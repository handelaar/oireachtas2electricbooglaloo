    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 44, Planning and Development Bill, 1999 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage (resumed). It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that any division demanded today on the Second Stage of No. 44 shall be postponed until immediately before the Order of Business on Tuesday, 15 February 2000.</P>

      <P>There is one proposal to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 44 agreed? Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Dáil will recess today until Tuesday next, does the Taoiseach wish to report to the House on the Northern Ireland situation? Has he had an opportunity to confirm the information he gave yesterday to Deputy John Bruton regarding the need for legislation if, God forbid, the institutions are suspended? As we will not sit again until next Tuesday it is important that we be brought up to date on the Taoiseach's views on the suspension of institutions or otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Some comment from the Taoiseach would be helpful at this stage. I am also conscious that the talks are at a very difficult stage. Does the Taoiseach wish to indicate to the House the aspirations of the Government? I know he will meet the First Minister, Mr. Trimble, later this morning but this is a matter which concerns not only this House but all the people on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify the concerns expressed in a number of quarters about the legality of suspending the Northern Ireland Assembly? Does what is being done have the full support of the Good Friday Agreement or are there questions which need to be answered in relation to those concerns?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Sec<Col N="326" /> retary of State, Mr. Mandelson, met in London. They agreed that we should continue the efforts at official level to come to some conclusion and understanding between the two Governments over the next day or so which we could put to the parties. That work continues. I will meet the First Minister, David Trimble, at 11.30 this morning and my officials in Belfast will meet representatives of some of the parties there at 12 o'clock and later. If those meetings are successful officials will return to London to meet officials there this afternoon. These efforts can only succeed if everybody works together. So far, I believe people genuinely wish to find a resolution to the problem. This will not be easy because people have stated positions and must answer to their parties. We must see what progress we can make to try to square the circle with regard to these issues. We will continue to try to avoid suspension while dealing with the remaining aspects of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement with absolute clarity.</P>
      <P>I have had discussions with the Attorney General on the issue of suspension and it is still our intention to wait and see. There is no need for us to do anything at this stage although we have concerns about suspension. Unilateral suspension would not be in line with the terms of the Good Friday Agreement at this stage. Deputy Bruton referred to this matter yesterday. If it all went wrong, this matter would have to be addressed but if the suspension were temporary that would not be necessary, in our view. Legislation to change something which we signed only a few months ago is not something we should contemplate yet, but I will keep the matter under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach and I have no doubt he will keep the party leaders informed as matters progress. I hope they will progress satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach share my concern at the ease with which hackers were able to break into the largest websites in the US and is he aware that recently Eircom, the CSO, RTE and other websites were hacked into also? Is he satisfied that we have legislation in place&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Planning and Development Bill, 1999  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The consultation process is important but its existence is not a reason to take away citizens' rights to comment on and, if necessary, object to local development. My colleague, Senator Coogan, raised this issue in the Seanad. A family might live in a particular area and be quite happy with its surroundings and a neighbour might apply for permission for a development to which the family does not have an objection. However, the family may subsequently find, to its horror, that the local authority has altered a feature of the development as a condition of the permission which renders the development unacceptable. It would be wrong for any legislation to prevent such a family having its say and I hope the Minister and succeeding Ministers for the Environment and Local Government will recognise people's right to be heard if such a circumstance arises. I do not support the notion of frivolous or vexatious appeals which are designed to frustrate development. I promote the notion of early consultation in order that objections can be minimised.</P>
      <P>While it is important to look at planning in local areas, it is also important that the regional dimension of development is planned for and that regional plans are nationally integrated, cohesive and reliable. It is important that that would happen given that serious questions have been raised in regard to the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area which the Minister launched in Malahide last March. Studies suggest that population forecasts and the manner in which they impact on household formation are seriously underestimated and that the current level of housing need is far higher than the forecast. The necessary infrastructure is not in place to meet the demands of the number of people currently living in the region, not to mention projected population figures, and this is a cause of disquiet in the region.</P>
      <P>The issue of staffing and the provision of support systems, not only in the planning departments of local authorities but also within An Bord Pleanála, must be addressed. The growth in development activity must be accommodated and facilitated by providing adequate staff to local authorities, not by removing people's entitlement to comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> The move to establish strategic development zones is welcome. However, I believe the concept is overly restrictive in terms of the area of application. All planning authorities should have the opportunity to prepare these development zones in conjunction with external interests.</P>
    <P>It is important that counties have a financial corporate development plan whereby planning applications could be fast-tracked where the principles of the scheme are complied with. In this way, councils could confidently consult with industrialists on how they could assist with the speedy establishment of enterprises. In turn, industrialists would have to wait a shorter time to put their economic enterprises in place which, in the fast moving world of commerce, is all important.</P>
    <P>There must be a focus on the development of clear understanding of detail, technology and strategic regional concepts and the manner in which they interact with local plans. It is important that inconsistencies between different counties' development plans are addressed and eliminated. There must be a clarity of purpose which demonstrates the integration from local action plan to county plan to regional plan and, ultimately, national plan level with a view to the sustainable long-term distribution of our population. The plans must also be practically attractive and capable of being implemented in the short-term.</P>
    <P>The section relating to the taking in charge of housing estates is most welcome. On section 164, will the Minister clarify that if a developer does not complete an estate and a local authority takes enforcement action which, for whatever reason, is unsuccessful, the majority of qualified electors who are owners or occupiers may not request the local authority to take the estate in charge? For too long, house developers sold a dream of gleaming houses set alongside sweeping and superbly surfaced roads and smooth, crack-free footpaths on which to wheel prams and buggies. In preceding years, young people played on rolling acres of manicured park lands. Action to address this terrible scandal of deceit is long overdue. The timeframe within this section is unacceptable and provision should be made for sections of estates to be taken in charge within three years of their completion. It is unacceptable that any home purchaser could be obliged to wait seven years before being in a position to initiate action to address these problems.</P>
    <P>The new system for the levying of development contributions is quite good. One of the ongoing resentments one encounters in developing areas arises where a self-sufficient village community which had adequate social facilities such as football fields, open spaces and community centres no longer has adequate facilities as a result of development. The established community is disadvantaged through the emergence of new estates, their social facilities are over-subscribed and their transport corridors are blocked with traffic. Development levies must be sufficient to <Col N="335" /> address the restructuring, repositioning and maintenance, if not improvement, of the quality of life of residents.</P>
    <P>I welcome the obligation to give information on the ownership of all property to the relevant local authorities. In the past it has been found that in an effort to frustrate the interests of local authorities, occupiers have failed to co-operate by not being frank. The importance of protected structures is obvious. Too often we read of fast buck merchants endeavouring to destroy listed structures, rights of way, etc. The new section providing further protection for landscape features is appealing and will ensure the survival of hedges, ditches and other such features.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with rights of way is welcome as it amends the 1963 Act under which local authorities were responsible for the maintenance of rights of way. Under section 49, it was unfortunate that when the planning authority sought the preservation of the public right of way, it was obliged to maintain it. There are many wonderful walks in the Howth peninsula, which I represent. We are awaiting the implementation of the amenity area order on which we have worked for many years. Fingal County Council has done a survey and submitted it to the Minister. However, there were objections and an inspector was appointed to hear them. This has caused some concern locally. I wrote to the Minister and he replied regarding the inspector's report. The residents' associations and other interested local bodies are anxious to have this report as soon as possible so they have an input before the Minister makes a decision. My constituency colleague, Deputy Broughan, put down a question on this matter. The Minister replied that the inspector's report will be submitted to him and he will make a decision on that basis. From the tone of the Minister's letter, the residents and I do not seem to be getting our way on this matter. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, can tell me if I would get the report if I made a request under the Freedom of Information Act. I ask the Minister to examine this matter.</P>
    <P>The need for a housing strategy is important. It is appropriate that the potential housing need of every local authority should be assessed and a plan put in place to address it, on the basis of the housing list. There will be an account of those in reasonably paid employment who would be excluded from the opportunity to avail of affordable housing. It is reasonable to say this is a short change scheme which will not assist enough people to buy houses. The Government is failing to address the crisis in providing adequate housing for those who cannot afford to purchase a home for themselves and their families. The scheme, which will, to an extent, address social exclusion if implemented correctly, with affordable housing dotted throughout housing estates, fails to make adequate provision to meet the real demand for local authority housing. It excludes, <Col N="336" /> perhaps permanently, those whose incomes are above £25,000 to £30,000 annum and who are not earning more than £40,000.</P>
    <P>The Government policy will be subvented by those purchasing on the open market. The indication is that the composite land purchase price remains the same, despite the notion of percentages of holdings being used to support social housing. If the land purchase price remains at the level it was prior to the publication of this Bill, or the inclusion of the Fingal County Council's development plan which is a similar concept, the only logic is that the land cost must be averaged over the remaining site units, thereby further inflating the selling price of domestic dwellings. This plan will not resolve the housing crisis. The poor will be in worse conditions and those earning above the average industrial wage will living permanently in rented accommodation. This Government, despite its considerable limitations, must be capable of greater things. This Minister, who likes to make the headlines, ought to consider how he can devise policy which will result in headlines regarding home contentment rather than feeding people illusions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the previous speaker on an extremely thoughtful and very fair-minded contribution. This is one of the most important Bills which is likely to come before the Dáil. Major review and consolidation of our planning law is long overdue. Most fair-minded Members on all sides believe the Minister is to be commended on achieving in this Bill what so many before him failed to do because of pressure of work. It was not because they did not wish to achieve consolidation, the achievement of which caused considerable problems. The Minister and his staff are to be commended on bringing a great deal of work to fruition in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill came before the House containing 245 sections and six Schedules, which is, by any measure, comprehensive. However, I know Members will agree that its significance should not be measured by the number of pages or its weight. An important aspect of the Bill is the manner in which the Minister has handled it. He accepted a substantial number of amendments following the debate in the Seanad. This is appropriate because the Minister was demonstrating to that House and this one that wisdom on this matter does not reside in any particular party but with the elected representatives of the people. A number of the Seanad amendments were put down by Opposition parties. I commend the Minister on handling this serious legislation in such an appropriate way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister implemented a novel arrangement by establishing the regional seminars and using them as a sounding board for the views of planning officials, councillors and the public on planning matters. This is a progressive innovation and I commend it to other Ministers, particularly those dealing with comprehensive legislation which touches the lives of everyone, the protec<Col N="337" /> tion of the environment and the type of country we live in and which we will hand on to our children. The manner in which the Minister has handled the Bill is as close as possible to the ideal way to deal with complex legislation.</P>
    <P>In County Wicklow, which I have pleasure to represent, we face unique challenges in the planning area. County Wicklow contains some of the most sensitive areas in the country. It is also to the fore in terms of population expansion, which has been phenomenal in the past 15 years. When I married and my wife and I moved to Greystones, its population was about 4,000 &ndash; it now exceeds 12,000 and is projected to grow rapidly in the years ahead. The population of Bray town which was contracting in the 1950s and 1960s has recently reached 30,000. It is literally chock-a-block. Planning is inevitably a major issue in my constituency. This growth gives rise to inevitable tensions between various factors &ndash; the necessity to provide new homes, workspace, protect the environment and in particular to ensure the built environment is what is desired. There is also tension because people who live in Wicklow, both natives and non-natives, find it difficult to maintain a standard of living and enjoy the environment they value because of the many pressures. This is visible in the debate on what density of development is acceptable. Experts suggest that towns such as Greystones and Delgany should have city centre levels of density, which are entirely inappropriate to those areas. There is, understandably, a constant anxiety about planning in the county which I represent. Wicklow is not unique in that.</P>
    <P>Another tension which has arisen in County Wicklow and throughout the country is the issue of affordable housing. This problem is perhaps best exemplified by the picturesque village of Enniskerry. If one had £750,000, one could, without any difficulty, buy a house in a housing estate in Enniskerry. However, a young couple from the area, living on standard wages and trying to provide a starter home cannot reasonably expect to obtain a house in that area. This is entirely inappropriate. Communities are having their sons and daughters driven out because of escalating house prices. These young people must then go elsewhere, which puts pressure on other communities. This is entirely divisive and one of the major crises facing us at this time. Again, taking the example of Enniskerry, even if the council zones a substantial amount of new land in that village, there is little chance of houses coming on the market in the foreseeable future at prices which are within the range of local people. This problem was exemplified in Enniskerry but it is a feature throughout County Wicklow, particularly across the north, east and parts of the north west of the county. A councillor living on the County Wexford border recently spoke to me about the problem of affordability in the villages of Tinahely and Coolboy. He pointed out that although there had been housing developments in these areas, they were outside the price range of local residents. <Col N="338" /> Ironically, people from either south Dublin or north Wicklow, who were driven by house prices from their own areas, were now competing for the short supply of housing in those remoter towns and villages. This is fundamentally divisive and a challenge to us all.</P>
    <P>There are also other problems. High on my list of problems in the area of development is that of rogue developers, developers who do not finish estates, who continuously breach the conditions attached to the planning permission and who are dishonest in the manner in which they sell a dream, as it were, which then turns into a nightmare. They employ bullying tactics and impose themselves on young people in a most unacceptable way. In addition, there are problems of capacity within local authorities to handle the building pressure. The population of this country has increased dramatically in recent years. The welcome influx of immigrants has put particular pressures on housing supply. The Bill is timely in that it addresses comprehensively many of these problems.</P>
    <P>I will deal in detail with Parts III, VI and V of the Bill, and will comment on some other sections as I go along. Part III is of fundamental importance. When I first moved to Greystones the problem of the failure of developers to complete estates was the most pressing local issue. It was the issue which compelled me into politics. In one estate in that town the situation was so disastrous that residents had to get up in the early hours of the morning to do family laundry because there was not sufficient water in the system which had been provided by the developer for domestic use. One new household proudly erected a sign 'High and Dry' in the estate to commemorate road development and the problems of the early 1970s. Throughout the 1980s, it seemed the problem was being resolved. It seemed that builders were beginning to honour their commitments to their clients, the people who bought the houses they had built. The community as a whole also seemed to be moving away from this problem.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this difficulty has made a very unwelcome reappearance in the 1990s. In Wicklow town, for example, the problem has been particularly acute, notably in a number of estates where a number of individual developers, albeit interconnected, have been in operation. There have been unfinished roads and poorly finished houses. In one estate an unfortunate house owner had to take a developer to court because a spring broke up in the front room in the house. Some of these problems have been subject to either court actions or threats of court actions by home buyers against rogue builders. This is not good enough; it is an abject failure on the part of the local planning authority. I realise the planning authority has difficulties in getting staff to police planning permissions but it is not good enough that people are left to their own devices in this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of Part III. In towns such as Wicklow town, for example, where there are major problems in four specific estates, these <Col N="339" /> sections of the Bill will be of considerable help. The overhaul of the 1963 Bill is long overdue. Section 39 deals with the limit of duration of permission. Planning should not just have a start-up date, but a specific finish date so that people who move into housing estates are not living for an interminable length of time on a building site. A classic example of this was recently brought to the notice of the whole nation in an individual estate in Sligo. Specifying a finishing date and providing for a maximum of five years is, therefore, very welcome. I hope the powers to vary and extend periods for planning permission will be used sparingly. A planning authority should only invoke the powers to extend the period of a planning permission in very specific circumstances. Every planning permission should have a start-up date and a completion date and only in the most serious circumstances should the developer be allowed to move from the completion date without having major penalties imposed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that under the new provisions where a new development plan is introduced, an outstanding planning permission which has not been acted upon can be revoked or amended to bring it into compliance with the new plan. This section may require further attention from the Minister and his Department in light of recent court cases, particularly in relation to the court case involving Eircom <i>versus</i> Leitrim County Council. I am involved in another case against Eircom involving a mast near Kilbride, County Wicklow, where the county council has taken the view unanimously and properly that there has been a change in circumstances since the new development plan was introduced. Unfortunately, our reasonable requests to Eircom to desist in the matter have been ignored. Eircom is now raising the challenge in the High Court and before An Bord Pleanála. I ask the Minister and his officials to keep their eyes on this case as a test case. It is an issue about which we will be hearing more.</P>
    <P>Of even more importance are the provisions in section 34(12)(<i>a</i>). This is aimed specifically at rogue developers and it makes the past record of such people the basis for a refusal. I welcome this section more than any other section in the Bill. It is an absolute perversion that individuals who have behaved in a way which is socially unacceptable and bordering on criminality with regard to the development of housing estates can register or pick off the shelf the name of a new company and do the same thing all over again. Planning authorities, particularly in my county, have long lists of rogue developers. The use of this section will bring them to a rapid halt. I ask the Minister, when the Bill is enacted, to ensure that planning authorities use to the fullest possible extent the provisions of section 34(12)(<i>a</i>). I am concerned that the Bill will run into difficulties with the courts, particularly when rogue developers hide behind a corporation. I hope, therefore, that the Bill has been proofed in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> Section 6 makes modifications to the board, which I welcome. It also provides for more openness in the board's decision-making. I welcome this, because the board has become not just removed from reality, but arrogant in the manner in which it performs its task. I understand and accept much of the criticism aimed at the board. An Bord Pleanála is now perceived as remote, its decisions are often inexplicable, notably when the board ignores either local democratically enacted development plans or, even more bizarre, when the board ignores the advice of its own inspectorate. I welcome the requirement under this section that the board will be expected to outline the considerations underlying its decisions and the reasons for those decisions. This is a major and positive development for which I commend the Minister and his Department. We live in a democratic republic and it is fundamentally wrong that any public body should be allowed to operate behind a shield of anonymity. The Minister is breaching that shield as far as the board is concerned and I welcome that move.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister to consider a matter, possibly when he is making regulations? It is appropriate to make provision for county council and local council members, particularly those aggrieved by planning decisions taken by the council executive and which in the view of the members are contrary to the council's intentions as incorporated in the development plan, to be permitted to make a formal written submission to the board as of right. At present, if a councillor, who is a member of the planning authority and who made the development plan, wishes to make a submission to An Bord Pleanála, he or she may do so in the same manner as any member of the public. He or she is effectively treated as a third party and must make a payment with regard to such observations. This is fundamentally wrong. Despite all their warts and faults, councillors are elected by the people and they are the makers of development policy. When the Minister is making regulations, I ask him to consider ensuring that councillors have a right to have their views considered when the policy is being executed and considered by the board.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of section 7 on the disclosure of property and business interests. There is a disturbing trend of planning and council officials becoming involved privately in after hours work in the planning area. This is a dangerous development. There was a major case in Dun Laoghaire a few years ago which brought about a sworn inquiry. It appears we are heading in the same direction. It is difficult for a planning official to serve two masters. It is fundamentally dangerous and I ask the Minister to turn his attention and the eyes of his Department to this matter.</P>
    <P>The major public debate on the Bill is focused on Part V and I welcome its provisions. If, as various vested interests are advocating at present, the matter of affordable housing supply was to be left to the vicissitudes of the marketplace, the <Col N="341" /> current crisis facing many young people will continue for many more years. I mentioned my concern for young people in places such as Enniskerry, Greystones and Delgany. They cannot afford to buy homes without landing themselves with ruinous mortgages. The free market has failed these people and it is spurious nonsense to suggest that the marketplace will resolve the issue.</P>
    <P>For example, in Greystones, Wicklow County Council has recently zoned an incredible amount of additional land for house building. However, I guarantee, that left to the free market, there is no possibility the builders who have bought the bulk of this land would choose to put affordable starter houses on the market in the towns I mentioned. The council has provided zoned land and the Government and the EU has put in place the road network, for which the taxpayer is paying in part. However, the provision of the infrastructure will be worthless because the market will determine that high price houses will be built there and young people can join the queue somewhere else.</P>
    <P>People in organisations who are praising the ideals of perfect competition in this area are, at the most charitable, guilty of self-delusion. Even Adam Smith, the founding father of perfect competition in his classic text, <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, cautioned against the propensity of businessmen to conspire against the interests of the consumer. The Minister should be conscious of what Adam Smith said many years ago, notwithstanding all the academic nonsense which has been written over the centuries about the virtues of perfect competition. It frequently has imperfect results in the short and medium term. Aside from the academic argument about the imperfections of perfect competition, the Minister is right to include Part V in the Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of local authorities, including Wicklow County Council, has made provision for a social housing content in housing development within their development plans. However, I draw the Minister's attention to a fact which disturbs me greatly. An Bord Pleanála is not looking favourably at present on such provisions and has on a number of occasions struck them down, in some instances suggesting that they are <i>ultra vires</i>. There was an alarming reference to this matter in the last report of the chairman of An Bord Pleanála. I am sure the Minister and Minister of State are aware of this and the concerns of local authorities about this matter.</P>
    <P>I point out to the Minister that there is a case in County Wicklow under consideration by An Bord Pleanála at present. I believe this will be a test case. The council has indicated a willingness to pay the market rate for sites which have been designated for social or affordable housing and this gives the developer the option to either sell the land to the council or to build appropriate houses. Yet the issue is on appeal to An Bord Pleanála. I ask the Minister to keep this case under review.</P>
    <P>I see pressure daily in County Wicklow on local <Col N="342" /> authority housing planning staff who are at the end of their tether. The councils in Wicklow, Meath and Kildare, which are on the periphery of Dublin, are under unique pressure at present and I ask the Minister to make as many resources as possible available to improve the conditions in planning departments not only because of a humane concern for the staff whom I respect, but also from the point of view of making progress on planning and development.</P>
    <P>I have mixed views about development levies. Will the Minister ensure by way of regulation that all development levies are ringfenced in a manner which will prevent them going into the general expenditure for the local authority and ensure that the local communities benefit rather than inefficiency?</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister and Minister of State on their work on it. Last year I published a national landscape policy and I am glad that many of its proposals have been included in the Bill. I will outline my proposals in the landscape policy before I refer to the Bill.</P>
      <P>Ireland possesses a unique inheritance of scenic, ecological, geological and historic resources. All these traits and more go to make up our distinctive landscape. This has been moulded through natural processes over millions of years and through human activity over the past 10,000 years since people first came to Ireland. The 20th century has witnessed many changes to our landscape. Some have been positive but, unfortunately, many have been negative. As we are now in the 21st century, we cannot afford to repeat these mistakes. We must be more proactive regarding the proper management and protection of our landscape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sustained economic growth, which it is accepted will continue into the foreseeable future, will inevitably lead to more housing development in urban and rural settings. The provision of industrial, commercial and office accommodation, the building of large scale tourism products, including hotels, recreation facilities and holiday homes, and the provision of infrastructural facilities such as major roadways, etc, will be facts of life in the context of the sustained development Ireland is experiencing. According to the reports of the NCB and others, it is expected that the population of the country will reach 4.5 million by 2006 and that there will be approximately 40,000 new house starts every year. This figure could be exceeded. The landscape we know will change radically over the next five years and this is why planning matters are so important. We as legislators can have an impact on planning, control development and influence the landscape. We can ensure that it is protected for future generations. Planning is one area where we can have an impact as legislators and there is no reason we should not. The landscape as we know it will inevitably change as a result of these intrusions &ndash; we cannot expect to freeze our land<Col N="343" /> scape. The challenge is in how we manage this growth, not how we frustrate it. That is very important, as growth is inevitable. The challenge is ensuring that growth is sustainable and in how we can enhance the landscape for future generations. We have a critical role to play as legislators.</P>
    <P>The objective should be to manage future change in a way that recognises the great diversity and quality of the landscape we have inherited and that sustains and even enriches that diversity and quality rather than allowing it to diminish. Apart from the inevitable changes that must take place and which must be managed, there are issues, mostly negative, affecting our landscape and which are addressed to some extent by this Bill, though not totally. These include the inadequate provision of parks and sensitively designed green spaces within our urban landscape and the erosion and destruction of our upland regions due to overgrazing and poor pasture management. As a hill walker I see this at first hand every weekend I go walking. The situation has improved and the provisions I put in place with the REPS plan to deal with this have helped considerably. There certainly has been destocking of sheep in our upland areas, but those areas have been damaged.</P>
    <P>There is also continued insidious erosion and, in some cases, outright destruction of our architectural and archaeological heritage. Despite legislation and various statements made about the importance of our architectural and archaeological heritage, the destruction is still ongoing. Buildings are being demolished in Ireland this very day that should not be demolished and the planning system is not protecting them. Hopefully this Bill will do so, but time will tell. I am sure the Minister of State and Deputy Batt O'Keeffe could name a number of buildings of architectural significance which have been destroyed in the past ten years. We could have retained the facades of buildings and built behind them. There are solutions other than outright destruction. I read the very good brief we got from Mr. Michael Starrett of the Heritage Council, which I am sure the Minister received, which ran to 20 pages. I do not have time to outline all its contents, but he expressed major concern about the protection of architectural and archaeological sties. There is a very important archaeological site in Lisardboula in Kerry where a mast would have been built but for the vigilance of a local group, though it is a listed site. I hope this Bill will address numerous issues which arise from cases such as this, as there are various questions about the protection of our sites which remain unanswered.</P>
    <P>The issue of masts, pylons and intrusive commercial signage must also be addressed. Cork Deputies will be aware of the problem in that county with pylons, but pylons are spreading across the whole country. If we are to use wind power, more pylons will be needed. We need to look at alternatives, such as going underground, <Col N="344" /> as pylons can be a blight on our landscapes. The Minister should respond to this when replying.</P>
    <P>The unwarranted destruction of mature, broad leaf trees is another problem. Despite Ireland's acknowledged low levels of tree cover and the threat to our remaining ancient woodlands, we still see the destruction of broad leaf trees. We should have a very clear policy on this matter, as it is one of the reasons we have problems with roadways. Planners should be conscious of the importance of our remaining broad leaf forests and they should do everything possible to protect them and not destroy them. We must have road development, but planners should show sensitivity where there are alternatives.</P>
    <P>Another problem is the changed management of our hedgerows in the wake of more intensive agricultural practices, which is probably the legacy of the farm development programme when we joined the Euorpean Community in 1973. Hedgerows right across the country, many of which were cared for by numerous generations, have been destroyed, whether they were along walls in the west or elsewhere. They have been taken out of fields and destroyed unnecessarily and nothing in this Bill relates to hedgerows. At present a farmer not involved with REPS can take down any hedgerow he wants, as I understand it. If he is in REPS he must protect them, but not all farmers are in that scheme. The Minister should clarify whether the Bill refers to hedgerows when he replies.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to homogenous housing estates, where every house and street looks the same. There is a general loss of village and town distinctiveness through the universal standardisation of shop fronts, street furniture, shopping centres, filling stations and so on. There is a proliferation of similar signage and the traditional uniqueness of villages and distinctiveness of shop fronts seems to be vanishing. The Minister mentioned that and I agree with him when he said he hoped to see the end of this type of building policy. He said he hoped the days of building vast tracts of one-class housing are gone, as we can all see the problems, inefficiencies and fractured communities that has created in the past. He is echoing more or less what I have said, that we must be far more creative in designing houses, villages and towns.</P>
    <P>We should try to impress on local communities &ndash; I am glad there is provision here for local planning &ndash; that they should retain what they have. Ireland is distinctive because of its differences. Ours is a small country, so communities have to be different if we are to appeal to tourists. We should encourage local communities to hold onto their vernacular architecture. They should upgrade, renovate and restore it, but they should not destroy it, as has been the trend, either for financial gain or simple expediency. Certainly it is affecting our architectural heritage.</P>
    <P>A matter that frequently arises at county council meetings and which will have to be addressed is the proliferation of new houses in the country<Col N="345" /> side where the designs are not in keeping with local vernacular architecture. This is happening especially in holiday areas, for example, in Dingle and south Kerry where there is the old traditional cottage and farmhouse. Before buying a site a person will come in with the plan of their ideal house which they saw in <i>Hello </i>magazine<i>.</i> They decide to build this house in Dingle and then get the site. They will not get the site first and ask what house would suit the site. People should be influenced to look at the site first. One cannot prevent people from building in any part of the country but they should look at the site, the landscape, the local architecture and design and try to build a house appropriate to that location. There are examples of this in Dingle but I do not wish to refer to anybody in particular. The richer people are, the more elaborate design they can put in place. That has happened and it is wrong. I hope the Bill will address that issue, otherwise the landscape will be destroyed.</P>
    <P>The general loss of bio-diversity in flora and fauna and the specific loss of wildlife habitats throughout the landscape is noticeable. That issue is being addressed I hope it will be effective. The list of issues I have mentioned is by no means exhaustive but it covers the main issues that need to be addressed in any planning Bill.</P>
    <P>In facing up to the challenge before us I am convinced the only way to tackle such a powerful range of forces for change and their related impacts is in the creation and implementation of an integrated national landscape management strategy. A spatial plan has been mentioned for the country in two years' time but we have to go beyond that and be more visionary. Apart from the planning legislation we must have a broader image leading to a national landscape management strategy.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the setting, whether urban, suburban or rural, the important contribution to Ireland's cultural heritage made by landscape quality must be recognised and whatever steps are necessary to safeguard the integrity of the landscape must be taken. The high standards of landscape management must be promoted in relation to those activities over which central and local government have direct control or over activities which are subject to the direction and influence of central and local government. We have the opportunity, the power and the instruments at our disposal to ensure proper planning. It is one area where we can all be effective. Economies change and our economy can experience ups and downs but planning is consistent and is something we can always influence.</P>
    <P>I propose the creation of an integrated landscape management strategy that could be used as the basis for decision making at all levels of public administration. This strategy should combine the principles of creativity and aestheticism with that of sustainable development. Speaking about the aesthetics of any landscape policy, that should be a core part of it. Given that people, particularly young people, are now more discerning the aes<Col N="346" /> thetic aspect of the landscape is becoming more important for locals and tourists alike.</P>
    <P>I welcome a number of aspects of the Bill from the point of view of central government, local government and regional level. I propose an input into the landscape policy at regional level. Landscape policy and planning in general is an appropriate area to be addressed at regional level. I am pleased that matter has been addressed in the Bill. Landscape co-ordinators could be placed within the regional authority structure and steer the activities of a number of local authorities and also provide executive support for their local authority counterparts.</P>
    <P>The whole issue of education and information is important. I understand there is no under-graduate course here where people can be specifically qualified and obtain a degree in planning. They must go to Queen's University. There is a post-graduate course, a masters degree course in UCD, that is very good. We need planners with a broader view rather than engineers who may have a narrower view, so that matter should be addressed.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the whole issue of public rights of way could be addressed as well. It is a complex matter on which I would welcome any progress within the framework proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Celtic tiger strides throughout the island this Bill left many people roaring in its wake because of the perceived impact it would have on them. The landowner was worried that he would not get the price he had heretofore succeeded in getting because of the one-fifth affordable housing concept. In Dublin developers who had hoarded 7,000 acres of land are worried because of the one-fifth affordable housing concept, that they would not get the profit margins they had expected. Local authorities suddenly came alive to the fact that this Bill would change their way of life and their approach to planning and development. This Bill seeks to give a timely boost to development.</P>
      <P>The measures on affordable housing are in line with the economic boom and take into account those who cannot afford to pay the house prices being sought. The Bill seeks to bring together all the necessary strategies to ensure the implementation of the development plan 2000 &ndash; 2006 is achieved. The integrated package of proposals strikes a balance. The Bill which is crucial and critical for its time and purpose has seen many changes since publication. Credit is due to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, who have been open to suggestions. They have organised seminars and have listened to various groups and where suggestions worthy of consideration have been put to them, by and large they have been adopted. I am also pleased to note that many of the amendments tabled in the Seanad have been accepted. They improve the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The developmental role of local authorities has never been properly specified. For example, the <Col N="347" /> integration between the IDA and local authorities has never been clarified. IDA-owned lands get priority in terms of international mobile investment. In the 1960s and 1970s local authorities had large landbanks designated for industrial development which were not utilised. If local authorities are to have a developmental role there must be far greater integration between them and the IDA. Given my experience over the years, I am strongly of the view that the IDA should not be involved in the purchase of land. That should be the remit of the local authority.</P>
    <P>Cork County Council received 3,600 applications for planning permission in 1993. By 1999 that figure had risen to 7,300, an increase of slightly more than 100%. In the light of such developments the issue of resources is critical. In the same year Cork Corporation received 1,000 applications. Given this, planners in the county are working at weekends to cater for the workload placed on them.</P>
    <P>The appointment and training of planners is a crucial issue. Will the Minister ascertain if, in view of the Celtic tiger, third level institutions produce enough planners? I understand 40 planners per annum come through our universities and institutes. This must be remedied because there is a massive turnover in staff in local authorities where employees move from one authority to another. Furthermore, given that people in the private sector see the benefits of employing planners as part of their strategy teams, mobility is all the greater. It means that many new planners taking up work in a local authority must be reoriented to the area in which they have located only to move on within a short period of time. The kind of continuity we require is not there.</P>
    <P>In the past the request for further information has been abused. I am pleased the Bill addresses this matter. The introduction of a four week period will allow local authorities to focus more on the issues before them. Perhaps the Bill should take account of complex issues which can arise in planning applications. For example, an applicant and a local authority may not be <i>ad idem</i> and the applicant may seek an extra period of, say, four weeks in which to have the application considered. Apart from that, requests for further information should not be tolerated because they are used to delay planning applications.</P>
    <P>Section 26 of the 1963 Act deals with planning by default, an issue that has been often raised in the House. Here the local authority must give the applicant a decision within two months of receiving an application. Amendments proposed in the Seanad and accepted by the Minister remove the requirement that applications be notified within two months and it is now proposed that local authorities must make a decision within two months and that the delay in the post procedure will not apply.</P>
    <P>We must, however, be careful in addressing the issue of planning by default. If planning authorities default in giving their decisions, who suf<Col N="348" /> fers? Is there a provision to reprimand the local authority that does not meet its commitment? If, for example, an application is submitted to build a complex and possibly undesirable housing estate the community will suffer if it is accepted by default because it will have to deal with a planning development that has no conditions attached to it. We should not allow such planning by default to be imposed on unsuspecting communities without conditions being attached.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that planning by default should not be allowed and that instead of the applicant getting planning permission the application should be automatically submitted to An Bord Pleanála. That would be a better way to deal with the issue. However, it would present a difficulty in that it would be unfair on the applicant who would be expecting a decision within two months. He would then have to wait six months before permission would be granted. Perhaps the Minister will consider the imposition of other mechanisms to ensure communities are protected and are not penalised in this way.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to tighten the grip on local authorities with the two month provision requiring them to make a decision on an application. Yet, there is no similar imposition on An Bord Pleanála, where the Bill allows the board the customary four months to decide on an application. Perhaps this time period should be reduced to three months.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with the preparation of development plans and guidelines. Once the planning authority publishes notice of its intention to prepare a draft an 11 month period is allowed for completion. While I am happy with this provision, local authorities are not. In my experience development plans tend to become protracted. In one instance in my county a five year development plan became an eight year plan. It is fair and proper that the Minister should specify a time period and that it should be rigidly adhered to.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with affordable housing. There has been much brouhaha in this regard, but we are reaching a general acceptance of what the Minister is proposing, namely, setting aside one fifth of development land for affordable housing. I ask the Minister to note that the condition can only be attached after a planning application has been submitted. This raises the question as to which portion of a site will constitute the 20% of social housing. Will the local authorities come under pressure to pay design fees and expenses where the layout has to be amended following submission of an application? It might be far better for agreement to be sought in the course of considering a planning application. If this is not done, a larger number of decisions will be appealed to An Bord Pleanála. We could be creating a monster by unnecessarily increasing the number of appeals to An Bord Pleanála, the very thing we want to avoid in the Bill, and it might be worth examining these possible difficulties.</P>
    <P>Yesterday on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; a person <Col N="349" /> from the planning institute indicated they were very concerned about the cost of appeals. However, I do not think the cost of appeals &ndash; £40 or £50 in terms of a local authority and more in terms of An Bord Pleanála &ndash; are prohibitive. However, the right of appeal is imperative and the right to make an observation on planning permission is desirable. We should be conscious of and facilitate people who cannot afford to lodge an objection to an application. We might look at the waiver system being applied where an old age pensioner, for example, wants to lodge an objection to a largescale planning application beside his or her house. If a waiver is applied to such a person's service charges, perhaps the local authority could extend it in terms of making observations on planning applications.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with local authorities taking charge of estates. In my constituency there are housing estates which were built 20 years ago and which have yet to be taken in charge. It is an absolute disgrace that this has been allowed to happen, and as a member of a local authority I must take responsibility in this regard. It stemmed from rogue builders at a time when bonds were not in place. In south Cork we have estimated that the cost of taking in charge some of those estates would be £1.5 million. I am sure this also applies to other local authorities. In the same way that the Department of Health of Children dealt with outstanding local authority deficits, we should take cognisance of the fact that many of these estates must be taken in charge. I am delighted that rogue builders will be dealt with in the Bill. If a builder has a bad track record a local authority can go to the High Court to ensure they do not get planning permission. However, why should a local authority have to go to the High Court if it is satisfied the builder in the past left estates unfinished? The local authority should be entitled to refuse a planning application by such a builder. The builder could then take a case to the High Court if he or she so wished.</P>
    <P>We know that a coach and four was driven through the retention scheme. I am delighted the Minister has taken this on board in the Bill, that the levies for defaulting in terms of non-application for planning permission is being dealt with, that the fines being imposed are extremely serious and that a person who breaks the law will pay.</P>
    <P>In many instances development plans include constraints relative to where people can live. In Cork if one is in an urban area one cannot get planning permission for a rural area, even though many of us may have come from a rural area. Is this a denial of a person's constitutional rights? The same is happening in Clare, and I would like the issue to be examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin" hpid="Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to be able to contribute to the debate. A blueprint on planning and development is long overdue. We live in a rapidly changing society where infra<Col N="350" /> structure simply cannot keep pace with the demand for housing, services and transport. A new Bill should be about realising the needs of people and should offer new ways of structuring our transport services, facilities and building programmes around these needs in a way which respects the environment and offers people the maximum convenience in accessing services and employment. Our booming economy has accelerated the haphazard development which is taking place in towns and villages throughout the country. The general quality of life for the majority of people, particularly those living in urban centres, has declined significantly over recent years. We spend longer going to and from work. Traffic problems have become so chronic that we must endure traffic jams on Saturdays and even Sundays when going to shopping centres, football matches, swimming pools etc.</P>
      <P>My constituency, south Kerry, presents some of the best examples of urban pressures and rural depopulation and neglect. Planning and development strategies in the past have not adequately addressed the need to make rural Ireland more accessible by means of better transport and new incentives which would take some of the pressure from urban centres which do not have the infrastructure, facilities or services to support the rapid growth in populations.</P>
      <P>The Bill fails to present the vision required to develop towns, cities and rural areas in a way which would bring about a dramatic improvement in the quality of life. In many respects it updates the planning laws to give backing to new practices which have been introduced as a result of local area plans, etc. This tidying up of existing practices and legislation is welcome in so far as it will assist in making the planning process more efficient and, to a lesser extent, effective.</P>
      <P>The biggest barrier to efficiency and effectiveness is lack of staff. What has been the percentage increase in planning staff allocated to local authorities and the percentage increase in planning applications in the past few years? Those figures will highlight that the staff of planning offices are under severe pressure. Morale and pressure of work have become serious issues. The huge volume of work with which planning officers are expected to deal is forcing qualified and experience planners to move to the highly lucrative private sector. This has been referred to by many speakers and the more often it is said, the better.</P>
      <P>I am a member of Kerry County Council and I am aware of the pressure on its staff. There has been a huge increase in planning applications in south Kerry, in particular, in recent years and I pay tribute to the staff for the manner in which they deal with such applications, the public and public representatives. The staff are barely able to keep their heads above water and that is why they write to applicants seeking more information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More staff must be appointed to planning offices. We cannot expect planning officers to continue to tolerate the working conditions they <Col N="351" /> have experienced in the past few years. Towns such as Killarney, Kenmare, Dingle, Killorglin and Cahirciveen should have their own planning officers as that would take the pressure off the central office in Tralee. Pre-planning meetings between applicants and planning officers should be structured and files should be validated at them. That would eliminate the further information syndrome which predominates throughout the country. First time applicants, in particular, should be given more time to complete their applications. Young people who are in the process of getting married and building their first houses often must wait six months after they have applied for planning permission before they can start building.</P>
    <P>A vision for planning and development should be underlined by both a rural and an urban plan, which should be prepared by each local authority. A simple booklet should be produced in which each local authority outlines the form of building suitable in urban and rural areas. Those who want to build can then refer to the booklet to find out what is permitted. Young people who wish to live in rural Ireland can purchase land with a view to building a house. However, when they seek planing permission they often discover the land is not appropriate for the type of houses they wish to construct. Well defined urban and rural plans will prevent many people from falling into the same trap.</P>
    <P>I refer to the issue of providing grant assistance to people who move to rural areas and invest in the refurbishment of derelict houses to an acceptable standard. The Labour Party, through its agriculture, food and rural development spokesperson, Deputy Penrose, proposed a once off grant of £15,000 to those who wish to purchase unoccupied homes in rural Ireland. There are many such homes and if an incentive were provided young people would be prepared to move from towns and cities to rural areas. That would benefit urban and rural areas. Such a grant would go towards alleviating the housing crisis throughout Ireland. Young people can no longer buy a site or a house in my constituency. Some townlands, which only ten or 15 years ago sustained many families, are devoid of population. Rural depopulation needs to be addressed before many local communities cease to exist, which would be a disaster for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Many voluntary organisations which organise local festivals are concerned about the provisions in the Bill. I received a letter from the organisers of Puck Fair, the oldest and most famous festival in Ireland, which stated:</P>
    <P>The proposed Planning &amp; Development Bill is a cause of concern for many voluntary organised festivals. Whilst we recognise the thinking behind the Bill and can understand the need to regularise the staging and organising of special events we feel that events such as our Puck Fair will be severely affected by the implications of the new bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> We are a voluntary group who organise the running of Puck Fair in co-operation with the local council and statutory bodies, on a very tight budget. The proposed extra expenditure on items such as licence, litter, sanitation, transport, etc., will have a serious detrimental effect on our budget and eventually could sound the death knell on our festival and many other similar community orientated events throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to examine this issue again. There is a tourism imbalance in Ireland and many voluntary organisations in small towns would have no way of attracting tourists but for their festivals. It would be a shame if festivals, such as Puck Fair, could not be held because the organisers could not afford to run them.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to re-consider the shared ownership scheme. When it was introduced it was worthwhile, but it is not feasible now for many couples who cannot afford houses because the income limit is too low. The limit must be raised so that more people would be enticed to buy their own homes.</P>
    <P>Each local authority needs to have a structured urban plan which provides details of areas in which house building is permitted and the type and scope of house. The IDA has sites in many towns and when an industry is attracted to such towns it is automatically located on an IDA site. Local authorities, however, must plan for industry. Factories and so on should be located on the outskirts of major urban centres. Many IT companies have been attracted to Ireland and have sought suitable locations to start up their enterprises.</P>
    <P>We have to put our minds to this and each local authority will have to prepare plans so that the towns outside the major urban areas will become more attractive.</P>
    <P>With the current building boom, local authorities will have to devise overall plans for quarrying and other major developments which require environmental impact studies etc. If a person applies for planning permission to quarry a site and sand is badly needed, it can cost up to £25,000 before even one load of sand is obtained. We need clear guidelines on where quarries can be located so as to ensure that we have a consistent supply of quarry products. We should not have to import these products because we have many of them here but we have to make plans in that regard.</P>
    <P>I want to return to the issue of planning. Many people have complained to me about the number of conditions attached to a planning application, but when an application is refused, only one reason is given. If the person wants to make another application for planning permission, that one reason is not sufficient for them to deal with the problems. People who are refused planning permission should be given the full reason for that decision.</P>
    <P>The fee for making an objection is causing concern, particularly among the elderly and people <Col N="353" /> on disability and invalidity pensions. These are vulnerable people who may not have the money to object if something is happening around them that they do not like. We have to protect the vulnerable people in our society and I ask the Minister to consider if such people could be exempt from these charges because the elderly and the ill are not quick to object to a planning application. They could find themselves in a situation where their homes could be destroyed and they would not have the wherewithal to object.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Apart from the fact that it is extremely necessary, it fulfils the Government's commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to deal with planning. The legislation aims to co-ordinate the structure of the planning process as well as consolidate different Acts which have dealt with it in the past. The Bill is comprehensive and its specific elements are important to overall good planning and development. It incorporates a structured approach to planning nationally, locally and on a regional and county basis.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the Bill is also timely. Now that we have new local authorities following the recent local elections, there is an opportunity to fundamentally underpin the importance of development plans. The Bill provides members of local authorities with the opportunity to realise the importance of their functions for future planning. Members of local authorities sometimes do not realise the significant role they play in working up the development plan, and it is welcome that the concept of subsidiarity, which is now the buzzword, is being reinforced in the Bill. The Bill co-ordinates national and regional planning in addition to setting out the agenda for proper planning and development generally.</P>
      <P>In the planning process, the Bill establishes the importance of sustainable development as part of the agenda for modern planning. In its structure and implementation, the legislation should do away with the concept of peripherality from a national and regional point of view, but that will occur only if we utilise the Bill and the opportunities provided in it to local authorities. The Bill will also enable us to build a holistic approach towards the environment whereby we can plan our future to work towards the agenda that deals with peripherality and sustains people's needs in an ordered way.</P>
      <P>To put the Bill in context, I want to refer to a number of points, but before doing that I want to quote from a report given to Dublin City Council in the past few days because it gives a good idea of where we are at in terms of need and the issues which have to be addressed. The report states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Strategic Planning Guidelines [they were published in April] forecast that the Greater Dublin Area would increase from 1.4M in 1996 to 1.65M by the year 2011. The Guidelines estimated that the number of households in the Greater Dublin Area would increase from 450,000 in 1996 to 660,000 in 2011. The Guide<Col N="354" /> lines state <i>&ldquo;to meet this need the number of houses in the Greater Dublin Area would need to increase by almost 50% representing a major challenge to the local authorities and other development agencies as well as to the construction industry&ldquo;</i>. The forecasts in the Strategic Planning Guidelines are being reviewed at present in the context of updated census information and it is likely that these forecasts will be revised upwards.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, and following the discussions we had the other night, it is more likely that the census will show a much higher figure than we had anticipated. The report goes on to state:</P>
    <P>At the time the Strategic Planning Guidelines were published, a joint report entitled &ldquo;Housing in Dublin &ndash; A Strategic Review for the Dublin Local Authorities&rdquo; was prepared for Dublin City Council. This Strategic Housing Report, which deals with the Dublin region (as distinct from the Greater Dublin Area) estimates that housing outputs for the region would have to increase to approximately 13,000 per annum to meet existing and future demand. A full time team, representative of the four Dublin local authorities, was set up to progress the infrastructural and other issues needed to achieve this objective. If this can be done the supply situation should improve to the extent that the market can be stabilised. To do so will require sustained co-ordinated action by all four local authorities in the region.</P>
    <P>That is the task we must achieve.</P>
    <P>As a result of these reports, a number of new initiatives have been taken by local authorities and the Government to tackle the problem, including additional funds to provide roads. I welcome the announcement by the Minister and the National Roads Authority on the important King Street, Cork Street and the Coombe roads etc. which, in one case, have been on the drawing board for the past 28 years. Additional funds will be provided also for water and drainage to release lands for development; the affordable housing scheme; the 20% social-affordable requirement provided in Part V of the Bill &ndash; I will return to that later; and the planning density guidelines increasing density for local development.</P>
    <P>New development plans with substantial additional zoned lands and increased densities have been adopted by each of the four local authorities, and in this case we managed to get our development plans completed in record time. As Deputy O'Keeffe said earlier, in one case here in Dublin the city development plan was not reviewed for about 11 years. Nevertheless, the corporation still has approximately 6,500 applicants on its housing list, the cost of ordinary houses is out of reach for many young single people and couples who are prospective first-time purchasers and costs continue to rise.</P>
    <P>The strategic planning guidelines report estimates that nearly 13,000 units of housing per year <Col N="355" /> will be needed in the area of the four Dublin local authorities over the next five to six years to balance supply and demand, with the city's contribution being 4,000 to 5,000. Output in the city over recent years has been in the region of 3,800 so an increase in output of 10% to 15% in the city is required.</P>
    <P>There are only three large reservoirs of undeveloped land left in the city. They are at Pelletstown, on the north fringe of the city, which includes Ayrfield-Donaghmede, and the docklands area. Other than these, all that is left are miscellaneous, small, brownfield sites which will become available for redevelopment over time and institutional lands, some of which may not become available.</P>
    <P>There is a degree of disappointment that some of these institutional lands, if they become available, will not be made available to the city or the State as readily as we had hoped. It is, therefore, imperative that the lands be developed with an optimum balance between the following factors, which are key to any discussion on planning: sustainable high density, quality design and quality materials and workmanship. If these are right, many other things will be right. It is also essential that these be fully integrated developments with shopping, social, recreational and community facilities provided concurrently with housing. The new Bill provides for development levies for the provision of community facilities. The manager's report concludes by stating:</P>
    <P>As identified in both the strategic planning guidelines and the housing in Dublin strategy report, top quality public transport is a vital key component of the solution to the housing issue. Low density housing and quality public transport are mutually incompatible and low density with individual private car commuting is simply not achievable in the Dublin situation. The city is at capacity for traffic.</P>
    <P>The report gives a sense of the complexity of the issues that need to be addressed in the Bill. By and large, they are being addressed. We might quibble with certain aspects but the Minister is willing to accept new ideas and amendments. The reforms envisaged in the legislation are geared towards improving planning services within a specified time frame by tightening the existing time limits governing planning applications. These reforms will place an onus on planning authorities to deal with planning applications within an agreed procedure and time frame. In addition, it creates a structure which will provide customers with a better service by opening up the planning process.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation has a record of transparency in the planning process which should be lauded and copied. It has a dedicated team of planners headed by the assistant manager and the chief planner, who have always taken a proactive approach to planning in the city. As a result, the decisions which are handed down are generally <Col N="356" /> acceptable to the broader community. I am aware there is a preliminary hearing before An Bord Pleanála today so I will not prejudice what might happen by commenting on it. However, it should be pointed out that decisions by Dublin Corporation have, by and large, been enlightened.</P>
    <P>The Bill recommends pre-planning discussions in relation to some applications. Those discussions have proved beneficial in the past and I am glad they are recommended in the Bill. It is an important development in customer service in the context of development plans. In this way, planning applications can be developed to the benefit of the applicant and the environment. This is a worthy aim although it will place substantial pressure on the resources of planning authorities. The Minister should take this into account.</P>
    <P>Pre-planning meetings will be time consuming and if they are to be worthwhile, they will have to be meaningful. They take up planners' time. Members of Dublin Corporation will be aware that plenty of interesting development is brought before the corporation but it takes time to deal with it. However, the Minister and the Ministers of State are sympathetically disposed to providing additional resources to the local authorities to ensure these pre-planning meetings are meaningful.</P>
    <P>When he introduced the Bill in the Seanad before Christmas, the Minister said he had carried out an assessment of the planning requirements of local authorities. He established that a substantial increase in demand for services had been created by recent economic growth. He is dealing with that issue by providing increased funding for the overall development of local services. The requirement for more planners needs to be addressed. I will return to the issue of fees later, if time permits.</P>
    <P>The Bill establishes strategic development zones, thus providing a new concept of proper spatial planning for the future. Such zones will be set up where there is a need for them and where they would prove suitable from an environmental viewpoint. Strategic development areas will be established in line with population growth and educational facilities, for example, for students in close proximity to institutes of technology or where well qualified young people can take up positions offered in areas of industrial growth, such as the high technology sector.</P>
    <P>In Pelletstown in my constituency the serviced land initiative has recently had an effect. We are in the process of approving an area plan which is innovative and wide ranging. There has been considerable consultation with the local community and public representatives, and amendments to the plan are being accepted. A relatively small area of land, 60 acres out of 160 acres, is being developed. Taking on board the new strategic planning guidelines, between 3,000 and 4,000 housing units, some of them in relatively high rise developments but many in the traditional housing model, will be developed along the banks of the Royal Canal.</P>
    <P>This development is being built around other <Col N="357" /> infrastructural development. The rail link to the airport, for example, will mean we can build two railway stations and it will be possible for future residents to be car owners without having to take their cars into town. They will be able to take the train to the airport or to town and to Maynooth. The development will be a model of best practice if we can get it together. Provision is being made for a primary school on the site. I grew up in an era when the primary school and shopping facilities were the last things to be provided in a development.</P>
    <P>There are also plans for office and hotel development as well as recreational developments, all of which are important. The plan takes account of the sensitive environment beside the Tolka where the Tolka Valley linear park is being developed by the two local authorities, Fingal County Council and Dublin Corporation. It also takes account of the importance of the canal and its potential for recreational development.</P>
    <P>The legislation establishes parameters for enforcing decisions of the planning office, an element which had been lacking in the past. This has been costly to local authorities. Often there has been reluctance on the part of administrators in local authorities and professionals as to who should do what. The Bill is to be welcomed if for no other reason than it puts a structure on how enforcement should be carried out. This country has an appalling record of enforcing planning authorities' decisions. It gives me no pleasure to point out that some people in the building industry believe they have a right to drive a coach and four through the conditions of a plan and to walk away from unfinished estates.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a local authority since 1985 and not one year has passed since then without the authority having to tackle some instance in Dublin &ndash; five of them in my ward &ndash; of unfinished estates. One case was settled on the steps of the High Court but it set the corporation back tens of thousands of pounds in legal costs in its attempt to bring the rogue builder to heel. The same builder was able to re-emerge in two further incarnations and do the same thing in two other estates. That type of activity must stop. Builders must realise that we will not stand for it any more.</P>
    <P>I drove past one such site this morning. The corporation, at the expense of the commercial rate payer,is putting down footpaths that should have been provided by a builder.</P>
    <P>On another estate, the builder seems to have decided to take winter holidays. His containers are still on site, the roads are not finished and I am told he can be expected to return in March. That is not good enough and is an abuse of the process. They should not be allowed get away with it.</P>
    <P>The legislation co-ordinates previous planning Acts in a positive manner and amalgamates the best elements in a concise Bill. This has not been attempted in the past and is welcome in our developing economy. The Bill deals with the problems of our booming economy such as <Col N="358" /> affordable housing. Part V of the Bill has been the subject of a great deal of discussion. Developers and builders must realise that we are serious about enforcing it and that we will not downgrade it. If one visits Helsinki or anywhere in northern Europe, one finds affordable and social housing alongside conventional housing.</P>
    <P>One worrying trend has emerged. I received a letter from the Community Information Centre in Finglas which stated:</P>
    <P>We are writing to inform you of the major crisis, which is current in today's housing market.</P>
    <P>At present, the Dublin Corporation will give &ldquo;Shared Ownership loans&rdquo; of up to £100,000.00 (which is the maximum amount of loan available from Dublin Corporation under this scheme). Unfortunately, it has come to my attention, in my capacity of CIC Development Manager; of the inappropriate way some Estate Agencies are dealing with clients who are buying houses under this scheme.</P>
    <P>A client has informed me that when he went to view a house priced in the region of £89,000.00 he was informed by the Estate Agents that no offers had been received on the house (the current owner confirmed this). However when the Estate Agent found out my client had a Dublin Corporation loan &ndash; the price gazumped to £100,000.00 (the Estate Agent immediately claimed he had a prior offer). However, the following day my client's father rang the Estate Agent asking about the property and was informed that no interest or offers had been made on this house. The Estate Agent asked where he was sourcing his loan when the father said Dublin Corporation; the Estate Agent said, &ldquo;well if it's a Dublin Corporation loan we would be talking about £100,000 &ndash; it's the Dublin Corporation who push the price up!!&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In light of this situation and other situations similar to this, the housing crisis in this area is going to remain at the current high level.</P>
    <P>The idea of Shared Ownership is to make housing affordable for young couples and couples who are on the housing waiting list. If the above situation is going to recur time and time again, couples will find themselves in a catch 22 situation.</P>
    <P>That is a serious matter and it is not isolated.</P>
    <P>The Irish Home Builders Association submitted a document which suggested amendments to the Bill. One claim it made was that only 915 transactions were completed under the shared ownership scheme last year. The number of shared ownership loans advanced in 1999 in the Dublin Corporation area was almost double that of 1998 at 539 and the processing time was reduced by approximately 20%. When bodies such as the Irish Home Builders Association put information in print, they should make sure it is accurate. I commend the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This is enormous legislation. I do not know what involvement the Minister had in terms of giving guidelines but the work which has gone into the Bill will have a fundamental bearing on the type of country we will have for the next 100 years. It is fine to draft plans five years in advance, but decisions taken in the current economic climate can mean that even carefully thought out plans can go by the board very quickly. The Bill is enormous and it affects every town, village, street and person in the country now and in future. In that sense, it is to be welcomed. However, it requires thorough and full discussion and treatment on Committee Stage and that should be open-ended enough to deal with the changes which will occur in Ireland in future. This country has moved on and the old days and ways are gone forever in many cases. The Ireland of five, ten and 20 years ago and beyond belongs to the archives and is delved into by students and people with memories of the way things used to be.</P>
      <P>The moneys allocated in the national development plan for the development of the country in the different regions are mind-boggling and are figures people are not used to. Much of that money will be wasted and not used for the purposes for which it was intended unless there is a clear system of management, responsibility and accountability for the way things are done. Local authorities have been gross wasters of money over the years. Unless there is a clear management structure, much of the hard-earned money given by European and Irish taxpayers for the national development plan will not be used effectively and for the purpose for which it was originally intended. I am sure the Government is conscious of that.</P>
      <P>Those involved in technology, the scientific area, the information age and research and development say that Ireland's future will be built on the brain power of its young people. That requires investment in education, research and development at an enormously high level and the equal development throughout the country of facilities, infrastructure and investment. Regarding the impact of the national plan on the so-called BMW region, the Border, midlands and western region, £12 billion will be invested there over the next six to seven years, which works out at £6 million a day, with no central co-ordination or tracking system of what is being spent and where and if value for money is being achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, all that is allocated for the worst sections of the national primary route from Longford to Charlestown is money for detailed planning and design. Obviously that is very important and will be dealt with by computer aided design systems. However, we live in a litigious society and everything is objected to, be it a hen house or a white line on the road. Someone will object and that is the type of society we live in. It means that unless there is a drive from the Government, a great deal of straight talking and a demand for answers and action, the plan will never be <Col N="360" /> achieved and the consequences for the rest of the country will not be what we want.</P>
    <P>Dublin is choked. About 700,000 to 800,000 young couples live within 20 miles of the city centre. They live in little houses for which they are mortgaged to the eyeballs and both usually work to pay off this crucifixion of 30 years. If they are blessed with children, the couple may choose for one of them to stay at home to rear the children. They are then in a position where one salary must pay for the mortgage. All the Government can do is influence interest rates to keep them low. Any change will have serious social consequences.</P>
    <P>Our media glamorise those who achieve wealth and who move up the social ladder. They create a need in people to keep up with the Jones's and to have the instant gratification of success and wealth. This instant gratification is not possible. Hundreds of thousands of these people are to be found jammed into &ldquo;little boxes on the hillside, little boxes all the same&rdquo;. They catch the train in the morning and come to Dublin where they run to their offices and work all day. They have a sandwich in the middle of the afternoon and go home on a bad train service in the evening. They have no interaction with their neighbours and no knowledge of the nature of the place in which they live. Interaction with their community does not begin until their children go to school. They do not spend in the local shops or walk around the local village or town. They are pressurised every minute of every day to pay for what they have got. The principal weight around their necks is a 30 year mortgage and they struggle, on one salary or two, to meet their payments.</P>
    <P>We are talking about balanced development and moving things out from Dublin. I support decentralisation. It has worked in my own town of Castlebar for 25 years. People who live in Castlebar appreciate a quality of life which is far superior to the rat race which has developed in Dublin. Local authorities should be challenged by this Government decision and present plans to the Minister for Finance. For example, a local authority might acquire 100 acres of land, service it and offer it to Government as a site for a departmental office. Preferably, such sites should be beside railway lines so that trains can be used by people who need to do business in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>We say we wish to keep rural Ireland alive and develop small towns and villages but the issue of planning is central to this objective. There is no spatial plan. We do not have a picture of what any town or village will be like in five years time. Picture a farmer who owns a 35 acre farm. When I was a child a farm of that size could have sustained a family. It cannot do so now. He decides to leave the farm to one son while another works in a local high technology industry. The son who works in the local factory earns £200 per week, drives a car and enjoys holidays and free weekends. The other son must work with an uncertain science in a messy environment, fill endless forms, wait for the cheque in the post and will <Col N="361" /> not receive a real financial return. The farming son decides to sell his land and get out of farming. A speculative builder with a large sum of money to hide buys the land and applies for planning permission for 50 or 100 houses. Without a water or sewerage scheme, proper road access or street lighting, he proposes to build a housing estate which will be bigger than the existing village. Picture the planners dealing with this application. Planning departments outside the Pale deal with similar applications every week.</P>
    <P>Staff in planning offices are pressurised. They are young, bright and intelligent but they are naive. Commonsense is missing in many planning laws. On the one hand the Government wishes to keep rural Ireland alive. Objective One status has been granted for this purpose. Emigrants are encouraged to come home. Irish people are now being encouraged to return from Newfoundland. However, when a returned emigrant applies for planning permission to build his home he will find that his application is turned down, because the proposed site is in a special area of conservation, a national heritage area, beside the sea or near a lake. When an emigrant comes back to Erin, takes up the challenge of the Government and wishes to live in his own locality he finds his application to build a home is turned down. The missing element in the equation is common sense.</P>
    <P>The EU Habitats Directive 92/43 states that the aim of the European directive is to &ldquo;promote the maintenance of bio-diversity, taking account of economic, social, cultural and regional requirements and also contribute to sustainable development&rdquo;. The preamble to the directive states that &ldquo;the maintenance of such bio-diversity may, in certain cases, require the maintenance, or indeed encouragement, of human activities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not know, sir, if you have ever visited the barony of Erris. If you go beyond Belmullet where, as the truck driver says, if you cross the bridge you will be in Manhattan and if you do not you will be in Ireland, go through Aghleam, Blacksod and Fallmore &ndash; beautiful country, wild and free &ndash; and on down to the Atlantic you can talk to mothers who will tell you they have six sons, five in America and one in England. A mother might tell you that the lad in Boston wants to come home, live at home and keep rural Ireland alive but has had his planning application turned down. Everywhere along that road, land where one might build a house is either close to the sea or in an SAC, a candidate SAC or an NHA.</P>

      <P>What do we want? The planners say we must not build houses while the Government says we must populate rural Ireland. This is a contradiction and what is lacking is common sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county development plan in Mayo and in every other county allows that a son or daughter of a local farmer or tenant should be entitled to <Col N="362" /> build a house where he or she wishes to live if he or she has no other land. This recommendation is not being followed in many places in rural Ireland. This contradiction requires Government attention. The European directive itself says that in many cases the maintenance of bio-diversity is not incompatible with human activity and that people should be allowed to live in such areas.</P>
    <P>When I was in Government I had the opportunity to deal with the seaside resorts scheme and I was severely criticised by many people. The Government designated 15 areas, some urban and some rural, which needed an injection of investment. It provided the environment and the local authorities decided the quality, quantity and type of development. The scheme worked wonderfully well in some places. In Westport, for example, more than £100 million was invested from private sources in three years although it had the effect of driving up house prices for local buyers. However, in other places ridicule descended on the local population because of the decisions of local authorities to allow a particular type of housing development or sometimes to allow too much of the same type. We now speak in derisory terms about the Courtown syndrome. Planning authorities decide the quantity and quality in these cases.</P>
    <P>They should say to contractor Dempsey that instead of 100, they will allow him build 45 houses of various types in respect of which proper levies will be charged to meet the cost of providing footpaths, water and sewerage and public lighting. Many of the cowboy operators are still around. There is still a need, therefore, to exercise very strict control.</P>
    <P>Sections 49 to 78, inclusive, deal with the architectural heritage. The blade of a bulldozer can remove in 30 minutes something that has remained untouched for 500 years. Dúchas, the heritage service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, has insufficient archaeological staff to deal with the 3,000 planning files which remained untouched and unexamined and which will be returned to local authorities with the words &ldquo;noted&rdquo; written on them. What this means is that potentially very valuable parts of our archaeological and architectural heritage are being lost weekly. It takes seven weeks to obtain a licence to excavate. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands need to deal with this matter. The new Ireland &ndash; the Ireland of the future &ndash; has been built on the Ireland of the past. The Government should, therefore, see to it that the necessary resources are provided.</P>
    <P>Today I met representatives of Enterprise Oil, the company which has acquired the exploration licence for the development of the Corrib field off Achill Head, the extent of which reputably is 1.3 trillion cubic metres of gas which will be brought ashore on the north coast of Mayo. The Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands does not have an underwater archaeolog<Col N="363" /> ical section. Judging from the recent survey conducted by the Irish Wildlife Trust of habitats along the north-west coast, the environmental aspects of the project will require detailed analysis, although I am sure the company has a very good environmental protection record. I hope the Government will rise to the challenge when the gas is eventually brought ashore.</P>
    <P>The extra time allowed for the submission of observations is not long enough. While an extra month may be sufficient for a county council planner to consider a planning application for a house or bungalow, it may not be sufficient in the case of a major factory or huge development. The necessary resources are not available. One cannot lodge an appeal if one has not submitted observations to the county council. What happens in the case of a person who only hears about an application by chance at the last minute? Local radio stations should include in their weekly schedules a planning programme which would include details of contentious planning applications and provide advice on what is possible or achievable in a particular area. This should be taken into account in pre-planning discussions.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill of enormous consequence and we have the opportunity to get it very right or very wrong. I hope common sense will prevail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been relieved to discover since being elected two and a half years ago that nearly every public representative, be they a Member of the Dáil or Seanad or a local authority, has had problems in negotiating their way through the planning process. I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister on introducing it. It is both enormous and detailed and indicates the road we intend to take in the future in relation to planning which has become a contentious issue in this booming economy. Some of the decisions made in the past left much to be desired and highlight the need for regulation.</P>
      <P>In the planning department in County Hall in Cork all one will see is people running helter-skelter carrying heaps of files which are often only dealt with at the last minute of the last day and then only to include the observation that further information, which has to be submitted within two months, is required. They are then returned for redrafting. Staff should have sufficient time to deal with files. This would enable them to make contact with the individuals concerned or the person who devised the plans a week or two before the deadline to have amendments made to enable permission to be granted.</P>
      <P>While one can make an educated guess if one studies planning laws well and seeks the observations of the local area engineer, in general it takes two months to get a definite line on a planning application for a house or factory in a rural area. In this context pre-planning discussions in County Hall in which everybody concerned is guided along the right path would be well worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="364" /> Much of the debate in this House on planning has concentrated on the way Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and other large urban centres of population have grown. Because of traffic congestion it can take up to one and a half hours to get to and from work. The Government and State agencies are trying to entice people to live in rural Ireland by highlighting the benefits such as a better quality of life and by endeavouring to provide under the national development plan the same leisure and other facilities that they enjoy in urban areas. However difficulties are being encountered.</P>
    <P>A planning application might be refused because the development relates to a different area or would spoil the countryside. We must decide to put serviced sites in small villages and towns in rural Ireland. I know of two villages in which that has happened, one in Churchtown in north Cork in which a developer is developing sites on a ten acre field and the other in my home town of Kiskeam. That type of development provides an orderly structure for the villages and ensures the provision of lighting and sewerage facilities, footpaths etc. This type of development avoids the construction of ribbon housing for which lighting and sewerage facilities must be extended at a later date at considerable cost.</P>
    <P>Agriculture, the traditional industry which has kept rural Ireland alive over the years, is in decline and is no longer attracting significant numbers of young people who can avail of far better opportunities elsewhere. If we are serious about repopulating rural Ireland and taking people out of logjammed cities and urban areas, we must provide the necessary facilities and infrastructure and develop serviced land initiatives.</P>
    <P>Anyone involved in the planning process will be aware of the anomalies involved. The N72 links Mallow to Killarney. On the Kerry side, the county council has no difficulty in allowing site access onto the road whereas access is not allowed onto the road from the Cork side. It is very difficult to explain that disparity to people. I realise that two separate county development plans are in question here but we need a unified policy in regard to these matters. The words &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; have been used on numerous occasions during the debate on this Bill and common sense must be applied in this area.</P>
    <P>There is a very high staff turnover in planning authorities. One could end up dealing with up to three or four different planning officers. I know the Minister intends to provide for the recruitment of additional staff in this area and that must be done as quickly as possible. The local roads engineers who must attest to the suitability of sites should be located in local county council offices and should be provided with staff in order that people do not have to trek off to county hall to obtain planning information and information on any other aspects of county council business.</P>
    <P>We are experiencing particular problems in regard to the county development plan where two towns are located within five miles of each other <Col N="365" /> and the three mile overlap is cutting off the intervening countryside. It is very difficult to convince people that they should build around towns which have necessary facilities and infrastructure when they cannot obtain planning permission.</P>
    <P>I am aware there has been a great deal of consultation on the Bill but perhaps that process could be extended. People who have obtained or been refused planning permission should have the opportunity to make observations on the planning laws and those observations should be duly considered.</P>
    <P>In rural areas where houses are located up to a mile apart, people are being refused permission to have red brick on the front or back of their houses because it might destroy the landscape. That does not make sense. It is very difficult to explain to people that those types of laws must be conformed with.</P>
    <P>There is a huge explosion of house building in Dublin but we should give careful consideration to rural areas. I note in this morning's newspaper that the smallest houses available in Dublin cost £120,000. If one was to build a house for that money in Duhallow, it would be a mansion and would be talked about for a long time. There are plenty of sites available and some people can obtain sites from their parents. Labour costs have soared in Dublin because of the volume of work but they are somewhat lower in rural communities. If this Bill can encourage even one in ten people to relocate in a rural area, that is to be welcomed. The trend is towards large urban centres in which the facilities are better but we should seek to encourage some percentage of people to live in rural areas.</P>
    <P>More than 1,500 post-primary students attend school in Kanturk and Charleville. Watching the number of young people in town at lunchtime, one wonders if something could be done to encourage 10% of them to stay in their community. Traditionally, when we were poorer, people left rural communities to go to England and America and they never returned. We must ensure this is dealt with although some measures in this Bill refer to the problem. Deputy Kenny referred to special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas where development is not allowed. In the 1960s and 1970s we bulldozed architecture and archaeological sites. We are now living to regret it. We must ensure that we do not destroy our heritage. However, there must be progress although people will ask at what cost? We need to ensure the viability of communities. Deputy Pat Carey mentioned how some communities in Dublin are dying. I hope this Bill will help preserve small urban and rural communities &ndash; I like to champion the cause of rural areas. Some measures in the Bill cover these areas although there are outstanding issues which I hope will be dealt with on Committee Stage. I appeal to everyone to support initiatives which ensure that rural communities survive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I give the Bill a qualified welcome <Col N="366" /> because I am not sure it addresses the issues we are facing. The last two speakers referred to some of the issues which do not come within the radius of planning, development and their associated considerations. Deputies Kenny and Moynihan referred to rural areas. I was born in the west and I know the territory well. When one travels along the narrow roads which are no longer regularly used, it is amazing to see on the hills the remains of cottages built 150 or 160 years ago, the occupants of which emigrated to the four corners of the world. The chances of someone living there again, albeit with better employment prospects and a different environment and future, are slim to none because someone has decided those houses should not have been built in the first place. We are refining the roundness of the wheel.</P>
      <P>One issue needs to be taken on board as regards planning and development. We had a population of about nine million 150 years ago whereas we have about half that number now. The population will increase if economic expansion continues, which is likely. Planners, experts and consultants say that people should only live in urban settlements &ndash; that is the jargon. That is true to a point because it accommodates a greater bulk of population. However, the tradition of living in rural areas should be borne in mind. It should also be borne in mind that we were able to accommodate a population of nine million 150 years ago when the cities and towns had a minuscule population in comparison to now. There is a lesson to be learned from that, which we are not taking on board.</P>
      <P>In the UK and Europe small settlements are interspersed throughout the countryside where people have traditionally built houses. They have managed to blend urban and rural living quite well &ndash; they have the advantages of space and the countryside while still having access to jobs and services. One area the Bill has not addressed, notwithstanding the Bacon report, is housing and where we will accommodate people in the future. I note what is happening in west Cork and other places. I am sure it will be only a short time before the dramatic spiral in house prices hits even the remotest parts of the country. It gets worse with each month. I despair when I go to my clinics on Saturday and find the same people who were there this time last year and two years ago. They have an income of £25,000 or £30,000 and no chance of acquiring a house. It is now at the stage where some people working here have bought a house in the UK and live there at the weekend. It is a disgraceful indictment on our planning and development process. It is incredible that it should happen here, the least densely populated country of all the EU member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it difficult to tell young couples that we are trying to make it possible for them to get a house, whether through the local authority, purchase or whatever. As the Acting Chairman will know, in my constituency, a Dáil Deputy's salary &ndash; according to the critics we are supposed to be <Col N="367" /> well paid &ndash; is not sufficient to fund the average mortgage for an ordinary three-bedroom house. It is not the kind of mortgage I would advise anyone to take out because in the event of slippage in the market, the person concerned would not have a chance of paying it. The Bill does not deal with this serious problem, notwithstanding the proposals regarding land zoning and the 10% or 20% figure. I am afraid it is too little too late. Its impact will not be sufficient.</P>
    <P>There is another area to which I want to refer and which I cannot understand. Any country one goes to, even the former communist countries in eastern Europe, have fairly good arterial road structures. They have wide roads, some of them built with concrete or whatever. Some of them have been there for years and they seem to have stood the test of time. Yet, in this country for some reason we are told we cannot and should not build roads because it encourages more people to drive and fills the roads with cars. This is a peculiar logic invented by the former UK Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. It had the added benefit of ensuring there was no necessity to spend capital on that type of project because it was environmentally unfriendly to do so. One only needs to drive in the mornings in this city to see we have a problem with traffic jams.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand, given modern transport methods and the need to provide goods and services at speed, how we can provide these services with roughly the same infrastructure as existed approximately 150 years ago, even though there have been a few improvements. I am sure the Minister of State will recognise that the road to Cork, with the exception of the area going through my constituency and one or two other areas such as Portlaoise and perhaps Kildare town, where a miniature slug held up progress for the past few years, is essentially the same as it was 100 years ago. It has been widened and improved a little but it is essentially the same, and this is a disgrace. Such a road carrying such a heavy volume of traffic between two major cities would not be tolerated in any other country. If one compares our roads structure with comparable population sizes, even in communist countries, we are way behind. I cannot understand this, it is incredible.</P>
    <P>One can scarcely enter a town or village at present without experiencing a traffic jam. There are traffic jams in towns with populations as low as 500. This is occurring because we are using the same road structures that were in place 150 years ago. If people wish to travel to any part of the country which involves the road bypassing the town, people go right through that town. I cannot understand this. I presume we wish to be friendly towards the people of these towns, go right up through the middle of the main street and blockade the traffic when the children are leaving school. All the converging services arrive at the same spot at the same time and a set of traffic lights is erected to help things a little further and <Col N="368" /> enable people to cross the street in reasonable safety. I cannot understand why it has not become a prerequisite to build a ring road and divert traffic around most towns and villages. When travelling throughout the UK, it is not necessary to go into the centre of any town or village unless one wishes to do so. One can travel throughout the country without the slightest difficulty. The British system has many disadvantages &ndash; we should know more about this than anyone &ndash; but they have certainly managed to master the road system, notwithstanding Margaret Thatcher's performance in that area.</P>
    <P>The same applies to general services whereby people tend to look for more infrastructure. The word &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; covers a multitude, it is being used regularly at every opportunity. Every public representative is familiar with the word. This essentially means services. Very often people fail to get into the nitty gritty of what it means. It means water and sewage facilities and the provision of utility services required by the population on a daily basis, and this country is way behind in this regard. There is very little in the Bill to deal with this issue, even though there is a little bit of movement here and there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is using the word &ldquo;little&rdquo; too often because it does not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure about that. I have toured the country as often as anyone else and in approximately 70% of locations there is either an insufficiency of services or a lack of services entirely. We compare very badly with other countries in this regard, notwithstanding the fact that we have received European funding for a number of years. I am not accusing the Minister of State because he was not responsible for all this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A couple of other issues need to be considered. I was interested yesterday morning to hear the President of the Planning Institute speak on radio. He was waxing lyrical about planning permission delays, my favourite subject. He suggested &ndash; I bow to his superior knowledge &ndash; that the £20 fee proposed in the Bill for third party objectors could be a deterrent to attracting objectors. There is no need to worry in that regard, there will be plenty of them anyway. I observe the right of the objector because there is a need to ensure that a development is not objectionable, intrusive, overpowering or inconsistent with the aesthetics of the area. However, my imagination is somewhat stretched when I see some of the grounds for objection which are clearly vexatious or mischievous. I fail to understand why An Bord Pleanála or the Department of the Environment and Local Government, in the context of this Bill, has not come up with a means of identifying the nitty gritty in terms of these objections which cost the State millions of pounds. This seems to be a growth industry. If one decides to build a golf course in Cork, for example, someone from the other end of the country might decide to object on the basis of their environmental <Col N="369" /> interest or whatever &ndash; they may well have such an interest &ndash; but I would like to know to what extent is the person familiar with the aesthetics of that particular area. I cannot understand this.</P>
    <P>A regular occurrence in rural areas is where a person applies for planning permission to build a house for a son or daughter or whatever and a third party objector appears on the scene, usually on the 30th day, the last moment before approval is given. Lo and behold, after a little while the person gets the impression that if he or she pays a visit, there could be the possibility of a financial arrangement whereby the objector will back off. These are not isolated incidents, they are happening on a fairly regular basis and with a consistency which is a little alarming. Not only is this intruding seriously on the right of the individual to go through the planning process without being impeded, but it suggests that perhaps a business arrangement could suddenly grow up around this area.</P>
    <P>I am not decrying the valid objection or objector, of which there are countless cases. I was involved in a case recently where the objection was genuine. However, in some of the cases I have examined from time to time, there seemed to be an extensive use of jargon which was hurriedly learned and which appeared to smack of nothing more than the decision by someone to say, &ldquo;Well, I have arrived at this particular location, I am here now and I will make sure that nobody else arrives here&rdquo;. This is what happened in the United States in the days of the land rush when a means had to be found to register property in advance so that people could not claim-jump and so on. I am concerned about this aspect which the Bill does not seem to deal with. If it is intended to streamline planning permission and to meet the needs of the country in the future, if one is obstructed for long periods by the sudden appearance of a small snail, which may well be unique to one particular area but not necessarily to the country, and if vexatious objections are entertained, this will have a negative impact and will eventually bring the whole system to a halt.</P>
    <P>I regularly criticise An Bord Pleanála because that is part of my job, it is what I am elected to do. It is essential that the board is provided with sufficient facilities to ensure it deals adequately and on a reasonably rapid basis with the applications coming before it.</P>
    <P>A period of two rather than three months should be used. This is the position with regard to local authorities. The final decision should be available in two months because there is no need to replicate in its entirety the process the local authority has already undergone. Services and facilities need to be provided.</P>
    <P>It is common practice for the board to subcontract to private enterprise various technical inspections in planning applications. Although such outside operators are approved by the board and signs a disclaimer, I am not entirely happy about it. It leaves the system open to question because the person or persons involved are not <Col N="370" /> permanent employees of the board. They are employed on a one off basis. Such people should be permanent employees of the board.</P>
    <P>In common with other speakers, I agree it is important to retain our heritage. Many aspects of our heritage, particularly our built heritage, in cities and towns were demolished years ago and we lost out as a result. It is important to protect and preserve, but that is not as difficult as people assume. Modern internal aspects can be incorporated into buildings. They can be adapted to make them aesthetically pleasing while also ensuring they reflect their historical past. Changes can be kept to a minimum while also meeting modern requirements.</P>
    <P>The issue of development would take hours to discuss in detail and therefore only a few minor aspects can be debated in the time available. However, there is a lack of architectural flair in the country. I heard a comment recently that there has been no worthwhile architectural development in Ireland in the past 40 years. Although I do not agree entirely, there is some merit in that point. There is an ongoing attempt to quell any architectural flair which may exist. If the planning system in local authorities encounters any flair in architects, it appears to kill it off.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest developments which are inconsistent with our heritage or the aesthetics of the area should be encouraged, but this aspect needs to be considered. We must move away from the notion that the only type of house one can build is one with two gables, a front and a back, one window on each side, two chimneys and doors at the front and back. It is time to make improvements and to incorporate a little flair.</P>
    <P>A suggestion was made by a much more eminent person than me some time ago that a house, which was built partially overground and partially underground and had the appearance of an historical monument, should have received an architectural award. The house had some merit but it was not consistent with modern requirements. If everything remained as it was 1,000 years ago, there would be no sense in making improvements and life would be idyllic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Durkan is wrong in suggesting the Bill does not do anything to facilitate the provision of infrastructure. On the contrary, the Bill provides that the responsibility for approving the compulsory purchase of land, local authority EI projects and roads schemes will be transferred from the Minister to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>Procedural deadlines have been introduced to ensure the process happens within a set timeframe. The board will have an objective to deal with CPOs and EIAs within 18 weeks, the same period that applies to planning appeals. The board has shown in the past that it can meet strict objectives when it has the resources to meet the demands placed on it. I am confident the board will perform its new tasks equally well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> The Deputy wants a provision included in the Bill to prevent vexatious objections. Section 123 gives new powers to the board to dismiss vexatious appeals or appeals which are made with the intention of getting money from the developer.</P>
    <P>Some 37 years since the enactment of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, marks a milestone in the development of planning in Ireland. It is modern, progressive legislation which places the concept of sustainable development at the heart of the planning system. The Bill consolidates primary planning law which is contained in nine Acts dating from 1963 to 1999 and a number of regulations implementing EU directives on environmental impact assessment. The consolidation in itself will be of major benefit to all users of the planning system. The Bill is very large, containing 245 sections and six Schedules. It is much more than a consolidation of existing law. It introduces many significant changes and new initiatives.</P>
    <P>At the start of the review process which led to the new Bill, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, said the planning system for Ireland in the 21st century should be strategic in approach, imbued with an ethos of sustainable development and deliver a performance of the highest quality. These are the principles on which the Bill is based. Given the size of the Bill, it is impossible to consider all its aspects in the time available. Therefore, I wish to concentrate on the strategic focus of the Bill and its implications for sustainable development.</P>
    <P>The workings of the Planning Act, 1963, were built around the central importance of the development plan. The development plan informed all decisions on planning applications and the local authority's own proposals for development. Under the Bill the local authority development plan retains its status at the heart of planning. It will be informed, however, by regional planning guidelines which will provide a long-term strategic framework for the development of the whole region. The regional planning guidelines will deal with such issues as projected population trends, settlement and housing strategies, economic and employment trends, transport and infrastructure.</P>
    <P>In turn, the regional guidelines will be placed in the context of the national spatial strategy which my Department is undertaking as part of the Government's policies for balanced regional development set out in the national development plan. We are all aware of the dominance of the greater Dublin area and its power to drag in people and investment. The national spatial strategy will aim to bring about more balanced regional development, including counteracting the dominance of the greater Dublin area. This will bring great benefits to all regions.</P>
    <P>As I represent the second largest city in the <Col N="372" /> State, I consider that Cork is well placed, along with the other major urban centres, to play a pivotal role in achieving more balanced development throughout the State. The national spatial strategy will be prepared by my Department over a two year period. It will have a 20 year time horizon and will set out the blueprint of how the Government's policy of balanced regional development will be achieved. The strategy will be prepared on the basis of developing a consensus among the social partners and sectoral and regional interests. This represents the best way forward.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions from the Opposition benches that the strategy is too late. It has also been put forward that perhaps three, six or 12 towns should be immediately identified as growth centres and investment directed to those centres. While I understand the desire to move quickly, to do so without the necessary preparation and study would be a major error. To do so without consultation and proper investigation would be correctly seen as high handed and a recipe for controversy and dispute. There will be no untoward delays in preparing the national spatial strategy, but it will be carried out in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>Turning back to the legislation, the Bill also provides for local area plans which will bridge the gap between the broad objectives of the development plan and actual development proposals. This will ensure that, for example, new developments are provided with the services and amenities required. For the first time, therefore, we will have a structured hierarchy of plans from the broad national picture down to local development level.</P>
    <P>In addition, the adoption of development plans has been strictly time tabled to ensure that development plans are renewed every six years and therefore remain relevant to current needs. The Bill recognises the value of public participation and strengthens the role of democratically elected councillors. Making development plans is one of the most important and most onerous functions of elected members of local authorities. The Bill makes it clear that a single development plan must be produced for each local authority, setting out the overall strategy for the development of its area. The only exception to this is where an urban authority includes its environs in a development plan with the agreement of the county council. Piecemeal plans for different parts of a local authority's area will not suffice.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes important provisions to streamline the production of development plans, while at the same time enhancing the role of the elected representative and improving public consultation. The objective in relation to development plans is to encourage a sense of ownership of the plan within the community which it serves and amongst the councillors who adopt it. The draft development plan has in the past been seen as a manager's or planner's document to which councillors react. This in turn can result in the <Col N="373" /> planners becoming defensive about the draft plan and councillors and the public reacting negatively against it. Under the Bill the whole thrust of the new procedures is to get councillors and the public involved at the earliest stages of plan formation &ndash; before the draft plan is produced. The Bill provides that four years into the lifetime of a development plan the manager must initiate the procedures to review the plan and to prepare a new plan. This involves early consultation with interested bodies to get their views on what the new plan should contain. After five months of initial consultation the manager must prepare a report arising from the public consultation and submit it to the elected members. The elected members can make recommendations to the manager regarding the preparation of the draft plan with which the manager must comply. Councillors are therefore in the driving seat regarding the initial drafting of theColour RGB 171,0,0 plan.</P>
    <P>Preparation of the draft plan must be completed within 11 months of the manager commencing the review. Once that is completed another formal round of public consultation must take place. The procedures involved are similar to the existing procedures under the 1963 Planning Act except that they are strictly timetabled. The draft plan must be adopted by the end of the year, that is, within two years of the review commencing. There is no further provision for extensions of time. This will ensure that development plans are renewed on time every six years and remain relevant to current needs.</P>
    <P>In addition, regional planning guidelines will be adopted by the members of the regional authority and local area plans will be adopted by the members of the relevant local authority. There has been some criticism from Members on all sides of the House regarding development carried out by local authorities. There has been a suggestion that local authority development is not subject to the same rigorous consideration as planning applications from private developers, but in general, local authorities have a good track record of carrying out development in a sensitive manner. The results of the various urban and village renewal schemes are testament to that. However, there is room for improvement in the transparency of the decision making process. Since 1994 local representatives have had a greater say in development carried out by their own authorities through the Part X procedure under the planning regulations. The Bill restates the Part X procedure in section 163 while addressing some criticisms that have arisen with regard to it. It requires the submission of planning reports to local authority members on proposed development, to a similar standard to planning reports on planning applications. The report must show how the proposed development is consistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area having regard to the provisions of the development plan. This is the same criteria which applies to evaluating a planning application. The elected members must consider <Col N="374" /> any report before the development may proceed and may vary or modify the development. Given my responsibility for environmental awareness and protection, I am particularly pleased with the way the concept of sustainable development has been woven into the fabric of the Bill. The term &ldquo;proper planning and development&rdquo; of an area has been replaced as the Bill's touchstone by &ldquo;the proper planning and sustainable development&rdquo;, but this is more than a change in terminology. For example, the development objectives to be contained in development plans reflect the environmental concerns of the modern age. Environmental assessment of regional planning guidelines, development plans and local area plans is provided for. The interface between pollution control licensing and planning control has been revised to allow a more holistic approach to be adopted in considering development which requires IPC licences.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces simpler procedures to draw up tree preservation orders and new measures to facilitate the protection of public rights of way and so on. All these measures envisage a greater role for local authority members than was provided for in the 1963 Planning Act. An important new power in the Bill is the provision to designate landscape conservation areas. Tighter planning controls in relation to the natural environment can be applied by local councillors in these areas. Section 187 enables the Minister, by regulation, to determine that planning permission may be required for certain works which are normally exempted development where such works are undertaken in a landscape conservation area. Works consisting of the removal of hedges or ditches or land reclamation would be typical of the type of works that could be covered in these regulations. A planning authority will then be able to propose the designation of an area as a landscape conservation area. Following the normal process of public consultation, the elected members of the planning authority may make the designation.</P>
    <P>Enforcement of planning law has long been a concern for many people and in particular, the issue of unfinished estates has been a bone of contention in many areas. If people are to respect the planning laws they must be assured that they will be enforced. This Bill introduces major reforms to the enforcement code. It has been simplified and strengthened to respond to people's genuine concerns. The enforcement provisions of this Bill will make people think twice before ignoring planning law and I hope to see the widespread use of retention permission being used only to rectify genuine mistakes, not as a means of circumventing controls.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions during the debate that the Bill does nothing to deal with the problem of existing estates which are unfinished. However, I draw Deputies' attention to section 164, which makes provision for taking estates in charge when a majority of the residents request that the authority do so, through the procedures set out in the Roads Act, 1993. Where the estate <Col N="375" /> is finished to the satisfaction of the authority, this can be done at any time. However, when the estate is unfinished, the authority will be obliged to take it in charge at the request of the residents if enforcement action has not commenced within seven years of the expiry of the planning permission. The obligation to take an estate in charge will apply to estates that are unfinished at the moment. This provision will end the problem of estates being left unfinished for once and for all.</P>
    <P>On the problem of unfinished estates, there have also been suggestions from some Deputies that the bonding system as applied by local authorities is inadequate as potential loss of the bond is not an adequate deterrent to ensure that a developer will finish an estate. However, it is clear that many local authorities request adequate bonds and ensure that the bonding system works. Where there is a problem with bonds not being applied the local authority should look at its practices. This is not a problem with the legislation.</P>
    <P>Once enacted, the Bill will be followed up with comprehensive regulations and guidelines so that the benefits of this new legislation can be applied by local authorities and by all who interact with the planning system. I assure the House that the Government is committed to giving this Bill full effect as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the officials of the Department of the Environment and Local Government for bringing forward such a comprehensive Bill. It has been said many times in recent decades that many aspects of planning law had come about in an <i>ad hoc</i> way through ministerial regulation in response to individual problems in the planning process and that there has not been a coherent overview since the planning system started in 1963. This comprehensive approach is welcome. I welcome the inclusion of the concept of sustainable development, that is, that planning and sustainable development should be the hallmark of our approach to general development from this period onwards.</P>
      <P>The greater Dublin area, which my city manager characterises as running from Drogheda through Navan, onto Naas and Wicklow, has a population of 1.65 million, shortly increasing to two million. It is important that its fundamental needs are met in a sustainable way and in a way that ensures those who live in that territory can have the best possible quality of life. The Bill is timely in relation to the National Development Plan 2000-2006 which is critical for the country's development. As one who has advocated the use of local and regional plans in my local authority for the past decade, I welcome the structured hierarchy of plans for each locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the responses I received on the Bill dealt with the fees payable to planning authorities <Col N="376" /> in respect of planning permission in section 222. There is a strong reaction against the idea of local authorities imposing fees when neighbours and local residents associations are making representations. To make an effective appeal to An Bord Pleanála, as I have had to do recently on an issue in my constituency, there is the general cost of submitting a structured and well thought out appeal, the cost of which we have had to bear. We can make ordinary representations but if we make a proper submission to the board we have to follow the usual rules, the cost of which is £36 each time. Given that we want citizens to take the deepest possible interest in planning matters and to respond quickly to a particular application in the locality, I suggest we leave the first stage, permission stage, with the local authority. In my constituency major campaigns have had to be mounted in particular areas, one of which was about the Eircom and Esat masts for microwave transmission for our well used mobile phones. There have been instances where if communities did not have the current flexibility, the major responses to planning applications could not have been made, in my case, to Fingal County Council and Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that in Part III, which deals at length with permission, the Government did not go as far as my colleague Deputy Seán Ryan went in the Bill he introduced towards the end of the last Dáil in relation to the completion of estates. Section 34 provides that residents, through plebiscite, will have the option of taking in charge and that subject to a High Court provision the local authority will be able to take into account the history of a particular developer. We have had cases in the Dublin area where estates have been left unfinished not only for five or ten years but in the areas I represent for 25 years, 30 years and 35 years where developers left derelict sites. In Donaghmede an estate was left as it was and the company, Connaught Estates, went into liquidation. In this case the Chief State Solicitor takes over the land. There is a long protracted process before the local authority can put the land, where there is anti-social behaviour night after night, to good use. Perhaps the Minister will look again at section 34 with a view to strengthening the requirement that developers complete estates within the specified period. The Labour Bill provided that otherwise they would not get another planning permission. That is what is necessary given the type of rogue development we have had to endure. We have had good developers but some rogue developers left us high and dry and left bits and pieces of land in a terrible state with all the anti-social consequences that follow.</P>
    <P>In section 34 the planning permission period has been reduced to eight weeks. There are some recommendations in relation to An Bord Pleanála later in the Bill on the timeframe within which a permission can be granted. In my area we were faced with a major development from Gannon Homes for 2,000 housing units with ancillary com<Col N="377" /> mercial developments &ndash; a whole new village or parish in my constituency. In adjoining areas there are proposals for three or four new parishes of up to 5,000 to 6,000 housing units. In the case of Gannon Homes the permission application was placed on the register of Dublin Corporation on 23 December, hours before Christmas eve. The result was that two and a half weeks passed while the officials had been on holidays. There had been some brief noticing of the permission but most citizens, for obvious reasons at Christmas, were not aware of it. Two and a half weeks of the eight or nine weeks had passed before councillors could react to this enormous development on our doorstep. Almost 30% of the time had elapsed before I got a chance to read and look through the detailed plans in Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would specify that submitting applications the night before Christmas is not acceptable and should not be permitted. I realise people could be working on plans for months and be in a rush towards the end of the year. Nonetheless, I do not see the necessity for that type of behaviour. On the completion of estates, I would welcome a stronger approach.</P>
    <P>Part II, chapter I, sets out the procedure in relation to development plans. I have been involved in drawing up two development plans in my local authority and in submissions to other development plans as a representative for an adjoining local authority. I wonder about the six year timeframe within which every planning authority shall make a development plan. I understand the Minister will shortly bring in a detailed Bill on local government and the reform of local government which will include the kind of supports that Deputies should get from councils in terms of information and so on. Why is the life of the plan not coterminous with the life of the council? If it is five years, why do we not have a precise five year plan? From my experience in 1991 and 1999 there was an incredible rush in Dublin Corporation and Fingal County Council to get plans completed. In the case of the city plan councillors, many of whom were part-time politicians who had to get off work to attend meetings, had to make representations on a host of books and amendments to the plan. In view of this there is a need to re-examine the timeframe provision.</P>
    <P>I welcome the framework to be applied to the making of plans, especially the requirement to include infrastructure, conservation and facilities for the community. Previous development plans failed to make adequate provision for infrastructure. In recent weeks I was strongly critical of the Minister because over the Christmas period the water supply to the northern fringe of the city was cut off night after night, starting on Christmas Eve. This was done because of fears over a physical Y2K problem and the possibility of a disaster over the Christmas period.</P>
    <P>I have told the House on several occasions that the water supply to Dublin is poised on a knife edge, yet people are making massive planning <Col N="378" /> applications which will need huge additional amounts of water. Unlike almost every other major capital city in Europe which has a 10% to 15% reserve supply, the Dublin region has none. I am glad, therefore, the Bill makes it a requirement to include this in the basic development plan for each area.</P>
    <P>I was unhappy with the rushed approach to finalising the 1999 plan for Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council and with the level of public consultation and the supports available to councillors in terms of maps and models. For example, in the two counties to which I have referred, incredibly, maps did not include housing estates built in the last three, four of five years, although they were part of the draft plans.</P>
    <P>I welcome the parts of the Bill which refer to co-operation between local authorities. The major developments on the northern fringe of the city require ongoing co-operation between Fingal County Council and Dublin City Council, which has been lacking heretofore. While Dublin City Council decided to demolish 3,200 apartment units in the Ballymun area, just up the road in adjoining territory in the Santry Woods area our colleagues in Fingal County Council decided to erect 1,100 apartments. Dublin City Council was not consulted by Fingal County Council on this. Similarly, across the northern fringe of the city, in Coolock, Donaghmede, Baldoyle and down to the sea, there are major proposals for development on both sides of the line dividing the two councils. It is only because of motions I put down in Dublin City Council in recent months and following discussions with the Fingal County Manger, Mr. Willie Soffe, that, at long last, co-operation has started. The Minister is right to make this mandatory because adjoining local authorities should work closely together, especially in a small area like the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for a local area plan set out in Chapter II. We have informal experience of this in the Dublin city region. For example, there have been local area plans for Finglas and Raheny, which were started by local people. More recently there has been the beginnings of a local area plan for the Donaghmede area. Before preparing these plans, a complete environmental audit of the locality should be undertaken. For example, thanks to the Northside Partnership we have a detailed environmental audit in the Coolock area which covers every house, garden, street and lamp-post. This kind of detail is needed to see how areas should be developed in terms of infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provisions on regional infrastructure because it will help to end the lack of co-operation between many of the localities I have mentioned. I am a member of the Dublin Regional Authority since last June-July. It is serviced by a hardworking but small number of staff and appears to be nothing more than a talking shop with no input into anything. Following enactment of this legislation, I hope a start will be <Col N="379" /> made on proper regional planning for the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>While the proposal to set aside 20% of development land for affordable social housing, set out in sections 79 to 86, is to be welcomed, it is only a drop in the ocean when it comes to dealing with the massive housing crisis. I am proud this proposal originated with the Labour Party. With the help of my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, the party has presented the only coherent plan to address the housing and homeless crisis. The Minister has off-loaded onto his hapless Progressive Democrats colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, one of the two most important problems facing the country, leaving him to carry the baby.</P>
    <P>When we meet our constituents at weekends Deputies repeatedly hear of heart rending, horrendous cases involving the sufferings of families on the streets of this city. When I visited the housing department of my local authority yesterday I discovered that a family whose son has a severe disability &ndash; a woman who is waiting for eight to nine months for a home &ndash; has been given some kind of priority, but there are no houses available. In my local authority there have been 600 house starts this year and there are 7,500 people on the Dublin City Council housing list. Fingal County Council has approximately 3,000 people on its housing and homeless list.</P>
    <P>The housing commission established by my party estimated that last year 135,000 families are homeless in this State. What is the point of having a Celtic tiger economy, an economy that will be worth £100 billion or the equivalent in euros &ndash; provided the euro does not fall any further in value  &ndash; where average incomes have supposedly overtaken those in Germany, if we have so many families on the streets? If the Minister does not take a more vigorous approach this will be one of two issues on which he will be harshly judged.</P>
    <P>My party has taken a much more rigorous approach. We established a housing commission, which the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, should have done. We have also proposed a series of policies which we would like to implement. If we had between 45 and 50 seats in the Dáil we would do so.</P>

      <P>We once had 33 Deputies and we are still very ambitious. If we were in power our approach would include the provision on social housing as one of approximately ten. The Government's failure to adequately implement the recommendations in the Bacon report has led to the enrichment of greedy speculators and investors with two, three or more properties while young couples with a combined salary of £35,000 <Col N="380" /> cannot buy a house. After almost three years in office that is the legacy the Government is leaving and it will be judged harshly on it.</P>
      <P>Our programme is simple. We are prepared to build 50,000 local authority houses over the next four of five years and, if necessary, we will CPO land to ensure that. We are also prepared to embark on an urgent housing crisis development plan, to cap rents if necessary and to allow for a fair rents environment. As Deputy Gilmore has outlined several times in the House, we are prepared to take a very strong approach. While the section providing for social housing is welcome, it is not enough.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Senator Costello, provided the Minister with the opportunity to implement this provision a few months ago. Why did he not avail of it? Nevertheless, I welcome the efforts made by his officials to introduce this measure, although I am critical of many aspects of it. On Committee Stage I hope to encourage the Minister to rethink aspects of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill which is important and weighty in terms of volume and its objectives of reforming our planning laws and assisting with the implementation of the national development plan.</P>
      <P>At a recent meeting of Dublin City Council a report, &ldquo;Major Infrastructural Projects in Ireland and Europe: a Comparison&rdquo;, was presented to members. Our planning laws must serve us well and cannot be used in delaying developments. The report says:</P>
      <P>Major public infrastructural projects in the Dublin area, such as the southern cross route, are often dogged by delays prior to the actual construction stages, thus exacerbating the problems they were designed to alleviate. Often the delays are predicated on legal challenges which can literally add years to the completion of a project with a simultaneous opportunity cost both in terms of funding and in public service provision. After commissioning reports comparing the Irish and European experience in this area from both a planning and legal perspective, the following observations and recommendations appear relevant to the development of major infrastructural projects in the city. Generally, the European Union has had an influence on the planning initiatives in member states.</P>
      <P>The report mentions in this context legislation, policy initiatives, etc. It also states:</P>
      <P>The European Commission has further identified three contextual factors which play a fundamental role in determining the characteristics of spatial planning systems in member states:</P>
      <P>1.constitutional law [which plays quite an important role in our deliberations]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" /> 2.Government structure and responsibilities for spatial planning</P>
    <P>3.the legal framework.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to read the entire report, but it continues:</P>
    <P>The comparison between the apparent progress which our European partners are making in the development of major public infrastructural projects and the delays experienced in Ireland are highlighted when one compares the following: the southern cross motorway, not yet finished; the second Severn Bridge between England and Wales, opened in 1996; the Oresund Bridge and Tunnel between Denmark and Sweden, to open in July 2000; and the Vasco da Gama Bridge across the Tagus, Lisbon, opened in 1998.</P>
    <P>The report gives the timescales for these projects, saying &ldquo;the longer timescale for the southern cross project in comparison with three other case studies is clear&rdquo;, stating that the Vasco da Gama Bridge, which spans 18 kilometres, took seven years to complete, the Oresund Bridge and Tunnel, which spans 18 kilometres, took 12 years and the second Severn Bridge, which spans five kilometres, took 12 years while the southern cross route, which involves eight kilometres, has taken 30 years.</P>
    <P>The manager draws conclusions from the report, two of which are:</P>
    <P>At the start of each project a timescale should be established within which it is to be completed. A fast-track system should be developed for all stages of the project from initial consultation stages to completion.</P>
    <P>In order to satisfy the requirements of natural and constitutional justice, it is necessary to have a consultation process so that those who are affected by the development can feed into the process at as early a stage as possible. If the concerns of interested parties, for example, local residents, businesses, etc., can be assuaged at an early stage, this should lower the number of objections considerably and thereby shorten any public inquiry into the matter. The need for an expeditious inquiry must be emphasised, possibly by legislating for a mandatory maximum period.</P>
    <P>I think this latter provision is included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The review was conducted by John Martin, Dublin City planning officer, Terence O'Keeffe, law agent and Michael Philips, city engineer, each of whom the manager thanks.</P>
    <P>It is worth reading these sections of the review into the official record given the major problems which have been identified. Deputy Broughan mentioned housing as a problem on which the Government will be judged. Traffic is also a problem, and I mentioned the report specifically as it highlights the need for public consultation and allowing individuals and groups make their views <Col N="382" /> known in relation to infrastructural projects. There are a huge number of infrastructural projects outlined in the national development plan which we hope will come to fruition, given that we have a few bob. The southern cross route and the port tunnel are examples of such projects. I argue that we have gone too far down the road of public consultation in terms of resulting delays. The public must have a right to make their views and objections known and to have them taken on board. In the context of planning applications the Minister stated that the objections or observations of the public have a statutory basis, which they did not previous have, something I welcome. However, it is equally important in the context of major projects that we reach a point where we can say we have exhausted the process and a decision must be made. Every development will be contentious, but a point must be reached where a decision is made.</P>
    <P>The report I mentioned refers to the constitutional right to property ownership and how this delays CPOs and it mentions that EISs and EIAs are part of how our European colleagues approach issues. Legal challenges in terms of property rights seem to result in Ireland taking an additional 15 years in making decisions. I presume the report has been sent to the Minister; if not he is welcome to have my copy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and have read most of it. In 1994 subsidiary was the buzz word when we were examining local government. I now note that &ldquo;sustainable development&rdquo; has replaced &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo;. The Minister said he has not precisely stated what sustainable development involves as he does not want to narrow the definition too much. I would prefer if it was defined as we may leave ourselves open to delays and queries.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been discussed at length in the Seanad and will probably be considered at length in the Dáil. I think this is related to the fact that 80% of Oireachtas Members make their way to both Houses through local government and therefore have a very hands-on approach and experience in terms of planning legislation and bring with them to the Chamber, hard earned knowledge and experience. I think the Minister recognises this by virtue of the number of amendments he brought forward on foot of consultation in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Under section 9 dealing with development plans, the period for drawing up a development plan has been changed to six years where previously it was five years. I wonder what was the rationale for this. For 14 or 15 years I was a member of Dublin County Council. I understand that the council's first development plan was presented in 1972. A review commenced in 1977 and was completed in 1983, an outrageous and ludicrous amount of time to review a plan. I am very pleased that under section 11(5) a development plan must be completed within one year.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the widespread concern that the offshore activity off the west of Ireland may not generate the potential spin off jobs in view of the changed circumstances and the technological advances since the special tax regime was introduced in 1992; whether a review body will be set up in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3576/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of recent statements to the effect that the added value to the economy of offshore developments may, in some way, be less than predicted. I wish to make a number of points. First, we are for the first time in the happy position of having a very real prospect of a significant gas find, possibly in the region of one trillion standard cubic feet, off the west coast. My priority is to assist the company, within my statutory responsibilities, in bringing this gas ashore and making it available to support development in the north-west.</P>
      <P>Second, this favourable position follows almost 30 years of disappointment during which 133 exploration and appraisal wells were drilled in the Irish offshore at an estimated cost of about £700 million to exploration companies with only the Kinsale-Ballycotton and Helvick fields being declared commercial. Third, the reasons for the long period of disappointment is not that it has been contrived by the industry, as has been claimed, but is the result of external factors and, particularly, the stark fact that prospectivity in our offshore area remains low.</P>
      <P>Fourth, our 1992 terms, which are currently the subject of some criticism, were carefully drawn up in order to maintain and enhance our position in the competition for exploration funds. They are not very different from those in place in the UK, which does not have a system of royalties, despite the fact that operating conditions off the west coast are worse than anywhere in Europe. Fifth, despite the terms, Ireland is likely to have only one Corrib related exploration well drilled in its offshore between 1998 and 2000 and prospects for the immediate future are not much better. The level of drilling since the 1992 terms were introduced shows little change over the previous period. Sixth, it is unlikely that we would have the very real prospect of a significant supply of gas, for the benefit of the people of the west and north-west, if we had not revised our terms in 1992.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>I am anxious that we do not lose sight of these facts. There will not be oil exploration and development without oil companies. Gas or oil will not be brought ashore unless Ireland can <Col N="383" /><Col N="384" /> compete for exploration and production funds with the North Sea and other UK areas. We need to establish our offshore as a petroleum producing zone, not just one with a succession of dry and disappointing wells. The Corrib find holds out the promise of changing the perception of our offshore, perhaps stimulating further development. We must not do anything, now that we are seeing significant results, that might hinder that development. My objective is to balance the primary need to provide security, predictability as well as competitiveness so as to attract the oil companies, in the first place, with the real need to maximise the value to the Irish national and regional economies of prospective developments such as the Corrib.</P>
    <P>None of this is to say that we should not continue to press the oil companies to employ Irish labour and contract Irish suppliers. However, the fact remains that the choice of Irish services will depend on the hard realities of the market and that the scope for me or my Department to force the companies to employ Irish goods, services or employees is minimal. I intend to intensify the effort to bring potential operators and Irish suppliers together to ensure that complete and timely information on potential business is available, that a level playing pitch exists and is maintained and that Irish companies are technologically positioned to avail of all opportunities. I am organising a business awareness seminar as part of this intensified effort to maximise the use of Irish goods, services and employment. The principal companies currently operating in our offshore area have agreed to participate in this seminar and in the intensified effort I am initiating.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that I will review the 1992 terms when, and if, I consider it necessary, having regard to the overall need not to jeopardise the interest or involvement of oil companies in our offshore areas. I have asked my Department to provide me with a preliminary assessment of developments since 1992, including any change in prospectivity, which might warrant such a review. In the light of this assessment, I will make a decision on whether a formal review is in the best interests of all stakeholders in the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister well with his new portfolio. I am aware that a great deal of media attention has been focused on the west in regard to this issue. As the Minister rightly pointed out, the gas find is estimated at one trillion standard cubic feet. Is he aware that the Wood McKenzie report quantified the potential find at more than five trillion standard cubic feet and, therefore, it has tremendous potential? Is he further aware of the concerns which have been expressed about the use of Irish goods and services by exploration companies? The Minister's predecessor articulated these concerns to Enterprise Oil at a function on 14 October 1999. Will the Minister follow his example to ensure that such services are used by exploration companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> Is he further aware that Enterprise Oil is servicing its rigs primarily from Ayr, Scotland, which is extremely disappointing? Should the company do more service contracting in Ireland? It has a token presence in Killybegs, but there is concern that the dividends from offshore gas exploration may go to Scotland and Ireland. The services and infrastructure are available here. Deputy Fahey stated that he is Minister for the west and it is incumbent on him to ensure that Ireland benefits from such exploration. Is the Government concerned enough to ensure that this happens?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>My priority is to ensure that the maximum benefit from offshore oil and gas exploration accrues to Ireland, particularly the west. However, we must be realistic. The company currently operating in the Corrib field makes decisions which are based on what is most viable and strategic for its development. I am most keen to try to attract more offshore service work into Ireland and I will make every effort to do so. I have already met representatives of the company involved and put forward my views in that respect, but I must acknowledge their case for the most commercially viable way to do their servicing, which is from Scotland at present.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I will leave no stone unturned in putting forward the case for increased activity off the west coast. Quite an amount of activity is taking place at Killybegs and we encourage that, but I will take every opportunity to ensure that as much servicing and support work as possible is carried out off the coast. My objective is to transfer as much of the work as possible from Ayr to Ireland. However, there are good practical and commercial reasons for the company to operate from there.</P>

      <P>My predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Woods, announced the publication of the report on 7 January 2000. The report is an up-to-date assessment of the position by recognised experts. I welcome its publication and I avail of this opportunity to thank the members of the task force and all who assisted them with their work in this important and sensitive area. The key conclusion of the report is that the risk to human health and to marine life from past radioactive dumping is extremely low and does not constitute a health hazard. This should help to allay genuine public anxiety in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report emphasises the importance of continuing with the ongoing marine radioactivity monitoring programme carried out by the RPII and also the ongoing research into radiological <Col N="386" /> impacts by the RPII and the university sector. It advises that attempting to retrieve the material dumped is not necessary or practical as deliberate movement of the material is likely to present a greater hazard than the very low risk of it returning to the surface by some other means. Caution should be exercised in carrying out any works that may disturb the seabed in any area where radioactive waste has been dumped and a careful assessment of any potential risks made. I am drawing the attention of the UK authorities to this important recommendation on the management of the various dumpsites and will seek their assurances in this regard.</P>
    <P>It also recommends that the Government should continue its leading role at international level in the protection of the marine environment and that any attempt to renew the practice of dumping radioactive material should be strenuously opposed by the Government. It suggests that if any further information emerges, this should be fully investigated. I support all these recommendations and am committed to continuing the role which the Government has undertaken in this regard.</P>

Does the Minister agree that there has been a great deal of public disquiet on this issue, particularly along the east coast? If it is not possible for the British Government to indicate clearly where these materials are located, how can we avoid the incidents which have occurred off the coast in the past? For example, when cables for the pipelines have been laid, what precautions can the State take, in conjunction with the British, to avoid a recurrence of what has already happened?</P>

As I mentioned, I am drawing the attention of the UK authorities to the important recommendations regarding non-disturbance of the sea bed, and to all of the recommendations in this report. I am satisfied with the level of co-operation between the UK Government and ourselves on the issue. Arrangements for communication, consultation and co-operation between countries on matters of mutual interest such as this at EU and international level continue to be developed, and Ireland is participating fully in this process. We are monitoring this issue carefully to ensure it does not happen again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>All the available analysis confirms that commercial fish stocks are heavily exploited and in some cases seriously depleted. The total allowable catches proposed by the EU Commission each year are based on the scientific advice provided by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea in advance of the annual fish quota negotiations at the December Council.</P>
      <P>For 2000, the scientific advice for fish stocks, including those of relevance to Ireland, was firmly based on the precautionary principle. This approach sets reference points below which stocks should not fall to enable the stocks to rebuild to levels which will ensure their future viability and prevent their collapse.</P>
      <P>The precautionary approach to managing fish stocks, therefore, requires that the catch levels be reduced in the short-term so that stocks can be rebuilt and higher long-term yields ensured. Acknowledging the state of the stocks and the need for the precautionary approach, the Council agreed to reductions in TACs of whitefish stocks generally. Reductions in stocks of interest to Ireland averaged 19.5% by volume. These reductions were by and large well short of those recommended by the scientists and the Commission.</P>
      <P>I would emphasise that reductions do not decrease Ireland's percentage share of the various fish stocks. Lower TACs result in lower quotas for all member states. In the medium to longer term, the precautionary approach to setting TACs combined with more effective conservation measures will enable stock levels to grow and lead to improved quotas as a result. It is Ireland's longstanding position that our allocated share of fish stocks under the CFP falls far short of a fair and equitable level. The Government's objective is to maximise fishing opportunities for the catching sector in the context of the ongoing evolution of the Common Fisheries Policy. I will take every opportunity to advocate and advance Ireland's case in this regard including the need for a level playing field across Europe on enforcement and improved conservation strategies.</P>

      <P>In January 2000 the figure was 43,049 tons. In three years there has been a <Col N="388" /> reduction of more than 10,000 in the white fish species which, when quantified, means a reduction of nearly 25% of the tonnage we had in 1997. That is a disastrous result for the Minister who was representing us in Brussels. With regard to the white fish fleet renewal, which we all appreciate and on which there was much successful spin doctoring, I ask the Minister to deliver on the Fianna Fáil commitment before the last election to increase the tonnage capacity of the fish overall. This has not been achieved.</P>

There is no doubt that the situation is unsatisfactory. My top priority, and that of my officials, will be to try to do as good a deal as we can for Irish fishermen because there is not a level playing field across Europe on enforcement. There are issues involving conservation strategies and there is also the fact that the big players are doing very well while our quotas are only a fraction of theirs. There is a difficult issue to be addressed, and I assure the Deputy and the fishermen who work off our coasts that I will not <Col N="389" /> waste any time or energy in fighting our case as effectively and efficiently as I can to get our quotas up to the maximum in the interests of Irish fishermen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in congratulating my colleague, Deputy Fahey, and wish him every success. I know he will do very well.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have been concerned for some time with the shortfall in forestry planting as compared with the targets set. I therefore initiated early last year a review of the factors which lay behind this shortfall. It was evident from this review that significant changes in afforestation grants and premia would be required to create sufficient incentives to stimulate a substantial increase in the rate of planting.</P>
      <P>I decided on foot of that review to bring forward and accelerate a submission to the Commission for changes in premia under the existing legal framework rather than await the submissions of proposals in early 2000 in the context of the new rural development programme. This submission was made in August 1999. On foot of the initial contacts with the Commission, the advice given to me at that time was that it would be possible to negotiate a favourable package and to conclude negotiation reasonably quickly. There has been an intensive ongoing engagement with the Commission at all levels, including with the Commissioner and his most senior officials.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, and despite our best efforts, a satisfactory package has not yet been agreed, particularly in respect of premia changes. The Commission has yet to complete fully its internal process of examination and consultation. It is also clear that, given the slippage on their timetable since last August, the Commission now intends to examine the proposals in light of the total set of measures which arise under the rural development programme.</P>
      <P>The full process for approval of that programme could take up to next June. Given that our measures have already been on the table for some time, I am continuing to press for a faster timetable in respect of the forestry aspects of the package.</P>
      <P>I confirm that the commitments I have given in respect of planting undertaken in the present season will be fully honoured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised and disappointed with the reply. The Minister is aware that only 50% of the afforestation target was met under the <Col N="390" /> last plan, which expired in 2000. The target was 25,000 acres of forestry per year but actual planting did not exceed 13,000 hectares per year. According to newspaper reports, the Minister's submission was made to Brussels last August. It was to be finalised and an announcement was to be made at the National Ploughing Championships in September. Then it was reported that an announcement would be made in October and now the Minister says we might have to wait until June for it.</P>
      <P>Who are dragging their feet? The information we were given was that a response was awaited from Brussels but that Brussels was 100% behind the submission.</P>

      <P>What has caused the undue delay in introducing the new grant rates? People who are interested in forest production are saying the Minister is like Nero, who fiddled while Rome burned. There is a serious threat to the supply of native timber. I cannot see any reason it should take the EU authorities almost 12 months to make up their minds about a submission which was relatively acceptable when it was first made. Has the Minister recently approached the EU Commission to ask it to expedite its decision? Another year has passed and the planting season will be over before we get a result from Brussels.</P>

As a result, I am pursuing the matter every day by way of telephone calls, letters and threats of visits. I will visit Brussels by the end of this month.</P>
      <P>We put in our proposals last August, which was long before any of the other contacts were made under the rural development programme. As a result, I hoped we could deliver on them. However, any planting done in the current season will benefit from the new planting levels.</P>

      <P>The sustainable development of the aquaculture industry is a Government priority. A total of £25 million of EU and Exchequer funding has been allocated under the regional programmes of the national development plan to support delivery of overall strategic objectives and targets for the sector.</P>
      <P>This level of investment support is more than double the funding made available under the last round. It clearly underlines our commitment to the aquaculture sector as a sustainable, natural, resource based industry providing jobs and economic growth for coastal communities. Shellfish productivity is of major importance in the south and south-west and there is significant scope for further incremental development of both fin fish and shellfish production in the region. We will work with BIM and Údarás na Gaeltachta to ensure that the objective of balanced regional development is delivered through investment programmes for the aquaculture sector around the coast. A new strategic framework for aquaculture development is being finalised in partnership with the industry. The main thrust of the plan is to achieve critical mass in production, diversification into new species, best practice in line with stringent environmental guidelines and high standards of quality assurance which are essential if we are to succeed in the competitive market for high quality seafood products worldwide.</P>
      <P>I will shortly publish a report on future strategic directions for the aquaculture sector. The recommendations of the report will critically inform strategies for the aquaculture industry into the future and, along with the national development plan, will help deliver on the goals of critical mass, quality, sustainability, diversification, technology and cost competitiveness.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 44, 58 and 60 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> The incident referred to is a collision which occurred on 22 January 2000 at 8.45 a.m. between the Dutch fishing vessel <i>Friesland</i> and the Spanish fishing vessel <i>Jose Luisa y Mary</i> in international waters within the Irish search and rescue region and the Irish pollution responsibility zone. The collision was reported to the Irish Coast Guard at 9.41 a.m. by the owner of the <i>Freisland</i> in The Netherlands, who stated that 90 metric tonnes or 23,580 gallons of fuel oil had spilled.</P>
    <P>The captain of the <i>Friesland</i> confirmed that assistance was not required as both vessels and their crews were safe. He reported that his vessel had sustained damage to his fuel tank above the waterline and lost 130 metric tonnes or approximately 34,000 gallons of fuel oil. He also reported that the Spanish vessel was damaged above the waterline but did not have a pollution problem. The captain was instructed to transfer any remaining oil in the damaged tank to another tank. The 130 tonnes of fuel oil was a serious threat of significant pollution to the marine environment, the Irish coastline and related interests.</P>
    <P>The Air Corps Casa maritime patrol aircraft, which was in the Shannon area, was requested to divert to the incident position to carry out a vessel and pollution surveillance, take photographs of the pollution and the vessels and report to the coastguard. In addition, the navel vessel LE<i> Aisling</i> was diverted to the incident position to monitor the situation.</P>
    <P>At 11.53 a.m. the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre in Holland confirmed that it had been advised by the captain of the <i>Friesland</i> that all the fuel oil, 130 metric tonnes, had leaked from the tank. At 12.21 p.m. the Casa reported that the pollution was within an area 400 metres by 100 metres with approximately 70% coverage. The reported description and extent of the pollution was smaller than expected from a spill of 130 metric tonnes of fuel oil. At 1.52 p.m. the Casa reported that the coverage was reducing and was now 50% with big and small streaks.</P>
    <P>At 8 a.m. on 23 January 2000 the director of the Irish coastguard and the deputy chief surveyor of the Marine Survey Office on board a contracted remote sensing aircraft surveyed 2,500 square miles off the west coast and found three slicks of approximately two metric tonnes. A few hours later, the owners of the vessel confirmed that a maximum quantity of 100 metric tonnes was spilled. At 8 a.m. on 24 January the remote sensing aircraft surveyed the area again and found nothing.</P>
    <P>The Netherlands Shipping Inspectorate and the Netherlands Marine Pollution Control Unit were advised of the incident and requested to quantify the amount spilled. Both agencies replied that the <i>Friesland</i> was declaring a maximum of 45 metric tonnes of fuel oil in the tank. On 27 January 2000 the owners of the <i>Friesland</i> declared that 45 metric tonnes of fuel oil was in the tank before the collision and some was spilled but that it was difficult to determine the quantity spilled.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> It is the opinion of Irish coastguard that only a small quantity of fuel oil was spilled. This conclusion is based on the Casa report shortly after the collision, the remote sensing reports and the Spanish vessel's report that it did not see nor was it contaminated by any oil during or after the collision and that no oil contamination was visible on the vessels in the aerial photographs.</P>
    <P>The Marine Survey Office has no power to investigate collisions in international waters which do not involve Irish flag vessels. We have offered every assistance to the Netherlands and Spanish authorities in their investigation of the incident and have asked to be informed of the outcome of their investigations.</P>
    <P>The Department's policy is that the polluter pays. The cost of the pollution response is being compiled and will be presented to the owners of the <i>Friesland</i>. The only damage may be to the environment which cannot be quantified due to the probable small quantity of fuel oil dispersed.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied there has been no environmental damage reported arising from this incident. Radio broadcasts were made requesting vessels to report any oil pollution sighted and no reports have been received. There is an obligation on any vessel or aircraft sighting pollution to report it to the coastguard. Samples were taken of the spilled fuel oil and a sample was collected in the Netherlands of the fuel oil on board. These are retained for comparison purposes should pollution reappear.</P>
    <P>Despite initial reports from both the owner and the captain of the Dutch vessel that a relatively large quantity of oil was involved, I am now satisfied that the quantity of oil spilled was very small and that only minimal damage to the marine environment is involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply to the question. Fortunately the pollution did not finish up on the Mayo coast. I was going to ask why both ships were not held, but the Minister answered that by saying the accident occurred in international waters. In the event of the pollution ending up on the beaches in Mayo, what recourse do we have for the cost of cleaning it? What discussions have taken place with the Spanish and Dutch Governments to pay for the cost of the services provided by the State in that unfortunate accident?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>A careful monitoring programme was carried out and there was no major difficulty. Where damage is done by oil pollution, compensation is paid by insurers. As for pollution and its causes, each case is different. Certainly, anyone who causes pollution ultimately must pay.</P>

      <P>The first report from the Department said the spillage was 34,000 gallons and the second report the following day said it was 500 gallons. It is difficult to understand the difference. A recent comprehensive report investigated the feasibility of an emergency towing vessel suitable for use in cases of pollution. As the Minister is aware, it is predicted that our pollution responsibility zone has about 28 merchant ships and 100 trawlers at any time in its area. Does the Minister agree that, in response to preparing for an incident in the future, we should have at this stage an emergency towing tugboat suitable for pollution control? Will the Minister prioritise this to ensure we do not have an oil spill on our coastline?</P>

      <P>The initial report of 130 metric tonnes came from the captain of the <i>Friesland</i> by way of the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre in Holland. Subsequently, that was revised when it was evident that the spill was much smaller.</P>
      <P>The towing vessel is the subject of another question. It is an important priority to progress the proposals for the provision of a towing vessel to ensure we can deal more effectively with possible spills.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The multi-annual coastal protection programme will address on a prioritised basis urgent coastal erosion problems. The overall strategy will take account of the need to adopt an environmentally friendly approach to coastal protection and the need to ensure value for money. My Department has received numerous proposals for coastal protection works from all local authorities in coastal regions. The cost of the projects put <Col N="396" /> forward as priorities by local authorities for consideration under the last round of Structural Funds was estimated at over £30 million. Consultations are ongoing with the local authorities on identifying and agreeing priority areas of need in accordance with objective strategic criteria which will be tackled over the period of the new programme. I will shortly be announcing the coastal protection programme for 2000 and I have asked the Department to finalise a multi-annual strategic programme for 2001 to 2003 as a priority.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that it would be important for the Department to issue some form of priority listing for local authorities which do not have funding to deal with this problem? The Minister will be aware that in some areas houses and roads are almost in the sea at this stage. To plan a programme of work, it will be necessary to give some indication as to when work in certain areas will be done. Will the Minister seriously consider issuing alongside this report some form of priority rating and some indication when funding will be made available, especially for the worst hit areas?</P>

I know the Minister realises the seriousness of this problem which is becoming progressively more serious with every passing winter storm. In my constituency in Donegal the land mass of the county is vanishing and some of it is sinking into the sea. In many cases houses, farmland, golf links and even graveyards are in great danger.

    <P>I am conscious of the difficulties. I have seen some very good preventive work done in some <Col N="397" /> coastal regions by local communities where, because of the local involvement in caging stones and rocks, the work was done very cost effectively. My Minister of State and I will pay a great deal of attention to this subject. We will examine priorities and the most effective ways of doing work.</P>

      <P>Under the Common Fisheries Policy Regulation, 1992, the review of the CFP in 2002 could be legally confined to a limited number of issues. However, I welcome the fact that the commission, at the request of the council, is undertaking a wide-ranging assessment of the changes needed right across the CFP to make it a more effective instrument. The commission has been asked by council to report on the state of fisheries and the fishing industry in the EU and on the operation of the Central Fisheries Policy before the end of this year. On the basis of this report the council will negotiate the changes necessary to the CFP.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission has already carried out a wide ranging consultation process with fishing interests throughout the community involving a detailed questionnaire and direct meetings with fishermen in all member states. The Commission met the Irish fishing industry in Dublin, Cork and Donegal in 1998 to hear at first hand the concerns of Irish fishermen. I very much hope that these consultations will inform the Commission's report to Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the national CFP strategy review group will inform and underpin our negotiating strategy for the 2002 review. The group which is widely representative of fisheries interests is undertaking a comprehensive examination of the CFP and its impact to date on the Irish industry. The work is well progressed and the group will report to me on strategy and policy recommend<Col N="398" /> ations by the middle of this year. The work of the strategy review group will inform discussions with the Commission on Irish priorities for the review in advance of the Commission's report and will critically inform our negotiating position in negotiations up to and during the 2002 review.</P>

The Minister could extend that report and say that the same problems exist now. With regard to his submission, has a date been set for concluding his findings? Is he aware that although the 1992 report was submitted to Brussels, the results were very disappointing for Irish fishermen? Is the Minister more hopeful that a resolution to the quota situation will be found? Is the Minister aware that Spain and Portugal have applied for access to the North Sea after the year 2002 and that this access is likely to be granted? This will create further problems for the people engaged in fishing.</P>

      <P>We face a tough task. I agree with the Deputy that we require more than we achieved in the past. This matter is my first priority. I will prepare a comprehensive case with my officials. Our case will be well prepared and scientifically supported. Ireland's case is stronger than that of other European countries and it will be put forward as effectively as is within my power.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The admissibility of the French case is being considered by the court. The judgment on admissibility is expected within the next two months. The Irish authorities and the Irish Tuna Association, as well as the French authorities, have made oral submissions to the court in sup<Col N="399" /> port of the admissibility of the case. The Council of the European Union, supported by Spain and the Commission, sought that the action should be declared inadmissible.</P>
    <P>If the French challenge is judged to be admissible the court will proceed to examine the merits of the case. Ireland has already submitted a comprehensive formal intervention to the court on the merits of the case, which has the full support of the Irish tuna fishing industry.

Given that tuna is a non-quota species and the alternative method of fishing for tuna by means of long lines seems to have a more serious effect on reducing tuna stocks, it would be a wise step for the Government to back the French to the hilt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 13, 42 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>There is no application in my Department for a lease, licence or permission under the foreshore Acts for the infill of Dublin Bay. What is under consideration in my Department is the application by Dublin Port Company for permission to reclaim 21 hectares of the company's own foreshore in Dublin Port for port purposes and the accompanying environmental impact statement which were published for public comment. These documents and the public comments thereon are being examined by my Department which has engaged independent consultants to review the environmental impact statement as a first task. If this is found to be adequate, the submissions made and the company's responses to them with the company's proposals for the reclamation will be considered by the consultants and a report made to my Department. I understand the consultants' report will be ready within weeks. The Department will then assess the report and make recommendations to me. This process will take at least two months to complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the environmental impact statement is found to be inadequate, the company will be required to publish a supplementary environmental impact statement for public comment or, if the shortcomings are deemed serious enough, publish a new environmental impact statement for public comment. In that event the timescale for a <Col N="401" /> decision could be significantly longer than two months. Should I decide to grant the permission sought it would be conditional on planning permission being obtained for the reclamation before any reclamation commenced.</P>
    <P>New statutory arrangements are clearly needed to provide for the integrated management of the coastal zone generally, including the greater Dublin Bay and adjoining land area which lies within the jurisdiction of a number of local authorities as well as the Dublin Port Company. I will lose no time in consulting my Government colleagues, particularly the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, about the new statutory arrangements which should be put in place and to seek Government approval for new legislation to be introduced as soon as possible. Realistically however it will not be possible to bring forward such legislation until next year. It would not be reasonable to defer consideration of all major foreshore applications, including the one from Dublin Port, until a new legislative framework is in place. In the meantime I shall be pursuing actively with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the question of filling the obvious gap in planning law which could allow a local authority to refuse to consider an application for planning permission for foreshore reclamation for specific purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of opinion. What I am stating is that I do not wish to issue a foreshore licence until I am absolutely satisfied with what is being proposed and that it is possible to receive planning permission for it. That is the sensible and proper approach to take and if the Deputy or anybody else wants to challenge the legality of this, that is their prerogative.</P>

      <P>Until now, ports have been governed by the Foreshore Act, 1933 which was subsequently amended in 1996 and 1998. The former Minister wrote a letter on 26 January to Dublin Port officials and he changed portfolios on 28 January, leaving the current Minister holding a potential time bomb. How can planning permission be applied for in respect of a parcel of foreshore land which does not exist? The buck is being passed to the corporation.

The port has carried out various feasibility studies etc. and even if it engages in the planning permission process, it can apply for a change of use. We must consider what the current process is in regard to the foreshore licence application. When is a decision likely to be made on that even if it will be conditional on planning permission or will that decision run parallel to the planning process? It is important that we would know the likely schedule. Is the Minister indicating that he may grant the licence, conditional on planning permission, regardless of the timeframe involved? </P>

      <P>The gas field discovered off County Mayo, the Corrib field, has not yet been declared commercial; further appraisal drilling will be undertaken this year and Enterprise Oil hope to be in a position to decide on commerciality in December this year. Should the results of this appraisal drilling enable the company to establish that the field is commercial then it will be the duty of Enterprise Oil to apply forthwith for a petroleum lease with a view to its development. Within two years of the issue of a petroleum lease the lessee is obliged to submit a plan of development for the field for my approval.</P>
      <P>It is required in such plan of development that details be provided on the design, siting construction, establishment, operation, abandonment and removal of facilities, including the export pipeline from the field to the onshore terminal, for the production, processing, storage or shipment of petroleum produced. Any transmission pipeline downstream of the onshore terminal does not form part of the development and is therefore not subject to my approval, being a matter for the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>Pending completion of the appraisal programme a decision has not been taken on an upstream pipeline location but in the expectation that the further appraisal will be successful Enterprise Oil have in the meantime a conceptual development plan under consideration which includes analysis of a number of different possible pipeline routes and landfall locations. Initial route surveys have been conducted over several possible routes and more are planned for this year.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister accept, <Col N="407" /> particularly given his reply to Question No. 1 in which he stated that it is estimated that there is one trillion or possibly 1.3 trillion cubic metres of gas in this location, that this represents exciting economic news for Mayo and the west? His predecessor has had dialogue with the company and I am sure the Minister will shortly do so. It should be pointed out to them that from the point of view of proximity and the amenability of terrain the obvious place to bring the pipe ashore is somewhere along the Mayo coastline, either at Achill or Blacksod.</P>
      <P>As regards projections and the future development of the gas field, does the Government plan to have talks with the company with a view to providing spur lines from the main line to provide a gas supply to towns along the route of or adjacent to the pipeline?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would caution against becoming euphoric about a find which has yet to be proved commercial. That will only be decided by the drilling of an appraisal well this April when the company will be in a position to establish the commerciality or otherwise of the find. It is for the company to decide on the structural arrangements for taking gas ashore should it be successful. I had discussions last weekend with John McGoldrick, the chief executive of the company, who will make an announcement shortly, which is a matter for him. I am anxious that the landfall point would be in County Mayo, which is obvious, it being the closest point to the Corrib field. If I can influence the company in that direction, I will be happy to do so. Pipelines, spurs etc. is a matter for the Minister for Public Enterprise. However, like Deputy Kenny, as a Deputy representing the west, I am obviously keen to ensure it benefits from natural gas.</P>

      <P>Events have moved beyond the information given in the Minister's reply. This licence was granted under the frontier round and the company expects the appraisal well being drilled in April to be commercial. So that everyone will benefit from the gas find, will the Minister liaise with the Minister for Public Enterprise to form a considered, structured and co-operative response from the various organisations, including the ADMs, local authorities and the Western Development Commission? Perhaps the Minister does not have the information with him, but can he tell me what areas outside the Corrib field are not licensed? If this field is deemed commercial, will the Minister change licence conditions or will there be State involvement in any future licensing round? Regarding what Deputy Higgins said, will the Minister liaise with the Minister for Public Enterprise to discuss if Bord Gais will revise its proposal for a national grid which leaves nothing west or north of Athlone? The proposal for a <Col N="408" /> Northern Ireland interconnector will have an effect on everyone concerned.</P>

Clearly there will be a major change in tactics if this find is commercial. There is gas off the west of Ireland. We will carefully analyse how we can best serve the west. The commercial reality is that Dublin is the marketplace for gas and is a desirable location for any company. However, strategically we will try to ensure in our negotiations with the company that the west has the best possible service.</P>

        <b>:</b> I know matters have not been finalised but there is reasonable confidence regarding the prospects of this find. However, in the context of future development plans, is the Government prepared to consider the establishment of a gas fired electricity generating station because from the next couple of weeks, 28% of the electricity supply will be provided by private sources? It is assumed that some peat fire stations will be closed. Given that there is a peat fire station in this location, in Bellacorick, will the Government consider, in the light of a huge deficit in electricity supply in this region, the establishment of a gas fired generating station using gas from the Corrib field? This would seem to be the sensible thing to do.</P>

      <P>Before the debate adjourned, I said I welcome section 12 (15) which provides that if a development plan is not made within two years, the manager would adopt the amended plan.</P>
      <P>I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister my experience prior to and during my membership of Dublin County Council where the first development plan was laid before the members in 1972, the revision commenced in 1977 and it was eventually completed in 1983, a period of six years. During my period as a member of that local authority, the review of the development plan commenced in 1988 and was completed in 1993, a period of five years. That was a very large local authority which has since been broken up into three smaller and more relevant local authorities. It is unbelievable that the review process of a development plan would have taken 11 years, therefore I welcome the fact that the Minister proposes in this legislation a two year period for dealing with this process. I would like the Minister to refer to the Athy case, which deemed that any representations made, regardless of whether a motion was tabled, would have to be considered by the members. This would slow up the review of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 15 refers to the development plan achieving its objectives. I was involved in one review of a development plan and when we looked at what had been laid down in the previous development plan review &ndash;  those of us who were new members at the time had lofty ideas for our areas &ndash; we discovered that these objectives were enshrined in the previous development plan. However, the objectives had not been achieved and the manager simply rewrote them into the plan. I do not know how we can ensure that objectives are achieved but it <Col N="410" /> seems they can be repeated year after year. If finance is available, they can become a reality and, if it is not available, nothing happens.</P>
    <P>Section 19 refers to area action plans. We had area action plans when I was a member of Dublin County Council. I am now a member of the corporation and I am not sure if these plans exist. I am not sure if the stipulation that these must be made within a two year period is achievable given the volume of work in the eastern region. It would be difficult for planning staff and council staff to ensure area action plans are completed within two years of the date of the adoption of the plan.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan referred to regional planning guidelines and development plans. He mentioned he was a member of a regional authority. It was thought at the time that they would be a good idea. I know nothing about how they work, despite the fact that I am currently a member of the corporation and a former member of Dublin County Council. The Deputy said they were just talking shops. It is time we addressed this issue. I do not know whether they are achieving anything or are managing to harmonise or regulate development in the eastern region. Perhaps they work better in other areas.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on record that in stating objectives local authorities must provide for a number of things. One is the provision of accommodation for travellers and the use of particular areas for this purpose. This is an area where most local authority members have been found to be very lacking. On becoming a member of a local authority in 1985, I said to the then Minister for the Environment &ndash; I have said it since to his predecessors, including the current Minister &ndash; that some sanction should be applied to local authorities which do not provide for traveller accommodation in their areas. This happens in the area of housing whereby if an allocation is not used, it is lost. This should also apply to the provision of accommodation for travellers. This issue is always long-fingered and needs to be dealt with given the leap in house prices. In the meantime, more and more travellers are ending up on the side of the road. The Minister should consider placing sanctions on local authorities which do not live up to their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Section 34 seems to be a new section. Under the 1955 Act, the manager has the right to bring forward material contravention. It is proposed that if a resolution referred to in subsection (4) is duly passed, the manager shall decide to grant the relevant permission. I presume &ldquo;shall&rdquo; means he must. There may be a slight change to that. The change to section 4 of the 1955 Act, which required that three quarters of the members had to be present when voting in favour, also required, where the material contravention was being brought forward by members as distinct from the manager, that it had to be three quarters of the members from the local ward. I do not see that in this section, therefore I wonder can a material contravention now be brought forward <Col N="411" /> by any member of a local authority in any ward or council administrative area.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the provisions in section 34(11). This provides for the first time that a local authority can take into account the track record of a developer or applicant. Deputy Broughan said this was not as strong as the proposed Labour Party Bill. However, it gives a local authority the right to refuse to grant planning permission where an applicant has failed to comply with previous planning permission. There could be a difficulty with, say, Marian McGennis, Building Contractors, putting in an application, not complying with the conditions laid down and simply re-applying as MMcG. Will the local authority be able to enforce the provisions of this section where a company changes its name? Can the company's track record be followed up? If so, this is a worthwhile provision. The section also proposes that where an applicant has not complied, he or she will not have the right of appeal.</P>
    <P>There is mention of acquisition for open space and land for housing is also dealt with. Section 47 refers to financial contributions. This posed a difficulty for local authority managers who found themselves in court on a regular basis with developers who would not complete estates. Very often cases were settled on the steps of the courthouse. My experience as a member of a local authority was that this resulted in absolute misery for people who lived in estates built by these people. Does the financial contribution requirement replace a bond and make access to the courts easier? I am concerned that we should not do away with the bond requirement.</P>
    <P>I have little or nothing to say about An Bord Pleanála. I must admit that I did not go through this in any great detail because I find it difficult to figure out how the board reaches its decisions. In some instances where the local authority, for good reasons, refuses planning permission, the board then seems to grant it for the oddest of reasons.</P>
    <P>Something must be done to make affordable housing available for those who cannot provide housing for themselves and those who are trying to buy their first house. I am not sure if the 20% allocation will work. I believe that builders will pass on the cost to those buying in the higher price bracket.</P>
    <P>I know this development because it was in Dublin County Council's administrative area and the land was bought at a particular price at a particular time. In 1995 the houses cost £65,000, in 1996 £69,000, in 1997 £95,000 and in 1998 £120,000. In July 1999 they cost £135,000 and this year they cost £160,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin West</i>)<b>:</b> The explanatory memorandum states that one of the effects of the Bill will be to facilitate maximum participation in the planning process. Unfortunately, the Bill includes provisions which have the opposite effect. Many aspects of the Bill are welcome, but I must dwell on the provisions which are wrong and need to be corrected.</P>
      <P>A number of key measures do not facilitate maximum participation in the planning process. They restrict the existing rights of citizens to have an input into planning matters. Section 33(2)(<i>c</i>), which provides for a prescribed fee which shall be levied by a local authority on anybody or any group making an observation on a planning application, is regressive in the extreme in terms of the rights of citizens. The interests of individuals and residents associations are often seriously affected by planning applications. In the context of natural justice, they should have the right, without being penalised, to make their views known to the planning authority on the implications for them of a particular proposed development.</P>
      <P>Aside from the new fee to make an observation on a planning application, it is already costly for individuals and residents groups to put together observations, recommendations and perhaps objections to a particular proposal. They sometimes have to pay fees to people with expertise in planning issues. They spend time and sometimes money drawing up their observations and submitting them. The Minister's proposal that there should be a fee, which is unspecified, is totally unjust.</P>
      <P>We do not know the amount of the fee and I am concerned about what I detect from Government and business sources as a certain tendency to want to railroad the planning process in such a way that the rights of people are severely curtailed. Various arguments are advanced for this and it would then be possible to pitch the prescribed fee at a level which would be prohibitive for people to make observations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl don Aire go bhfuilim go mór in aghaidh an rud seo atá curtha isteach aige sa Bhille seo, sé sin go mbeadh ar dhaoine agus ar eagraíochtaí an phobail táille a íoc anois chun an dearchadh atá acu a léiriú ar iarratais ar chead pleanála. Cuireann seo isteach go mór ar an cheart ba chóir a bheith ag gach duine agus ag gach eagraíocht phobail sa tír. Ba chóir go mbeadh an ceart acu a ndearchadh a léiriú don údarás áitiúil gan táille a íoc. Cuireann seo isteach ar cheart daonlathach na ndaoine ó thaobh an <Col N="413" /> méid atá á phleanáil ag comhlachtaí agus ag daoine eile don áit ina bhfuil comhnaí orthu.</P>
    <P>Section 36(1) restricts the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála to individuals or groups who have made an initial submission at the planning application stage to the local authority. This is an appalling restriction and entirely unjustified. The explanatory memorandum states that one of the effects of the Bill will be to facilitate maximum participation in the planning process. However, this measure is directly counter to that and may severely inhibit proper participation by people.</P>
    <P>I have been a county councillor for almost ten years and I am aware that on occasions residents or residents associations do not hear about an application that could have severe ramifications for them until planning permission has been granted. The Bill will now deny them the fall back position of being able to make an objection to An Bord Pleanála. There are also cases where applications for projects which could have national significance in terms of planning, the environment or other aspects may only become known after the planning authority has given permission for them. To deny non-governmental organisations or individual citizens the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála is regressive. The Minister must explain himself in this regard and I hope the provision will be dropped on Committee Stage or on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin, sé an rud gur mhaith liom a rá i dtaobh alt 36(1)(a) ná nach gcuirfear bac ar dhaoine nó ar ghrúpaí achomhairc a dhéanamh chuig An Bord Pleanála mar nach raibh aon ní istigh acu nuair a bhí an chéad chuid den iarratas pleanála ag dul faoi bhráid an údaráis áitiúil. Cuireann sé sin isteach ar cheart dhaonlathach na ndaoine agus ar cheart dhaonlathach eagraíochtaí. Tarlaíonn sé go minic nach mbíonn fhios ag daoine nó ag eagraíochtaí go raibh iarratas éigin istigh agus go raibh cead pleanála tugtha ag an údarás pleanála. Tá súil agam go ngearrfaidh an tAire agus an Rialtas an méid sin amach as an mBille seo níos déanaí.</P>
    <P>Section 48(4)(<i>b</i>), which prohibits application for a judicial review of a grant of permission unless the applicant has a substantial interest in the project is extremely sinister. There is no attempt by the Minister to define what a substantial interest is. This leaves the interpretation open to the courts and many of us fear that &ldquo;substantial interest&rdquo; would be interpreted by the court as a property interest. That view could be taken of this section and it would severely limit what is regarded as a democratic right by every citizen to appeal to the courts. Unfortunately, the right to appeal to the courts is already severely inhibited for many people by virtue of the inordinate costs of actions coming before the High Court or Supreme Court. There are examples of individuals and groups who have gone to the higher courts on planning matters and who have had to risk substantial amounts of finance to do so. Some people have had to make pledges to underwrite costs if they were awarded against them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> People and organisations do not go the courts lightly, but to insert provisions in the Bill that bar people from seeking a judicial review is very regressive and there is no defence for it. The Minister is obliged to explain in detail what he or his Department meant by &ldquo;substantial interest&rdquo;. For example, there is now a rash of applications for major incinerators to burn waste. Communities near these proposed incinerators &ndash; and those further away &ndash; are concerned by these developments because of justified health fears about what may be put into the atmosphere. In the event of a property-based interpretation of &ldquo;substantial interest&rdquo;, an adjacent community or voluntary group with a particular brief to look out for the environment could find, even if they felt they had a legal basis to go to a judicial review, that they were prohibited from so doing. The Minister must explain this matter.</P>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin, deireann alt 48(<i>4</i>)(<i>b</i>) go gcaithfeadh &ldquo;leas substainteach&rdquo; a bheith ag duine nó eagraíocht sular féidir leo dul os comhair cúirte. Tá sin ag dul siar i bhfad ó thaobh cearta daonlathacha daoine agus grúpaí pobail nó timpeallachta. Ba cheart nach mbeadh aon cheist ann faoi cheart daoine dul os comhair cúirte uachtaraigh dá gceapfadh siad go gcaithfeadh siad é sin a dhéanamh chun ceart a bhaint amach. Caithfidh an tAire míniú a thabhairt faoi cad is brí le &ldquo;leas substainteach&rdquo; agus caithfidh sé a rá go cruinn cad tá i gceist.</P>
    <P>Section 84(<i>c</i>) has been the subject of much comment and media coverage. It provides that 20% of land zoned for residential use be set aside for affordable housing at the cost for land before the zoning took place. I fully support this section, but it is a pathetic, limp, half-hearted and unconvincing attempt to make up for the gross failure of this and previous Governments to take on the real problem in this regard. That is the untrammelled right that has been given to speculators and developers to inflate building land prices outrageously and thereby create a situation where housing is now out of the reach of hundreds of thousands of ordinary working people. It is an incredible scandal that four years ago a worker on the average wage could purchase a home, which I regard as one of the basic, fundamental human rights. A mere four years later that is now impossible because a cabal of speculators, developers and construction bosses were allowed to profiteer outrageously in land and housing without any meaningful measures being taken against them.</P>
    <P>The major political parties have constantly yielded to the development, speculator and building lobbies. That has had severe implications for the rights of ordinary people. Instead of this provision, why did the Government not tackle this problem head on and bring in some of the measures discussed as long ago as 1973 in the Kenny report? Justice Kenny of the High Court &ndash; not a raving Bolshevik by any means &ndash; laid out provisions by which the price of building land could be controlled having regard to the rights of all citizens. Action could have been taken as long <Col N="415" /> ago as that, but no Government has had the courage or political will to take on these lobbies on behalf of ordinary people who are suffering so much from speculation and profiteering. On a number of occasions the Constitution has been raised as a barrier to taking land out of the control of these people and putting it under the control of a local authority, where it could be let out at fixed prices in one form or another. If the Minister, under this section, can provide for the limited control envisaged regarding the price of building land, the same principle should apply to a more general provision to stop speculation in its tracks.</P>
    <P>Facilitating maximum participation in the planning process is a laudable aim, but the Abbotstown project intimately affects the area I represent here and on Fingal County Council.</P>
    <P>The way in which the Government has proceeded by way of consultation and participation does not give me confidence in its bona fides<i>.</i> It is incredible that the Pricewaterhouse report, on which it based the sports stadium, advocates the rezoning of 275 acres for residential and commercial purposes in what was to be, and was seen by the planners, including elected Members to be an essential green break between the massive built up areas of Blanchardstown and Finglas. What is not said outright but is implied in the Pricewaterhouse report is that that area could be rezoned, thus breaking the green area, and sold for up to £80 million. In other words, the State is becoming a speculator in building land, presumably to assist the financing of the stadium envisaged. That does not give me any cause for confidence in the goodwill of the Government in regard to participation because nobody so far in greater Blanchardstown or Finglas has been consulted about that provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on achieving yet another of his objectives. When he took over in the Department of the Environment and Local Government he indicted that one of his objectives was to address the planning and development issue. He has done so in a relatively short period. We all welcome any measure intended to consolidate Acts. The purpose of this Bill is to consolidate Acts and provide for the proper planning and sustainable development of all areas. It is long and complex. I welcome the Minister's open approach inviting constructive debate and submissions to help improve the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the principle that the local authority development plan will continue to be central to the planning and development process and that there will be a defined role for local area plans and regional development guidelines. I support the provisions for the co-ordination of development plans of a region but, in particular, that the development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of that development plan. The statutory recognition of local area plans will give the neces<Col N="416" /> sary impetus to such plans and the planning authority and An Bord Pleanála will have regard to the local area plan when making planning decisions. I congratulate those who have been successful in bringing forward local area plans. A number of activists in my constituency have been successful in bringing forward plans which were adopted by the city council.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the role of the local authority of which I am a member, Dublin Corporation. I pay tribute to and applaud the good work being carried out by Dublin Corporation planners. While it is dangerous to name people it is important to acknowledge the role of the city manager, John Fitzgerald, the principal officers of the planning department, Christy Geoghegan and Gerry Folan, the development officer, Vincent Norton, and planners such as John Murphy and others who are very involved in such development plans. I thank them for their support and encouragement to members of the council, local activists and community groups alike to put together area plans.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the Eastern Health Board I had the pleasure today to participate in the Darndale-Belcamp local plan devised by Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board with an input from a large number of community groups, individual community activists and individuals in the communities. The Eastern Health Board is investing £1.7 million in a village centre health centre, catering for day, family, nursery and other needs. This project was promoted and prompted by the local community, the initial stages of which came to fruition today. This shows the commitment of the two statutory authorities in the area, Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board. Following the required prompting by the local community and other activities the commitment to proceed was there.</P>
    <P>I support the provision whereby the local authority manager is required to undertake widespread public consultation when preparing draft development plans and to report to local elected members. The only way forward, a theme used by my party for some time, is through partnership.</P>
    <P>The long-term strategic framework and the regional planning guidelines should be hugely helpful in achieving balanced development. I understand the regional planning guidelines will cover issues such as population trends, housing strategy, location of developments, transport, waste and the protection of the environment. The Bill provides for greater emphasis on pre-planning issues and puts in place a tiered structure in the decision-making process.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms that I and most Members have come across is the current planning process. This criticism can come from an applicant, an objector, a speculator, an investor. For all, the current planning and appeal process seems to be a difficult process with no certainty or any regard for important matters such as the local development plan.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the Joint Committee on <Col N="417" /> Enterprise and Small Business I am deeply concerned at the current difficult planning process which with current planning regulations, extensions of time and appeals to An Bord Pleanála can create many difficulties for project sponsors. Due to such difficulties some projects are lost or reduced. That is not in the best interest of our communities or society.</P>
    <P>On the domestic front I do not agree with some of the proposed changes particularly the proposal that people exercising their right to make a submission on a planning application will have to pay a fee and that the right to appeal will be restricted to the applicants and those who made a submission to the planning authority on the original application. As a member of and having been involved in a local authority over a number of years and representing Clontarf at Dublin City council level and Dublin North-Central I have come across many people who need guidance when making a legitimate objection to a planning application. Through our offices they may receive that guidance. I know from a number of those people that the imposition of a fee would result in great hardship if they were to lodge an objection.</P>
    <P>There should be some leeway or consideration for them. Perhaps they could obtain the fee from the local supplementary welfare officer if they could prove to him that they were not in a position to pay it, or perhaps they would not have to pay it if they were in receipt of an adjudicated benefit, such as a medical card. A person living on a restricted income, be it a pension or social welfare income, or receiving a benefit from the State should not be required to pay a fee when exercising his or her legitimate right to object to a planning application.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to find a mechanism that addresses both this issue and the one where a person fails to make an objection on the original application to the local authority which is then appealed by either party to An Bord Pleanála. If a person wishes to contribute to this process but was not privy to the planning application for whatever reason &ndash; he may have been out of the country &ndash; a way should be found to accommodate him. I look forward to the Minister's proposals on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal to strengthen enforcement and the placing of a greater onus on local authorities to follow up complaints about breaches of planning matters is welcome. I ask him to elaborate on his views on the possibility that developers may be financially penalised in connection with unauthorised development and on the proposal to increase fees for retention on unauthorised developments. The latter aspect is straightforward. Many people probably take the view that it is pragmatic and logical to have different sets of fees. Those who proceed in the normal manner should pay the stipulated fee while those who proceed in the absence of going through the normal procedure should pay another set of fees.</P>
    <P>In this regard what does the Minister mean by <Col N="418" />&ldquo;developers&ldquo;? Is it the owner of the property, the person who requested the work to be carried out or the builder? Could it be the subcontractor, architect or engineer? Who exactly could be financially penalised?</P>
    <P>I support the ethos underlying the proposal. For example, an enforcement officer may find that a legitimate or illegitimate builder is involved in an unauthorised development. He should be penalised, and this should include cutting off the supply. Some builders get these jobs through architects or other contacts. It is a simple matter to check on because they will check with plans and specifications and would be <i>au fait</i> with the procedures. Given this, it is not unreasonable to expect them to ensure that their project complied with appropriate planning procedures.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes similar measures against those who are contracted to complete an estate but who leave either the local authority or the residents to finish outstanding work. I welcome this because I have had direct experience of the hardship caused in such circumstances. I ask him to elaborate on this proposal.</P>
    <P>Many tradespeople undertake work in occupied houses, some of which is illegal but if they were aware that there was a penalty clause if they carried out such activities they might not proceed. It may also mean that the householder will have to proceed through the proper channels, but at least this would ensure that misleading figures and values do not get in the way of a fair assessment of supplies &ndash; such as electricity &ndash; to an area. For example, a dishwasher or washing machine could be wrongly connected to the main supply of the house. A person engaged to effect that type of connection will take the nearest lead, but the imposition of penalties which cut off the supplies would act as a deterrent.</P>
    <P>The social housing proposal has caused the most controversy. The Minister has made a genuine effort to address the relevant issues associated with the provision of houses. Part V proposes to fully integrate housing supply into the planning system. The local authority development plan must provide for housing for the present and future population and must ensure that adequate land is zoned for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Everybody must support these provisions because they will lead to increases in the housing supply in the short-term and in the long-term they will ensure that there are sufficient houses at affordable prices to meet demand. They will also encourage social integration. The favourable changes in the economy are fuelling increases in land prices, material costs, contract and labour costs, together with onerous increases in development levies, other levies and charges. All these issues are component parts of the current crises in house prices.</P>
    <P>It is very easy, as the previous speaker has done, to cherry pick the marketplace and blame one sector or group who appear to be creaming it. Those of us who have had the opportunity to engage in lengthy debate with people in the mar<Col N="419" /> ketplace have been told that even if they bought land at low cost four years ago, the land they are buying today has risen in value to today's prices.</P>
    <P>I welcome the formal submission on the Bill by the Irish Home Builders' Association to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government. It supports the main thrust of the Bill. I acknowledge its concerns about certain aspects, especially on section 82, as amended, which it says is unworkable, inappropriate and will cause an adverse impact on the overall housing market. I have a high regard for the IHBA. It has its finger on the pulse of the house market. I only received its submission before I attended the Chamber. It outlines alternatives to the Minister's proposals. I am not sure if he has received the document, which is dated February 2000.</P>
    <P>I look forward to these issues being teased out further in the debate on this Bill. Together with the participants in the housing market we can work to achieve social and affordable housing. Page 6 of the IHBA submission refers to the shared ownership issue. People born and reared in Dublin who wish to reside in their own area find it very difficult to do so. I have come across many people in my constituency of Dublin North-Central who find it impossible to purchase a new house and avail of the first time buyers grant and other such benefits.</P>
    <P>If they purchase a previously occupied house they have no grants but rather additional charges such as stamp duty etc. I have communicated with the Department on the issue and given it statistics showing that the price of new houses bought by first time buyers averaged £96,000 nationally and £125,980 in Dublin, compared with average prices of £122,048 and £156,967. This endorses the case for Dublin. I ask the Minister to increase the shared ownership cap for Dublin to give it special recognition because of house prices in the Dublin area, and to delete the charges on previously owned houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill introduces a number of substantial changes and is intended to accelerate the processing of planning applications, which must be welcomed. Another major feature is the restriction on the rights of objectors. This will mean that An Bord Pleanála will not entertain third party appeals unless the people making them first make their objections known to the local authority and have paid the fee of £20. I understand what the Minister is attempting to do in this regard, including the financing of additional paper work. However, wide-ranging doubts have been expressed about the constitutionality of the removal of the appeals by third parties. For example, a person affected by a proposed development could be on holidays or ill and would fail to see the site notice or announcement in the newspaper. A site notice is supposed to be in place for a statutory period of one month, but invariably when we complain to planners <Col N="420" /> about notices not having been posted, they will say they were unable to visit the site within the month and had no evidence that it was not in place. People who have not made an appeal at the planning stage cannot, therefore, appeal to An Bord Pleanála due to factors outside their control. This is not just unfortunate for the people involved but removes their constitutional right.</P>
      <P>I have difficulty with the prospect of a fee for making observations or submitting objections to planning applications in terms of the principle and the practice. The applicant, not the objector, proposes to change the <i>status quo</i>. For example, somebody might propose building a workshop across the road from a householder who is happy and enjoying his property, perhaps interfering with the natural light of the existing house. Naturally, the householder will be concerned and will want to make an observation to the planning authority about it. Why should somebody with serious concerns about the continued enjoyment of their property have to pay a fee to object or make a submission? We have the usual concerns about introducing a fee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to respond to this matter. We are within days of a dispute which threatens to deprive Dublin and surrounding areas of a bus service. It is imperative that the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, intervene to try to avert the threatened strike of Dublin Bus employees which is due to start next Tuesday. The withdrawal of almost 1,000 buses serving over 130 routes will create real hardship for those who rely on public transport and will be a real setback for Dublin Bus. For most people in Dublin and many of the neighbouring parts of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, there is no alternative form of public transport, and the withdrawal of bus transport and the bus services will leave huge numbers of commuters unable even to travel to work.</P>
      <P>During the 1970s and 1980s the image of public transport suffered greatly from repeated industrial disputes. In recent years it has managed to remain largely strike free and with the introduction of additional vehicles and welcome innovations like the quality bus corridors, confidence in public transport is recovering and more and more commuters are using buses. Against this background a strike would be a serious setback.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also public safety aspects to such a dispute. The likelihood is that many of those who normally use buses but who might live within walking range of DART or commuter train lines <Col N="421" /> will try to crowd into already overcrowded carriages. Overcrowding on DART and rail lines already constitutes a serious safety hazard. Thousands of extra people trying to crowd on provide a recipe for disaster.</P>
    <P>While the strike next week is planned for only one day, the unions have made it clear that unless the dispute is settled it will gradually escalate action with a two day strike the following week and three days the week after, until all-out action is reached by the middle of next month. Every effort must be made to avoid this dispute and the relevant Ministers must act now, not at the end of a crippling dispute.</P>
    <P>Driving large buses in Dublin traffic conditions is a demanding and stressful occupation and this should be reflected in the wage structure. A basic starting scale of £207 per week, which is only about £30 more than the statutory minimum wage that will apply from 1 April, going up to £273, does not reflect this and indeed it is clear that part of the reason for this dispute is that bus workers do not believe the work they do is reflected in the current wage scales.</P>
    <P>The claim at the centre of this dispute was first lodged in August of last year. Strike notice has already been served twice and deferred twice. The NBRU, which has served strike notice, is in a difficult situation in that it is told that its claims are outside the terms of national agreements. However, the NBRU is not a member of ICTU and is not a party to national agreements.</P>
    <P>There is also anger among bus workers at the role played by the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke. The Minister promised that if certain productivity changes were agreed from 1 January 1999, public service contracts would be guaranteed for Dublin Bus which would improve the position of the company and provide job security. Workers also believe that the culture of low pay in the company arises from the very low subsidy received from the Exchequer, one of the lowest for any public transport system for a European city of comparable size.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the two sides get back to the negotiating table as soon as possible. The union has said it is available for talks 24 hours a day. Management has said that it will not be available until next Monday and will only talk then if the strike is called off. It has threatened to refuse to negotiate if the dispute starts. This sort of approach is not helpful. Some gesture from management is required. A recognition that drivers are not adequately remunerated for the work they do would be a start. Some realistic offer from management would help.</P>
    <P>We urge the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, who has responsibility for public transport, and the Minister, Deputy Harney, who has responsibility for labour relations, to intervene to secure the re-opening of talks between unions and management with a view to averting this potentially disastrous strike. I know that Ministers are particularly reluctant to intervene in industrial disputes, but there are plenty of precedents for this and <Col N="422" /> there are cases where the impact on the public is such that intervention is justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter and I am glad to reply to it. The Ministers and Members of the Opposition are aware of the facts, but I wish to say some important things. The National Bus and Rail Union, which represents approximately 1,200 bus drivers, has served strike notice for Tuesday, 15 February, on Bus Átha Cliath. The one day strike on Tuesday will be followed by a two day strike the following week and then a three day, four day and all out strike in succeeding weeks. I understand that SIPTU, which represents the remaining 900 drivers, is to consider the situation tomorrow. The dispute has its origins in a pay claim by NBRU for a 20% increase in basic pay for bus drivers. NBRU originally served strike notice in support of the claim in September 1999. SIPTU also served strike notice at the time, but did not quantify the amount of the claim. NBRU is seeking an increase in basic pay for all drivers to £330 per week. The current basic for most drivers is £273 per week with new recruits entering at a lower rate. It is estimated that the cost of the drivers' claim would be approximately £8 million.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court considered the dispute on 28 September 1999 and issued a recommendation on 11 October 1999, which found the claim to be in breach of Partnership 2000. I take the Deputy's point that NBRU is not a party to the agreement. However, the court recommended that an independent third party carry out an investigation of a range of issues on which there was a wide disparity between the parties on the factual position, including pay and conditions, pensions, the effect of State subvention, comparisons with other driver groups, current working practices and methods of payment. The court recommended that the third party report should be used as a basis for further negotiations.</P>
      <P>The company agreed to the appointment of the independent third party nominated by the unions and his report was submitted to both parties on 31 January 2000. The third party concluded that the current pay claim would place the future viability of Bus Átha Cliath in jeopardy, if conceded in isolation. However, it also said that some inflexibility still exist in work practices within the company and there are significant opportunities for cost savings, which could form the basis of a productivity deal to address the basic pay issue in a meaningful way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, NBRU having considered the report, said that it did not agree with it and served strike notice on Friday last, commencing with the planned one day stoppage next Tuesday. Bus Átha Cliath management met both SIPTU and the NBRU yesterday afternoon &ndash; the Deputy was wrong about that &ndash; in an effort to avert strike action. The company agreed that there was room for further negotiation on the issue of basic pay for the drivers, based on the finding of the <Col N="423" /> third party report. It offered to commence proper negotiations on Monday within an agreed timeframe on condition that the strike notice was withdrawn. The company also indicated that it was prepared to agree to an independent chairman from the LRC for these talks.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, NBRU is reluctant to wait until Monday to negotiate and is seeking a substantial offer from the company by Monday evening. SIPTU members were agreeable to enter negotiations and have invited the independent third party to a meeting tomorrow to discuss his findings. As the House will appreciate from the list of items raised in the independent review, this is complex. The review which followed the Labour Court recommendation is less than two weeks old and the company has offered to enter negotiations starting next week.</P>
    <P>The entire matter must also be seen in the context of the very significant pay and taxation package that is set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which was agreed earlier this week.  I recognise against that NBRU is not a party to that. In the circumstances I do not believe there is any justification for a strike with all the inconvenience that would create for commuters. I will monitor developments over the next few days.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court recommendation was quite clear. The report of the third party was to be used as the basis for future negotiations. I call on the parties to respect that recommendation because there is a sufficient basis in the third party report to provide a framework for negotiations.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing to return to this extraordinary case. On 29 June 1999 I informed the House that I had been involved as chairman of the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace in the Birmingham Six, Guildford Four and Maguire Seven cases and a variety of other cases involving extraordinary injustice to individuals, but I have never come across a case such as this where there has been so much indifference among public institutions to the fate of a child and the well-being of a family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This case is truly tragic. The family involved was in difficulties and it sought assistance from the Eastern Health Board. On 29 June I outlined the circumstances in which a child was taken from the family amid scenes of brutality. The situation <Col N="424" /> was so bad that in his reply the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children stated:</P>
    <P>This case bothers me more than any other which has come to may attention in two years as Minister of State.I have failed to get the information I require from the Eastern Health Board. Based on Deputy Roche's information over the past six months and a meeting I had with the family, I am deeply concerned with the way in which the family has been treated by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>Grave injustice was the order of the day last June but now a child and its family are in limbo because of the EHB's activities. I appeal to the Minister of State to take effective action to bring this quite scandalous state of affairs to an end.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the EHB cares for children is well chronicled in the telephone records that have been kept by the family concerned over Christmas. The five year old child was abandoned on her parent's doorstep on Christmas Eve. The previous week the EHB agreed that the child would have a seven hour visit to the family home. When the child was left with the family on Christmas Eve, no contact number was provided or arrangements made for her return. On St. Stephen's Day, the family, fearful that it would fall foul of the health board yet again, contacted the emergency services, me and the Garda but it could not get a contact number for the EHB. Over the next few days there was continued frenzied activity by the family as it tried to find out where exactly it stood with regard to the child.</P>
    <P>In addition to the child, three other children in the family were deeply distressed throughout Christmas as a result of the activities of officials whom this State has put in charge of the welfare of children. There is more than enough room in this case for a criminal investigation. Finally, after a great deal of confusion, the child, still supposedly in the care of the health board, was left with the family. The family have been trying to bring finality to this issue. I ask the Minister of State to do so. A child cannot be treated in this way, nor can a family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing time on this issue. Some of Deputy Roche's information differs from that which I obtained from one of the public institutions but I was surprised that the former Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, on 29 June 1999 stated &ldquo;I have failed to get information I require from the Eastern Health Board&rdquo;. He then referred to the Child Care Act, 1991. When this case was brought to my attention by my colleagues in the EHB and Deputy Roche, who expressed genuine concern about it, I tried to make inquiries but found that I was unable to obtain the required information. Deputy Roche referred to the indifference of the public institutions charged with implementing the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the new Minister of State at the <Col N="425" /> Department of Health and Children on her appointment.</P>
    <P>A mechanism must be found, however, to ensure that the required information in cases such as this one, which has troubled me along with many others, is made available to an elected public representative, the Minister or Minister of State of the day, or a member of the public. It is totally unsatisfactory that a person wanting to get basic information comes up against a brick wall. I do not know what amendments are required but I ask the Minister of State to make the necessary amendments to the Child Care Act so that this will never happen again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Roche and Deputy Callely for raising this matter. The Deputies will appreciate that under the Child Care Act, 1991, the provision of services to individual children is a matter for the health board concerned. The Oireachtas has established health boards on a statutory basis and has given them statutory powers while reserving others for the Minister of the day.</P>
      <P>Deputy Roche and Deputy Callely are well aware that the child in question is under a care order and is the subject of ongoing judicial proceedings. As these cases are heard <i>in camera</i>, all the parties are constrained in what they can say but I understand that in this particular case the judge has specifically told the parties to refrain from public comment.</P>
      <P>This matter was raised previously by Deputy Roche on 29 June last and following the Adjournment Debate on that occasion, my predecessor sought legal advice from the Attorney General on his powers to seek a report from a health board in respect of an individual case and, in particular, on a case which was before the courts under the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
      <P>The advice of the Office of the Attorney General was that a Minister is entitled to seek information from a health board about a particular case if the Minister has come to the view that this knowledge is required, for example, to keep the state of health legislation or of the health services under review and to satisfy himself or herself as to whether legislation needs to be reviewed. That is to say, the Minister can seek a report in a specific case but only for a general purpose. Any report received in this way cannot be used in any other way, including in a reply to matters raised in the House in response to a parliamentary question or in response to an Adjournment Debate. My advice is that to give such information in the House could be seen to be indirectly interfering with the proceedings currently before the court as well as being beyond what is permitted by the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand the importance of allowing a statutory body such as a health board to discharge the functions for which it was established, but I also understand the frustration this can cause for <Col N="426" /> parents in difficult family cases. I very much regret that I am limited in this way.</P>
    <P>It is most unfortunate that there has been such a complete breakdown in communications and trust between the family in this case and the health board concerned. I have no doubt that everybody is acting from the best motives and with the best intentions, and I am sure everyone wants to act in the best interests of the child. I am well aware that Deputy Roche has been concerned with this case for some time and has pursued it vigorously.</P>
    <P>I am aware also that the board has reviewed its handling of this case internally and that it stands over the actions of its professional staff, but I also know that this position is not acceptable to the parents. Bearing in mind what Deputy Roche and Deputy Callely said about the difficulty in their respective capacities of getting information, and my difficulty as a Minister in gaining access to the information and the use of that information, I will consider this case further and see if there is any action which I am in a position to take. In the circumstances I have outlined, however, I do not propose to comment further at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Only a few days into the new year, people around the country were appalled at the vicious butchery of two young men in the so-called canal murders &ndash; young men apparently caught up in the heroin trade murdered, it is suspected, by an individual well known to the Garda and to the community he terrorised in Ballyfermot, an individual attempting to build up his own heroin network in an area with one of the worst heroin scourges in Dublin.</P>
      <P>At a recent commemoration service in Lourdes church in Dublin's north inner city, organised by the city-wide Drugs Crisis Campaign, a young woman from Ballyfermot told me that her area had recorded the highest number of drug-related deaths of all the areas in Dublin represented at that service. With an estimated 1,500 deaths in Ballyfermot, Ballyfermot had 167 more than any other community represented at the service.</P>
      <P>There are five gardaí in the Ballyfermot drug unit and they are supported by two adjoining area drug units. Resources for the gardaí have improved dramatically in this area in recent times. This Garda unit is dedicated, highly professional and effective but it covers an area with one of the greatest concentrations of the drugs problem in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 1998, after months of surveillance and <Col N="427" /> good police work, the Garda arrested and charged an individual, Raymond Duff, with possession for sale and supply of half a kilogramme of pure, high quality heroin, just in from the supply source in Manchester, with a street value of £300,000. The heroin was hidden in the interior wall of the house next door to Ballyfermot Garda station. A large weighing scales was also found. In statements to the gardaí, Duff admitted that he collected and delivered heroin to various locations around Dublin. He was not an addict. Duff was a significant cog in a heroin network run by an individual named Comerford who was recently sentenced to 12 years in jail in Manchester.</P>
    <P>Duff was charged with an offence punishable under the law by life imprisonment. Under the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue's new mandatory sentencing legislation, he would have received a minimum of ten years in prison. To the utter disbelief of gardaí and the horror of the community, he was rewarded with a suspended sentence and set free. This happened within days of the discovery of the canal murder victims in the same area. Not that this individual was involved in those, but what message does that judge's decision send out to the embattled communities, to the dedicated gardaí or even to the young people tempted to enter the drugs trade to make quick, easy money? Surely this case must be urgently brought to the attention of the Director of Public Prosecutions to review the undue leniency involved. I read this week in <i>Magill</i> magazine that this case is only one in a pattern of suspended sentences in recent drugs cases.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the seriousness of questioning in this House the correctness or otherwise of the decisions of any judge, but I believe the matter simply cannot be ignored. I have received correspondence from community groups outraged by this judge's decisions. The suffering communities&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On Tuesday last, over 2,000 people packed themselves into Lourdes church in Sean MacDermott Street in Dublin's north inner city. They were there to commemorate the estimated 1,500 <Col N="428" /> young people who have died from the heroin scourge of the past 20 years. The groups of people came from communities in every working class area of Dublin to represent the young lives lost in their own district. They said that there are now in the region of 15,000 persons in Dublin addicted to heroin, with some 4,000 treatment places and little aftercare and rehabilitation services. The waiting lists for treatment are again on the increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be given this opportunity to address the aspect of the drugs problem in the Dublin area raised by Deputy Gregory. The drugs problem in certain areas of Dublin did not arrive overnight and it cannot be solved overnight. The Deputy is probably more aware of this than most other people. There are no quick and easy solutions to the problem.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, my commitment to dealing with the drugs problem is well documented and I am confident that the Government's policy for dealing with it is working. This policy is unambiguous. It is and will continue to be to tackle the drugs problem on two fronts, supply and demand. Never in the history of the State has the Garda Síochána been better resourced or equipped. Garda strength is rapidly heading towards 12,000, an all time historic high. We are on target for increasing the capacity of the prison system by one-third. Our tough anti-crime policies are yielding the anticipated good results with a further fall of 5% in crime figures last year leading to a cumulative fall of approximately 21% since the Government came into office.</P>
      <P>I make no apologies for my policy of strong legislation backed up by tough enforcement to tackle drug dealing and trafficking. I have put in place the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, which provides for a minimum mandatory ten year prison sentence for persons convicted of dealing in drugs with a value of £10,000 or more. This Act has also introduced a range of new measures designed to prevent the intimidation of witnesses, jurors, those who are assisting the Garda in the investigation of an offence and their families, and provides for a maximum ten year sentence for such offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which I introduced while in Opposition, has been success<Col N="429" /> fully utilised by the Criminal Assets Bureau to deprive those involved in criminal activity from enjoying the benefits of their ill gotten gains. This legislation and the activities of the Criminal Assets Bureau have received much praise both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>On the enforcement side, An Garda Síochána has enjoyed considerable success in its operations both at national and local level. During the period from January 1998 to December 1999 drug seizures amounting to an estimated street value in excess of £120 million were made. In the period January 1998 to September 1999 Garda operations Dóchas, Cleanstreet and Mainstreet, aimed at combating drug dealing at local level, yielded seizures of illicit drugs with an estimated street value in excess of £12 million and resulted in over 15,700 arrests.</P>
    <P>Overall, my policy of strong legislation backed up by tough law enforcement has resulted in record drug seizures, many Irish based drug trafficking organisations being dismantled, major drug barons fleeing abroad and a high percentage of persons who are prosecuted being convicted and sentenced to prison.</P>
    <P>These Garda successes in dealing with the supply of drugs is evidence of the commitment of the Force to tackling the problem. The Garda national drugs unit deploys 50 gardaí under the command of a chief superintendent to deal with the problem at national level. This national deployment is backed up by 116 officers based in local drug units in the Dublin metropolitan region. In addition, there are 27 sergeants and 186 gardaí involved throughout the city on Operation Dóchas. This operation is currently under review in terms of an overall examination of community policing in Dublin. In this context, all Garda operational units are subject to ongoing review by the commissioner and if it is felt that more resources are needed, they will be made available.</P>
    <P>I am aware that enforcement measures alone will not be sufficient to deal with the drugs problem. In this context, the multi-agency partnership approach is the cornerstone of the Government's policy for dealing with the drugs problem at community level. This approach has borne fruit and will continue to be successful. The community and voluntary sectors bring a dynamic to the equation that cannot be replicated by the statutory agencies no matter how involved they are on the ground. This multi-agency partnership approach has given local communities an effective and vital role in dealing with the drugs problem in their own areas.</P>
    <P>I have ensured and will continue to ensure a commitment to the integrated policies which are being implemented under the national drugs strategy through participation in the structures which have been established to co-ordinate this strategy. I am a member of the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and officials from my Department are represented on the interdepartmental group on the national drugs strategy and on the national drugs strategy team. Representation on each of the 14 local drugs task forces, which were established in the areas where the <Col N="430" /> heroin problem is most acute, include an inspector from An Garda Síochána and the local Probation and Welfare Service officer. This level of representation ensures that my Department plays a full role, along with the other agencies involved, in the ongoing development of the national drugs strategy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will agree that tremendous progress has been made through the allocation of funding by the Government under the national drugs strategy and under the young people's facilities and services fund. These resources will make a significant contribution towards dealing with the drugs problem in local communities and towards tackling social exclusion. A sum of £10 million has been allocated on an annual basis to support the implementation of over 200 projects proposed by local drugs task forces in their own areas. In addition a further £15 million over a two year period has been allocated to support the development of new service development plans by the local drugs task forces. The Government has also allocated a sum of £35 million over three years, 1999 to 2001, under the young people's facilities and services fund to assist in the development of preventative strategies, in a targeted manner, through the development of youth, sport and recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drugs problem exists or has the potential to develop.</P>
    <P>On top of this funding, significant amounts are being made available to deal with the issues of social exclusion and disadvantage under the national development plan. In this context, I have secured an additional £16 million of funding under the plan to facilitate a significant expansion of the Garda juvenile diversion programme. I have also secured approximately £70 million for additional crime prevention measures and over £200 million to fund the development of child care provision over 2000 to 2006.</P>
    <P>I believe in these policies and I believe they are working and will continue to work. However, there is no room for complacency and I assure the Deputy of my commitment and that of the Government and the Garda Commissioner to tackling the drugs problem at local level. Our policy of targeting drug dealers at both national and local level will continue relentlessly as will our policy of active participation in the partnership with local communities.</P>
    <P>We know the drugs problem in the Dublin area will not be solved overnight. There are no quick or easy answers. It can only be dealt with by a sustained campaign that tackles both the symptoms and the causes of the problem. Current Government policies are doing this and ultimately they will prove successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter, the position of Kilfinane primary school, roll No. 13026P, in County Limerick. I raised this matter on the Adjournment 11 months ago but it is necessary to raise it again since no progress has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> It was made clear in an Irish National Teachers' Organisation report that facilities in the school are unsatisfactory and have been for years. The school is the base for a remedial teacher who is shared among five schools. Her classroom &ndash; if one could call it that &ndash; is also used as a staff room, library, store room and office. It is also used by a special needs teacher, visiting doctors and nurses and for parent/teacher meetings. The resultant disruption is continuous and not conducive to a learning atmosphere. It renders the teacher's job particularly difficult.</P>
    <P>Four of the classrooms are so small that it is virtually impossible to implement the old curriculum, let alone the revised one. There are no indoor PE facilities, no GP room and no place for children to leave their gear for outdoor games. The staff are enthusiastic to encourage the use of computers but with so little space it is extremely difficult. Toilet facilities for staff are inadequate while the outdoor facilities for children are Dickensian. I doubt that the school building would pass examination by a health and safety authority.</P>
    <P>It is more than three years since representations were first made regarding improvements to the school. The feasibility study carried out clearly shows that a new building is the only viable option. The board of management has earmarked one or two possible sites for the new building. At present, the most prestigious sites in this area are fetching relatively conservative prices. This is just beginning to change. If the go-ahead is given for a new building, it would be cheaper to proceed sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>The staff of the school want what is best for the children of the parish. They also need practical working conditions to enable them to carry out their professional duties to the best of their abilities. They have found themselves frustrated over the years. They have been contacted by the local media when word leaked out that they were seeking some improvements.</P>
    <P>The school is a six teacher rural school with a shared remedial teacher and about 160 pupils attend the school. In January 1998, the board of management applied to the Department of Education and Science for a grant to carry out major structural works and, in 1999, it received a reply stating that, due to restricted site size and falling enrolment trends, classroom extension and conversion would not proceed. A grant was provided for outdoor toilets and a staff room was sanctioned. This was unacceptable and it is now accepted by everyone in the area that a replacement is required.</P>
    <P>The existing building dates back to 1909 and the school is housed in a converted church. It consists of six small classrooms, three of which are only 35 square metres. There is a tiny ancillary room, which is used as a library, and a tiny office and cloakroom. There is also a small central area which can be accessed from the classrooms. There is no staff room and the toilet blocks are situated <Col N="432" /> outdoors. The playing space outdoors is very limited. In addition, three of the classrooms are seven metres by five metres and house classes between 25 and 30 pupils. The partitions between the classrooms are wafer thin, consisting of narrow timber boards or glass, and fail to be soundproof which causes difficulties for teaching and learning. The timber floors have begun to sag in many areas. Due to the building design, ceilings are very high and temperature extremes are common. There is evidence of dry rot and many of the windows can no longer be opened, leading to a lack of adequate ventilation. The playing space is also inadequate for the pupils and drinking water is not available to them. Sinks are provided in only three of the rooms. There is no staff room proper library, principal's office or remedial teacher work base. There is also occasionally evidence of rodent infestation. The Minister should immediately examine the provision of a new school.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Neville for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding additional accommodation for Kilfinane national school. He has painted a very good picture of conditions in the school at present.</P>
      <P>The school has a staffing level of a principal teacher, five assistant teachers and a shared remedial teacher. The school management authorities applied to the Department of Education and Science for additional classroom and ancillary accommodation. The Office of Public Works investigated the matter on behalf of the Department and reported that, due to the restricted nature of the existing site, a certain range of accommodation could be provided. Consultant architects were subsequently engaged to carry out a feasibility study on the various options available and the Department's planning and building unit is considering options for improving the accommodation facilities at the school. I appreciate the concerns of the school authorities in this matter and I assure the House that it is the intention of the Department to provide adequate accommodation for the current and future needs of the school.</P>
      <P>Deputy Neville will appreciate that a large number of school building projects are on hand within the Department. Given the priority the Government has given to reversing the evident neglect of our primary schools, the spending estimates published show primary school building and renovation funding increasing by an unprecedented 186% from the 1997 budget allocation. In addition, we have significantly reduced the burden of fund-raising faced by schools and communities throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I assure Deputy Neville that the application by Kilfinane will be dealt with as quickly as possibly. He will appreciate that, at this early stage, it is not possible to say the extent of the accommodation to be provided.</P>

      <QRef>[3565/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey): The Fisheries Acts provide for severe maximum fines, ranging from £10,000 to £200,000, for conviction on indictment of a sea fisheries offence. Forfeiture of fishing gear and fish on board the vessel is a statutory consequence of conviction in most offences, and the courts are empowered to order forfeiture of gear and catch in other cases. In addition, the courts may order the fishing boat to be confiscated if the offence is judged to be a serious abuse of the rules or if it is a repeat offence within three years of an earlier conviction.</P>
    <P>The penalties to be applied in particular cases are obviously a matter for the courts, taking account of the particular circumstances and the nature and gravity of the offences. The scale of the penalties under the fisheries Acts, combined with strong enforcement on land and at sea, should constitute a real and substantial deterrent to illegal fishing activity. I will keep the current regime under review however to ensure that, from both an enforcement and penalties perspective, it is having the necessary deterrent effect in terms of illegal fishing in our waters.</P>

      <P>The capacity of the Irish fishing fleet, as expressed in gross registered tonnage, increased from 53,049 GRT in 1995 to 56,687 GRT in 1999. The figures for each of the years requested by the Deputy are in a table which I have circulated in the official report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EU regulations now require all fishing fleets to be measured in gross tonnes which is the basis on which legally binding fleet capacity targets are set by the EU for each member state. The necessary readjustments are being carried out to ensure full transparency between the current capacity of the fleet by reference to mandatory GT targets to be achieved by end 2001. The difference between the two units of measurement is that GT calculations include certain enclosed spaces on board which could be exempted under the GRT governing rules. The capacity of a vessel in GT terms is <Col N="434" /> therefore greater than its GRT. As a result the overall capacity of the fleet expressed in GT terms will be higher than the GRT figure.</P>

      <P>Final planting figures for 1999 are not yet available. The estimated outturn for 1999 was 13,000 hectares, of which an estimated 80% was carried out by or on behalf of farmers. The planting targets set in the strategic plan for the forestry sector are 25,000 hectares annually to the year 2000 and 20,000 hectares annually thereafter to the year 2030.</P>
      <P>While the planting levels of recent years are in their own right quite substantial, they show a shortfall on the targets previously, even when one recognises that the targets were extremely challenging ones they have been disappointing. Action is being taken on a number of fronts to increase planting levels further. A key issue is the level of financial incentives. I have already outlined to the Deputy in reply to Priority Question No. 4 the action being taken in this matter. It is the intention to link forestry and REPS more closely in the new rural development plan. Teagasc advisors and REPS planners will ensure that due account is taken of the forestry option in the preparation of REPS plans on behalf of farmers. The IFA is receiving support from the forest service for the promotion of forestry as a result of discussions I had with the IFA last autumn. The processing of grant applications and payments, which has been a cause of legitimate complaint by some applicants, will be improved greatly over the next few months as the new computerised system in the forest service offices in Wexford comes onstream.</P>

      <P>Developing Ireland's vast natural resources is among the greatest challenges facing the country. Our plans for the development of the various natural resources which come within my responsibility are outlined in the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Investment of £938 million has been earmarked for the marine and natural resources sectors, which underlines the Government's commitment to these most valuable indigenous assets. The plan includes unprecedented funding programmes, and will support overall investment well in excess of £1.2 billion in development of these sectors, which are vital for rural and coastal communities. The plan will ensure the benefits of economic prosperity reach all regions.</P>
      <P>Key areas for investment include the seafood industry, £171 million; forestry, £592 million; coastal protection, £35 million; sea ports, £46 million; inland fisheries development, £24 million; marine tourism and leisure, £20 million; and marine and forestry RTDI, minimum £50 million.</P>
      <P>Private investment in oil and gas and mineral exploration and production, carried out with due regard for the environment, will continue to be encouraged through fiscal incentives.</P>

      <P>As outlined in replies to the House on 23 June 1999, 20 October 1999 and 25 November 1999, arising from discussions which my predecessor, Deputy Woods, had with the Irish Offshore Operators Association and SIPTU, he arranged that my Department set up and facilitate discussions between representatives of the Irish Offshore Operators Association, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Offshore Suppliers Association on the utilisation of Irish resources and services in the offshore petroleum industry. These discussions are ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October Deputy Woods met the board of the company referred to by the Deputy and impressed on it our expectations for the use of Irish workers and goods and services in its operations in this country. While exploration and production companies have employed, and continue to employ, Irish workers in offshore exploration and development, particularly in the Kinsale gas field, I nevertheless wish to reiterate that it is Government policy to ensure the economy benefits to the maximum extent possible from offshore exploration activities, within the constraints of EU legislation. It has been continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators Association and the individual operators that Irish workers and suppliers of goods and services, including service ports, must be given opportunities to participate in such activities and I will continue to do so. Enterprise Ireland has been designated to act as facilitator between <Col N="437" /> operators of petroleum exploration licences and Irish providers of goods and services.</P>
    <P>Responsibility as regards employment of workers and the provision of services and related issues, including the selection of service ports for offshore operations, are strictly matters for the exploration companies and their contractors. There are no powers available to me to require undertakings in regard to jobs or the provision of services with the oil companies involved in offshore petroleum exploration activities. The imposition of such conditions on licence holders is precluded under EU legislation in force since 1968, Regulation 1612/68, in relation to the freedom of movement of workers.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to maximise the use of Irish goods, services and employment in respect of all offshore operations. Crucial to that is the need to ensure all potential contractors or suppliers of service are made aware of present and future requirements of operators and main contractors. To that end, I have asked Enterprise Ireland and the Marine Institute to intensify their business awareness efforts. I am organising a business awareness seminar for the suppliers of goods and services to the exploration and production sector and this will be held in Mayo at end March or early April 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to the new requirement for EU member states to carry out fisheries monitoring in the north east Atlantic. The North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission, promotes the conservation and management of the fisheries resources of those areas of the north east Atlantic which lie outside the jurisdiction of its contracting parties which include the European Union. The NEAFC has adopted a scheme of control and enforcement for vessels of the contracting parties operating in the NEAFC area. These recommendations became binding on contracting parties on 1 July 1999.</P>
      <P>The European Union has given legal effect as from January 2000 to the NEAFC control recommendations for EU member states. The EU regulation sets out requirements on matters such as the marking of vessels, the recording and reporting of catches and the trans-shipment of fish. These requirements must be complied with by all EU vessels fishing in NEAFC waters, and EU member states are obliged to carry out surveillance and inspection of fishing vessels fishing in NEAFC waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department liaises regularly with the Department of Defence, the Naval Service and <Col N="438" /> the Air Corps on fisheries protection, with a view to ensuring effective delivery of fisheries monitoring and control in our zone. Specific discussions on the operational implications of the Council regulation for Ireland have been ongoing for some months. We are also collectively engaged in discussions with the commission on the practical arrangements.</P>
    <P>The practical extent of new operational responsibilities for the Naval Service and the Air Corps outside the EU zone is largely dependent on the level of fishing activity by Irish vessels in the north east Atlantic area and on the overall practical arrangements which will be made for monitoring the fishing activities of EU vessels in those waters. A key objective in delivering on Ireland's NEAFC responsibilities will be to ensure we can meet those obligations without detriment to the core business of ensuring effective fisheries protection in our waters and proportionate to available resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware following an inquest into the death of a person who drowned at the Forty Foot bathing place on 16 October 1998, the coroner for the county of Dublin wrote to my predecessor advising that the inquest jury recommended &ldquo;that a competent inquiry be undertaken, with a view to establishing the nature of any changes in sea conditions attributable to HSS vessels&rdquo;. Subsequently, a report on a review carried out by the chief surveyor from the marine survey office of my Department on waves and HSS vessel operations in Dublin Bay was presented to my predecessor who published the report by laying it before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 24 January 2000.</P>
      <P>The report is not into the drowning of a person, the subject of an inquest in the normal way, but rather a review of the position in relation to waves generated by the HSS vessel operated by Stena Line Limited between Holyhead and Dún Laoghaire. The report examines the wave patterns which are generated by the HSS vessel in various sea conditions and the effect that these could have in the bay and on the shoreline. It also outlines the action taken by Dublin Port and Stena Line Limited to identify the problems with this wave generation and the measures, including speed abatement procedures and modified operating conditions, which were introduced to eliminate, or at least minimise to an acceptable level, the waves produced by the vessel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations of the report are: that <Col N="439" /> the current operating regime for speed abatement by the HSS in the approaches to Dún Laoghaire be continued; that Dublin Port Company continue recording all HSS movements in and out of Dublin Bay to ensure that the speed limitations are being complied with; and that a record in the form of a database of all reports of wave activity attributable to the HSS, or other high speed craft, be maintained by Dublin Port Company and that monthly and annually the reports are analysed to try to determine if any pattern of wave activity is evolving.</P>
    <P>These recommendations are being addressed jointly by my Department, Dublin Port Company and the Stena Line Limited which operates the HSS vessel.</P>

      <P>The current licensing terms and financial and taxation provisions were introduced in 1992 and have been supported by every Government since. I have no doubt that without these terms there would have been little or no exploration off the Irish coast.</P>
      <P>The study referred to by the Deputy presents empirical data and costs about the number of exploration and appraisal wells drilled offshore since 1971, and points to the employment created onshore arising from this expenditure in the past and the potential for such employment in the future.</P>
      <P>It is almost 30 years since Ireland's last commercial find. Although 133 exploration and appraisal wells have been drilled in the Irish offshore since 1971 to date &ndash; all undertaken and financed by the exploration companies &ndash; there has been limited success with only the Kinsale-Ballycotton and the Helvick fields being declared commercial. This level of success in making commercial finds does not compare with the United Kingdom or the North Sea.</P>
      <P>It is a simple and stark fact that the prospectivity of our offshore area has been demonstrated, over the period 1971 to date, to be consistently low. Our waters are deep and operating conditions are among the most difficult in Europe. Given these facts, the 1992 terms were designed to maintain the competitiveness of the Irish offshore area to exploration comparison. Without exploration there can be no prospect of production, which carries with it best prospects of benefit to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> That being said, the Government will keep the terms for exploration and production under constant review, and will balance the interests of the State with the industry's needs for stability and confidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 18 January 2000 my predecessor, Deputy Woods, published the report of the Irish emergency towing vessel, ETV, study. The study made the following three recommendations. An ETV should be deployed in Ireland to empower the State to proactively protect its coast and all maritime activities in the Irish pollution responsibility zone, IPRZ, in accordance with the provisions of the intervention convention. Among its functions would be the conservation of ecologically sensitive areas, protection of amenities and marine economic activities, reduction of pollution costs and enhancement of search and rescue activities. The report stated that the most cost effective method of securing an ETV would be a dual function vessel having a secondary role in fisheries protection.</P>
      <P>The marine safety information services should be extended to incorporate the functions of a vessel traffic management information service, VTMIS. This would provide coast guard staff with a traffic image of vessels, enhance SAR as vessels could become useful resources in the event of a marine incident and allow detection of and safety management service for vessels in the event of a breakdown or accident.</P>
      <P>The coasts of Donegal, Mayo and Galway should be designated as a marine environmental high risk area and, working through the IMO, passing vessels that pose a potential threat because of their cargo or size should be required to stand off this coast by a specified minimum distance.</P>
      <P>I will give particular attention to this report and its recommendations. The economic, human and environmental costs of a major oil pollution incident off our coasts are incalculable. If we can put in place an infrastructure to prevent such an occurrence, rather than do so after such an event, we should do so. Accordingly, Deputies can be assured that we will review this report speedily and comprehensively and urgently bring to Government our conclusions in the matter.</P>

      <P>The strategic plan for the development of forestry, published in 1996, indicated that Coillte Teoranta would be maintained in public ownership in the medium term, but that the full commercial development of the company would provide Government with a wide range of ownership options in the future.</P>
      <P>In December 1998, AIB Capital Markets and Merrill Lynch International were appointed to carry out a consultancy study to assess the options for the corporate development of Coillte. The study involves considering the role of Coillte in contributing to the Irish forestry sector and the identification and evaluation of appropriate options for the corporate development of Coillte, including strategic alliance and wider share ownership possibilities. The consultants' report is expected shortly. It is my intention to publish the report and to invite comments from sectoral interests.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to this matter is, as was outlined by my predecessor, Deputy Woods, to the House on several occasions, most recently on 25 November 1999. The sensitivities of the Irish Government and public to the use of the Irish Sea generally for the transport of the materials mentioned by the Deputy to and from Sellafield have been made known on many occasions to the UK authorities.</P>
      <P>My main concerns regarding any transport of this nature are to ensure that the vessels do not pass through waters under our jurisdiction. I have assurances from the UK authorities that they will not. The UK authorities have also stressed that voyages by such vessels through waters solely under UK jurisdiction are kept to a minimum and are already limited to one or two per year; and to ensure that the highest possible levels of safety are applied both in terms of the vessels employed and the operational requirements applied to them.</P>
      <P>As Minister I have to accept that the vessels transporting these materials may be involved in an accident arising from hazards of navigation or from occurrences such as workplace accidents which will require assistance from Ireland's emergency services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" /> In this connection, the Irish Coast Guard, in co-operation with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland recently engaged in a communications exercise on board one of these vessels. The aim of the exercise was to ensure that the limited shipments that do take place are as safe as possible and that there are no adverse effects on the environment.</P>
    <P>While we would all prefer if shipments of this nature did not take place, I am conscious of the fact that they are for the present a reality. As Minister responsible for the marine environment and safety at sea, I am committed to ensuring that Ireland will continue to be notified in advance of shipment dates, the nature of cargoes and all other relevant details.</P>

      <P>On Sunday, 25 July 1999, an unidentified vessel was in collision with the Irish fishing vessel <i>Renegade</i> in the Irish Sea. The unidentified vessel which was heading on a southerly course did not stop after the incident. The <i>FV Renegade</i> was holed as a result of the collision and took water in the engine room. Pumps were put on board by the emergency services and these were used to lower the water level in the engine room and enable the vessel to reach port.</P>
      <P>An investigation into this collision is currently being carried out under section 728 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, by a surveyor from the marine survey office of my Department and various lines of inquiry are being followed to try to establish the identity of the merchant vessel which collided with the <i>FV Renegade</i>.</P>
      <P>It is a basic tenet of maritime law that the flag state is responsible for the regulation of its vessels' behaviour in international waters. I am advised by the chief surveyor from the marine survey office that the flag state of a suspected other vessel involved in the incident has been contacted with details of the collision and requested to provide assistance to the marine survey office in their investigation. It is intended that my Department's investigation into this collision will be completed once all relevant information has been received from the flag state which has been contacted in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 35 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland operates very strict fish health provisions in accordance with the EU Council Directive 91/67/EEC. Under the directive, Ireland has &ldquo;approved zone&rdquo; status for list one and two diseases reflecting our overall high fish health status. To maintain that disease free status which is critical for our export based aquaculture industry, all <Col N="445" /> fish farms must be inspected and regular sampling carried out by the marine institute in accordance with the requirements of the directive. The directive also sets out compulsory requirements for disease eradication programmes which must be implemented by member states in the event of a disease outbreak.</P>
    <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, the fish farm was a shore based unit operating a pilot scale project to evaluate the potential for farming halibut and turbot. Following an outbreak of the notifiable disease viral haemorrhaic septicaemia, in 1997 it was necessary, in line with mandatory EU requirements, to undertake a cull of fish. The operators were informed in February 1998 that it would not be possible to provide Exchequer compensation and this remains the position. I am advised that the Marine Institute is now working with the co-op to re-establish fish farming on Oileán Chléire.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>EU regulations on fisheries control require an EU fishing vessel proposing to land into a member state other than its flag state to give four hours advance notice to the relevant authorities in the country into which the landing is to take place. Third country fishing vessels are obliged to give 72 hours advance notice of proposed landings. In both cases the proposed port of landing and the time of arrival must be specified.</P>
      <P>These advance notice requirements facilitate a rigorous and targeted scrutiny of landings by my Department's sea fisheries officers. Any further restrictions or requirements would have to be introduced in the context of a designated port scheme, applicable equally to Irish and other EU fishing vessels. While I have no immediate proposals in that regard, the position can be kept under review as part of ongoing work to ensure the optimal effectiveness of fisheries surveillance and control.</P>

      <P>The present management of the fishery harbour centres is unduly centralised, and lacks the commercial and operational flexibility needed to respond effectively to local circumstances and needs. I will give priority to the development of a new management framework which will devolve the day to day management of the centres from my Department. My objective is to deliver greater local involvement and a more responsive and commercial approach to delivering services at local level within an appropriate overall framework. This is in line with the general thrust of submissions made by interested parties.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Department to finalise recommendations for a new framework for my consideration as quickly as possible with a view to bringing proposals to Government at an early date.</P>
      <P>The new management system will be the most significant development in the administration of the fishery harbour centres since the enactment of the Fishery Harbour Centres Act, 1968. It will be firmly based on local involvement through boards which will have an input on all issues affecting maintenance and development of their harbours. Mechanisms for appropriate levels of co-ordination between the harbours will also be put in place, to ensure a consistent overall national response to fishery harbour development requirements.</P>
      <P>The proposed new management arrangements take account of submissions from all interested parties and are being progressed by my Department at present.

      <P>Deputies are aware that the proposed siting of a Loran C mast at County Clare is a complex and sensitive matter. Involved are matters relating to international commitments, entered into solemnly by the State in 1992, maritime safety and the sustainability of dependence on the US GPS system as the sole position fixing infrastructure and Irish access to a possible new generation of position fixing technology involving land and satellite elements. Against these considerations are strongly held concerns on the part of local communities in County Clare about the health, environmental and visual impacts of a Loran C mast in the locality of Loop Head.</P>
      <P>I do not intend, therefore, to make any commitments as to when final decisions will be made in relation to this project, at this stage. I need to consider carefully how to progress in the light of the influencing factors indicated above. I am very aware that there is a binding commitment to proceed with a Loran C mast in Ireland which will meet the requirements of the international agreement, ratified by the Dáil and Seanad in 1992. I am also aware that not proceeding with the project carried political and financial exposures. It is also possible that not proceeding will mean that Irish mariners of the future will not have access to an established position fixing infrastructure which will be a credible alternative to GPS. I am also aware that the site at Loop Head is perceived to create particular difficulties and that there is widespread opposition to a siting at that location.</P>

      <P>Enterprise Oil and its partners, Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited and Marathon International Petroleum Hibernia Limited have drilled three wells in the Corrib gas accumulation located in the Slyne Trough &ndash; an exploration well in 1996 and two appraisal wells, one in 1998 and the second in 1999.</P>
      <P>The exploration well was a gas discovery but the operator was unable to test it at the time. The first appraisal well produced gas on test which flowed at a stabilised rate of 63 million cubic feet of gas per day. The second appraisal well flowed gas at a rate of 64 million cubic feet per day. All data acquired by the operator, has been made available to my Department, and evaluation has continued over the winter with a view to establishing a location for a well which Enterprise Oil will drill this spring. They hope to be in a position to decide whether the Corrib gas field is commercial or not in December of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final decision as to whether the field is commercial will depend on factors such as the volumes of gas in place, the quality of the reservoir, the quality of the gas, the flow rate of wells, market availability and price and the cost of development. Calculation of the size of the gas accumulative is too imprecise at this stage based on data currently available but this will be known with more precision once the accumulation has been fully appraised. The Deputy will appreciate that in accordance with <Col N="450" /> the licensing terms data from the field remains confidential at this time.</P>
    <P>There are frequent meetings between myself, my officials and Enterprise Oil regarding Corrib and I have a detailed understanding of the field and I am being kept fully informed of the operators views and concerns as the appraisal programme progresses. My specific requirements for a plan of development application and the process whereby approval would be given are under discussion between us to ensure that should Enterprise declare commerciality there will be no delay in moving to the development stage.</P>
    <P>Should the results of Enterprise Oil's appraisal programme prove that the Corrib field is commercial it will be necessary for them to apply to me for a petroleum lease and to submit a plan of development for the field for my approval in order to bring the field into production. I hope that they will be in a position to seek a petroleum lease at the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The Government decided on 25 January 2000 to re-name the Irish Marine Emergency Service as the Irish Coast Guard, Garda Cósta na hÉireann. While no change in functions was proposed, the new title responds to a long held view among the staff and volunteers of the IMES that the new title was necessary to correctly encompass the function carried out by IMES and to create a more meaningful corporate identity.</P>
      <P>Work is in progress on the preparation of legislation, a marine emergency service Bill, which will give the Irish Coast Guard a firm legislative base and statutory duty of responsibility for all activities associated with the discharge of its remit. The Bill will take account of the findings of the recent IMES expenditure review and Naval Service and Air Corps reviews. It will propose the appropriate functions for a coast guard following consultation with various Government Departments, national services and related interests in partnership with the staff of the Irish Coast Guard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A departmental group, modelled on the principles of partnership and consisting of staff, unions and management has commenced the assessment of the IMES expenditure review including the recommendations concerning a coast guard and will identify the necessary organisational and service delivery changes which might arise with a view to maintaining and enhancing the high quality provision of search <Col N="451" /> and rescue and pollution response in our marine and littoral areas.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a local firm applied to my Department for a foreshore licence to allow for the extraction of sand and gravel from a site off Waterford Estuary. The application was subject to a full EIS and full public consultation took place.</P>
      <P>Having considered the application, the objections to the proposed extraction, the company's response to the objections and the technical and scientific advice available to my Department, my Department has entered into negotiations with the company regarding the terms and conditions of a foreshore licence which may issue in the future.</P>
      <P>The conditions being suggested by my Department are designed to minimise the impact upon fishing and, in particular, to protect white fish, herring and lobster. However, the area concerned, approximately 655 hectares in size, is relatively small compared to the potential spawning grounds of the Celtic Sea which has far more extensive areas of clearer water deemed more suitable for spawning of herring.</P>

      <P>The Council of Fisheries Ministers, last December, agreed, among other matters, the total allowable catches for the year 2000, fisheries control and monitoring measures within the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission area and a number of technical conservation measures for the protection of juvenile fish.</P>
      <P>The package of TACs proposed by the Commission for 2000 included a number of stringent reductions over 1999 levels. These proposals were informed by scientific advice provided by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas and management advice provided by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee on Fisheries. There are serious concerns about the state of certain stocks, including key whitefish stocks fished by the Irish fleet, and in these cases substantial quota reductions of up to 40% were proposed by the Commission.</P>
      <P>These severe cuts were scaled down during marathon talks and the Council agreed to less substantial cuts totalling 19.5% by volume over 30 demersal species. This more balanced incremental approach to reducing fishing mortality over a number of years, rather than the Commission's hard-line approach of wholesale once off cuts, was favoured by the Council. The scientific advice, however, on many whitefish stocks was too bleak to be ignored. We have a responsibility to ensure that the long-term future of the resource was protected taking into account the economic needs of the fishing industry. Following the political agreement at Council, a recovery plan for Irish Sea cod has been negotiated with the support of the industry which will be further augmented during the year.</P>
      <P>The outlook for Ireland's pelagic fishermen following the quota negotiations was positive. Quota levels are down just over 2% by volume on 1999. A 17% increase in Ireland's mackerel quota was secured and our blue whiting share increased by 2,000 tonnes.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that existing arrangements within my Department provide for an action plan to deal with oil spillages and other sea disasters.</P>
      <P>Among the responsibilities of the Irish Coast Guard of my Department are those for (1) search and rescue and search and recovery services for persons in distress or missing within the Irish marine search and rescue region (IMSRR), the coastal littoral area and inland rivers, lakes and waterways. (2) Responsibility for preparedness and response to pollution reports and incidents in the Irish marine pollution responsibility zone (IMPREZ) including local and harbour authority areas, oil jetties and off shore oil Installations. (3) Response plan approval and intervention in casualty or salvage situations required by the Salvage and Wreck Act, 1993, and the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, which includes the saving of the vessel, its cargo and the apparel of the vessel and protection of the coastline. (4)A national marine broadcasting network exists for, <i>inter alia</i>, marine information, weather and radio navigation warning broadcast service for shipping and other sea and coastline users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To discharge its responsibilities, the Irish Coast Guard of my Department has 65 full-time staff and 680 volunteers. It manages and operates three co-ordination/communication centres at <Col N="457" /> Dublin, Malin Head and Valentia, 13 remote VHF sites, two voice repeater sites and 50 coastal emergency response stations providing shore coverage. The Irish Coast Guard has contracted two civilian Sikorski S61N search and rescue helicopters, one at Shannon and the second at Dublin Airports. Stocks of pollution equipment are retained at Killybegs and Castletownbere and training courses are run at different levels in marine pollution preparedness and familiarisation with pollution equipment. Harbour and maritime local authorities are invited to participate in such courses. The main ports at Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford also hold stockpiles of pollution equipment and the Irish Coast Guard works closely with them in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Sea Pollution (Amendment) Act, 1999, designates the Irish Coast Guard as the Irish national response agency for oil pollution preparedness response and co-operation. Arising from this, the Irish Coast Guard supervises the planning and implementation by local and harbour authorities of arrangements for the protection of coastal amenity/fishery/wildlife areas, and is responsible for the removal of oil from the coastline and in the event of major pollution incidents, the direction of co-ordination of the on-shore response.</P>
    <P>In addition to its own resources, the Irish Coast Guard has a number of declared resources available on a 24 hour basis all year round. These include two Air Corps search and rescue helicopters based at Finner, Co. Donegal and Waterford Airport, the RNLI which has 24 lifeboat stations around the coast and six community inshore rescue service boats based in strategic locations. I should stress that while the Irish Coast Guard helicopters are based at Shannon and Dublin Airports and an Air Corps helicopter is based at Finner, they are available on a 24-hour 365 day basis for emergency response on any part of the coastline. They are positioned so that they can reach, by day, 40 nautical miles off-shore in one hour and by night or in bad weather, 100 nautical miles in two hours. The Irish Coast Guard can call on the Department of Defence naval vessels and divers, the Air Corps fixed wing aircraft, the Garda and their divers and UK coastguard and all vessels at sea in a marine emergency situation.</P>
    <P>An assessment of the expenditure review of IMES, now the Irish Coast Guard has commenced with a view to maintaining and enhancing the high quality provision of search and rescue and pollution response in our marine and littoral areas. An enhancement of pollution surveillance operations is under consideration with a view to acting as a deterrent to pollution. An Irish emergency towing vessel study has been completed recently and the report concludes that there is a need for an ETV. This must now be assessed within my Department in relation to factors such as procurement options, costs, possible additional roles, location, etc.</P>

      <P>There are important developments taking place in relation to two hydrocarbon accumulations in our offshore, the Corrib gas accumulation and the Helvick oil field.</P>
      <P>The position on the Corrib field is that Enterprise Oil and their partners, Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited and Marathon International Petroleum Hibernia Limited, have drilled three wells in the Corrib gas accumulation located in the Slyne Trough &ndash; an exploration well in 1996 and two appraisal wells, one in 1998 and the second in 1999.</P>
      <P>The exploration well was a gas discovery but the operator was unable to test it at the time. The first appraisal well produced gas on test which flowed at a stabilised rate of 63 million cubic feet of gas per day. The second appraisal well flowed gas at a rate of 64 million cubic feet per day. Enterprise Oil is reported as saying that the field might contain more than one trillion cubic feet of gas-in-place. However, it is too early at this stage to give a precise figure for the size of the gas accumulation and the licensees will not be in a position to do so until they have fully evaluated the discovery.</P>
      <P>Evaluation of all the data has continued over recent months with a view to establishing a location for a further appraisal well which Enterprise will drill this spring.</P>
      <P>It hopes to be in a position to decide whether the Corrib field is commercial in December of this year. The final decision as to whether the field is commercial will depend on factors such as the volumes of gas in place, the quality of the reservoir, the quality of the gas, the flow rate of wells, market availability and price and the cost of development of the field.</P>
      <P>Should the results of their appraisal programme show that the gas can be commercially produced it will be necessary for Enterprise Oil to apply to me for a petroleum lease and submit a plan of development for the field for my approval.</P>
      <P>The Helvick oil field is held under a petroleum lease by Providence Resources who have declared the field commercial. A detailed plan of development for the field is due to be submitted to me for approval by the end of April this year. The field is small and is estimated to contain between five and seven million barrels of oil and a small amount of associated gas.</P>
      <P>A plan of development for the southwest lobe of the Kinsale Head gas field was approved last year and the field was brought into production by Marathon in October.</P>

      <P>With regard to minerals exploration and mining, Ireland has had considerable success in the development of ore bodies in recent years with the opening of two world class lead and zinc mines at Galmoy, County Kilkenny and Lisheen, County Tipperary. Together with Tara Mines Limited full production at these mines will see Ireland ranked seventh in the world for zinc production, and the leader in Europe.</P>
      <P>We also have the large Irish gypsum operation at Knocknacran, County Monaghan which produces gypsum to service the needs of all plaster and cement manufacture in the country.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by these successes, we will continue to foster a healthy minerals exploration industry in Ireland, and I hope for further discoveries in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Minerals exploration is currently being carried out under some 463 prospecting licences. In the face of strong competition between countries to attract dwindling exploration funds, Ireland has, in recent years, actually bucked the global trend with exploration expenditure increasing by 16% in 1998. The 1999 figures are estimated at no lower than 1998 and the number of current <Col N="460" /> prospecting licences has increased by 15% over 1998.</P>
    <P>With regard to oil and gas exploration and development there is a high level of offshore petroleum exploration activity with 22 exploration licences in place covering 119 blocks or part blocks. In addition there are four offshore licensing options and two leases in place. Applications for three further licensing options and one lease undertaking are at present under consideration. Two onshore licensing options are also held over the Northwest Carboniferous Basin.</P>
    <P>A plan of development for the southwest lobe of the Kinsale Head gas field was approved last year and the field was brought into production in October. There are important developments taking place in relation to two other hydrocarbon accumulations in our offshore, the Corrib gas accumulation and the Helvick oil field.

      <P>The measurement and monitoring of the levels of radioactivity in the Irish Sea, is a statutory function of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The institute implements an extensive programme of marine monitoring. It publishes the results of its monitoring programme in a series of reports entitled &ldquo;Radioactive Monitoring of the Marine Environment&rdquo;. The reports provide extensive details of the level of radioactive contamination in the Irish Sea and of their impact on the Irish population. The results are also available on the institute's web-site at www.rpii.ie</P>
      <P>The dominant source of radioactive contamination in the Irish Sea is the British Nuclear Fuels reprocessing plant at Sellafield. Other sources of radioactive contamination arise from the fall-out from nuclear weapons testing carried out in the 1950s; the fall-out from the Chernobyl accident in 1986 and radioactivity from natural sources.</P>
      <P>The institute has found that the radiation doses to the Irish people arising from Sellafield discharges are very low and do not pose a significant health risk to the Irish public. Nevertheless, any contamination of the Irish marine environment is highly objectionable from an Irish viewpoint.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government wishes to see a cessation of all radioactive discharges from the Sellafield plant into the Irish Sea and its concerns are repeatedly made known to the UK Authorities. In 1998, the contracting parties to the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, which include the UK, adopted a strategy on radioactive substances. This strategy has as its objective the virtual elimination by the year 2020 of all radioactive discharges to the marine environment covered by the convention, which includes the Irish Sea. Ireland took a prominent role in the development of this strategy and work is now taking place within OSPAR to enable the strategy objective to be achieved. Ireland will play an active part in ensuring that the strategy objective is realised by way of progressive and substantial reductions in discharges into the Irish Sea between now and 2020.</P>

      <P>EU Council Regulations 3820/85 and 3821/85 were introduced in 1985 to promote safety for drivers and other road users. These regulations concern the use of tachograph in heavy goods vehicles and large public service vehicles and lay down maximum driving times, minimum rest and break periods.</P>
      <P>The general terms of the regulations are as follows: driving is limited to nine hours per day but this may be extended twice in any one week to ten hours; a break of 45 minutes in respect of each 4.5 hours driving which may be replaced by breaks of at least 15 minutes each distributed over the driving period; a weekly rest of 45 hours which may in certain circumstances be reduced to 36 hours at base or 24 hours away from base provided compensatory rest is provided in the following week.</P>
      <P>All EU member states are obliged to comply with the regulations. It is the responsibility of operators to organise work in such a way that drivers are able to comply with the provisions of the regulations. Drivers have responsibility to plan their journeys so as to ensure that they take adequate rests in accordance with Regulation 3820/85.</P>
      <P>The EU tachograph and driving regulations are currently being reviewed on a community wide basis by a working party under the auspices of the EU Commission. This detailed review will take some time and will consider such topics as the impact of technology in the transport area and the exemptions currently in place. Enforcement officers from my Department are taking an active part in this review.</P>
      <P>My Department is responsible for the enforcement of European Union regulations concerning tachographs in heavy goods vehicles and bus passenger vehicles. Member states are obliged under EU law to undertake a minimum number of inspections on an annual basis. My Department has a transport inspectorate who are engaged full time on the detection and prosecution of breaches of the tachograph regulations and other offences under the Road Transport Acts. Where serious contraventions of the regulations are detected prosecutions are initiated in accordance with the regulations. A person guilty of an offence is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both fine and imprisonment.</P>

      <P>Income tax reliefs are currently available in respect of carers for relief for health expenses and relief for <Col N="467" /> employed person taking care of incapacitated individual. An individual may claim tax relief for certain medical expenses incurred on behalf of a dependent relative in respect of whom he or she is entitled to a &ldquo;dependent relative&rdquo; tax allowance. Most non-routine medical and dental expenses, not already re-imbursed or re-imbursable by the VHI, BUPA or regional health authorities, including such items as the cost of doctors' visits, maintenance or treatment in a hospital, transport by ambulance, are allowable. Certain items prescribed by a doctor, will also qualify for relief, for example, engaging a qualified nurse in the case of a serious illness, physiotherapy or similar treatment, drugs and medicines, hearing aids, orthopaedic bed-chair, wheelchair-wheelchair lift  &ndash; no relief is due for alteration to the building to facilitate a lift &ndash;  and glucometer machine for a diabetic. Maintenance in an approved nursing home also qualifies for relief which is available at the individual's marginal rate of tax.</P>
      <P>Tax relief of up to £8,500 per annum, is available where an individual employs a carer to look after an incapacitated relative. For the purposes of this relief, a &lsquo;relative' includes a relation by marriage, and a person in respect of whom the individual is or was the legal guardian. Carers may be employed on an individual basis or through an agency. The relief is not due where the carer is employed as a housekeeper only. The relief is available at the individual's marginal rate of tax.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I propose to introduce a new allowance for home carers in the Finance Bill, 2000. The allowance of £3,000 will be available at the standard rate of tax, in respect of homeworking spouses caring for children, the aged  &ndash; 65 or over &ndash; or incapacitated persons. It will be possible for such homeworkers to have a certain level of income from part-time work and-or the social welfare carer's allowance without affecting the new homecarer's allowance. The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the type of expenditures referred to by the Deputy would not normally be eligible for relief under the existing reliefs referred to above.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my budget speech on 1 December 1999, I announced that as in previous years the threshold for the <Col N="468" /> payment of the health levy will be increased from £11,250 to £11,750 per annum, or from £217 per week to £226 per week, with effect from 6 April 2000. However, as my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, announced on 8 February 2000, the Government has now agreed that as one of a number of measures aimed at improving the position of the low-paid workers, the earnings limit for exempting employees form the health levy contribution is to be increased to £14,560 per annum. All employees earning between £217 and £280 per week and all self-employed people earning between £11,250 (the current annual threshold) and £14,560 will benefit by up to £5.60 per week at a cost of £52.6 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>At present the health contribution is chargeable on the income of persons over 16 years of age with the following exceptions; income below £217 per week or £11,250 per annum, £280 and £14,560 respectively from 6 April 2000; payments under the Social Welfare Acts; medical card holders; persons in receipt of a widow's or widower's contributory, non-contributory or occupational injuries' pension or a corresponding EU pension; persons in receipt of a deserted wife's benefit or allowance; persons in receipt of a lone parent's allowance; and maintenance payments are also allowed as a deduction to the payer before computing the health contribution.</P>
      <P>The health levy is currently 2% and is included with PRSI and where applicable, collected through the PAYE system. Class K1 (health contribution only) applies to people receiving income which is not subject to social insurance contributions, such as; occupational pensions; income deriving from positions of certain office holders, e.g. Judges and State Solicitors and other categories of income, e.g. taxable portion of termination lump sum payments. Under class K1, the health contribution levy is currently payable where an individual's weekly earnings-pension is greater than £217 per week, or £11,250 per annum (£280 and £14,560 respectively from 6 April 2000).</P>
      <P>Where an individual pays the health contribution levy during the year because his or her weekly earnings-pension exceeded £217 in any one weeks(s), he or she can claim a refund of any health contributions deducted, where his or her total earnings-pension for the year does not exceed £11,250. The claim for a refund can be made by submitting a form P60 to the Office of the Collector General, Sarsfield House, Limerick.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that increasing the threshold for Class K1 contributions to £14,560 would not pose any administrative difficulties under the present refund system and that the present system of allowing an individual to claim a refund of the health contributions where his or her earnings-pension do not exceed the relevant annual threshold will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I introduced substantial changes to the capital acquisitions tax legislation in the recent budget. These included an increase of the three tax-free thresholds and a new single CAT rate of 20 per cent to replace the old rates of 20 per cent, 30 per cent and 40 per cent. This single rate will apply uniformly to both gifts and inheritances.</P>
      <P>In addition, I introduced a family home relief. The purpose of this relief within the CAT regime is to ensure, in so far as is possible, that persons who inherit, or are gifted, the home in which they are living, and in which they may have lived for many years, do not face a substantial tax bill when they get the home. To qualify for the relief the recipient of the home must have lived in the home for the three years prior to the gift or inheritance. I do not propose to introduce any further changes which would depart from the broad thrust of the relief as I have described it here.</P>
      <P>In the case outlined, where a house is being willed by an individual to his brother who has not lived in the house prior to the transfer, the tax-free threshold of £30,000 will apply for CAT purposes. However, possible hardship is taken into account by the Revenue Commissioners when determining the terms of payment of capital acquisitions tax. Where the threshold is exceeded, for example, payment by instalment may be arranged, and tax may be postponed in certain cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 to 86, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children is the national paediatric cardiac centre. Following discussions in 1997 between the hospital and officials from my Department, it was considered that a range of measures should be implemented to alleviate pressure on cardiac surgery services at the hospital. Included in these measures was the agreement to upgrade the theatre facilities, which when completed will boost the hospital's annual capacity by an additional 100 procedures.</P>
      <P>As an interim measure, it was agreed that the hospital should enter negotiations with suitable UK facilities for the purchase of additional cardiac surgery procedures and that resources would be met under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative. Under this initiative 18 children were referred to the UK in 1997, 30 children were referred to the UK in 1998 and 69 children were referred to the UK in 1999. My Department has allocated additional funding of £0.7 million to Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children to continue this initiative in 2000. The details of this funding, including the referral of children to the UK for cardiac procedures, will be discussed with the hospital in the context of their service plan for 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that the design team for the theatre development at the hospital has been appointed. When complete the new theatre <Col N="472" /> development will provide five new operating theatres complete with ancillary accommodation, a day surgery area and a central sterile supplies department. The existing theatre facilities will also be upgraded to provide a further two theatre suites. It is expected that when these theatres are fully commissioned Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children will be in a position to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures, which is a 40 per cent increase on existing capacity. The estimated completion date for the development is 2002.</P>
    <P>With regard to the staffing situation there are currently four cardiologists and two cardiac surgeons working in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children. Approval for a third cardiac surgeon has already issued, the recruitment procedure has been finalised and the selected candidate is expected to take up duty in July 2000.</P>
    <P>As at 31 January 2000, the latest date for which figures are available, there was a total of 96 public patients awaiting cardiac surgery procedures in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children. Of these 96 public patients, 14 are waiting between zero and three months, 19 are waiting three to six months, and 63 are over six months. The average waiting time for routine paediatric cardiac surgery is 2 years. The prioritisation of the waiting list is a matter for the clinicians concerned and it is important to note that immediate medical treatment is provided to urgent cases. In 1999 the average cost of sending a child to the United Kingdom for heart surgery was £16,400.</P>
    <P>The paediatric cardiology-cardiac surgery services are under constant review by my Department and the authorities at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children and I am confident that, when complete, the new theatre development at the hospital will be a significant factor in enhancing these services.</P>

      <P>The provision of drug treatment services in the Cherry Orchard area is a matter for the Eastern Health Board in the first instance. There is no register of drug abusers in any health board area.</P>
      <P>The health board provides a broad range of services to clients at the Aisling Addiction Centre in Ballyfermot. The number of people attending at Aisling from the Ballyfermot-Cherry Orchard area is 157. At present there are eight people from Ballyfermot on the waiting list for treatment. A number of people from Inchicore and Clondalkin attend the centre in Ballyfermot and it is intended to provide locally based services in Inchicore and Clondalkin in the near future thereby significantly alleviating the waiting list in the Aisling clinic.</P>
      <P>Fortune House in Ballyfermot also provides a 12 week detox programme as well as a specialised young person's programme. At present 33 people from Ballyfermot attend these programmes. There is currently a waiting list of three people from the Ballyfermot area and they will commence treatment shortly.</P>
      <P>The board's education officer also provides a number of educational and prevention initiatives in the Ballyfermot area and works closely with schools and community groups in the area. The board also works in conjunction with the Ballyfermot task force in a number of locally based initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> The board, following discussions with the local community, has agreed to open a rehabilitation unit in the same building as the family resource centre, Cherry Orchard Avenue. The building has now been commissioned and a management committee put in place. An extensive programme has been designed for the project and the board is now in the final stages of recruitment of staff. Services will commence in the building shortly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Inquiries were made of VHI which has advised that an application for insurance cover for spinal cord stimulators was previously considered. VHI has concluded, having carried out a literature review to identify both the clinical and cost effectiveness of this procedure, that randomised control trials were required to support its use. VHI has been keeping the issue under review and has informed my Department that it does not pro<Col N="495" /> pose to provide insurance cover for this treatment pending the outcome of such trials which demonstrate both the clinical and cost-effectiveness of spinal cord stimulators for specific conditions, <i>vis-à-vis </i>other therapies.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances, it is a matter for each insurer to evaluate the medical knowledge and scientific evidence available in determining the question of whether or not it is appropriate to provide cover in relation to a particular treatment.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to replies given in the House on 23 November, 14 December, 1999 and 27 January last in relation to the waiting times for assessment for inter-country adoption. I can reiterate the points which have already been made. An additional £213,000 was allocated to the Eastern Health Board in mid 1999 following the publication of the report Towards a Standardised Framework for Inter-country Adoption Assessment Procedures. A further £236,000 has been allocated in respect of 2000. The total additional funding for the Eastern Health Board over this period therefore amounts to £449,000 which represents almost a doubling of the budget for inter-country adoption services in the region.</P>
      <P>The board has advised that the standardised framework approach, set out in the report on assessment procedures, will be commencing this month through the provision of the new format preparation courses. In addition, the board has made arrangements for the provision of improved accommodation, information technology and administrative support for intercountry adoption services. These initiatives should help to streamline the assessment process and increase throughput. Together with an increased complement of social workers these measures should bring about a significant increase in the number of assessments being completed in the board in 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the recruitment of social workers is a particular difficulty in the Eastern Health Board and that adverse media attention on the inter-country adoption service has undoubtedly been a contributing factor. Despite other initiatives which the Eastern Health Board has taken to improve the service to applicants for inter-country adoption, the availability, recruitment and retention of appropriately qualified staff will be a key element in bringing waiting times to an acceptable level. There are difficulties in recruiting social workers for both adoption and <Col N="496" /> child protection services. The Eastern Health Board have recently advertised social work posts in the area of intercountry adoption again and I understand it is currently processing responses to that advertisement.</P>
    <P>I can advise the Deputy that the updated figure for the waiting list up to the 7 February is 438 couples awaiting assessment.</P>

      <P>The joint Department of Health and Children/health board working group referred to in the Deputy's Parliamentary Question No. 97 of 27 January was established in 1998 with the following terms of reference:</P>
      <P>to clarify the guidelines on eligibility for medical cards particularly as they relate to the budget 1996 provision in relation to persons who have been on the live register for 12 months and who take up paid insurable employment and also to participants on approved schemes aimed at the long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>The group completed its work and its recommendations were agreed by the chief executive officers. The terms of reference above of the group were not extended to examine other issues. However, I am advised that health board chief executive officers continuously keep under review medical card eligibility criteria and this process would include consideration of couples on individualised social welfare payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, in the matters raised by the Deputy. I have been informed by the hospital that it is an established practice among hospitals to transfer organs to other hospitals' laboratories. This most commonly arises where a second opinion is required or when technical or professional expertise available in a different institution is required. Organs were and continue to be transferred from Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, to other hospitals in contexts such as these. The hospital authorities have informed me that it has no knowledge of organs being transferred to any medical school from the hospital.  With regard to transfers of organs to a pharmaceutical company, or organs being a source of financial gain or forming part of any commercial transaction within this State or abroad, the hospital has confirmed that save as stated below it has no knowledge of any participation by the hospital in such transactions.</P>
      <P>The hospital has confirmed that for many years there was no medical treatment for the condition commonly known as short stature. In the early 1960s a growth hormone was developed in the USA using human pituitary gland as a source. Pharmaceutical companies were involved in the development and a national pituitary agency was set up in the USA to manufacture growth hormone and prepare it for injection. In Ireland hospitals were involved in the effort to avail of this growth hormone product, there being no other way to treat children with this condition other than the pituitary gland derived product at that time. The hospital understands that a significant number of glands were required to produce a small amount of the product and that the treatment to children involved multiple injections over a lengthy period of time.</P>
      <P>Development in genetics in or about 1985 allowed that human growth hormone could be produced without extracting the material from the pituitary gland.</P>
      <P>The hospital also understands that about the same time health concerns arose in relation to the growth hormone product from the pituitary gland. The hospital has confirmed that there is an indication in correspondence located in its laboratory that the laboratory participated in this process of extracting pituitary glands which were then supplied to a pharmaceutical company called Kabi Vitrum to produce growth hormone for the treatment of children. Between June 1980 and November 1981 a contribution towards the cost of the work of extracting the glands was made by the pharmaceutical company in question. The contribution identified is £109.50 which was payable to the Children's Research Centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the issues which will be examined <Col N="499" /> under the inquiry into post-mortem practices at the hospital, the establishment of which I announced yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The system of expenses allowances for elected members is designed to defray, in a structured way, members' travelling and subsistence costs arising from their attendance at council and committee meetings. Being an expenses system rather than a salary, it does not include specific provision for sick leave or holidays. For the same reason, there are no deductions for taxation. Members can however, avail of their full expenses allowance, even where they have not attended up to 20% of the council and committee meetings during the year. In addition, members only have to attend 50% of the meetings in a year to qualify in full for the miscellaneous representational element &ndash; ranging from £1,800 to £2,100 &ndash; of the allowance. I consider that these attendance thresholds allow a reasonable measure of flexibility to cater for non-attendance due to illness or other reasons. It is also proposed that the local government Bill will include provision to allow for the introduction of a salary type payment by way of regulations, the detailed arrangements of which will be worked out following the enactment of the Bill.</P>

      <P>An updated preliminary report for the scheme was submitted to my Department in February 1995 but has not been approved.</P>
      <P>In October 1998 my Department requested each local authority to undertake a fresh assessment of needs for capital works in its area and to prioritise its proposals on the basis of the assessments which were to be forwarded by June 1999. The priority lists will be taken into account in the framing of water services investment for 2000 and future years under the national development plan. No proper assessment has yet been received from Monaghan County Council despite a number of reminders from my Department.</P>

      <P>The use of a points system criteria for the assessment of applications for the grant of taxi licences was introduced in 1991 and has been the subject of a number of amendments, most recently in February, 1999, following consultation with local authorities and other interested parties. The criteria give priority to taxi drivers, for example, cosies, who have never held taxi, wheelchair accessible taxi or hackney licences, in relation to the allocation of new taxi licences.</P>
      <P>The amendment of the criteria made in February 1999 relaxes earlier provisions which excluded all previous hackney licence holders from the fullest allocation of points. A more limited restriction now applies only to persons who have held a hackney licence within the previous relevant two years; the point of reference for this period is the date of publication of the notice by the licensing authority in relation to the relevant determination to grant new taxi licences.</P>
      <P>The administration of the above provisions is the responsibility of the local licensing authority concerned.</P>

    <P>It is primarily a matter for the local authorities concerned, in co-operation with the other statutory and voluntary agencies, to formulate responses to meet the accommodation and welfare needs of homeless people in their areas. My Department will continue to afford priority to providing resources and support for a range of measures to meet the accommodation needs of homeless persons. In addition, the cross-department team on homelessness under the aegis of my Department is due to report shortly on a comprehensive response to the problem of homelessness and I anticipate that the report will include recommendations to improve the situation of homeless families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. In effect, the main objective of the scheme is to make up the difference between a person's means, whether cash or in kind, and his or her needs.</P>
      <P>The maximum rate of SWA payable where a person has no means of any kind is £72 per week for a single person, £115.20 for a couple and £13.20 for a child. The maximum rate of rent supplement paid to a single person in the Eastern Health Board area is £64 per week, while the average family can receive up to £167 per week in rent supplement.</P>
      <P>Payment at the full basic weekly rate is not made in cases where some needs are met directly or in kind. This is the situation, for example of persons in long stay institutions and, to a different extent, people in &ldquo;digs&rdquo; type accommodation. A payment of £15 per week is typically made to people in long-term institutional care and it has been the practice in the Eastern Health Board to pay £25 per week to people in &ldquo;digs&rdquo; type accommodation.</P>
      <P>Guidance was sought by and provided to health boards recently in relation to the amount of SWA which would be appropriate in the case of people who have been provided with full board accommodation, mainly in hotels and tourist hostels outside Dublin. Where a person in full board accommodation receives all meals and has access to other facilities such as laundry and leisure areas, the weekly allowance is £15 per adult, in line with the practice in long-term institutions referred to above and £7.50 per child. Furthermore, where there are other reasonable expenses, exceptional needs payments are being made by the health board.</P>
      <P>General guidance and clarification regarding the payment of rent supplements and deposits was also sought by and issued to the health board community welfare staff recently. The legislation provides that it shall be a condition of any claimant's entitlement to a rent supplement that the health board is satisfied that the claimant is in need of accommodation. Therefore, in general, a person who is in full-board accommodation does not have an accommodation need and would not be entitled to a rent supplement and or a deposit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there will be instances where, in the view of the health board, the full board accommodation is not appropriate. In those circum<Col N="504" /> stances, deposits and rent supplements will be paid in the normal manner.</P>

      <P>The treatment benefits scheme administered by the Department provides assistance towards the cost of dental, optical and audiology services to people who satisfy certain statutory PRSI conditions and to their dependent spouses. The scheme is a contributory social insurance scheme and the qualifying conditions are set at a level which maintains a reasonable balance between social insurance contributions received and the costs of the benefits concerned, which amounted to £35 million last year.</P>
      <P>For persons aged under 21 years at the date of claim, the only contribution condition is that they have 39 weeks PRSI paid since entering insurance. Between the ages of 21 and 25, there is an additional requirement that they have 39 contributions in the relevant income tax year &ndash; the 1997-8 year in the case of the person concerned. It is the claimant's age at the date of claim that counts and not her age in the relevant tax year.</P>

    <P>Information is not available on the average age of claimants who qualify for benefit nor on the eligibility of persons in particular age groupings or take-up by them.

      <P>I am aware of the particular difficulties at Kilmacthomas Garda station. It is proposed to build a new replacement Garda station and, in that regard, I can say that progress is being made in that a sketch scheme of the new station has been prepared by the Office of Public Works and is currently being considered by local Garda management. Alternative accommodation for the station as an interim measure is, I understand, being actively sought.</P>

      <P>An application for a Garda CCTV system for Ballyfermot was received by the CCTV advisory committee in December 1999. The application is under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, the advisory committee has received in excess of 40 applications for Garda CCTV systems, as aids to policing. Six locations have been prioritised for the installation of such systems &ndash; Bray, Cork, Dublin South Central, Dundalk, Finglas and Limerick. The extension of the Garda CCTV system in Dublin to include Grafton Street and its surrounding streets and the installation of a CCTV system in Cork city are the CCTV projects currently being undertaken. The order in which the <Col N="510" /> remaining priority locations will be undertaken has not yet been decided, although it is intended to commence the planning and implementation of Garda CCTV systems in each of the prioritised locations as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Delays have been encountered in progressing various CCTV projects while the demand from various communities for CCTV systems has been very significant. A shortage of technicians in the</P>
    <P>telecommunications section of the Garda Síochána has impacted on the progress in implementing CCTV systems, particularly in each of the prioritised the prioritised, locations. Notwithstanding this, it also became evident that the existing approach to CCTV could not cope with the demand and a review of all aspects of CCTV was required. I therefore decided to initiate a review of CCTV and asked the Garda Commissioner to look at this whole area. The review is expected to be completed soon and its findings will then be submitted to me for consideration. I expect that these findings will assist in facilitating and accelerating the installation of Garda CCTV systems in the future.</P>

      <P>Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister for Justice may grant a certificate of naturalisation, at his absolute discretion, where statutory provisions are complied with. These provisions require that an applicant is of full age, is of good character, has five years residence in the State in the past nine years, the last year being a year of continuous residence, intends to continue to reside in the State following naturalisation and makes a declaration of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State. Section 16 of the Acts provides that the Minister may, in specific instances, waive some or all of the statutory requirements when considering an application.</P>
      <P>Applications were submitted in respect of the persons referred to in September 1999. These were duly considered and it was decided not to grant certificates of naturalisation in these cases at this time. The persons referred to were notified of my decision in January 2000.</P>

      <P>The Maternity Protection Act 1994, which implements the employment rights provisions of the EU pregnant workers' directive (92/85/EEC), provides that all female employees who have notified their employer of their condition are entitled to 14 consecutive weeks' maternity leave plus four weeks' unpaid additional maternity leave. The Act also provides an entitlement to time off work for ante-natal and post-natal medical appointments and to health and safety leave in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>In addition to maternity leave, the Parental Leave Act 1998, provides an individual non-transferrable entitlement to both parents to 14 weeks unpaid leave from work to take care of young children. The leave must be taken before the child reaches five years of age, except in certain circumstances in the case of an adopted child. The entitlement applies to parents of children born or adopted on or after 3 June 1996.</P>
      <P>In view of the different conditions which apply to the taking of maternity leave in EU member states, it is difficult to make comparisons. However, the position regarding the length of paid maternity leave to which there is entitlement in EU member states, based on a 1998 publication of the European Commission, is set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>A review of the Maternity Protection Act 1994, is being undertaken by my Department, in accordance with the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium, which provides that key priorities regarding women's rights will include the review and improvement of maternity protection legislation. It is intended to complete this review by September 2000.</P>

      <P>However, I have had inquiries made with the Legal Aid Board and have been advised that, if the person in question is a client of the Legal Aid Board and is on the waiting list of a law centre awaiting either an appointment to have her means assessed or an interview with a solicitor, the law centre in question will, on request, issue the person with a letter for the court stating that she is on the law centre's waiting list. It is open to her to present this letter to the court and an adjournment may be granted.</P>
      <P>If the person in question is successful in her application and receives a legal aid certificate to defend the divorce proceedings, the Legal Aid Board will appoint a solicitor to act on her behalf. The board will also engage the services of a barrister for the duration of the court proceedings.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would advise the person in question to raise the matter directly with the board itself.</P>

Teachers with the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the Association Montessori Internationale &ndash; AMI &ndash; College, Mount St. Mary's, Milltown, Dublin 14, and teachers trained in St. Nicholas, Dun Laoghaire, Montessori, who have successfully completed the full-time course of at least three years duration which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards may be granted recognition to teach in special schools and classes.  If a person holding these qualifications is appointed to teach in a special school or special class she or he would receive full salary entitlements on being appointed to such a post. She or he would also be regarded as qualified for resource teaching posts for pupils with special needs.</P>
      <P>Teachers holding Montessori qualifications who serve as substitutes are paid at the trained rate, but are paid at the untrained rate when employed in a temporary capacity in mainstream schools. I should point out that substitute teachers are generally employed on a short-term basis to replace teachers absent on certified sick leave and maternity leave. Temporary teachers, on the other hand, are generally employed for a full school year to replace teachers on long-term unpaid leave of absence.</P>

This allowance was later approved for eligible participants in the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme &ndash; VTOS. The bonus was introduced as an incentive to encourage greater participation of the long-term unemployed in education and training programmes.</P>

    <P>People with disability allowances who are on VTOS are entitled to the £25 bonus if they have been unemployed for the required period prior to starting their course.

The Department of Education and Science, through <Col N="515" /> the vocational education committee, pays the bonus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards access to information held by schools, the Education Act 1998, already has provisions, which when implemented in full, should ensure that schools are transparent in their operation and accountable to their local community.</P>
      <P>Under section 7 of the Act, one of my functions as Minister for Education and Science is to publish information relating to the monitoring and assessment of the quality, economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the education system provided in the State by recognised schools. Section 9 of the Act provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that parents of students, or in the case of a student of 18 years or over, the student themselves, have a right to access to all records relating to the progress of their child in school. Section 21 provides for each school to draw up a school plan, and section 21 provides for the school to report to the parents of students on the operation of the school. Boards may further report to parents on progress towards goals set out in the school plan.</P>
      <P>In relation to the records of interview boards, the Education Act provides for a partnership approach in the development of procedures for the appointment of staff. Section 24 of the Act provides for the Minister to agree procedures with the school patron, recognised school management organisations and any recognised trade union or staff associations representing teachers, as appropriate, for the appointment of staff. I would prefer to give these partners in education an opportunity to develop appropriate procedures, which could include access to marks at interview, rather than to achieve this result by unilaterally applying the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
      <P>Given the provisions of the Education Act, I am of the view that adequate alternative statutory arrangements are now in place regarding access to information held in schools and it is not my intention, at this time, to seek the extension of the Freedom of Information Act to schools. However, this situation will be kept under review by my Department, especially since the implementation of the Education Act at school level is still at a very early stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>A working group was set up in autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy school bags. The terms of reference of the working group were to consider the issue of heavy school bags and in particular the extent of the problem; the factors which contribute to the problem; and possible implications of the problem, particularly for the health of pupils.</P>
      <P>The group was also asked to formulate proposals to alleviate problems associated with the weight of schoolbags. The group presented its report in July 1998. I have arranged for a copy of the report to be sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The group's report outlined a number of recommendations that had implications, not only for my Department, but also for schools, parents and publishers. One of the main recommendations is related to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard my Department, at primary and post-primary levels, initiated an awareness raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-<Col N="519" /> primary schools. Furthermore, information leaflets and posters have also been distributed to all schools, highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted in order to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each individual school to choose those measures that would be most suitable to its individual needs.</P>
    <P>The report also recommended that my Department should examine the feasibility of providing for appropriate storage facilities in future specifications for furniture manufacturers. Accordingly, the building unit of my Department will be examining the possibility of incorporating storage facilities in the provision of furniture in the future. The report further recommended that, in relation to second level schools, my Department should continue to afford schools the option of book storage in the case of new schools.</P>

Where necessary appropriate education programmes are delivered in special projects and in some cases individuals are provided with <Col N="520" /> special tuition in order to facilitate their return to mainstream education.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware that the Education Welfare Bill which is currently being considered in committee in this House, will provide a new framework to treat with issues of school attendance. The Bill provides for the establishment of a national educational welfare board, with a general responsibility to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a prescribed minimum education &ndash; section 9.</P>
    <P>I recognise that particular problems arise in the case of children of homeless parents. Given that both the Department of Education of Science, and the relevant health board have a role to play here, it is necessary that an integrated approach be taken.</P>
    <P>The Welfare Bill provides for this approach, through the establishment of liaison officers between all the relevant service providers, and specifically including the Minister for Health and Children and the health boards. The creation of this statutory network will allow for effective exchange of information between the welfare board and the health boards to identify children in the situation described by the Deputy, and to provide for their educational needs, whether through registration at an appropriate school, or through such other means as the board considers appropriate.</P>
