      <P>I give notice that I seek leave to move a motion for the Adjournment of the Dáil today under Standing Order 31 on a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, that is, the decision by FÁS not to renew contracts for community employment for 450 people working as caretakers, cleaners, classroom assistants and secretarial assistants in the schools sector in the north-east region, comprising Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath.</P>

      <P>No, Sir. I have a problem with No. 20f, the Standards in Public Office Bill. In light of the Government's experience with the appointment to the EIB, which is a public office, will this Bill deal with the scrutiny by the House of future Government appointments such as the appointment it will probably make this month to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development? Will the Tánaiste indicate whether that appointment will be scrutinised by the House or if she has discussed it with the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards No. 20f, it is proposed that this long awaited Bill which was published this morning will be immediately referred to two committees. The purpose of that course of action is not clear. Is Second Stage of the Bill being taken in a nominal way following which the Bill will be referred to the committees or is it simply going back to the two committees which discussed these proposals over the past two and a half years? The legislative intent is not clear. Is the Government trying to kick this issue into touch again or what is it asking the committees to do? I do not recall this parliamentary procedure being proposed before. Will the Tánaiste clarify what is intended by this proposal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps you might assist me, a Cheann Comhairle. This is a new parliamentary procedure. Having had prior consultation with the set of proposals for a committee, and having taken those proceedings from the committee, the Government has introduced a Bill. The Government is clearly declining to move Second Stage of the Bill and is referring it back to committees it controls by virtue of its majorities. One can only conclude that having extracted the Bill from the Government, it is now employing a parliamentary device to ensure it is not enacted.</P>

      <P>No. 24 concerns an agreement between the Governments of Ireland and Romania, one of the countries covered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. This month a vacancy arises for an Irish director of that bank and before agreeing to take this important motion without debate I would like the Tánaiste to outline the Governments plans. Will the Tánaiste indicate that the Government will make an announcement regarding the filling of the post in the EBRD before the recess?</P>

We know the logistics relating to other arrangements in the House which will improve the working conditions for all of us &ndash; our working conditions should be as good as those of others.</P>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste indicate whether there are provisions and whether they will be communicated by the Government for the recall of the Dáil should that be necessary? On a number of occasions in recent years the Dáil has been recalled. If the committees make progress during July, would it not be appropriate to have a one or two day session in July to complete and advance Bills? I propose an amendment that we make provision for the Dáil to be recalled if there are Bills which could be progressed to Report Stage, as has happened previously. More than 20 Bills either have been published or are in progress. We can be more productive in the way we do our work. We should, therefore, come back for two days at the end of July. I propose this by way of amendment.</P>

Although the committees have much work to do, we cannot honestly bring this plenary session to an end until we have much more under our belts. We are behind on many Bills.</P>

The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will investigate the matter. He has not seen the report. I <Col N="935" /> understand the Garda Commissioner received it last night. He will prepare his observations on the report and make them available to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform tomorrow.

      <P>I have been waiting to raise a matter of promised legislation. Since the Order of Business began, more than one million gallons of radioactive contaminated water have been discharged from Sellafield. Does the Government see the urgency of getting two more votes for OSPAR, which would win Ireland's position and end discharges? Only two more votes are needed and we should be lobbying those people. Is the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, doing that?</P>
      <P>It would indicate some urgency on the part of the Government to resolve the issue if the railway safety Bill were brought forward earlier rather than waiting until 2001, as is written in the document. Will the Government make progress on resolving that issue? It will fester over the summer and kill off a great deal of tourism business. Workers will lose their jobs&mdash;</P>

      <P>The purpose of this order is to reserve 32 places in the first year of the bachelor of education course in the Church of Ireland College of Education, Rathmines, for students who are members of the Church of Ireland or who belong to the broad Protestant tradition. The making of the order and its laying before the Houses arises from the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and to ensure that the rights and interests of the college, schools with a Protestant ethos and the students in those schools are provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, prohibits discrimination on a wide range of grounds, including religion. While the Act deals primarily with discrimination in employment, it also extends to discrimination in vocational training. Vocational training is defined as any system of instruction which enables a person to acquire the knowledge for the carrying on of an occupational <Col N="947" /> activity. Teacher training falls within this definition.</P>
    <P>For many years, probably since its foundation, the Church of Ireland College of Education has provided training in primary school teaching only to students who come from the Church of Ireland and the broader Protestant tradition. The purpose of this practice is to ensure that there is available to schools under Protestant ownership a sufficient number of teachers who themselves come from a Protestant background and are trained in an institution with a Protestant ethos.</P>
    <P>Most primary schools in the State are privately owned, publicly-funded denominational schools. This system of denominational education is underpinned by the Constitution. Collateral to the right of the religious denominations to conduct schools with a particular ethos is their right to ensure that they have available to them a corps of staff belonging to and trained in the particular religious denomination of the school. If such staff were not available, the constitutional rights to free profession of religion and the conduct of denominational schools would be seriously impaired. To avoid imposing what would, in effect, be unconstitutional restrictions on the rights of the denominations in this regard, section 12 of the Employment Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination in vocational training, makes two exceptions. It provides that for the purpose of ensuring the availability of nurses to hospitals and teachers to primary schools which are denominational in character and in order to maintain the religious ethos of the hospitals and the schools, the prohibition of discrimination does not apply in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>In the case of primary schools, the section provides that an educational or training body may apply to the Minister for Education and Science for an order permitting the body to reserve places in the vocational training course. The Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, may then make an order allowing the body to reserve such number of places to meet the needs for teachers in primary schools as is considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Church of Ireland College of Education has made an application on behalf of the college for the reservation of 32 places in the college for the academic years 2000-01, 2001-20 and 2002-03 for students who are members of recognised churches in the Protestant tradition, essentially in this instance, the Church of Ireland, the Methodist Church and the Presbyterian Church. The college makes the case that the reservation of 32 places, which is at present the full complement of first year places in the college, should be made to provide sufficient teachers to Protestant schools over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The grounds for the request as put by the college are as follows: recent initiatives of the Minister for Education and Science, including the allocation of an additional teacher to one teacher schools, the lowering of the pupil-teacher ratio <Col N="948" /> and the development of remedial education, have placed additional staffing requirements on the schools; anticipated demand in the schools indicates that it outstrips supply from the college; some of those who enter the college will not complete their studies and, of those who qualify, some will not take up posts in schools with a Protestant ethos or may not teach at all; the career break and early retirement schemes reduce the number of teachers available to schools and in addition there is some evidence of a greater number of teachers resigning from teaching in recent years than in the past; and in the last school year a survey of schools indicated that 43 posts would become available during or at the end of that school year and in 1998 55% of all schools reported that they had encountered considerable difficulty in securing qualified teachers to undertake substitute teaching.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science believes that, in the circumstances set out by the college, the reservation of 32 places in the college for students from the Protestant tradition appears reasonable in order to ensure that Protestant schools have available to them a sufficient number of teachers who share their value system and religious beliefs.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the order now to be made will continue in force for the next three academic years. The Minister is satisfied that it is unlikely that within that period circumstances will materially change either for the college or the schools which it serves. In the third year of the order, it is proposed that the situation will be reviewed again and this House will then be given a further opportunity to consider the matter.</P>
    <P>Apart from the constitutional requirements from which this order flows, the order is a necessary support to the maintenance of diversity of values, beliefs and culture in our education system and in Irish society. Given that schools with a Protestant ethos represent only a small minority of primary schools in the State, there is clearly a risk that that ethos could be greatly diluted unless specific protections are provided. This order puts in place a protection which the Oireachtas considered appropriate and which will guarantee Protestant schools that they can continue to provide education for their students in accordance with their particular values and beliefs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion. Many Protestant schools are currently experiencing extreme difficulty in recruiting staff. Recently Mr. John McCullough of the Church of Ireland Board of Education attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Science and the figures he revealed were even worse than those cited by the Minister. He stated that 66% of Church of Ireland schools found that substitutes were rarely available while only 4% of schools found favourable levels of substitute teacher availability. Serious problems are experienced in recruiting staff in unattractive areas such as <Col N="949" /> remote rural areas or in encouraging people to continue teaching in those areas.</P>
      <P>Unless an adequate supply of teachers is available from the college, there is no doubt that the Church of Ireland Board of Education's ability to continue to provide denominational education would be seriously undermined. The Minister correctly pointed out that the Protestant education tradition is a very valued part of the Irish education tradition and it is important that the State would make every effort to support its continuance.</P>
      <P>There is perhaps a need to consider some of the other issues which affect smaller schools, particularly those of a Church of Ireland or Protestant denomination. The fact that resource and supply teaching duties cannot be combined in one post to create a permanent position in the school causes problems for Protestant schools that are small in size. It is more important that they can offer permanent positions than it is for mainstream Roman Catholic schools because there are so many options. If Protestant schools are to have attractive positions they must be able to create posts that have permanent and full recognition. There is need for the Minister to look at that area and also at colleges of education and the supply of appropriate in-service training for all schools.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable that there is not ongoing in-service training in Ireland provided for remedial teachers. This is an area that evolves rapidly and it is crucial that people are up to date. Adequate training is not provided for teachers to cope with children with special needs who often present in such a way that teachers do not recognise their difficulties in time. That, allied to the difficulties in getting assessments creates real problems. We need to invest much more in teacher in-service training so that they will be equipped to deal with children who present with challenges that are outside the ordinary.</P>
      <P>I have often said to the Minister that it is ridiculous that we spend 1% of teachers' payroll on in-service development particularly as the financial services sector, we read recently, spent 5.5% of payroll on in-service development for its staff. We do not invest in updating the skills of those who are the fountainhead of knowledge and learning in our community. It is unacceptable at a time when we have resources. We know from our neighbouring island that the status and standing of the teaching profession can go into decline quite quickly if we do not nurture and support it. I welcome this order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Sargent. I am speaking on this order as a kind of past pupil of the Church of Ireland college in Rathmines because I did my teacher training under a special scheme called the Wilson Scheme in the late seventies. It was mainly centred in the College of Education in Marino but part of it was in Rathmines so I am familiar with the college but not as much as Deputy Sargent who is a past pupil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="950" /> The Labour Party has no difficulty with this order. We welcome it and fully accept the need to protect the Protestant ethos of our schools. We also fully accept the serious difficulties encountered by Protestant schools in recruiting staff of their own religion. That matter must be dealt with and we support the order for that reason. We have no difficulty with the fact that 32 places are being reserved but why is the figure so low? </P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the many problems which various Protestant schools have in maintaining and recruiting staff. Why was a greater effort not made to increase the intake? The figure of 32 places is exceptionally low and must be viewed in the context of the serious shortage of teachers generally. I would have thought the College of Education, Rathmines, would have a far greater capacity &ndash; I do not know what the maximum recorded capacity has been. Presumably there is unused capacity in the college and potential for increasing it. I wonder why that has not happened. I was quite shocked to see that the intake was only 32 places.</P>
    <P>Another area in need of attention is providing non-Catholic teacher training options for those who wish to enter teaching, especially when we view what is happening in the educational system and the growth of the multi-denominational sector. It is a vibrant sector but like many other primary schools it is experiencing great difficulty in recruiting qualified staff. I would have thought there would have been a big demand for places.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the chief executive officer applications, one will see that the teacher training colleges are heavily over-subscribed. It does not make sense that we are restricting the intake into one of the teacher training colleges. The Minister should address that issue.</P>
    <P>We are conscious of the very serious lack of supply of teachers and the fact that so many children are being taught by unqualified staff across different and no religions. That is a serious issue and we must recognise the difficulties the schools encounter. Many children are being short-changed as a result of lack of planning in this area.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party agrees with the order but regrets that the Minister is not pro-active in making more trained teachers available.</P>

    <P>Is cúis díomá dom áfach go bhfuil deireadh le Coláiste Móibhí agus ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Uas. Risteard Giltrap as an obair a rinne seisean sa choláiste a bhí in aice linn anseo i bPlás Chill Dara ar feadh na mblianta chomh maith leis an gColáiste Ullmhúcháin.</P>
    <P>I welcome this order. As a former student I know how important it is to the Church of Ireland College of Education. It is extremely important for the future of the schools under Church of Ireland management and the management of other Protestant denominations as well. As Deputy Shortall and Deputy Bruton have said, there is an enormous shortage of teachers which particularly affects the Church of Ireland community as it is drawing from a much smaller pool of people.</P>
    <P>It should not be overlooked that the order sends a very clear and welcome message to those working for reconciliation that minorities are cherished and are not caught in the rush to reform and change but are taken into account so they may feel as citizens with the same equality of opportunity. The equality of minorities must be dealt in a way that respects their sensitivities particularly when there is such a big majority and a small minority.</P>
    <P>In this college it would be possible in a less sympathetic State to feel under siege given that the numbers are so low. As Deputy Shortall said, 32 places seems small in terms of the overall context but I know from experience that number fills the classrooms. We would need to have a big increase to make it a two stream system for the B.Ed. degree. While that needs to be done there must be a certain amount of preparation and degree of intent. There is a great need, as Deputy Bruton said, for more in-service training in the schools given the speed of change in education. I compliment the college which, under Dr. Dunbar, has done outstanding work in the area of children's literature which has gained national and international fame. There is no doubt in-service training is outstanding in those areas, but the Department has a particular responsibility to counteract the effects of its own removal of teachers from the system for curriculum development. There are now so many teachers on secondment that schools are being placed in an extremely invidious position and find it difficult to get substitute teachers, though it is all in the name of developing the curriculum. The Department does not appear to be able to facilitate schools in maintaining permanent positions and keeping teachers in what are termed supernumerary positions so they can perhaps be replaced by a permanent teacher or some other arrangement. This will have to be worked out as the Department is part of the problem and it should be part of the solution.</P>
    <P>Tá fhios agam nach bhfuil mórán am agam, but <Col N="952" /> given that the Garvaghy Road and other marches are on everyone's minds at this time of year, an order of this kind is seen as a strong signal of respect for minorities and is very welcome. In my town of Balbriggan, St. George's Church of Ireland school was in danger of closure and amalgamation with a Church of Ireland school in Skerries, but the Roman Catholic community was the key factor in wanting to keep that school open so that diversity could be maintained in Balbriggan. That should be mentioned so that our Northern colleagues, or brethren as they say in the Protestant faith, are conscious that diversity is cherished and minorities respected in this part of the island.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 9, before section 7, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.&ndash;It shall be an offence under this Act for any person to cause or carry out any electronic communication or activity that would&ndash;</P>

      <P>My purpose in moving this amendment is to hear the Minister confirm that these areas of well known fraud are clearly stipulated. These are well established cyber crimes.

      <P>In the past six months we have come to describe on-line illegal activities as cyber crime. However, this is not a justice Bill, it deals with business. The Criminal Damages Act, 1991, contains a number of very general damage to property offences, including damage to computer data. The Criminal Justice Fraud Offences Bill, which is an up-date of the 1991 Act, is due for publication in the autumn of this year. It will contain a number of offences related to electronic commerce. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will work closely with my Department to ensure that Bill reflects the type of issue which have been raised in amendments to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 9, before section 9, but in Part 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="955" />&ldquo;PART 2</P>
    <P>9.&ndash;It shall be an offence under this Act for any person to monitor or track any electronic communication by an originator without that person's consent.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is the area of the Bill about which I feel most strongly. I raised this matter on Second Stage and public concern has been expressed. I refer to an article in <i>The Irish Times </i>of 19 May. If any individual operates a personal computer to surf the Internet, any site visited can be tracked by the Internet service provider and these data given to marketing companies. This is an intrusion of people's privacy.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 would make it an offence to monitor traffic without the user's consent. Amendment No. 6 would make it an offence to store information without the consent of a user. Amendment No. 7 would require information previously garnered to be deleted and destroyed, thereby setting a start date for this privacy and dealing with the lacuna which would otherwise arise. Amendment No. 8 would ensure that data protection legislation related to the EU directive would be fully implemented. Amendment No. 9 would make it an offence to give information on Internet users to a retail chain, for example, for marketing or other purposes. Amendment No. 10 would establish the right of every citizen to find out what data is held on him or her on computerised records.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that these matters should be dealt with in other legislation, but I disagree. This Bill deals with individual rights, not merely with business. Privacy must be protected and the data protection measures being drafted at European Union level move in this direction. Article 7 of the EU directive states that the unambiguous consent of the individual is required before data can be processed and the explicit consent of the individual is required in relation to sensitive personal data.</P>
    <P>I accept that data protection legislation is to be amended but the two should coincide here. I am told it is impracticable and undesirable to forbid e-commerce companies from storing information regarding their customers, but I do not accept that argument. Banks, doctors and solicitors, for example, are obliged to keep information about clients confidential. There cannot be different charters for off-line and on-line business.</P>
    <P>United Kingdom legislation attempted to deal with these issues. In the United States, which pioneered the <i>laissez faire </i>attitude to this issue, the Federal Trade Commission has introduced a study which recommends a change of policy. Its advisory committee report on privacy, Security and Protection Approaches for Protection and Legislation, highlights these points. A <i>laissez faire </i>approach to electronic commerce is not adequate. I seek basic safety provisions for users of the Internet. This is the part of the Bill about which I feel most strongly.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 10 would establish &ldquo;the right of every citizen to apply for and obtain all data which is held on him or her on any electronic database held in the State&rdquo;. Could this power be extended to databases not held in the State? Could this restriction be avoided by taking a database outside the State or could such an activity be regulated by this or the other legislation mentioned by the Minister? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Yates, Coveney and O'Shea for tabling these amendments and for their comments on them. Privacy in the face of bureaucracy is becoming increasingly central to EU directives and national legislation. Since the Second Stage debate I have been aware of Deputy Yates's and Deputy O'Shea's concern in this regard and I asked for full information on this matter.</P>
      <P>The Data Protection Act, 1988, set up the Data Protection Commission to ensure the legislation was enforced. That Act needs to be updated. Many of the principles of the European directive on data protection are already included in the 1988 legislation. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has carried out consultation on the transposition of the directive and legislation is now being drafted which will be published in the autumn. This will be an up-date of the Data Protection Act, 1988.</P>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 5, the 1988 Act provides that personal data must be &ldquo;fairly obtained&rdquo; and it must only be used for the purpose for which it was collected. We had extensive discussions with the Data Commissioner, Fergus Glavey, and his office. If companies collect data without the knowledge and consent of individuals, it would be in contravention of the 1988 Act, which will be updated in the autumn by the Department Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the light of the directive which is waiting to be transposed into law.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates is right in that the European directive goes even further in article 7 by providing that the unambiguous consent of the individual is required before data can be processed. The 1988 Act will be amended to reflect that part of the new directive and we have been told by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that it will be formulated and issued in the autumn. Therefore, a single, clear, coherent and regulatory environment for data protection and privacy issues would seem to be in the best interests of business and individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 seeks to forbid e-commerce companies from storing information on their customers. It is often essential for e-commerce businesses to store information on their customers as long as the data is got in a fair way and used fairly and legitimately for the purpose for which it was got and in accordance with the existing legislation, which is 12 years old and soon to be updated. Beyond that, there should not be any restriction. Similarly, as proposed in amendment No. 7, it would be wrong to oblige e-commerce <Col N="957" /> companies to destroy information which they had gathered correctly and legitimately and which was gathered for a particular purpose correctly stated. Why should they seek to destroy that data when it was got for fair purposes? In regard to all the amendments, section 27 provides a very clear privacy protection in that it clearly precludes the seizure. Deputies will remember we talked about our compulsion to hand over private keys.</P>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 8, the Data Protection Act applies to all electronic data. If I was in the Deputy's place, I would have tabled those amendments &ndash; I cannot put it more clearly than that &ndash; because they are good amendments and their intention is good. The purpose of the amendments is good because they seek protection of privacy in a global sense and in the other senses outlined in the amendments.</P>
    <P>The Data Protection Act, 1988, is 12 years old and will be updated this autumn by another Department in the light of an intervening European directive. I spoke to my colleague in recent days and he told me that Act would be considerably updated. Those issues arose when we discussed this Bill at Cabinet, although not in as much detail as we are discussing it now. It is clear that it is better to have one Act. We must remember that electronic and written business will be equal, which is the purpose of the Act. It is better that the Data Protection Act, 1988, which established the commissioner, the Data Protection Commissioner, his office and the amended Data Protection Act provide the regulatory framework to ensure the security of privacy issues. That is my response to those well prepared amendments, and I am not being smart or patronising because those are the kind of amendments I would be disposed to tabling if I was on the Opposition benches &ndash; they are, in essence, good amendments.</P>
    <P>The European data protection directive applies to the members states and is to be transposed into legislation this autumn. Section 11 of the 1988 Act prohibits the transfer of data outside the State. A recent &ldquo;safe harbours&rdquo; agreement between the EU and the US applies the same data protection on a voluntary opt-in basis in the US for data transferring the content of a trade, etc. In general, the question Deputy O'Shea raised is best reposed in the Data Protection Act soon to be amended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious problem. My understanding is Internet services providers can put a cookie on someone's website and track all the traffic in an unauthorised way. A number of Irish ISPs and other Irish sites have no privacy policy. Would it be possible for the Minister to write to the Data Commissioner saying that she expects Irish ISPs to have a privacy policy? There is nothing on many of these sites indicating to where an individual could write to find out what information they have on them. That would be a first step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although neither the Minister nor I were Ministers for Justice, my understanding is that EU the <Col N="958" /> Commission has made legal threats against the Government because the data protection directive has not been legislated for. The Commission is accusing the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform of foot-dragging on this issue. What I am looking for is that people can surf the net anonymously. That is the key point. I will put amendment No. 5 to a voice vote because we do not have much time. I will withdraw the other amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and the amendment relating to the deletion of existing information in certain cases. The Minister made the point about explicit consent and implicit consent and so on. The point about fairly obtained data, which the Minister made, and the Data Protection Act is not worth the paper on which it is written. When I told people they could be fully tracked and monitored, they were shocked. They had no idea that this was the case. There is much public ignorance about this. Will the Minister commit the Government to allowing people to surf the net anonymously? Will she ensure the provision of cookies requires the consent of the individual who is the originator of the traffic? Will she consider writing to the Data Commissioner saying this new legislation is coming on stream and Irish Internet service providers should be required to have a privacy policy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me to write to Mr. Glavey, the Data Commissioner, asking him to ensure Irish ISPs have a privacy policy. I will undertake to do that and will write directly to him. I will do that tomorrow and will ask the officials to arrange that a letter is prepared for me. I will then contact the commissioner and send <Col N="959" /> him a copy of the debate today. I will send Deputies Yates, Coveney and O'Shea copies of the letter which I will send to Mr. Glavey.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said the EU was cavilling at the delays in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in transposing the new directive on updating the Data Protection Act. I raised this issue with the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, who is a very good Minister. All Ministers like their Departments and what goes on in them, and he assured me that legislation to update the 1988 Act would be introduced in the autumn.</P>
      <P>The office of the Data Protection Commissioner was established in 1988 which seems like a different era. Technological advances, which are at the core of the Deputy's point, have meant that many of the provisions of the 1988 Act are not sufficiently strong or balanced. That is why the EU introduced the new directive updating these matters.</P>
      <P>I will draft a letter to Mr. Glavey tomorrow and speak to him. I will also send the &ldquo;Blacks&rdquo; to his office and to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, so they are in no doubt that the House feels the transposition of the new EU directive should include strong provisions on privacy and business.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;9.&ndash;Any person or organisation, including an internet service provider, who, prior to the date of the enactment of this Act, has any information relating to electronic communications via an originator shall be required to delete and destroy all such information, unless they have the consent of the person to whom the information relates to do so.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 9, before section 10, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>10.&ndash;(1) Notwithstanding section 9, a person shall not send an unsolicited electronic communication to another person for the purposes of any trade or profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) It shall be presumed that the recipient <Col N="960" /> of such a communication has suffered damage in the amount of £100 per communication and the District Court shall have jurisdiction in respect of any claim under this section pursuant to rules of court providing for the bringing of small claims.</P>
    <P>(3) Without prejudice to the right of action in damages for any breach of subsection (1), the Minister may apply to the Circuit Court for an order requiring any person to comply with this section.</P>
    <P>(4) Where an internet service provider is aware of a contravention of this section, it shall take such steps, including withdrawal of service or blocking of e-mails, as are required to ensure that the section is complied with.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to impose a prohibition on unsolicited electronic communications or &ldquo;spam&rdquo; which is the electronic equivalent of junk mail. This type of communication is inappropriate for a number of reasons and should be stopped. Such communication is a threat to the Internet and is a major blight on e-commerce. It wastes time and capacity and must be banned.</P>
    <P>The amendment sets out a number of measures which would help achieve this objective, including a small claims court fine of £200 per communication. The Minister could intervene in this issue. I will not labour the point as the issue is fairly clear. However, this is another aspect of privacy in the context of not wasting people's time or not cluttering up their receivers with information which is unwelcome and unsolicited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for this useful contribution on how to deal with spam. Article 7.2 of the new e-commerce directive provides that members states shall take measures to ensure that service providers undertaking unsolicited commercial communications by electronic mail consult regularly and respect the opt-out registers in which persons not wishing to receive such commercial communications can register. Such consultations should seek to ensure that names on the register do not slip in that people again begin to receive unsolicited communications.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, will address this issue when transposing the provisions of the e-commerce directive. The Department is working on the directive and legislation will be introduced in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was one of the trickiest issues involved in the Bill. This is a simple Bill. However, because it is important in business terms, it strayed into other areas through good intent. Deputy Harney has assured me that legislation transposing the e-commerce directive will be ready in the autumn &ndash; it will be a busy autumn. However, this Bill deals with the electronic signatures directive. Deputy Harney will be dealing with the e-commerce directive. Article 7.2 of the e-commerce <Col N="961" /> directive includes the measures outlined in the amendment. I cannot anticipate the legislation but it is forthcoming.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (1)(b), lines 3 and 4, to delete &ldquo;other than contracts (whether or not under seal)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 10 deals with exclusions. The Law Society has requested this amendment which deals with transfers of real estate and property. If it is not accepted buyers and sellers of property will be permitted to enter into contracts over the Internet without professional advice or any cooling off period. This will produce an anti-consumer effect for purchasers of new houses who are frequently faced with unfair terms in purchase contracts which they may not, as lay people, be able to unravel.</P>
      <P>Legislation governing contracts on the purchase and sale of land and property is chiefly governed by the Statute of Frauds which has created a formal procedure for the acquisition and disposal of property which gives the parties to the transaction ample time for considering their positions after the payment of a booking deposit. It also provides adequate time to check their position under the Planning Acts, Family Law Acts and the title to the property in question. None of this will be possible if one can buy property over the Internet.</P>
      <P>I am seeking to replicate the off-line facilities of checks and balances which deal with these often problematic issues. This would make it possible for people to ensure that title deeds and planning permissions are in order, or to see if anyone has a financial or other charge on the property. Such a situation may involve a family member or be due to marriage break-up. In such circumstances the way paragraph (b) is framed is somewhat contradictory. The exemptions and exclusions are set out. On first reading it looks as if real property is excluded, but it is not. I have given this matter some consideration. The people who are advising me are legal specialists in this area, people who should not be dismissed. I do not believe they have a vested interest. It is the due diligence aspects of property transactions that I seek to have dealt with here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very interesting because it is in the line of vested interest. We received the same correspondence, as did the Attorney General and various other people. The group in question calls itself the Conveyancing Committee of the Law Society of Ireland. I am sure its members are very estimable people of the highest integrity and that they have concerns <Col N="962" /> about this. We consulted widely when those concerns were conveyed to us and could find nobody outside the Conveyancing Committee of the Law Society of Ireland who had similar concerns. The Attorney General wrote back to them, and we have copies of that correspondence. We consulted with the Land Registry, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. We met representatives of the Law Society of Ireland &ndash; I do not know whether they were with the Conveyancing Committee, but I presume they were &ndash; regarding the inclusion of contracts for the disposal of land and property under the Electronic Commerce Bill as published. They were not satisfied with our response. They have every right to put forward their case. However, I also have every right to stand up for consumers and their rights in this regard. We are of the opinion that the concerns, although coming from a legitimate background, the Conveyancing Committee of the Law Society of Ireland, are misplaced. It is with regret, therefore, that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>The thrust of this section is to ensure the disposal of land or premises can be carried out on line but that the registration of deeds is carried out off line. Nobody I mentioned, the Attorney General, the Land Registry, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, has any objection to allowing such contracts to be carried out on line. That is the background.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not proposing the deletion of paragraph (b), just six or seven words in it. Has the Minister been briefed on what the precise import of my amendment would be? In other words, there could be a sale in principle, but the deeds are not yet registered. Is it possible to have a half-way house?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the points that puzzled us obviously struck others from whom we sought advice. The same degree of informality attends entering into a binding contract via the fax machine, which is currently possible. What we do not understand, nor can anybody else with whom we have discussed the matter, is what new dimension of danger is posed to the integrity of the conveyancing process by the Internet. It seems to us, and to all with whom we have consulted, that the Internet poses no new additional dimension of danger to the integrity of the conveyancing process. That remains the position. I am sure there are conveyancing committees and all sorts of other committees of various societies, and I am sure the one attached to the Law Society is an excellent one. However, I do not understand the sudden rush of blood to the head about this. There is no real need for it. There is nothing in our proposal which precludes the taking of legal advice or which means legal advice is obviated or put to one side. Everybody is free to consult any <Col N="963" /> legal source. This seems to be to an overemphasis on a particular role, not just in my book but in that of many other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I will withdraw the amendment. However, there is a substantive difference between logging on to a PC and buying a house or whatever and a situation where a person has the normal consumer protection whereby there is established in law a 14-day cooling off period during which time a person might decide, having thought about a particular transaction, he or she is not so keen. It must be noted that the people selling on the Internet are in the hustling business. What I am trying to do is ensure people do not get suckered into something on line without going through the small print to which they would give more scrutiny if they had it on paper. I will be able to make a better case in which there is no vested interest element and which I will argue more strongly later.</P>

      <P>I am seeking the exemption of patents and An Bord Pleanála appeals. Both are vital legal areas. The Minister's departmental officials were unable to give me a straight answer on this and were going to consult with the offices. In terms of An Bord Pleanála appeals the written word is very important. There are very strict deadlines, and very strict procedures. Those procedures should be dealt with off line. These are areas where due care is very important.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Patents Office, given the threat of hackers and so on, the security of patents is a very important issue. The whole point of a patent is the secrecy element of it and the protections therein. I await with interest the Minister's reply on whether she is prepared to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>Paragraphs (e) and (f) of amendment No. 13 go against much of what we are trying to do in this legislation. They also go against what other Departments are trying to do. The Patents Office is already preparing itself for the introduction of electronic filing of applications and other documents in the patents and trade marks area. While it might take some time to finalise those plans and to install the necessary supporting technology in the office, that should not stand in the way of this enabling legislation which will, in time, permit the office and its clients to do business by electronic means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="964" /> Paragraph (f) refers to An Bord Pleanála. The Department of the Environment and Local Government has indicated that the exclusion of An Bord Pleanála from the terms of the Electronic Commerce Bill is unnecessary because the Planning Bill was recently amended to allow transactions with the board to be carried out electronically when information technology and procedural requirements are in place. The Bill has been concluded in both Houses except for a minor extract from it which is going through today.</P>
    <P>It is with the very best of motives that Deputies Yates and Coveney have tabled these amendments. However, there is inherent in them a strong element of protectionism which is wrong, given that we are opening up Government, Government Departments and all the agencies that operate under Government through the whole information society. Our aim is that all of that will be available to the citizens of the State in a very open way so that their business can be done in this way. The amendments, though clearly well meant, would take away from what is already provided for in the recently amended planning legislation, because the Departments are already gearing themselves up to do business between themselves and with the agencies operating under them. The Patents Office has done likewise. I would not seek to hold back agencies of Government which should be properly available and accountable to citizens.</P>

      <P>(a) technology has advanced to such an extent, and access to it is so widely available, or</P>
      <P>(b) adequate procedures and practices have developed in public registration or other services, so as to warrant such action, or</P>
      <P>(c) the public interest so requires,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>he or she may, after consultation with such Minister or Ministers as in the Minister's opinion has or have a sufficient interest or responsibility in relation to the matter, by regulations made under section 3, for the purpose of encouraging the efficient use of electronic communication facilities and services in commerce and the community generally while at the same time protecting the public interest, extend the application of this Act or a provision of this Act to or in relation to a matter specified in subsection (1) (including a particular aspect of such a matter) subject to such conditions as he or <Col N="965" /> she thinks fit, and the Act as so extended shall apply accordingly.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This seems complicated, but is not. We have transposed a paragraph in subsection (2)(c). It is a technical amendment clarifying that the Minister may make regulations extending the application of the Bill to areas of excluded law if, after consultation with the relevant Minister, she feels it would be in the public interest to do so.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This directive is distinct from the directive on electronic signatures, referred to and implemented by the Bill. Article 9.2 of the draft directive on electronic commerce permits certain exclusions from the scope of section 10 of the Bill. It is clear that the text of article 9.2 has influenced the drafting of section 10 which sets out the exclusions from the scope of sections 12 to 22. However, I am advised that the Minister has missed the fact that article 9.2 does not set out the only list of exclusions from the scope of the draft directive. The recitals to the draft directive specifically state that the directive will be without prejudice to ten existing EU directives, namely, Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms of Consumer Contracts, Director 84/450 on Misleading Advertising, Directive 97/55 on Comparative Advertising, which has not yet been implemented in Ireland, Directive 87/102 on Consumer Credit, which concerns the specific matter of amendment No. 19, Directive 98/7 on Consumer Credit, which has not been implemented in Ireland, Directive 90/314 on Package Travel, Directive 98/6 on Consumer Product Pricing, Directive 97/7 on Distance Consumer Contracts, Directive 98/43 on Tobacco Advertising and Directive 92/28 on Medicinal Products Advertising. Of these, five have not yet been implemented in national legislation. It is important that the Bill permits the Minister to exclude from its scope the directives listed in the draft directive and any future directives which the European Parliament and European Council may see fit to exclude from the scope of the directive on electronic commerce. In simple terms, the EU has provided for exceptions to the rule.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about the failure to exclude the directive on consumer credit from the scope of the Bill. Failure to do so will place the State in automatic breach of the directive when it comes into effect. The directive on consumer credit was implemented by Ireland in the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, and contains extremely important safeguards for consumers. Article 4, subsection (1) of the directive states:</P>
      <P>Credit arrangements shall be made in writing. The consumer shall receive a copy of the written agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 6, subsection (1) requires that certain information in relation to consumer overdraft arrangements &ldquo;shall be confirmed in writing&rdquo;. The requirements of writing contained in the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, which give effect to articles 4 and 5, must therefore be exempted from the scope of the relevant provisions of the proposals. The point is that the directive on consumer credit and the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, which implements it, ensure consumers get a hard copy of the credit agreement. This is of particular importance because the Act prescribes that the agreement must contain a clear statement as to the consumer's cooling off period, that is, it must clearly state that the consumer has ten days in <Col N="967" /> which to withdraw from the contract without penalty.</P>
    <P>There is a difference between a credit agreement which is on-screen and which the consumer can agree to, and a written agreement which is physically sent to the consumer for perusal and agreement. The fact that the consumer receives a hard copy is cautionary to him or her. Furthermore, the hard copy is more conducive for skimming through and hence the consumer is more likely to spot the clear statement regarding the cooling off period. Consumer credit is already offered on a very large scale via the Internet. One notes in particular the growth of electronic stockbrokers offering significant credit terms. There is a real need to protect the unwary, especially in times of exuberant markets.</P>
    <P>As the Eircom share price hits 2.68 euros, the Minister will need no instructing in terms of what I have said. It seems Murphy's law is applying to the Eircom IPO in so far as the bonuses to the management will apply not at the share price of 3.90 euros but at the share price of 2.68 euros.</P>

      <P>First, Alfie Kane wants to blame everyone else &ndash; he should look to the mote in his own eye.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that Deputy O'Malley and I are the two people who know most about the Consumer Credit Act, because when Albert Reynolds gave me the chop I went to see Deputy O'Malley who was most kind and courteous and advised me to make sense of the consumer credit directives. We introduced the Consumer Credit Act and we were down to the final two amendments when the Government fell. I note Deputy Rabbitte now claims the Act as his own, but that is the way of politics. It was a most interesting Act. I remember there were 420 amendments and we spent one summer discussing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the points raised by the Deputy. We are obliged to correctly implement EU law, either by statutory instrument or primary legislation. Amendment No. 19 seeks to ensure further protection for consumers. Section 30 of the Consumer Credit Act provides that consumer credit agreements must be either handed directly to the consumer or sent to them. Section 45 of the Act stipulates that such a written communication must be in a sealed envelope. The provisions of <Col N="968" /> the Act are not undermined in any way by the Bill. They will to be complied with to the letter by credit institutions. On the inclusion of unfair terms in consumer contracts, the regulations apply equally to electronic and paper consumer contracts. This issue is of huge importance and in its own way touches on earlier amendments which were not fully accepted.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) of amendment No. 19 reads, &ldquo;the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, or any regulations made thereunder and the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations, 1995 (S.I. No. 27 of 1995), or . . .&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 13, before section 15, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;15.&ndash;(1) The Minister may, by regulations made under section 3 after consultation with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and such other persons and public bodies, if any, as the Minister thinks fit, including the body known as the Cryptography Certificate Registration Authority, authorise, prohibit or regulate the <Col N="971" /> registration and use of the certificates under this Act.</P>
    <P>(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the regulations may prescribe&ndash;</P>
    <P>(a) designated registration authorities,</P>
    <P>(b) the form of registration,</P>
    <P>(c) the period during which registration continues in force,</P>
    <P>(d) the manner in which, the terms on which and the period or periods for which registration may be renewed,</P>
    <P>(e) the circumstances and manner in which registration may be granted, renewed or refused by the registration authorities,</P>
    <P>(f) the right of appeal and appeal processes,</P>
    <P>(g) the fee, if any, to be paid on the grant or renewal of registration and  the time and manner in which such fees are to be paid,</P>
    <P>(h) such other matters relating to registration as appear to the Minister to be necessary or desirable to prescribe.</P>
    <P>(3) A person who contravenes or fails to comply with a regulation made pursuant to this section is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £10,000.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to establish the Cryptography Certificate Registration Authority. This is a crucial point. The Bill provides for electronic signatures. The person who sets up and gives out these signatures must be subject to some statutory control. I do not mind what State body would be involved, but it must be policed. I made all the arguments in favour of this on Second Stage. It cannot be left to the voluntary sector, be it a university or whatever. There must be a ministerial role.</P>
    <P>I could go through the reams of debate on this in the House of Commons in the UK. The British legislation provides that the Secretary of State &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be the relevant authority. I understand the Department is reluctant to take on this role. It wants the good name for sponsoring the Bill but it does not want the arduous responsibility for the day to day handling of the provisions of the legislation. The wording of paragraphs (a) to (h) in the amendment may be imperfect, but it is taken from section 30 of the Bill, which deals with the establishment of a process for registration of domain names. The buck must stop somewhere if there is a security problem with the cryptography or with those giving out the electronic signatures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy rightly says the amendment is inspired by Part I of the UK Elec<Col N="972" /> tronic Transactions Act. That provides for a register. I met the British Minister responsible when she visited Dublin a couple of months ago. Subsequently, she is on the record of the House of Commons as stating that she does not wish to commence this part of the Act unless the self regulatory scheme being introduced fails. Under section 15 of the UK Act, if a statutory registration scheme is not set up within five years, Part I of the Act is automatically repealed.</P>
      <P>Section 28 provides the Minister with the power to make regulations setting up a voluntary accreditation scheme for the issuers of electronic signatures. The National Accreditation Board has already put in place a pilot scheme. The section also provides that a supervisory scheme will be set up for such service providers and such a scheme should be in harmony with our European neighbours.</P>
      <P>To date, there is little evidence of an emerging consensus on how this issue should be addressed. Under the EU directive, Ireland is prohibited from introducing any form of licensing or prior authorisation for such service providers. We do not wish to put up barriers which might preclude business. Interestingly &ndash; I do not say this for the purpose of self promotion &ndash; editorials in <i>The Guardian</i> and the <i>Financial Times</i> have said that the British legislation is wrong while ours is right.</P>

However, it will not be implemented unless the self regulatory system does not work correctly. If it works correctly it will not be implement at all after five years. It will be repealed and put out of existence.</P>
      <P>Under section 28 the Minister can make regulations setting up a voluntary accreditation scheme, of which there is already one on a pilot basis, at a national level and a supervisory one, set up also for such service providers. It would be better to see how matters proceed under self regulation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (2), line 12, after &ldquo;communication&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and, subject to any contrary provision contained therein, the contract shall be deemed to have been made where and when the said acceptance was sent&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 18 deals with contracts. There is a curious omission in that the Bill provides that an offer may be accepted electronically, but it does not state where and when the contract is deemed to have been made. This issue is not dealt with in section 21, which deals with the definition of when a communication was sent. This is different from the definition of when the contract is made. Nor, according to my legal advice, is there power to determine the issue by regulation under section 3, which is too limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to paper transactions, I understand that once acceptance of an offer is posted, the contract is concluded. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the contract is concluded when the response is sent, that is, when the communication has left the person who is accepting. Analogous to when a letter has been sent, when <Col N="974" /> an acceptance has been sent electronically, there would not be a way the person could retract the contract. It seems to me that this section is not clear enough in terms of when the contract is transacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill does not set out to establish new rules of contract law. Its purpose is to provide a legal framework for electronic commerce. We must keep in mind at all times that the purpose of the Bill is to allow for equivalence between written and electronic communication.</P>
      <P>The purpose of Deputy O'Shea's amendment appears to be to add certainty and finality to the moment when an electronic contract is entered into. While this may at first seem to add finality and clarity, it would cause difficulties in a number of areas and situations because it would create a rule which does not exist for off-line contracts and would, therefore, unfairly discriminate against the on-line contract formation process.</P>
      <P>To return to what I said about equivalence, it would cut across equivalence in that regard. The law of contract for all forms of contract, whether written or oral, is primarily governed by common law. It would be contrary to the principles of equivalence, therefore, to legislate differently for electronic commerce.</P>
      <P>Section 21 deals with the time and place of despatch and receipt of electronic communications, but not the contractual consequences arising from that.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Shea's point was well made in a legal sense. Yesterday, I met Mr. Humphries and I meant to speak to him about this amendment because he is always very correct in the way he examines sections of Bills. It seems to me that if we keep the principle of equivalence in mind, equivalence in both on-line and off-line is what the Bill should provide for. We do not set out to bring into force new types of contract law. We set out only to give a legal framework for electronic commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point the Minister made, but if we accept the basis of what the Minister is saying, that the Bill does not seek to create new contract law, then in terms of equivalence if the Minister makes me an offer and I accept it in writing and 10 minutes after I send her the letter of acceptance I wish to change my mind, the legal advice available to me is that I cannot do that. Once the letter is on its way to the Minister, I have finalised the contract.</P>
      <P>The equivalence is there in terms of e-commerce, in that if the Minister makes me an offer and I accept it by way of electronic media, then I cannot telephone her ten minutes later and say I do not accept this. This does not create new contract law but is a clear equivalence between what exists and what should be contained in the Bill by way of contract.</P>

      <P>I see clearly what the Deputy is getting at, but this amendment is superfluous. <Col N="975" /> Everything the Deputy said is correct and comes under the acceptance of equivalence in the legal framework of written contracts and electronic contracts. The Deputy's proposal is a reiteration of what is already the situation because what we are providing is the legal framework and the equivalence, and both are the principles of the Bill. The Deputy seeks to copperfasten the fact that the same tenets hold for one as for the other, but they do, because we are giving legal framework to it. It is a moot point.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the recently published national waste database report for 1998 states that there has been a reduction in the recovery rate from municipal waste since 1995; the implications this has for his target recovery rate of such waste; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an increase in the recovery rate for municipal waste since 1995. In this regard, the Environmental Protection Agency's national waste database report for 1998 states that the national recovery rate for the combined household and commercial waste stream in 1998 was estimated at 9% compared to 7.8% in 1995. The increase in recovery activity has been predominantly in the commercial sector, where the recovery rate has increased from 15.3% in 1995 to 18.7% in 1998.</P>
      <P>In real terms, the total quantity of municipal waste which was recovered increased from about 118,000 tonnes in 1995 to almost 167,000 tonnes in 1998, an increase of 42% over the three year period. However, this was accompanied by a significant increase in overall municipal waste arisings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EPA cautions that care must be taken in making comparisons between 1998 data and those in the preceding report for 1995. Nevertheless, broadly speaking, the findings of the national waste database report for 1998 point to increasing waste generation, limited waste management infrastructure and considerable scope for improved recycling and recovery of waste. The findings also reinforce the need for concerted <Col N="978" /> action to prevent and minimise waste generation and put waste management on a modern footing.</P>
    <P>The report clearly underlines the challenge inherent in meeting the Government's targets for the recovery and disposal of waste, as set out in the policy statement, Changing our Ways, and the importance of adopting and vigorously implementing the local and regional waste management plans that are currently being finalised. These plans provide for practical measures to minimise municipal and industrial waste generation, as well as the development of improved waste services and an integrated waste management infrastructure to meet our waste recovery targets. I am confident they will lay a solid foundation for sustained improvement in our waste management performance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say it from memory. It stated there was a reduction in the level of household waste reused between 1995 and 1998. That was the basis of my question. We can quote as many figures as we like. However, the fact is the amount of waste produced in this country has increased, yet the level of reuse as a percentage of that waste has decreased. My question related to the performance target recovery rates set by the Government for itself. How are we to meet these rates if the level continues to decrease? The absence of an infrastructure for the separation, collection and recovery of commercial, construction and electrical waste is the essence of the problem. While every city, county and region can produce waste management plans, unless the infrastructure to recycle waste is in place it will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a slight reduction in domestic waste due to the fall off in the collection of waste paper from householders. We generate 80 million tonnes of waste per year in this country, 65 million tonnes of which come from agriculture and 2 million tonnes from domestic waste. That is the challenge ahead.</P>
      <P>The Government's development plan for 2000-06 has earmarked £650 million for infrastructure, £100 million of which is coming from the Exchequer and the EU. There is a comprehensive approach to waste management. While I accept we have a long way to go, we have achieved a great deal. An increase in the recovery of waste from 118,000 tonnes to 167,000 tonnes is no mean achievement. However, I accept there is a lot to be done. The Government's policies are laid out in the Changing our Ways policy statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in dismissing the local authority and regional plans because they will be the basis for our whole approach to dealing with our waste. Twenty of the 34 local authorities have <Col N="979" /> their plans in place and I am confident that working closely with them and the provision of resources will deal with this problem over the years.</P>
    <P>It is not all negative; there are positive aspects. The number of bring-banks has doubled since 1995 from 400 to 800. The number of active local authority landfill sites has decreased from 87 to 50 since 1995. It has been estimated that 43% of the 2.7 million tonnes of construction and demolition waste going into landfill was recovered. I accept there is a long way to go, but we must work together. The local authority and regional plans have a vital role to play in the management of our waste.</P>

      <P>According to my Department's house price data, which compile average house prices on the basis of loan approvals by all mortgage lending agencies, the average price for a new house in Dublin in the first quarter of 1997 was £84,001, while the average new house price in the first quarter of this year was £162,044. The average mortgage interest rate in the first quarter of 1997 was 6.9% and in the first quarter of this year it was 4.6%.</P>
      <P>While average house prices have increased significantly over this period, the Government has acted decisively to restore balance to the market and my Department's house price statistics show a welcome moderating trend in house price increases which, given the continued very strong demand for housing, is firm evidence of the effectiveness of measures taken by Government to address the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Average house prices for the first quarter of 2000 indicate a significant moderating trend of price increases on previous quarters, with Dublin house prices showing reductions of 1.1% and 2.7% in the average prices for both new and second-hand homes respectively, the first quarter that average prices have dropped since 1995. Year on year house price increases &ndash; March 2000 compared to March 1999 prices &ndash; are also significantly lower than in previous quarters, with annual new and second-hand house price increases in Dublin of 13% and 17%, well below the peak inflation rates of 37% and 41% respectively in mid-1998, just prior to the publication of <Col N="980" /> the Government's policy document, Action on House Prices.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State satisfied that, in the period in which he has been in office &ndash; the period to which the question refers &ndash; the average price of a new house in Dublin has doubled? With regard to his comments about the first quarter of 2000, has the Government adopted a policy aimed at reducing house prices? Does he intend to reconsider current housing policy given that the third Bacon report, and the Government's response to it, is generally regarded as not being capable of addressing the housing crisis in its totality?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>All the actions we have taken have had a positive effect on the market. There is a strong demand for houses and the only permanent solution to this problem is to bring the supply of houses into balance with the level of that demand. That is what we have been seeking to do. In the meantime we have taken measures which will allow the market to cope with this extraordinary level of demand and the resultant increases in house prices and rents.</P>
      <P>On many occasions I have expressed my dismay at the level of increase in house prices. However, I entered office only in the middle of 1997 and the Deputy must recognise that it usually takes one or two years for decisions relating to the housing area&mdash;</P>

We have taken effective action in respect of this matter and the level of increase in house prices has decreased since the middle of 1998, when the situation reached its peak. We intend to keep a tight rein on matters because the other factors which influence this area are artificial and their effect will be temporary.</P>
      <P>It is forecast that the high level of demand for housing will continue for some time. We intend to ensure housing output is increased from the very low level which obtained when we took office up to the extraordinary high level of 55,000 to 56,000 houses per annum. In my opinion it is possible to achieve that level of output and various measures designed to ensure it is achieved were published two weeks ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals are being finalised for the creation of strengthened local authority management structures to meet the demands of the introduction of a programme based system of administration and the abolition of the dual structure. Under these proposals, the posts of assistant county manager and county engineer will cease to exist. A new grade of director of services will be created at assistant county manager level and a number of these new posts will be filled by designation of the serving assistant managers and county engineers as directors of services. Each director of services will have responsibility for the management of all of the staff, both technical and administrative, dealing with the functions assigned to him or her.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to all other posts will be a matter for consideration by individual managers in consultation with their staff during local discussions on the implementation of the new structures. However, I understand that proposals currently under discussion in the Dublin county councils and Cork City Council involve the suppression of the county and city planning officer posts in favour of the creation of director of services posts with the wider management remit.</P>
      <P>The new structures proposed will not, in my view, result in any diminution in the level or quality of the planning advice available to local authorities. Under the new arrangements, the planning function will be headed up by a director of services at management level who will oversee both the technical and administrative staff. Under the new structures, there will be adequate numbers of senior planning staff to deal with technical matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the professional expertise which will be available to county councils or local authorities at county, regional and national level. Will a director of services not necessarily need to have planning expertise? In light of the recent debate on the Planning and Development Bill, I believe the functions of planning officers will be greatly expanded to take account of matters such as sustainable development, land use planning, spatial planning, etc. Will the Minister confirm that those who fill the post of director of services will be properly qualified and possess a particular level of expertise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no concerns about the quality of the planning service that will be delivered under the structures for which the new directors of services will be responsible. As the Deputy is probably aware, this policy was laid down in the document, Better Local Government &ndash; A Programme for Change, which was introduced on <Col N="983" /> behalf of the previous Administration by Deputy Howlin, the then Minister for the Environment. That document contained a great deal of material about the dual structure in local government, namely, the administrative and technical sides, to which a dual reporting system applied. That structure was clearly outdated because no modern business could operate effectively under such constraints.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 6(15) of Better Local Government contained recommendations <i>vis-à-vis</i> changing the dual structure and explained the rationale for doing so. As the Deputy will be aware, we have been trying for the past three years to finalise matters in this regard to allow the SPCs to become operational. The proposals were voted on by SIPTU and IMPACT in 1999 and IMPACT accepted them while SIPTU and the IEI did not. The matter was then referred to the Labour Court which stated that in the view of the court paragraph 6(15) &ldquo;is a comprehensive statement of justification for the proposed reorganisation as it affects engineers. It should be accepted as such by the unions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The procedures employed in respect of this matter were quite exhaustive and it is now the responsibility of local authorities to implement the recommendations in the best way possible within their organisations. I am satisfied it will not have the effect on the planning system which some planners have predicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the industrial relations problem which currently exists in South Dublin County Council where planners are not responding to telephone calls from the public? If people enter the planning profession, what are their chances of promotion in view of the cap which has been put in place? Has the Minister held discussions with the Minister for Education and Science on the possible expansion of the number of college places available to planning students in UCD? Some 45 people have applied to do the course, yet only 20 places are available. Planning is essential to this country's future, a fact of which the Minister is well aware given the number of initiatives he has introduced. If planning is not given due recognition, that will have a negative impact on the profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of this issue which forms part of the Government's action on housing programme drawn up on foot of the two recent Bacon reports. I have held discussions with the Minister for Education and Science in regard to the possible expansion of the number of college places. I have also held direct discussions with the relevant Department in UCD and my departmental officials have discussed the matter with representatives of Dublin Institute of Technology. It is envisaged that the number of places available on planning courses in these two institutions will be increased.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</askee>
      <Quest>when the proposed levy on plastic bags will come into operation; the steps being taken to ensure that retailers provide shoppers with alternatives to plastic bags; if he intends to apply the levy, on a pro rata basis, to other larger plastics bags, such as those used for fertilisers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18845/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a public consultation process regarding the 1999 consultancy report on plastic shopping bags, I recently brought proposals to Government with regard to the implementation of our commitment to tax such bags. The Government has agreed to the introduction by the Revenue Commissioners of a levy to be imposed on the manufacture in Ireland, or the importation into Ireland, of plastic shopping bags for use in the Irish market. The proposed levy will be at a rate such that, when VAT and retailers' costs are included, it will result in a flat cost to consumers of 10p per bag. This levy will be complemented by a requirement on retailers to apply an equivalent charge per bag.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the proposed levy requires enabling primary legislation. Requisite legislative provisions are being regarded as a matter of priority and will be incorporated into the earliest available legislative vehicle. It is my intention that the proposed levy will be introduced early next year.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the proposed measure is to directly influence consumer behaviour and achieve a significant reduction in the consumption of plastic shopping bags dispensed at retail outlets as their current widespread use is unnecessary and is a primary source of litter. I make a distinction between such bags and plastic bags used as primary packaging for products such as fertiliser. I do no have proposals at this time to levy such primary packaging.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for decision by retailers whether and to what extent they are prepared to provide customers with alternatives to plastic shopping bags. It is of course open to customers to utilise reusable bags or other containers for shopping purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister depart from the recommendation contained in the consultant's report to the effect that this charge should be levied on supermarkets and the suppliers of plastic bags rather than consumers? Why has the Minister now decided to impose the charge on the consumer? Does the Minister agree that the type of primary packaging such as plastic fertiliser bags to which he referred causes huge environmental problems and has, in particular, caused huge land drainage and flooding problems in recent years? The Minister drew a distinction between primary packaging and plastic shopping bags. Does he intend to levy a charge in regard to unnecessary plastic packaging on products <Col N="985" /> such as sliced bread, meat, fruit and other products?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a waste of time and energy to levy this charge at source as it is consumers who are responsible for the bags ending up as visible litter pollutants caught in flagpoles, ditches, hedges, telephone poles or lying on the roadside, along canal and river banks, etc. It is the end customer, not the retailer, who is causing the pollution. The imposition of a charge at source would not have any effect from a litter point of view and this levy is primarily an anti-litter measure.</P>
      <P>On primary packaging such as fertiliser bags and land drainage, I am aware of the problems to which the Deputy referred, particularly in County Galway. There was huge concern about this matter at one stage. There has been an improvement in this area since those incidents occurred. It was silage wrapping rather than fertiliser bags which allegedly caused the problems in Galway. The Irish Film Producers Packaging Association has a fantastic record on the re-use and recycling of such plastics.</P>
      <P>In regard to the differentiation between so-called biodegradable shopping bags and ordinary shopping bags, it does not matter to members of the public or make a difference to the litter problem whether a plastic bag which is fluttering in the breeze is biodegradable as it is still an unsightly piece of litter. The biodegradable bags have the advantage of disintegrating over a period of three, four or six months, but members of the public or tourists would not find it any more acceptable to see biodegradable plastic bags fluttering in the breeze. It would be extremely difficult to make a distinction&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, in common with other Ministers, to initiate discussions with a range of professional representative groups in relation to the cost of fees as part of the Government's anti-inflationary package. In particular, my Department will have discussions with the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute and the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers regarding <Col N="986" /> auctioneer fees or housing transactions. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will initiate discussions with the Law Society regarding solicitors' fees.</P>
      <P>I am aware that rising house and property prices have meant rising fee incomes for many professionals working in the property area. However, there is competition in the market for the professional services of solicitors and auctioneers and people can avail of savings by exploring the various options open to them. People can obtain better value by shopping around for professional services and should be encouraged to do so. Indeed, I understand that percentage-based auctioneers' fees have decreased somewhat in recent years. Nevertheless, it is important that all professional and representative bodies recognise the need for a sense of social responsibility and restraint in the setting of prices and fees and this will be strongly conveyed to them in the upcoming discussions which will be held urgently.</P>

Similarly, since the introduction of the Act, recommended scales of fees in respect of services provided by solicitors have ceased to apply. It must be accepted that there is increased competition in the market for auctioneers which shows there is an opportunity for benefits to be gained by the purchasing public from shopping around.</P>

      <P>Unlike some other professions that charge fees on the basis of time spent working on a person's behalf, auctioneers' fees are payable on completion of a successful transaction, that is the sale of the property. If a sale does not proceed, an auctioneer does not charge for the time spent on trying to sell the property. The only costs that are chargeable are direct costs incurred such as newspaper advertisements and so on. Changes to the current fee structure would require careful consideration, as to charge on the basis of time, could lead to increased costs for vendors who are the only party subject to auctioneers' fees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's Environment: A Millennium report concludes that, overall, Ireland's environmental quality remains relatively good in comparison with that of most other European countries. The report also recognises that economic growth is placing increasing pressure on the environment as can be seen, for example, in <Col N="989" /> eutrophication of inland waters, growing waste volumes and rising greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Eutrophication is identified as perhaps Ireland's most serious environmental problem. The phosphorous regulations made in 1998, record levels of investment in water services under the new national development plan, development of catchment management strategies, use of nutrient management planning, phase-out of phosphate-based domestic laundry detergents and implementation of REPS are among the key measures we are taking to secure and maintain good water quality.</P>
      <P>The regional waste management plans being developed within our policy framework, Changing Our Ways, will be integrated strategies building on the recognised hierarchy of prevention, minimisation, reuse/recycling and, finally, safe disposal. Some £650 million is earmarked for capital investment in waste management infrastructure under the national plan.</P>
      <P>On climate change, we have a challenging target under the Kyoto Protocol. I will shortly bring to Government for approval a national greenhouse gas abatement strategy to set the framework for meeting Ireland's Kyoto target. The EPA report recognises that individuals, through choices in their daily lives, can play a major role in helping to protect and enhance the environment. The national environmental awareness campaign aims at getting this message across.</P>
      <P>The report makes a major contribution to awareness and debate on the environment and on sustainable development in Ireland. It will inform and guide policy making and individual action in these areas in the years ahead.</P>

Is he not ashamed that the EU continues to take infringement proceedings against us for breaches of EU Directives? Is he not concerned about the rising air pollution in our cities particularly Pm10s? Does the Minister accept that people are dying in our cities because of air pollution? Does he accept the WHO findings that more people are dying from car emissions than from car accidents? What is he doing about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Kyoto commitments, the Minister said &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; but I note in his press release on the publication of this document that he said &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; again and that was in April. When will he bring the national greenhouse abatement strategy to Cabinet and when will he publish it? Does the Minister accept that we have no chance of complying with the Kyoto commitments and is <Col N="990" /> that not another source of shame for him and another indictment&mdash;</P>

      <Quest>if, in regard to his Department's document, Action on Housing, he will outline when the series of project offices will be established to fast-track infrastructural development in the proposed SDZs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18643/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of strategic development zones or SDZs is to ensure a much greater degree of certainty both in securing planning permission and the time horizon involved in relation to development that is of strategic economic and social importance to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While candidate SDZs for housing development were listed in the recently published review of the housing market, decisions have not yet been taken on suitable sites. Such sites can only be designated by Government order following commencement of the Planning and Development Bill. The selection of sites will have regard to objective criteria including the capacity of the site to deliver a significant quantity of housing, the availability of necessary services such as water, sewerage, roads and public transport and the planning status of the land in question. My Department will shortly commence a series of <Col N="992" /> detailed consultations with local authorities to determine what sites could best be developed using the SDZ process so that decisions can be taken by the Government at the earliest possible date following commencement of the Bill. It is my intention that the necessary arrangements will be finalised to ensure that project offices for the SDZs can be established as soon as sites are designated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The SDZs were represented in the Bacon report and the Government statement which followed it as a way of speeding up planning for residential development. If the Government has not yet made decisions on the designation of areas as SDZs and is only now commencing a process of consultation, is it not the case that these SDZs will be part of a longer process than planning applications submitted to the planning process in the normal way for residential development? Can the Minister indicate when he expects the Government to announce areas to be covered by SDZs and when he expects the first SDZs to be designated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is all about making residential development happen faster than it would under the normal planning process. If the Government is serious about doing this and it is not just a ruse for circumventing the normal planning process rather than getting residential development fast-tracked, it seems strange to me that the Minister is not in a position, three weeks after publication of the Bacon report, to indicate when the Government will make an announcement about SDZs or where they will be? Can the Minister give us an approximate date for when the Government will make the order for SDZs? When does he expect this to be done? The Bill has already been passed in the Houses.</P>

A number of possible sites were identified in the report entitled The Housing Market in Ireland: An Economic Evaluation of Trends and Prospects, which was published last week. However, the Deputy need have no fears. If the normal planning process is faster for any particular application then I am sure that process will be used by local authorities. This measure is meant to facilitate bringing into use land for residential development over a period of time, but it cannot happen overnight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's target under the Kyoto Protocol is to limit the net increase in emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases to 13% above 1990 levels in the period 2008 to 2012.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of measures are currently in place to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the transport, residential, industrial, agricultural, waste and commercial sectors. These are outlined in Ireland's second national communication under <Col N="994" /> the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Since the preparation of this report in July 1997, there have been a number of further policy developments which, <i>inter alia</i>, address climate change.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming national greenhouse gas abatement strategy will provide the necessary framework for Ireland's response to our Kyoto obligation. Within this framework, a range of integrated and mutually reinforcing measures will be implemented over the coming decade to ensure achievement of Ireland's Kyoto target. The strategy will be subject to policies and regular review and progress will be monitored by reference to a comprehensive set of indicators.</P>
    <P>Preparation of the strategy has included widespread consultation, following publication of a consultancy study on the limitation and reduction of COf7&gt;2 and other greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland, undertaken on behalf of my Department and the Department of Public Enterprise. Public submissions on this study, a discussion forum I held to address the issues arising and sectoral concerns addressed to me have been utilised in its development. In addition, last year I invited Comhar, the National Sustainable Development Partnership, to consider and make recommendations on the draft strategy. Having regard to the views of Comhar and to interdepartmental input through the environmental network of Government Departments, I will shortly bring the strategy to Government for consideration. Following Government approval it will be published, and we will put all necessary measures in place to ensure implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the conclusion in the EPA report that the increase in emissions which we are allowed under the Kyoto Protocol will not be 13% but will be closer to 30%?</P>
      <P>What is the cause of the delay in presenting the national greenhouse gas abatement strategy? In reply to a parliamentary question on 25 May, the Minister told me the draft was being finalised for presentation as a matter of urgency. Has the draft been completed, when will it be presented to Government and when will we see it? The Minister has been in office for three years and greenhouse gas emissions are going beyond the very generous levels to which we committed ourselves in the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Most sectors affected by the protocol regard it as much too stringent. The Deputy's party spoke in terms of 20% when the then Government was involved in negotiations. I had that reduced to 13%. The target is stringent and it will be difficult to meet it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> There is no delay. Normal consultation is taking place prior to the production of the draft document. These consultations are nearing conclusion. I hope to finalise the strategy, bring it to Government in the coming weeks and publish it as quickly as possible thereafter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree there is no point in negotiating lower limits if it is obvious we cannot achieve them? The real issue is his failure and the failure of his Department and the Government to take the difficult political decisions to achieve the targets we have set ourselves. Unless we are prepared to take difficult decisions, the level of emissions allowed, whether 13% or 30%, will be irrelevant. Have the difficult political decisions been taken on this matter? </P>

Data are constantly being updated and on the basis of sound reliable scientific data the difficult decisions on measures to be taken in various sectors will be taken. There is no point in taking so-called difficult decisions if they are not based on scientific data. This is the basis of the draft document. As soon as it is published Deputies will see that hard decisions have been made. I look forward to the support of all Deputies for those decisions.</P>

Will the Minister make a statement on this <Col N="996" /> matter? Will he capitulate to the IBEC and other sectoral interests who do not wish to see a carbon tax?

      <P>Does the Minister agree that when something becomes scarce, it becomes more expensive and that the real issue is that there is no incentive for people to enter into the business of providing proper rented accommodation? Is he also aware that, as a result of a lack of policy in this area, more tenants living in private rented accommodation are being evicted on a daily basis by District Courts, particularly around this city? I can quote the Minister examples. Rent for a semi-detached three bedroom house went from £400 per month, with health board subsidy, to £1,000 per month. The courts are granting eviction orders against those tenants and they are ending up on local authority housing lists. The Minister does not need a commission.

Whatever action we take will be based on full and careful consideration of the various options that might be open to the Government. As I have already said, I expect the work of the commission will be very helpful in those deliberations and will influence, I hope, to some extent, whatever policy decisions we make in this area.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied to continue with the present system. The law in regard to the letting of rented property has to be changed. The difficulty is to ensure that in making changes and in giving security of tenure to tenants that we do not do so in a way which drives landlords out of this business.

There has been an outstanding response to that. Many thousands of accommodation units are in the pipeline, some are under way and others are in the planning pro<Col N="1000" /> cess. This will result in a substantial number of units being built which will be dedicated to providing accommodation for students in or near the campuses of third level colleges. I encourage those colleges which have not encouraged this type of development to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 prioritises a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents. It establishes quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principal of which is to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997. Priority is accorded by the strategy to actions targeted at speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing. A timetable for key actions in these and other areas is also set out.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy is monitored by the high level group on road safety whose first progress report in July 1999, <i>inter alia</i>, details progress with these key actions. Copies of that report were circulated to all Deputies and are also available in the Library. A second progress report, incorporating updated information on key actions, will be published next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Good progress has been made in the first two years of the strategy's operation towards the pri<Col N="1001" /> mary target of reducing road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002. By end 1999, road deaths had been reduced by nearly 13% relative to 1997 and serious injuries from road accidents had been reduced by over 15%.</P>
    <P>Progress is also ahead of target in providing low cost accident measures on the national road network with nearly 300 schemes now likely to be completed by end 2000. On the other hand, recent NRA surveys have shown that considerable improvement will be needed in order to achieve road safety targets for reduction of speeding and increase in seat belt wearing.</P>
    <P>Garda enforcement activity has been intensified and improved in accordance with the road safety strategy. Over 170,000 on-the-spot fines issued in relation to speeding offences in 1999, and more than 70,000 in the first four months of this year. Fixed speed cameras are in operation in the Dublin and eastern regions. More than 50,000 on-the-spot fines have been issued for non-wearing of seat belts since the introduction of this measure in July 1999.</P>
    <P>The road safety strategy envisages a penalty points system as a key measure in support of road safety enforcement. The scheme of a new road traffic Bill is being drafted in my Department with the principal purpose of providing for this penalty points system. However, the design of the system has, as stated in the strategy, required careful consideration because of the exclusive constitutional role of the Irish courts in the administration of justice. Following protracted examination of this legal issue, I expect to be in a position to submit legislative proposals to Government before the summer recess with a view to the earliest possible publication of a Bill after that date. I am referring to the Government's recess before the end of July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State has at last given a date for the submission of these proposals to Government because his reply is virtually identical to that he gave on 25 May.</P>
      <P>How many drivers do not have a driving licence? What is the Minister of State doing to address the industrial relations problems in the driver testing area of his Department which are restricting the number of driving tests and the number of people obtaining driving licences? Does he agree one of the major contributing factors to the number of deaths on roads is the fact that up to 25% of drivers are not qualified to drive?</P>

      <P>Part of the Deputy's question would be more appropriate to a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is about road safety.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy that information separately. I do not have that information with me as the question refers to the penalty points system. In case Deputies get the wrong impression, even though the Bill is finalised, in practice it will be possible to implement the penalty points system only when the national driver licence file is fully computerised. Completion of that project is forecast for the end of 2001. The strategy did not give a specific date as regards the penalty points system because certain legal issues had to be examined arising from the constitutional separation of the Judiciary and the Legislature. Hopefully those issues are being worked out and I expect to bring legislation before the House after the summer recess.</P>
      <P>The strategy also deals with other aspects of road traffic legislation. However, implementation cannot be expected immediately on the passing of a road traffic Bill as it will depend on the new computerisation system. Unfortunately that system is taking some time to put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister of State well in his efforts to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on the roads. We all have a responsibility to support measures which help to achieve that aim. Does the Minister of State agree that, while there is much concentration on speeding, which is one of the main causes of accidents, little action is being taken with regard to dangerous driving?</P>
      <P>A person can drive at 50 or 60 miles per hour within the speed limit but in a reckless manner, overtaking at dangerous points, and get away with it. However, one can be fined £50 for driving at five miles per hour over a motorway speed limit at 6 a.m. I have seen lunatics on the road overtaking at dangerous points which could lead to serious accidents. Are there any proposals for additional mobile patrols to watch for dangerous driving and to take immediate action against drivers where it occurs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's comments. Part of the Government's road safety strategy is that there would be a substantial increase in Garda enforcement of road traffic regulations. There is a fairly extensive range of offences and the law is quite strong. I am sure the Deputy will have seen reports, and from the figures I have given in reply to this question, that there has been a very significant increase in the level of Garda activity enforcing road traffic regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to speeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The enforcement level has increased substantially. The Garda has substantially increased the number of highly visible vehicles on the roads and the Minister for Justice, <Col N="1003" /> Equality and Law Reform has substantially increased investment in this area. This is part of the Government's strategy and is outlined in the published programme. Annual reports on progress will be compiled.</P>
      <P>The more Garda manpower and vehicles that can be provided the greater level of efficiency it will achieve in terms of enforcement. However, we must appeal to our fellow citizens to exercise due caution when on the roads. This involves a personal decision but, unfortunately, younger drivers form the largest category of drivers who suffer serious injury and death. I must appeal for more care by all road users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>If speeding is the primary problem, is it not possible to introduce governors into cars which would prevent them going over 70 miles per hour? Surely that is the most logical approach. When will a proper penalty points system be introduced which would act as a disincentive for reckless drivers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been answering the second part of the Deputy's question concerning the penalty points system. Legislation is being finalised but the implementation also depends on the computerisation of driver licence records. That will be towards the end of 2001.</P>
      <P>There are governors in some commercial vehicles and there are arguments for and against such a measure. In some cases I am sure the lack of ability to accelerate could be a problem. A Member of the House lost his life in a car accident which resulted from a similar situation. I would require detailed scientific and professional advice on this measure before recommending it to Government. However, we could examine the issue.</P>

I understand contract documents for the scheme are being finalised by Waterford County Council for submission to my Department. On receipt the Department will ensure they are approved as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Delays in progressing the scheme arose in the first instance in relation to foreshore licensing requirements. This in turn led to a review of the scheme to take account of, <i>inter alia</i>, the EU <Col N="1004" /> urban waste water treatment directive that had come into force since the original proposals were drawn up and to address additional capacity requirements emanating from the Waterford county development plan.</P>
    <P>At this point, all outstanding issues have been addressed and it is hoped the local authority will be in a position to invite tenders for the collection system before the end of the year and for the treatment plant next year. Construction is expected to begin in late 2000 or early 2001, with completion by early 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>On reflection, I feel that in this instance it would be wiser to use the original provision laid out in the Bill. Under the rules of evidence written words would never be excluded simply on the ground that they are written on paper. The approach of section 22 is similar in that electronic communications would not be inadmissible as evidence on the sole grounds that they are in electronic form. Electronic communications and information will, however, still continue to be subject to all the usual exclusionary rules of evidence, including the &ldquo;best evidence&rdquo; rule which serves to exclude information which is not regarded as relevant or reliable by the courts.</P>
      <P>The essence of the rule is that evidence presented to the court should be the best evidence available of the matter under consideration. This common-law rule requires the parties seeking to rely on the contents of a document to adduce primary evidence of those contents, that is, the original document in question. The contents of a document may be proved by secondary evidence if the original has been destroyed or cannot be found after a search.</P>
      <P>The essence of it is that the court has discretion on such matters. I just could not get at the kernel of Deputy Yates's amendment. I would be interested to hear what he has to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision as it stands refers to the &ldquo;best evidence&rdquo; rule of evidence. This is a common law rule requiring the parties seeking to rely on a document to adduce the original document in question. The rule does not apply if the original has been destroyed or is otherwise impossible to trace. The application of the rule to proving electronic dealings is awkward. Where a hard copy document has been scanned and transmitted, for instance, a technical certificate to goods in a sale of goods transaction, it requires the obtaining of the original hard copy. Where a document was originally generated and transmitted in electronic form, identifying the original is difficult and pointless. If a court has no doubts as to the reliability of a copy, be it in an electronic <Col N="1007" /> version or of a document, the &ldquo;best evidence&rdquo; rule creates a pointless exercise. That is why the rule was abolished in criminal law by section 30 of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992. Under that section, a copy of a document authenticated in such manner as the court may approve may be given in evidence.</P>
      <P>Section 22 seems to enshrine the &ldquo;best evidence&rdquo; rule. If there is an original hard copy, one can rely on an electronic version only if one can satisfy the court that the electronic version of it was the best evidence one could reasonably be expected to obtain. The whole balance of this provision is against the use of electronic versions. They are the poor relation. My amendment instead prevents a court refusing to admit an electronic version &ldquo;on the sole ground that it is not in its original form&rdquo;. If the court has other grounds for refusing to admit an electronic version, for instance because some doubt has been raised as its accuracy or authenticity, then the court may require production of the original.</P>
      <P>I am told that in the criminal law what I am proposing is now practice and that this allows the court to take a common-sense view of it. My proposal is pro-electronic commerce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that. However, section 16(1) of the Bill as amended in the Seanad states:</P>
      <P>If by law or otherwise a person or public body is required (whether the requirement is in the form of an obligation or consequences flow from the information not being presented or retained in its original form) or permitted to present or retain information in its original form, then, subject to subsection (2), the information may be presented or retained, as the case may be, in electronic form, whether as an electronic communication or otherwise.</P>
      <P>This section provides that where there is a requirement to present or retain information in its original form, that original form information can be presented or retained in electronic form. This section is intended to apply to situations where there is a requirement for information to be presented or retained in its original form and is to be distinguished from situations where there is a requirement to retain or produce a paper document. That is dealt with in section 17 which sets out the minimum acceptable form requirement. I appreciate the point the Deputy is trying to put forward.</P>

      <P>I could. I do not have the documentation with me, but I remember it distinctly. We accepted that in good faith. Subsequently, we received a communication from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform informing us that it directly contravened section 30 of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992. I mentioned it before the break because I thought it was important to do so. I have to accept what the Department says in that regard because I do not know enough about that Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that at some stage the officials may have given the impression that this legislation would deal with hearsay in the context of admissibility of evidence in courts. Essentially the hearsay rule provides that out-of-court statements are not admissible. This is a real problem in the field of record keeping. It means that many records cannot be relied upon to prove facts recorded in them. For instance, if a call centre employee records on a computer that a particular customer ordered £1,000 worth of goods and later that must be proved because the customer denies ordering the goods, it is not permissible to rely on the computer record to prove the order. It is necessary for the employee to give oral testimony in court. That employee may, however, be untraceable by the time the proceedings take place or may simply not be able to recall one telephone call among many. With the expansion of electronic record keeping there are many other scenarios where the same problem arises. Ireland is the only common law country which has not tackled this problem. The Department intimated that when the draft heads of the Bill were published in January, the head in relation to admissibility of evidence &ldquo;will also need to be expanded when interaction of the legislation with the hearsay rule is being considered in greater detail&rdquo;. Is there an explanation why it is not dealt with?</P>

      <P>The proposal is to establish an appeals board for on-line transactions in the same way that a small claims court operates for off-line arbitration of disputes.

We already have a number of initiatives in place in terms of business-consumer arbitration, including the European extra-judicial network and associated clearing houses. A pilot project to bring the small claims procedure on-line in respect of disputed consumer transactions in relation to goods or services is being considered by the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, and by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="1010" /> Reform under the information society action plan.

      <P>In page 18, before section 23, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;23.&ndash;All provisions of existing defamation law shall apply to all electronic communications within the State, including the retention of information electronically.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to apply the defamation law on-line as well as off-line in the context of stories carried on the Internet, etc. I understand the Defamation Act, 1961, deals with this area and there are ancient non-statutory common law rules, but there is no case law in Ireland in relation to defamation principles on the Internet. There was a case, but apparently the defendant pleaded guilty and it did not get to court. The Department is relying on the English High Court decision in the Godfrey <i>v</i>. Demon Internet case of 26 March 1999. I would like an assurance from the Minister that the Attorney General is satisfied that defamation law applies equally to the Internet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very interesting because when we examined this again this morning, and read the explanation, I immediately said &ldquo;there is no precedent in Irish law&rdquo;. There was a court case, but the defendant pleaded guilty. There is a precedent in the UK &ndash; the decision of the English High Court of 26 March 1999 in Godfrey <i>v</i>. Demon Internet &ndash; but we just cannot take such precedent. It is likely that Irish courts will hold that defamation principles apply equally to the Internet. We will have to wait until there is an Irish precedent. In the UK case the judge said the defendant Internet service provider was analogous to a bookseller or publishers who sold defamatory materials. The judge said that publication of defamatory matter will occur each time a person accesses it on the Internet. I am inclined to take the point of view of Deputies Yates and Coveney in this matter. We do not have Irish case law, and we will see if the English precedent becomes the precedent here. I will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I will withdraw the amendment. I flew it as a kite because I feel very strongly that the final aspect of liberalisation and regulation is the unbundling of the local loop.

There should be no incentives to engage in cybersquatting which should be made illegal.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Taoiseach has appealed to the World Intellectual Property Organisation, to which everyone can have recourse, on the issue of bertieahern.com.</P>
      <P>Section 30, as it stands, provides powers for the Minister of the day to regulate domain name registration in Ireland and, if necessary, these regulations would be used to tackle the issue of cybersquatting on dot ie addresses, in respect of which cybersquatting has not been an issue because they can be registered only by persons or companies associated with them. Other domain registration addresses such as dot com are not controlled from within the State. This is a global issue and organisations such as Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers is examining methods to deal with the problem in a global context. It is interesting to note that in the first case of its kind in the State an Irish firm of solicitors succeeded in recovering rights to an associated dot com address registered by another Irish company.</P>
      <P>As regards amendment No. 39, the Office of Attorney General has advised that the current limit for penalties for summary offences remains at £1,500. My Department does not have the power to change it. The possibility of revising it is being examined by the Office of the Attorney General which, in turn, will advise the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>As regards amendment No. 40, section 30 as currently worded provides powers for the Minister of the day to make regulations on the right of appeal and appeal processes in relation to domain name registration in Ireland. I propose to address the matter at that stage.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for the making of <i>ex gratia</i> payments of £20,000 to the former employees of the Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited or their personal representatives. Former employees or their representatives will apply for the <i>ex gratia</i> payment. Applications will be reviewed by an interdepartmental committee and each eligible applicant will be paid £20,000.</P>
      <P>The Irish Hospital Sweepstakes was established in 1930 and was promoted by a private company, Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited, in pursuance of a standing agreement with a sweepstake committee appointed by the governing bodies of various hospitals. The Hospitals' Trust Fund was used to channel the net proceeds of the sweepstakes to hospitals for capital purposes. Statutory responsibility for the Hospitals' Trust Fund was with the Minister for Health and that for the running of the sweepstakes by Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited with the Minister for Justice. Overall responsibility for pensions in the private sector rests with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sales of sweepstakes reached a peak of £18 million in 1961 but then declined until for the three years 1980-82 total sales were only £23.1 million. The expenses as a percentage of the proceeds came to exceed the statutory maximum of 40%. The bulk of the income had come from outside the State, and this had declined severely as legal gambling opportunities arose elsewhere. <Col N="1016" /> The Hospitals' Sweepstakes made various proposals for new weekly draws but the approval of the Minister for Justice was not forthcoming, mainly because it was considered the draws would interfere with and cause unfair competition with existing lotteries supporting worthy causes.</P>
    <P>The entire workforce, then some 150 persons, were given notice of redundancy in January 1987 and received statutory redundancy payments. The Labour Court in 1987 recommended payment of redundancy of two weeks pay per year of service in addition to the statutory payments already made. This was rejected by the company on the grounds of inability to pay. Although there was a company pension scheme, most of the persons concerned accepted a once-off lump sum of a few thousand pounds in lieu of the small pensions that were available. They are now dependent on the State old age pension.</P>
    <P>In December 1990 the Public Hospitals (Amendment) Act enabled the Minister for Health to take over approximately £481,000 in unclaimed sweepstakes prize money, together with accrued interest, for distribution to former employees of the company. The money was distributed in 1990 and 1991 to the former employees generally regarded as the most seriously disadvantaged when the company ceased operating.</P>
    <P>The staff made redundant in 1987 were the only employees of the company who did not receive any compensation over and above statutory redundancy entitlements, apart from a tiny pension or a small lump sum. All other groups of employees of the company who were made redundant prior to 1987 received compensation in the form of enhanced redundancy lump sums and enhanced pensions. Accordingly, this Bill is directed towards the staff who were made redundant in 1987. It provides that they receive a once-off and final payment from the Exchequer of £20,000 each. Some 147 former employees who were made redundant benefited from the Department of Health scheme in 1990-91. It is expected that the number of beneficiaries of this scheme will be similar and the cost to the Exchequer will be somewhat less than £3 million.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that these <i>ex gratia </i>payments do not involve setting a precedent for former employees in other organisations, either public or private. There are several unique features which distinguish the former employees from others. While the employees were employed by a private company, statutory responsibility for running the sweepstakes by Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited rested with the Minister for Justice. The existence of this company was dependent on the Hospitals' Trust Fund, which was used to disburse the net proceeds of the sweepstakes to hospitals. Statutory responsibility for this fund rested with the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>Those employees who remained with the company until it closed received only their statutory redundancy entitlements, supplemented by a tiny <Col N="1017" /> occupational pension or the alternative of a small lump sum. Most of them opted to accept the lump sum which means they are dependent on their old age pension. While more than 30 of these former employees have since died, the majority are single women living in very poor circumstances. I am confident that no other group of former employees of other organisations could claim that their circumstances are similar to those of the sweepstakes employees who were made redundant in 1987.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to establish a mechanism which will enable <i>ex gratia</i> payments to be made to former employees of Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited. Section 1 is an interpretation section and defines the terms in the Bill. The term &ldquo;former employee&rdquo; is defined as a person who was employed by the company for a period of which not less than 104 weeks was a period of continuous employment within the meaning of Schedule III of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, and continued to be employed until 1987. The term &ldquo;personal representative&rdquo; has the same meaning as in the Succession Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that payment may be made to the former employee or, in the case of a deceased employee, to a personal representative. This section also identifies the level of payment at £20,000. Section 3 provides for the appointment of a committee to advise and assist the Minister in implementing the provisions of the Act. The membership of the committee will comprise two officers from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and one officer each from the Department of Finance and the Department of Health and Children. The remainder of the section deals with the position of chairman of the committee, the quorum for meetings, filling of vacancies, regulation of business and the dissolution of the committee.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that applications must be made within two months of the passing of the Act, although this may be extended by the Minister. Such information as the Minister may require to process the application must be provided. Where applications are refused the applicant must be so notified in writing and the reasons for the refusal must be given. Applicants must be informed that they can appeal the decision within 21 days. Appeals against such refusals may be made within 21 days. The Minister must consider such appeals and notify the applicant of the final decision and the reasons for this decision.</P>
    <P>Section 5 prohibits the giving of false information in relation to an application for payment. It provides for a maximum fine of £1,000, but recognises that certain defences are available. Section 6 provides that applications for payment must be referred to the committee. The committee ascertain whether the applicant is a former employee. If the former employee is not the applicant, the committee must verify the status of the applicant in relation to the former employee. This section provides that the committee report <Col N="1018" /> to the Minister on its investigations and activities. The section also provides that the committee can require applicants to answer questions and provide information and documents relevant to the application.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that in the case of a deceased former employee, payment will be made to the personal representative.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that administrative expenses incurred by the Minister will be paid from moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 9 is a formal section which provides the Short Title.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents the final chapter in the ongoing saga concerning the treatment of a small group of Sweepstakes workers who were made redundant in 1987. The perception is widespread that these workers were badly dealt with both by their former employer and the State. The Bill vindicates the campaign of these former employees for a generous gesture by Government. It is hoped that these former employees will take some satisfaction from this <i>ex gratia</i> payment.</P>
    <P>In particular, I salute the efforts of the representative of the Sweepstakes workers, Mr. John Slevin. If it was not for his determination and for the fact that he was so resolute and such a good campaigner for the former workers, I doubt we would have legislation of this kind before us today. Those former workers, in particular, owe him a great deal of gratitude.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to be in a position to bring the Bill before the House and to ensure that a group of very vulnerable people, who were done a grave injustice in my view, can now get some satisfaction from what is happening. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an old saying &ldquo;better late than never&rdquo;, and if ever that applied to something, it applies to this legislation. Eventually under this legislation former workers of the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes will be paid an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of £20,000.</P>
      <P>I understand there are about 147 who will benefit. Most of these staff who worked in the Sweepstakes were women and many of them were widows. My mother was widowed early, as were many of her friends, and the only work they could find was in the Sweepstakes. They had to work hard for a very low wage and many of them suffered when the Sweepstakes closed down. I am very glad we are passing this legislation today in order to make this <i>ex gratia</i> payment. No doubt it does not make up fully for what they suffered, but it is heartening to know that people who have fought long and hard for 14 years, quietly and often without much recognition, will now see that they will get their entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Sweepstakes closed down in 1985-6, a derisory pension of £2 per week was paid to many of those people or a lump sum of £4,000 to £5,000 in lieu of the pension. Obviously at that time some people took that lump sum instead of the £2 per week because they probably had bills to pay, etc. The pension fund established in the <Col N="1019" /> Irish Hospital Sweepstakes was totally inadequate and underfunded when the Sweepstakes closed down, and of course then the Revenue Commissioners moved in to take about half of the money available in capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the sequence of events was that the former workers decided to take the matter to the Labour Court. They won a ruling from the Labour Court that they should be paid two weeks pay for each year of service. That looked reasonably hopeful to the former workers, who felt that the State had benefited so much from the activities of the Sweepstakes.</P>
    <P>The State benefited from the Sweepstakes to the tune of £35 million in stamp duty on the Sweepstakes prize fund, £135 million for its hospital building &ndash; in the 57 years of the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes, that was a valuable sum and £7.7 million as a direct result of the Sweepstakes closure. The State benefited from large volumes of foreign currency at a time when that was very hard to come by and helped the balance of payments deficit at that time. The State also benefited from industries set up on the back of the Sweepstakes success such as Waterford Crystal, Irish Glass and the bloodstock industry.</P>
    <P>Therefore the former workers were right, the State had been the main beneficiary of their work, and they rightly thought when they got the award from the Labour Court that the State would assist in the payment of the award. As the House will be aware, the State was unable to do so. In Parliamentary Questions from Deputy Gregory and the then Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla, the then Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, who is now our esteemed Leas-Cheann Comhairle, indicated that &ldquo;It is not open to the Hospital's Trust Board to divert any of the net proceeds of the sale . . .&rdquo;, which, I understand, resulted in revenue of £6 million to the State, to benefit the redundant Sweepstakes workers. He also stated: &ldquo;Neither is it open to me as Minister for Health to divert any such funds for this purpose or to instruct the board to do so.&rdquo;  He went on to say that he had great sympathy with the workers but, as the House will be aware, one cannot live on sympathy.</P>
    <P>Again two months later, on 21 May 1989, Parliamentary Questions were tabled to the Minister by Deputies from his side of the House, Deputies Andrews and Stafford. The reply appeared to open a little chink of light in the sense that the Minister stated that &ldquo;Present indications are that amending legislation would be required to secure their disposal&rdquo;, meaning the disposal of the assets out of which perhaps the redundant workers could be paid. However, the Minister went on to state: &ldquo;It is unlikely that any such funds could be diverted to augment redundancy payments for former employees of Hospital Trust (1940) Limited.&rdquo;. Somebody in the then Department of Health was at least taking some interest by saying that present indications were that amending legislation would be required. That, again, probably <Col N="1020" /> gave a glimmer of hope that somebody might do something.</P>
    <P>Then, in 1992, the same Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, introduced the Public Hospitals (Amendment) Bill, 1990. That Bill was introduced specifically in order that the disbursement of the money belonging to the Hospitals' Trust could be used for paying the Labour Court award but sadly, as I said in my summary, that money was not sufficient to pay the award to the redundant workers. Once again, their hopes and wishes were dashed and they had to accept it.</P>
    <P>The long struggle to find a way to get their just rewards for their work of so many years continued when it was discovered when the money available would not cover the Labour Court award. Some people had 40 years service with the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes and they felt very hard done by.</P>
    <P>There was a promise in the Fianna Fáil Government document in 1990 that this matter would be addressed and, in fairness to the then Government, the Bill to which I referred, which was introduced on 5 November 1992, did appear to make an effort to pay the money due. Regrettably no Government since 1990, that is, the Governments of Fianna Fáil, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party, and the Rainbow Government, really tackled the issue in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>It is as if the matter has come full circle, for the moment anyway, to a Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats variation on the theme. It may be an endangered species, but I must at least give credit where it is due. This Government, having put it into its programme for the millennium, could have provided for it in the 1999 budget. Although it failed to take the initiative at that stage, I warmly welcome today's commitment from the Tánaiste in the form of the Bill. It was probably her personal interest in, and commitment to, righting a wrong which drove this legislation forward.I warmly welcome the legislation and thank the Minister and the Government for delivering on their promise.</P>
    <P>Many people who will receive the money are getting on in years, so the money will be extremely useful to them for the various expenses they might encounter such as repairing their homes, increased medical or nursing care or assistance to build an extension to the family home in which they can live. There are many things on which people can spend the money. Sadly, some will not enjoy it because they have died. I welcome the reference in the Bill to personal representatives and perhaps the Minister would clarify that phrase when she replies. I take it that it means a spouse or children, be they natural or adopted, and that they would benefit. That is right, because there are probably many instances where the spouse or family of a redundant worker had to financially assist that former worker because of the derisory amount of money they received in 1987, which was £2 a week or a <Col N="1021" /> £4,000 lump sum. It is only right that the family should benefit.</P>
    <P>The time for applying to claim this money is very short. It is only two months. Will the Minister assure the House when she replies that every effort will be made to identify everyone who is eligible to be paid or their personal representatives? I assume the legislation will be signed next week by the President, which means the two month period will occur during a difficult time when people will be on holidays. It is possible that eligible people could go and stay with their children in the country or by the sea, for example, and, given their age, it could be for an extended period. I am fearful that someone from that group who has waited 14 long years for this day of celebration might not know about their eligibility and slip through the net. I pay a warm tribute to John Slevin and others who have fought this long fight. While I have no doubt the eligible people are probably identified, I want to ensure that the Minister knows where they live and that they will know how to apply. Some red tape is built into the legislation concerning applying to the committee, providing identification and providing paperwork to show that one was a bona fide member of the staff, and we can deal with those when we discuss the sections. However, it is important people know they are eligible for this payment. It is important the Minister uses the national airwaves and newspaper advertisements to alert people. There is only a small number &ndash; approximately 147 &ndash; so I hope she does that.</P>
    <P>It is a good day for the people who will gain from the legislation. It is heart-warming to read of people's delight, especially that of one of the recipients, Maureen McDonnell, whom I am sure will not mind me mentioning her by name. A very nice article was written about her in the <i>Evening Herald</i> recently. It is interesting to note that one of the things she wants to do is to go to the Galway Races. That is apt because the Minister is from Galway. I hope she has a great day and has many wins. She might even be asked into the Fianna Fáil tent, and that would be something.</P>

They did not picket to the degree others do nor shout loudly to get their just desserts. They are the winners today and we must thank them for making us do what we should have done long ago. I take no joy in saying that Governments of all hues failed this group of people. It is wonderful that so many people who gave so much to this company and did so much for the development of the fund which was used to build hospitals throughout the country know that their jobs were worth it and that the State recognises the worth of their jobs. I congratulate the many retired or redundant workers of the company, nearly all of whom are women or widows. Perhaps other groups could take a leaf out of their book and persist until they get what they want.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation brings an inglorious chapter in employment practices to an end. I commend the Minister for contriving to have the legislation enacted before the House rises for the summer recess. It is an inglorious chapter in employment history. Deputy Owen traced the background through the years and it is fair to say that the people concerned were treated shabbily by their employers and, as Deputy Owen also said, neglected by successive Governments since then. Although I sponsored the cause of these workers during the current Dáil, I am ashamed to say I did not really know about them prior to this. It is an excellent tribute to Mr. John Slevin, who I understand was a one man band in advocating the cause of these workers, that his efforts have resulted in the legislation.</P>
      <P>It is unconscionable that the promoters left the workers with nothing but statutory redundancy. Their pensions, at £2 to £3 a week, were paltry, and I am sure many workers opted for the lump sum at the time. It was described as a friendly liquidation, in so far as such a thing exists, which meant everyone else received their entitlements but not the former workers who ran the sweepstakes down the years and who were left in very difficult circumstances when employment prospects were not what they are today. We are belatedly righting a wrong.</P>
      <P>The Minister has had a difficult few weeks. I am sure that even she would admit that she brought much of it on herself. However, she has certainly made amends by bringing forward this legislation. I always knew that, at heart, she was something of a social democrat. Should she consider crossing the floor at some stage, I will be happy to intercede with my colleagues on her behalf. The legislation is worker friendly and this, along with other personal testimonials I can give on her behalf, should be enough to do the business if matters should continue as rickety as they are between the partners in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am appalled by Deputy Owen's suggestion that the former employee of the hospitals sweepstakes ought to visit the Fianna Fáil tent at the <Col N="1023" /> Galway Races. The woman would have nothing left out of the £20,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us put the memory of the Talbot workers on the record of the House. In that situation, a number of workers were retained on the public purse, although they were employed by a private company, for a very long time as a result of a decision of the Tánaiste's old nemesis, Mr. Haughey, and put in place by the ever present Mr. Ó hUiginn, who had an impressive record in implementing decisions from Talbot to Goodman to the IFSC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That precedent would have certain implications if it were to spread. However, in this case, given that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility for the legislation and the Minister for Health and Children is an indirect beneficiary through the hospital service, it seems we have no apologies to make for providing a paltry few pounds for people who dedicated their lives to what they thought was not just a job, but a worthy cause. I presume I am right in saying the former Minister, Noel Browne, the predecessor of the former <Col N="1024" /> Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, was assisted by this fund in the assault on tuberculosis in the 1940s and 1950s. I do not think we need be too concerned about that.</P>
      <P>Reasons are set out which purport to distinguish these workers from other workers and to argue it is not setting a precedent. However, as I said, I am not really persuaded by that. I do not think, in any event, it is the end of the world if, in times of relatively propitious public finances, we have a case made to us in these circumstances. An <i>ex gratia</i> payment ought to be made in the circumstances circumscribed by the legislation to workers who were badly treated. It is only right that that should be done, and I commend the Tánaiste for doing so.</P>
      <P>I would like to have seen a representative of the former workers on the committee. Mr. John Slevin, for example, probably knows a great deal more about the details, names and identities involved than either of the Departments might ever do. I hope that, even if the legislation does not provide for his membership of the committee, it will enlist his assistance to administer the fund being created here.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I have missed the definition of &ldquo;personal representative&rdquo; in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see this legislation going through the House. It remedies an injustice, albeit belatedly, and, presumably, after very many years of at least some of the people concerned finding it very difficult to make ends meet. Even at this late stage, the Bill does something to lessen the pain of the experience they had. I commend the Tánaiste for bringing the legislation before the House.</P>

      <P>This is a good day in the Dáil. I am delighted I am here to welcome this Bill and I am even more delighted that a woman Minister has introduced it. I acknowledge and congratulate the Tánaiste on expediting this and ensuring it gets through the House before the recess.</P>
      <P>As everyone has said, this has had a long and painful history. I became very aware of it through the Single Women's Association, which was one of the core groups that became affiliated to the Council for the Status of Women. Miss Traynor was a formidable spokeswoman on behalf of the women. Many members of the Single Women's Association had worked in the sweepstakes. Due to the marriage bar and the cultural climate of the time, married women were not allowed work. Only single and widowed women, therefore, worked in the sweepstakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies Owen and Rabbitte said, they had a tremendous sense of motivation and commit<Col N="1025" /> ment to the job because they saw it on the same level as voluntary work. It was so badly paid it was almost voluntary. When they lost their jobs, which were the only jobs they had for so long, they found themselves in straitened economic circumstances, which was a terrible blow for them. They then found that the redundancy payments and-or pensions being offered them were pitiful. Miss Traynor and the Single Women's Association fought that.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to Mr. John Slevin, who has consistently worked and lobbied for this, and reminded us over the years of the outstanding injustice of this and the difficult circumstances of these women. They were among the most dedicated, but also the most vulnerable and badly paid, employees in Ireland at that time. Despite this, they contributed at a high level to the upkeep of hospitals and health services when we had few other economic ways of doing so.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House because I know there is a deadline on the Bill. I feel very good that there has been such a conclusion to this, even at this late stage. I hope the survivors will enjoy the money to the very last penny and the families of the employees, those who have passed away and those who are still living, will also share in the recognition and proceeds.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill is being taken with such speed and is being supported on both sides of the House. I hope its speedy passage will be an indication, even at this late stage, to these people that their case has been recognised and that we are trying to make up for it in a better economy. I hope these people live long enough to enjoy spending the money they will receive. I also hope they recognise that the State is trying to reward them for their work and dedication. These people struggled long and hard for 30 years to have their case heard and I hope the financial reward they receive will stand as a measure of the gratitude of this House.</P>
    <P>I thank the Tánaiste for introducing the Bill, which is one of the best items of legislation to be brought before the House.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for their contributions. I also thank Fine Gael and the Labour Party for facilitating the speedy passage of the legislation through the House this afternoon. This shows that an enormous amount can be achieved when we work together in the interests of the people we represent. Notwithstanding the fact that this matter has been awaiting a resolution for 13 years, I believe politics can work for the benefit of ordinary people.</P>
      <P>Today has been interesting. This morning Deputy Joe Higgins invited me to attend a rally on Saturday and now Deputy Rabbitte has invited me to join the Labour Party. That proves that a week is a long time in politics because earlier in the week there were calls for my resignation.</P>

      <P>Given the size of the new Fine Gael front bench, I am concerned that Deputy Owen might be tempted to advocate a constitutional referendum to extend the size of the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The definition of the term &ldquo;personal representative&rdquo; used in the Bill is taken from the Succession Act, 1965, and it means the executor or the administrator, for the time being, of a deceased person, a spouse, a child, a sister, a brother, a niece, a nephew, a friend or an agreed person. In the case of a former worker who is incapacitated and unable to look after his or her affairs, the cheque will be made available to the person concerned and can be lodged to his or her account. People who are incapacitated always have a carer looking after their affairs in this situation. In my opinion, the Bill covers the various people about whom Members inquired. Initially, I had considered using the word &ldquo;child&rdquo; but seeking and identifying former employees' children would have been very difficult. Therefore, the term &ldquo;personal representative&rdquo; is more appropriate.</P>
      <P>The committee will work closely with John Slevin who was crucially involved in the drafting of the legislation. In fact, earlier this afternoon he assisted my officials in drafting an amendment I intend to table on Committee Stage because we have discovered that one former employee who left the Hospitals' Trust in November 1986 would not have been covered and I have no desire to see anyone lose out. I reiterate what I said earlier, namely, that this Bill would not have been introduced without the efforts of John Slevin. He is an outstanding representative, he is reasonable and he carried out an effective campaign in respect of this issue.</P>
      <P>In the event of their being any misunderstanding I must state that the entire Government supports this legislation. The Taoiseach, his programme manager and many others took a personal interest in this matter. Everyone who has been in Government knows that on occasion it can be difficult to take on board people's concerns and enshrine them in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> A number of references were made to precedent. When one tries to introduce legislation of this nature, people always tend to refer to precedent. It is clear that the State would not be expected to introduce a Bill of this sort in respect of a private company. If this was a foreign company, a great deal of criticism would have been forthcoming about the way matters were handled. In view of the circumstances, it is right that the State should make the contribution outlined in the Bill. One would hope that in the future, in light of public-private partnerships and the contracting out of many State activities, arrangements must be made in legislation to ensure risk and liability will be passed on to private contractors and that taxpayers will not be obliged to foot the bill.</P>
    <P>Whether the former employees of the Hospitals' Trust want to spend their money betting on horses at the Galway races or on some other activity, the choice rests with them. These people will not be paid enormous sums of money &ndash; although £20,000 will mean a great deal to some of them &ndash; but, as Deputy Barnes stated, the payments they receive will be a recognition on the part of the Government and the Oireachtas that they were hard done by and that we are seeking to undo a grave injustice that was done to them 13 years ago.</P>

      <P>On the two month period, the Minister did not outline how she planned to track people down, apart from saying that she already has many of the names. I urge the Minister to publish at least one set of newspaper advertisements to make people aware of this matter. The two month period will run from the 4-5 July until the 4-5 September. The summer months are not a time when people usually read the newspapers, listen to the radio or deal with their finances or paperwork. As public representatives, we are aware that residents' associations etc. take a rest during those months, thereby allowing us to take a rest too. The two months of the year in which people will have to make this application will be the two holiday months so there is an additional onus on the Minister to ensure that people are identified quickly within the two month period. I would hate to see somebody discovering on 11 September that they are too late to apply.</P>

    <Title>Harbours (Amendment) Bill, 2000  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Collins: At the outset, I want to put on record the fact that members of Foynes Yacht Club made representations to the former Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. Together with Deputy Finucane, I accompanied a deputation to the former Minister, Deputy Woods, and I understand that Deputy Woods gave a written undertaking that financial assistance would be provided to the yacht club for improvement works which were carried out. I hope the current Minister will honour that commitment.</P>
    <P>On 14 June, the Minister said that there would be a serious obligation on the advisory boards to assist in every way in the achievement of the main and subsidiary objectives for which the company is established, including the tendering of any advice sought by the board on matters relating to measures for the management, control, operation and development of the estuary port facilities, the provision of facilities, services, accommodation and lands in its jurisdiction for ships and goods, the promotion of investment in its facilities and the engagement in business activity considered advantageous to the development of the estuary.</P>
    <P>The number of members of the implementation board shall not exceed five. Section 1(3) details matters to be provided in respect of the name and capital formation of the new company in its jurisdiction, the transfer of property and liabilities to the transfer company, the continuity of legal proceedings, the transfer of members of staff, the dissolution of any transfer company and the functions of the advisory boards in the supplementary matters necessary to ensure that the transfer of functions is effectively carried out.</P>
    <P>Section 1(4) provides for staff transferring from one company to the other and for the continuation of the protections afforded by the Harbours Act, 1996, on scales of pay and conditions of service. It provides, however, that the office holders of chief executive and harbour master of a transferor company are not required to be appointed as chief executive and harbour master of the new or transferee companies. That caused great anxiety in that part of the country. Senan Histon, the Harbour Master at Foynes, has done a magnificent job through the years and is highly respected and regarded. Unfortunately he will lose that position. I ask the Minister, at this late stage, if he will consider allowing Senan Histon to look after this as well as his own section of the port and the harbour master in Limerick could look after his section. I hope the Minister will change his mind on that issue.</P>
    <P>The Government is right to ensure the new company is put on a firm financial footing. For many years these companies have experienced a lack of investment support by the State, yet they <Col N="1032" /> have survived to operate within a very competitive business environment. The new amalgamated company must be able to operate from a position of strength.</P>
    <P>A capital injection is needed at Foynes Harbour so that the company can install new handling equipment. This is very important and I hope the Minister will announce that shortly. It was brought to our attention a few days ago that the financial position in Foynes is not great. I call on the Minister to make that announcement before something serious happens. Foynes Harbour has already invested heavily in the new west jetty extension and between this and dredging development, £12.5 million has been spent. It now has the capacity to load and discharge more and larger ships but without the necessary handling equipment their normal day to day business is being hampered. This will be an issue for the implementation board to look into as matter of urgency. It will need to establish the exact level of equity that will be required to ensure the new amalgamated company can operate effectively.</P>
    <P>The Harbours (Amendment) Bill, which has been published, states that the equity injection may be of the order of between £5 million to £8 million depending on the planned capital works by both ports, the restructuring of loans, the treatment of the Shannon estuary ports pension fund deficit, private sector involvement, port reorganisation and the disposal of surplus assets. The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, has made it clear that the Government will support financially the construction of new cranage and handling facilities at Foynes. We all want to see this new amalgamated port succeed. If this port is to be a success it cannot be crippled with financial difficulties. This new company must be centrally supported by Government to ensure the Foynes port and the Shannon estuary port become more competitive in the near future.</P>
    <P>We know of the resulting spin-offs which can arise as an immediate consequence of a profitable and active port structure in the Shannon estuary. We know that there are clear spin-offs for the west Limerick region and that is why the Government must financially support this new company and ensure it is put on a sound financial basis on its first day of commencement.</P>
    <P>The Government has also made it clear that certainty was required as to the new headquarters of the single port company. For reasons of certainty, it has decided that the amalgamated port company will have its headquarters at Foynes. I fully support this decision. It is the policy of the Government to decentralise many semi-State, Civil Service or ancillary bodies away from major towns and cities. For this reason, it is right and proper that Foynes is the new headquarters of the single port company. I commend the Minister on that. Deputy Finucane stated that he may table an amendment which he would like to see enshrined in the 1998 Bill. Be that as it may, I recognise that the Minister has given a commit<Col N="1033" /> ment that he, or whatever Minister will follow him, will honour. Perhaps the Minister might restate that today. He has stated that out of the combined business of the two companies the facilities where the most business influence can be exerted by the new port company are at Foynes.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the legal technical details of an amalgamation was never going to be enough to put the new single port company in the Shannon estuary on a competitive footing. It is an imperative that key access roads into both ports are upgraded. In this regard one of the most important key access routes is the construction of the port access road at Foynes. I pay special tribute to the Minister and to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who visited Foynes and saw at first hand what was required. I thank them for their enthusiasm. When the Minister announces the additional moneys we should receive for Foynes and the access road we will thank him again.</P>
    <P>The importance of the completion of the port access road at Foynes cannot be understated. While I welcome the £1 million allocation which has been spent on the realignment of the N69 route it cannot take away from the importance of the need to construct the port access road at Foynes. The Government's national development plan which identifies key social and economic investment priorities for the period 2000-06 includes financial commitments to upgrade the N69. The upgrading of that route, together with the construction of the Foynes harbour access road and the proposed fourth Shannon river crossing, would play a tangible role in improving the quality of the competitive position of the new single port authority in the Shannon estuary.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the Government also fully recognises the need to protect existing employment with the two port companies which are to be amalgamated. At a very early stage of this review process the Government confirmed in writing to both port companies that all the employment protections as to salary scale and conditions of service which are guaranteed under the Harbours Act, 1996, will remain.</P>
    <P>As the new Shannon and Foynes port company comes into being one of the key matters of concern to the employees will be the future of their jobs. Their concerns will be put to rest at the earliest possible stage. This will be a matter for the implementation board. However, no forced redundancies will be part of the amalgamation process and this should be welcomed by the employees who may be directly affected by the formation of the new port company.</P>
    <P>The Shannon estuary has long been identified as a deep water asset which is equipped with major unexploited maritime and related potential. The level of progress along the estuary has fallen far short of expectations. This Bill will help redress this imbalance. It will ensure the new Shannon and Foynes port company will become more competitive. There is no doubt but that as <Col N="1034" /> a result of the implementation of the Bill the marketing focus of these two ports and of the Shannon estuary in general will be greatly strengthened. As the Minister said recently, the new structure, with a single voice, reduced costs and strengthened management and marketing capabilities will enable the potential of the estuary to be maximised to the benefit of all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Bill dealing with the Shannon is a political barometer and the Dáil has fallen on five or six occasions on which the Shannon estuary Bill has been introduced. When Dr. Woods was Minister for the Marine and we spoke about this Bill I told him to be careful as every time the Bill was introduced we have a general election. Such an event is not an impossibility given the events of recent days, but I would regret it if the Dáil fell without passing this Bill. There should be a single estuarial authority. There should be a particular company in charge of running this valuable asset.</P>
      <P>The Shannon estuary has been neglected as a potential area of growth. Parochial interests on both the Clare and Limerick sides of the river have meant major decisions have been postponed because of political infighting. It is not confined to one party but is a general intercounty rivalry and people in the midwest have suffered as a result. A huge industry was to be located at Ballylongford when Shannon Development and the IDA bought a park there where an international company was to locate a car assembly plant. When the estuarial authority company could not get off the ground and things could not move on, the industry was located elsewhere and a potentially huge employment opportunity was lost. The quicker the Minister moves this Bill on the better.</P>
      <P>Even if people have reservations they should look at the advantages of the Shannon. There is deep water on both sides of the river and there is an excellent if under utilised pier at Moneypoint which could help employment in west Clare, west Limerick and north Kerry a great deal. Since Moneypoint was built by the ESB it has been very good to west Clare, north Kerry and west Limerick. Wherever this estuarial authority is located, as long as it is able to raise finance and put up an infrastructure we will be well on the road. The Minister should keep the board as tight as possible, as a wide-ranging board or management interference will mean we not get anywhere. The old Dal Cais fights will start again &ndash; the Clare, Limerick and Kerry people will be fighting for who will get what. That has presented enormous difficulties over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many aspects of the Shannon, such as tourism, have not been exploited. There is huge commerce on the Rhine, for instance, in Europe. Barges ply that river every day from one side of Europe to the other, but tourists take cruises side by side with them. The tourists are brought ashore to places of interest such as great castles or the birthplace of Konrad Adenauer and there is a <Col N="1035" /> huge tourism industry. There is a myriad of little islands on the Shannon, many of which are of great historical interest. This resource could be exploited. I am glad there is now some sense of development of the River Fergus. Shannon Development, FÁS and the Clare County Enterprise Board are helping people to develop access to these islands and people will visit them once more. However, that is only one part of the Shannon estuary's potential for tourism and I compliment the Minster for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands for designating the area used by the group of dolphins on the Shannon as a special area of conservation. The people of north Kerry and Clare will gain substantially from the tourism generated by this.</P>
    <P>Other historical sites along the Shannon should also be exploited, but potential investment in this area is being halted because we do not have a company that can raise the funds to improve infrastructure. Deputy Collins referred to the infrastructure of Foynes and that should be developed. It is the same for Kilrush, Kildysart and other parts of west Clare. Their infrastructural needs must be addressed and some kind of partnership should be established between Clare County Council and the estuarial company to produce the fine roads necessary to service a harbour like this.</P>
    <P>I see nothing but good coming out of a unified Shannon estuarial authority. I am one of the few people from my county who would not fight for a greater proportion of Clare people on the board. I live in a port, Clarecastle, which had special legislation passed to give it harbour trustees. That legislation is still operative and I regret the Minister has not included Clarecastle harbour in this Bill. The parameters of the Bill should include the entire Fergus estuary, subsuming Clarecastle, as it has trustees. Small boats of 1,000 and 1,500 tonnes used to come to the piers in Clarecastle. They used the Shannon estuary well up to the 1960s, though use has now fallen away. The only people who now use the river permanently are local drift net fishermen looking for salmon during the short season from May to July. I appeal to the Minister to look at Clarecastle again to see if it can be included in the Bill by way of an amendment.</P>
    <P>The authority might also include Clarecastle and there might then be an opportunity for the future development of the area. A great deal of coal came into County Clare via the Clarecastle port. We also exported considerable amounts of timber through the port. As stocks of salmon are declining, local fishermen seek alternative forms of employment. Because the port is tidal it cannot accommodate continual traffic but there is interest in the provision of excursions down river and pleasure boat trips during the summer months to the islands in the estuary and the River Shannon.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides many opportunities. I wish it well and I ask the Minister to consider the posi<Col N="1036" /> tion of the Clarecastle port and the Fergus estuary and to include them under the new authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EddieWade" hpid="Mr. Wade Mr. Wade">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wade</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister and his officials for the work they have done on this important and ground-breaking legislation which will have enormous implications for the mid-west region. As a former member of the old Limerick Harbour Board, I have a close and practical interest in this matter. I pay tribute to the former members of that harbour board, some of whom have gone to their God, who played a major part in the development of the ports of Limerick. I mention Ted Russell who was a Member of this House and of the Seanad many years ago and who is alive, fit and well in his late eighties. He took a great interest in the port of Limerick and its surroundings and it is only fitting that the old Limerick docks are now called the Ted Russell Docks. He played a major part in the political and business life of Limerick city.</P>
      <P>The Bill presents a strategic opportunity for the Shannon estuary, the mid-west and the whole western seaboard. What we are doing will benefit much of the mid-west and its hinterland for generations and centuries to come. Not only will the people of Clare, Limerick and north Kerry, along the estuary, benefit, but the people of Tipperary, north Cork, south Galway and Offaly will also benefit from the Bill.</P>
      <P>The strategic and development possibilities which will be created by a unified harbour authority for the estuary will provide a counterbalance to the overdevelopment of the east coast where Dublin and its surroundings are sucking in people and industry in a way which does not give the rest of the country a fighting chance. In this connection, I am particularly glad IDA Ireland recently announced that it will, in future, be more proactive in targeting inward jobs to the regions. The pace of development in Dublin is causing huge infrastructural overload, economic inefficiencies and a decline in the quality of life of citizens. A large percentage of the population of Dublin is from rural areas, including Munster and the mid-west, and many of these people would welcome the chance to live and work at home in well paid employment with a superior quality of life.</P>
      <P>This Bill lays the foundations for what could be the development of one of the greatest deep sea ports in western Europe and the EU. With improved sea crossing and transport links with Britain and the Continent and the possibility of an Irish Sea tunnel under active consideration, we have the opportunity to create a major port, not only for Ireland, North and South, and for our domestic import and export businesses and economic needs, but also to provide deep sea trans-shipment facilities for Britain and western Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1999 throughput for the Shannon estuary ports, which covers everything except Foynes, was 8.72 million tonnes. Throughput for Foynes was 1.3 tonnes. There is a great capacity for <Col N="1037" /> development. The entire estuary consists of deep sheltered water and is currently capable of handling ships up to 200,000 tonnes. The Bill will give the management of the estuary authority the opportunity to market the new port with much greater effect. That is to be welcomed. The existing wasteful duplication of resources will be eliminated by amalgamation and for the first time there is local agreement to amalgamation. This is a positive omen for the future. As a member of Limerick County Council for 21 years, I recall many divisive debates about the conflicting needs of Foynes and Limerick and I welcome this amalgamation.</P>
    <P>Staff of the existing harbour authorities need have no fear for the security of their employment and career prospects. Apart from the Minister's assurances in relation to continuity and security of employment, the enhanced business opportunities will provide those who have made a professional contribution to the development of marine traffic to do so in a much more effective manner. Those who wish to serve in the new enterprise will find their career opportunities enhanced rather than diminished.</P>
    <P>The existing harbour authorities have large numbers of professional staff who are well qualified and experienced. Estuary contingency and emergency planning is the best in the country and well up to worldwide best practice. Nothing but the best will suffice for the estuary.</P>
    <P>The latest marine port management technology is already in place. A new radar system is being installed and satellite information monitoring systems are already in use. Oil tracking systems have been well developed for some time, which is most important for the protection of water quality and the environment of our most important waterway.</P>
    <P>A single harbour authority will be much better placed to approach the Government and the European Union for legislative or financial assistance because it will be speaking with a single voice on the development issues of concern to the region. This can only result in a win-win situation for the people of the mid-west. Local interests will be encouraged to move into new enterprises which will function for the greater good of all. The new company under unified management will be in a position to conduct a cohesive and comprehensive marketing campaign which will take some of the pressure off other Irish ports and offer real competition to ports in Britain and mainland Europe. The enabling provisions in the Bill regarding current and capital expenditure will permit the extensive use of a dredging bar which will open the estuary to the largest vessels afloat.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. I commend the Minister on the amount of time and energy he has devoted to its preparation. I ask the Minister to ensure that money is provided for a new crane in Limerick and I hope this will happen in the near future. I also hope planning for the new bridge across the Shannon will be done in consultation with local <Col N="1038" /> authorities and the port. I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for the great effort he has made in such a short period in this Ministry and on bringing this Bill forward.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because there is much work to be done not only in the harbours mentioned in the Bill but in other harbours. Coming from Wexford, I must comment widely on the piers and harbours in my county. I agree with my colleague on the amalgamation of the Shannon Estuary Ports Company and the Foynes Port Company. I have always believed that these areas have not been developed. I served for a short time in that Ministry and found there was a continual tug-of-war going on between the two authorities. It is wise for the Minister to amalgamate both authorities. From a commercial and operational point of view, there will be far more benefits from the amalgamation than leaving the authorities as they stand at the moment.</P>
      <P>I agree with most of what my colleague, Deputy Donal Carey, said in respect of Foynes and the Shannon estuary. I have examined the explanatory memorandum of the Harbours (Amendment) Bill, 2000, which states:</P>
      <P>The purposes of this Bill are to:</P>
      <P>&ndash;provide that if the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (&ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;) is of the opinion that the functions of a company or companies could be performed in a more cost effective and efficient manner by another company or companies, he or she can establish a new company resulting in the amalgamation of existing companies;</P>
      <P>&ndash;enable the Minister to amalgamate the functions of Foynes Port Company and the Shannon Estuary Ports Company; [That is the main purpose of the Bill]</P>
      <P>&ndash;allow the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister, to make available to a company moneys to finance capital works and to inject equity for other purposes; [This is very important]</P>
      <P>&ndash;raise the upper limit of the aggregate amount of moneys that may be made available to companies;</P>
      <P>That is extremely important as well because we have seen limits placed on the raising of funds on the one hand and the amount one can spend on the other. This has acted as an inhibiting factor in the development of these companies. We are living in a completely different era and the moneys required for any of these works are enormous, and the Bill provides for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the recent suggestion put forward by Waterford Port Company of an amalgamation of the three south-eastern ports of New Ross, Rosslare and Waterford, the board of New Ross Port Company formed a special sub-committee to examine this suggestion and it concluded that such an amalgamation does not offer the best option for the future development of either port. <Col N="1039" /> The board is strongly of the view that the current corporate structure is the best vehicle to maximise the potential of the New Ross port and also of the Waterford port.</P>
    <P>New Ross is profitable and is in a sound financial condition. Annual throughput is consistent at over one million tonnes. Investment in the order of £7 million in the River Barrow improvement scheme during 1999 and 2000 will ensure that the port will continue to be easily accessible to short sea trading vessels for the foreseeable future. In order to fully realise the benefits of this scheme, further investment is required in facilities and onshore infrastructure. It is my view that this investment would not be a priority in an amalgamated port structure &ndash; I do not have the slightest doubt about that.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the port of New Ross is a small port. If it is amalgamated with a larger port the size of Waterford, we would be on the hind tit much of the time. I saw, particularly during my time as Minister, and other Deputies will have seen a huge amount of money going to large ports and fishery ports, while the smaller ports were neglected. The same would happen in this situation in that five or six larger ports would get all the investment.</P>
    <P>Waterford and New Ross ports are already co-operating closely in efforts to improve efficiency in both ports. A change in the corporate structure is unlikely to significantly assist this process. I am pleased to report that 1999 was a highly successful year for New Ross port. Very satisfactory results were achieved in throughput, revenue and profitability. Some 475 vessels entered New Ross port in 1999 and total throughput amounted to 1.11 million tonnes. This compares with 471 vessels and 1.02 million tonnes in 1998. The volume of fertiliser handled in the port increased to almost 341,000 tonnes. Significant increases were also experienced in the export of mineral ores and animal by-products. On the other hand, the volume of petroleum products handled in New Ross decreased slightly. The outlook for the coming year is positive and it is expected that throughput will be maintained at its current levels.</P>
    <P>I will give a run-down of the financial results for the year. Total revenue in 1999 was £1.047 million, an increase of 3% on the previous year. Operating profits were £256,649 and profit on the sale of property was approximately £111,409. After taxation of £34,635, the total profit returned for the year amounted to £344,999. That is a fair performance by a small port.</P>
    <P>In regard to the River Barrow improvement scheme, construction work on this project began in June 1999 and is now substantially completed. The project includes a major programme of capital dredging, realignment of the channel of the Pink Rock and the construction of a training wall and right groynes. The objective of the works is to significantly improve access to the port for all vessels and especially to open New Ross to vessels of up to 6,000 tonnes. That we could not pro<Col N="1040" /> vide accommodation for the larger vessels has been an inhibiting factor down through the years and it has damaged the prospects for the port. With this new investment, we hope we will be able to accommodate vessels over 6,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>At a cost of £7 million this project is essential for the long-term prosperity of New Ross as it will enable the company to continue to meet the needs of port users well into the future. The River Barrow improvement scheme is being partially funded by the European Union Structural Funds. The provision of matching funding at 52% of project cost represents a major long-term financial commitment for the company. The board is confident that the port has the capacity to finance this investment but it will impact on the company's ability to undertake further investment in the short-term.</P>
    <P>I refer to the profit and loss account for the New Ross Port Company for the year ended 31 December 1999 in order to demonstrate how well the port is operating. Turnover was about £1.047 million in 1999 and £1.014 million in 1998. Gross profit was £696,442 in 1999 while in 1998, it was £628,860. That is not a huge increase but at the same time the trend is upwards as far as the profit is concerned. The operating profit for 1999 was £256,649 while in 1998, it was £68,498. That indicates a good cash flow situation as far as New Ross port is concerned. The retained profit carried forward was approximately £511,432 in 1999 as against £166,433 in 1998. This clearly demonstrates the situation in respect of New Ross Port.</P>
    <P>The balance sheet of 31 December 1999 also makes interesting reading. The tangible assets in 1999 were approximately £6.9 million as opposed to £3 million in 1998 &ndash; almost double. Anyone with an understanding of finance knows this is a good situation. The shareholders fund was £4.2 million in 1999 as opposed to £3.8 million in 1998. This is another satisfactory position as all indicators are heading in a positive direction which is important to any business.</P>
    <P>In a letter dated 11 April 2000 regarding New Ross Port, Kenneally Ryan and Company, chartered accountants, stated:</P>
    <P>In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at the 31st December 1999 and of its profits and cash flows for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990.</P>
    <P>We have obtained all the information and explanations we consider necessary for the purposes of our audit. In our opinion, proper books of account have been kept by the company. The financial statements are in agreement with the books of account.</P>
    <P>In our opinion, the information given in the directors' report on page 1 is consistent with the financial statements.</P>
    <P>The net assets of the company, as stated in the Balance Sheet on page 5, are more than half of the amount of its called up share capital <Col N="1041" /> and, in our opinion, on that basis there did not exist on 31st December 1999 a financial situation which under Section 40(1) of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983, may require the convening of an extraordinary meeting of the company.</P>
    <P>I have checked with the chairman as regards this issue and that has already been held.</P>
    <P>The Minister will understand the concerns in Wexford about any interference with New Ross Port. There are problems in Waterford Port but they will not be resolved by amalgamating it with New Ross or Rosslare ports. New Ross UDC has been very supportive of the port as has Wexford County Council, and we wish it to remain as it is.</P>
    <P>Rosslare Europort is one of the finest ports in Ireland and is very profitable. However, rightly or wrongly it is still under the jurisdiction of CIE. Wexford County Council has fought unsuccessfully for a port authority for Rosslare. However, we will continue to push for this development.</P>
    <P>I will cite the throughput figures for Rosslare Europort per annum &ndash; foot passengers, 1.4 million; passenger cars, 330,000; ro-ro freight, 75,000 tonnes; trade cars, 48,000; coaches, 6,500; and up to 70 sailings per week at peak passenger periods. This port is a very important economic unit in County Wexford and was designated as a tax incentive area. The county council obtained 130 acres but not one development was acquired for that land. This was a great disappointment to the council.</P>
    <P>The case made for Limerick is similar to that we are making for Rosslare, but we have not been successful. I do not know why, but I would like to know why a port such as Rosslare, which services almost every port in Europe, cannot obtain development in this time of the Celtic tiger economy. I would be interested in any views the Minister may have on this issue.</P>
    <P>I am putting down a marker regarding any interference with New Ross or Rosslare ports as regards amalgamation, particularly with ports which are experiencing problems. New Ross and Rosslare ports have received much support from the county council and urban authorities in Wexford. In 1982 I managed to secure the first investment of £300,000 for Rosslare Port in the Estimates. Up to £20 million may have been invested since. I welcome investment in ports across the country and not just in the Shannon Estuary. However, we must be careful not to interfere with ports which are operating profitably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. If I am not mistaken this is the fourth Bill to come before the House with essentially the same purpose. The last three Bills fell as a result of the dissolution of the respective Dáil for a variety of reasons not confined to the Shannon Estuary. Unlike its three predecessors, I hope this Bill will be enacted and we break the unhappy cycle of Shannon Estuary Bills which met a sad fate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was instrumental in instigating at least two of the reviews carried out for the purpose of bring<Col N="1042" /> ing about the proposed amalgamation. The first review was carried out in the early 1970s by Brendan O'Regan who made great efforts. An agreement was reached which, unfortunately, was broken by the then Government which amended the Bill at the last minute in a way unacceptable to one of the parties. That Bill made no further progress.</P>
    <P>In the 1980s I asked the Limerick county manager, Richard Haslam, a man of considerable standing and well respected in the region, to conduct negotiations to try to bring about a rationalisation of the foolish situation which existed on the estuary. He tried very hard but did not succeed in obtaining agreement. A Bill was introduced which lapsed after being on the Order Paper for some time. I do not remember which Minister introduced the third Bill but it met a similar fate. Let us hope The Minister, Deputy Fahey, sees this Bill through.</P>
    <P>The need for this Bill is so self-evident that one laments it was not introduced 25 or 30 years ago, but that is a monument to local and personal interests taking precedence over the national interest. The Minister quoted from the consultants' report where it said that the establishment of a new and single port company is the only arrangement that makes commercial and operational sense. I fully concur with that, as does anybody who knows anything about the situation there. That was equally true 25 or 30 years ago. It is a great pity it did not come about then because we would have had a very different Shannon estuary.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about the Shannon estuary. One can never be dogmatic about these things, but it is arguably the best natural harbour in Europe, and certainly the best of the more accessible ones. The fact that it is so grossly underdeveloped when it has such marvellous natural amenities is deeply regrettable. It has 80 ft of water within less than 50 metres of the shoreline at Ballylongford, and it has four miles of river at that depth at that point for manoeuvrability. There is nowhere in Europe that has anything like that. In particular, the Ballylongford site in County Kerry, which I got the IDA to buy many years ago and which I then, happily, prevented it selling when it was under pressure to sell in the late 1980s when the Government was on a necessary cost-cutting and asset-realising mission, is still in public ownership. That has the greatest potential of any site in Ireland and possibly in western Europe. I am very pleased that is still the case.</P>
    <P>I also had something to do with the jetty at Moneypoint, because I was Minister for energy in the late 1970s when construction of the jetty started. I agreed to its extension outward by 30 metres in order to enable it to take ships of 450,000 tonnes. There is no other natural port in western Europe that can take ships of that size. There are some created ports that can, but no natural ones. Every effort should be made to develop those facilities. The site at Ballylongford <Col N="1043" /> is particularly suitable for serious heavy industry as opposed to the kind of heavy industry that passes as such here. I would love to see it developed for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word also about Limerick docks, which is one of the oldest established ports in the country. In volume terms, compared with the rest of the estuary, Limerick docks does not do a big trade because the maximum size vessel it can take is about 9,000 or 10,000 tonnes and it cannot take those fully laden. However, it is an important port because it is the most inland port in Ireland and enables imports and exports to be brought 60 miles in from the ocean, thus avoiding much traffic on roads. We are shortly to have a further river crossing downstream from Limerick docks, somewhere in the Mungret area. The precise location is not fixed but it will be quite close to Mungret and the cement factory there. If a conventional bridge of the kind that was built about ten years ago in Limerick city were built across the Shannon at that crossing, it would spell the end of the Limerick docks, and that would be most regrettable.</P>
    <P>A bridge of the type known as the Shannon Bridge in Limerick should, therefore, be ruled out, even though it would be the least expensive way of crossing the Shannon. There are two alternatives. One is a high-rise bridge, which would be much more expensive, unfortunately, but which would enable shipping to pass under. The other is an opening bridge, which also would be much more expensive and would cause much traffic congestion. It is because of traffic congestion that the opening on the East Link Bridge in Dublin is so little used now. There is a further alternative, which I would favour, and that is to build a tunnel at that crossing. There is no reason it could not be built. The tunnel that was recently opened in Cork has not hindered shipping in any way. The same situation would pertain in Limerick, although it might be somewhat more expensive. However, in all the circumstances, it has a great deal to recommend it. If Limerick were cut off from the sea it would be regrettable and would not be in the overall interests of the region or the country.</P>
    <P>A number of amendments to this Bill have already been circulated &ndash; I am sure they were all put down with the best of intentions. I would, however, urge the Minister not to accept amendments of a localised kind. It would be better to enact this Bill as it stands rather than introduce many local issues at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I know a fair bit about the two harbour authorities which it is now proposed to amalgamate. It is, perhaps, better that I keep some aspects of my knowledge to myself because if we are to have a new start it is better to leave the past alone. It is difficult not to remark, as the Minister has, on the extraordinarily heavy qualification of the auditor's report of the 1999 accounts of one of these companies. It is quite clear that the company concerned is insolvent. A note sent to the <Col N="1044" /> Whip's office in the past few days seeking to have this Bill enacted drew attention to that fact and to the fact that it would not be possible to let the situation continue over the summer recess. I was certainly glad to add my voice to the urgings that the Bill be taken before the summer recess. That is why it is important that it be passed now without amendment. Some of the management decisions and other broader and more strategic decisions were not just wrong, they were made for the wrong reasons. I hope we can leave all that behind us.</P>
    <P>When it comes to appointing a new and unified board, the Minister would be advised to omit people with a very narrow and often parochial vision of why they are there and to appoint people who are anxious to see the new unified port working successfully and commercially and who know something about shipping and the commercial management of ports. Very localised representation has not been a success in the past and will not be in the future. I believe in appointing people to boards who take a broader view, rather than the narrow sectional view as is frequently the case on traditional harbour boards and authorities.</P>
    <P>The Bill is the correct one for the reasons I have given and I certainly hope it becomes part of the Statute Book within the next few days. To market the estuary as a single unit will be far more feasible then what had to be undertaken in the past. It is a place which not only has enormous potential for serious heavy industry but also for a great variety of other activities which have nothing to do with heavy industry but with which heavy industry is not necessarily incompatible, particularly in the 21st century. The ability to utilise the entire estuary should not be lost.</P>
    <P>On television this afternoon, as we sat champing at the bit in this warm atmosphere, we had an opportunity to see Ballybunion and the area at the very end of the estuary at its most glorious. I think the golfers were getting the best of it because of the benign climate in Ballybunion today &ndash; it may not be like that tomorrow or the following day, as is frequently the case. However, one of the assets of the estuary is that at the mouth of it we have one of the best golf courses in the world. There is also a major airport in the area, two major power generating stations and one of the largest alumina plants in the world, which is proposing a further extension and which is endeavouring to generate its own power, a venture in which I hope it will be successful. Twenty years ago I sought to encourage the plant to take over the Tarbert generating station, but unfortunately the ESB would not hear of it. Of course, it would still not hear of it only for the EU, to whom we owe so many of our benefits, not as is popularly assumed in terms only of financial handouts, but also because it forced on us a rethinking of our social and commercial practices very much to the benefit of the country. Against the will of the ESB the EU forced on us a major element of competition in the generation of <Col N="1045" /> power. I hope, therefore, we will see a third power station on the estuary at Aughinish, where the location is ideal.</P>
    <P>There have been various proposals, especially for the Ballylongford site, over the years which did not come to fruition. In some ways I am glad because the Ballylongford site, the most valuable in Ireland and one of the most valuable in western Europe, is still available. I hope that development, when it takes place, will be major and be of huge significance to the country, particularly to the west.</P>
    <P>I am glad to support the Bill and rejoice that it is within an ace of being enacted. I urge the Minister to seek to have it enacted as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their very positive contributions which were well summarised by Deputy O'Malley. There is no doubt that this has been a long 25 year saga. The common denominator is that a number of changes in the Dáil and changes of Government have resulted in the matter remaining unaddressed. When I was made aware of the fact that a consultancy study on the Shannon Estuary was nearing completion I set as a priority the bringing about of a unified port company. I agree with Deputy O'Malley that had this been done in that 25 year period, Foynes would unquestionably be one of the finest ports in Europe. It is great that the old habits and prejudices of a lifetime in politics have at least been put aside and that we are at one on this development. It is sad that it has taken a long time, but it is great to see it through and I do not think the Government will fall before the Bill is enacted.</P>
      <P>A number issues were raised by a number of Deputies. Deputies Deenihan and O'Malley have dealt with Ballylongford. I did not deal with it in my opening speech because time did not permit and I had dealt with it in the Seanad. I agree that Ballylongford is probably one of the most strategically important sites in the country and I compliment Deputy O'Malley for his foresight in having the land acquired by the IDA and ensuring it was not sold. I know that Gerard Collins, a former Minister, was also instrumental in ensuring it was not sold at a time when other lands were being disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw the need to take a decision in respect of the Ballylongford site for once and for all. A number of initiatives have been suggested in the past 20 to 30 years which have come to nothing. Together with the Department of the Taoiseach, we initiated an examination as to whether a container transhipment facility could be located on the Ballylongford site. We have asked the Shannon Development Company, the ports and other relevant stakeholders to carry out an indepth examination in association with the Departments of the Taoiseach and the Marine and Natural Resources to established whether this proposal is a runner. The intention is that we will speak with <Col N="1046" /> the major players in container transportation around the world.</P>
    <P>There are about 26 round trips each year between the US and Europe, going into ports such as Rotterdam and Amsterdam. With a transhipment facility at Ballylongford, that could be increased to 32 or 33 shipments per year. It is vitally important to remember that we are on the busiest shipping lane in the world, that is, that between Europe and the US. With the change in logistics and improvements in shipping and technology I am hopeful there may be an opportunity which did not exist in the past. The study will examine whether this is a runner. I assure the House that in the event of there being potential to move forward in this direction I will put proposals to the Government that we bring forward an attractive development package and put in place a development worthy of the significance of the location. I agree with what Deputies O'Malley and Deenihan had to say in that respect.</P>
    <P>The position of Foynes Yacht Club has been raised by Deputies Finucane and Collins. I am aware of the background as I have received numerous representations about the development from both Deputies. There has been goodwill on everybody's part. There were lingering concerns about uniting the two ports. I compliment both Deputies for adopting such a positive approach and being so constructive in assisting me to allay fears and resolve difficulties. As they are so keenly involved, as a gesture of goodwill I am prepared to make available the required funding. I have received a letter from the yacht club indicating that a further £11,500 is required to complete phase one of the project. I am prepared to commit us to providing this sum. We can then look at the amount outstanding but given that it has taken 25 years to bring the project to fruition we can provide for the completion of the development.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties with both port companies. While the report was very negative in respect of Foynes which is close to insolvency, the port company had the courage to proceed with a very significant development on the west jetty. It would cost many millions of pounds to put such a facility in place today. This explains its current difficulties and to some extent it can be let off the hook on the grounds that it has done a fine job. Although cost effective, it got itself into financial trouble as a result.</P>
    <P>Without an immediate injection of funds for new cranage and hoppers the port will not be in a position to operate as efficiently as it should. Large vessels have had to wait for a day or two to be unloaded. The report indicated that between £5 million and £8 million would be necessary to allow the new port company to start with a positive balance sheet when handed over by the implementation board. I am satisfied that the Government will respond positively to the case which I will make by providing the funding required to ensure the company will not be hamstrung from the outset.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> I am delighted to announce that, following consultations with the Minister for Finance, I am prepared to make up to £3 million available immediately for cranage and hopper facilities in Foynes and the purchase of a crane in Limerick, which is also considered an urgent priority. I will be informing the existing port companies that they can proceed immediately with the necessary planning. The benefits of co-operation will be seen immediately, therefore, as two cranes can be purchased at a much lower cost. I am pleased to be in a position to respond to the demand, particularly in Foynes, that we show our support and goodwill. Other issues will be addressed by the implementation board in terms of the further capital required.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that the implementation board completes its work as quickly as possible. It has difficult decisions to take. While we have given assurances that there will be no forced redundancies, there are a number of manpower issues which will have to be addressed. There are six harbour masters employed along the Shannon Estuary, all of whom are not needed. As I explained to staff and management, everybody will be treated fairly. A redundancy package will be made available. It will then be a question of staff volunteering. We have received indications that some may be interested in a voluntary redundancy scheme.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Malley said there are a number of other major infrastructural developments along the estuary. I have a particular interest in the facility in Moneypoint. Given the changes in technology, particularly in power generation, especially in Great Britain &ndash; the KPMG report adverted to this &ndash; there are possibilities for a coal transshipment facility in moneypoint. I would welcome such a development. There are other initiatives which could be taken in other locations.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Estuary is probably our finest natural resource and, as has been said, one of the finest in Europe and on which we will see significant industrial development. I want Foynes to force down costs in other ports, Dublin in particular. The cost of imports and exports through our ports is too high and must be reduced. I am confident that the estuary can become a major industrial location for some of the significant industries seeking relocation from elsewhere in Europe. We have received some inquiries in that respect.</P>
    <P>With the construction of bypasses around Limerick, Clarecastle, Newmarket and from Crusheen to north of Gort the west coast will be opened up to shipping traffic, diverting it from Dublin. Each of these bypasses should have dual carriageway status. It is intended that the roads running from Dublin to Belfast, Galway, Limerick and Waterford will have motorway and dual carriageway status. The route running from Sligo to the south west and on to the south east should have a similar status. I intend to raise this matter with the National Roads Authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> I hope the implementation board will conclude its work quickly. Although it has up to two years within which to complete it, I have indicated to the chairman that it should make itself redundant as quickly as possible to enable us to put in place the new port authority, of which I propose to appoint the current chairman of the existing Foynes Port Company, Mr. Kieran MacSweeney, as chairman. He has a very good reputation and lives in Limerick. I have been impressed in my discussions with him. He takes a solid, business-like approach to the operation. It is my intention to appoint him as chairman as soon as the new port company is put in place.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Deputies for their contributions. When I introduced the Bill to the Seanad I said I would not introduce more important legislation during my term as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. I have pleasure in commending the Bill to the House and I hope we will take Committee Stage without too much delay later this evening.</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 45, after &ldquo;right&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(not being a period that expires after 30 September 2004)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill will enable the selection of power producers who will have the right to contract with BGE for the scarce capacity in the natural gas network that has been reserved for new power generation. The Bill allows BGE and the selected power producers to enter into a contract under normal commercial arrangements. Both parties are free to enter into a contract beyond September 2004 if they agree. The selected power producers may not wish to enter into a contract for a longer period as they might wish to be free to negotiate contracts for capacity with other pipeline operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had intended putting a sunset provision in the regulations. As I explained on Committee Stage in response to a proposed amendment from Deputy Stagg, I am not against the idea of having such a provision in the Bill. Having considered the issue on foot of our discussions on Committee Stage, I propose this amendment. It inserts a provision in section 2(5)(a), specifying that the maximum period for which the rights acquired <Col N="1049" /> under the Bill may be enjoyed will be up to 30 September 2004.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(11) Regulations may provide for the Commission to have such additional functions in connection with capacity on the natural gas network as the Minister sees fit and may include such ancillary provisions in relation to those functions as appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I made a vain attempt to persuade the Minster of State to accept a number of amendments and I am making a repeat attempt here. I am impressed with the Commission for Energy Regulation. It has in-house and independent expertise which should be availed of in the carrying out of this function. This amendment enables the Minister to broaden the remit of the CER to have additional functions with regard to the gas network. It is harmless in so far as it does not remove any authority from the Minister or the Department. It merely provides additional authority. It would be useful to invoke it as a substitute for spending a lot of money on consultants, as has happened with the gas and other studies.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 27 deals with the gas pipelines, which is a critical issue in terms of capacity, the choices to be made in terms of the various proposals from Belfast to Dublin, a second interconnector to Scotland and so on. The effect of the amendment would be to ensure consideration of the purely consultative advice of the CER, which can only be beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 proposes to give the commission additional powers with regard to the capacity of the network and the regulations under the Bill and to provide for other ancillary provisions as the Minister sees fit. Amendment No. 27 proposes the insertion of an additional function for the commission to report to the Minister on strategic considerations for the development of infrastructure in carrying out functions under sections 40 and 40A of the 1976 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 40 deals with the construction of pipelines by persons other than BGE, while section 40A is concerned with environmental impact statements only. The commission has no functions under either of these sections. My principal <Col N="1050" /> concern in this Bill is the introduction of an allocation scheme for scarce capacity in the gas network and the creation of a level playing field between BGE and private pipeline developers in the natural gas sector.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Bill that the powers to be given to the commission are specific in nature and relate exclusively to the allocation of a fixed amount of scarce asset capacity, which is 3.3 million standard cubic metres per day, sufficient to fuel 800 megawatts of electricity generating capacity. I do not propose to give the commission any additional functions. It is beyond the scope of the Bill. If I accepted these amendments, significant additional amendments would be required, for example, the introduction of provisions to cover the financial and administrative implications of giving the commission such additional functions.</P>
    <P>In so far as this Bill is concerned, we are all agreed that time is a luxury. I would prefer to consider in a comprehensive manner the policy issues and practical considerations that would arise from any increase in the commission's functions before I bring forward the legislation that would be necessary to give effect to any such decision. As I explained on Committee Stage, the overall question of granting additional functions to the CER in relation to the regulation of the gas sector would be addressed in the context of the ongoing restructuring of the natural gas sector. The Bill, as amended, provides for the inclusion of ancillary provisions in the regulations under section 11(7).</P>

      <P>In page 10, lines 16 to 18, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;as&rdquo; in line 16 down to and including line 18 and substitute &ldquo;on which financial closure of project sanction is made on the contract execution for the project;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Of all the issues I was lobbied on for Committee Stage, this caused the most dissatisfaction. Those lobbying me maintained the whole question of commissioning is fraught with danger. They told me that, in layman's terms, if one was to go to a bank with the present wording, finance would not be granted because there was so much uncertainty over the timing. With regard to the commissioning date being the financial closure of the project, I hope from the grouping of these amendments the Minister of State will propose a more clear-cut definition. I look forward to hearing his arguments and I hope the matter can be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> Commissioning is a process, typically over a six month period, in the course of which plant and all other facilities are progressively tested, leading to a reliability run, again typically for 30 days, only after which the handover of the plant from the EPC contractor to the owner takes place. This has a number of implications. First, firm capacity in both gas and grid connection is an essential prerequisite. An interruptible gas supply would not be acceptable, at least during the liability run. The process is, by its nature, investigative and susceptible to delay and time extension for a wide range of technical or even regulatory reasons over which the developer may have little or no control.</P>
    <P>Requiring the CER to make an objective evaluation of the date of the end of commissioning will expose it to requirement for an intimate involvement with the planning and progress of each project, and to criticism, if not legal challenge, of any decisions taken by the CER to change the project milestones, for example. I hope the Minister's amendment, amendment No. 4, will enable me to withdraw these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments arise from Committee Stage. Deputy Yates made a strong case for them. He withdrew them then on the basis that I would consider whether we could tighten up the definition of commissioning and I hope we may have done that.</P>
      <P>These amendments propose to remove the estimated commissioning date as being the first criterion by which applicants may be ranked in order of precedence by the commission and replace it with &ldquo;financial closure of project sanction made on the contract for the execution for the project&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned before, I consider that the text proposed is vague and open to interpretation. In addition, it does not appear to be sufficiently objective to allow for the test of financial closure of project sanction, etc., to be applied or to be measured against independent criteria.</P>
      <P>I am advised that in competitions of this type it is important that the selection criteria should be objective and easily measured. The use of the commissioning date and rated generation capacity achieves essential obligations of transparency and objectivity in the selection criteria because they are technical standards.</P>
      <P>These amendments would eliminate also ranking by reference to commissioning date. I am advised that during the consultation process on this Bill regarding the selection criteria, none of the independent power producers supported this view. Following our discussions on Committee Stage on this point, I took further soundings from the industry and did not find any support for the regime mooted in these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances, I consider that it is not appropriate to make such a radical alteration in the proposed allocation scheme. However, I undertook on Committee Stage to reflect on the <Col N="1052" /> definition of &ldquo;commissioning&rdquo; to see if it could be tightened up further. As a consequence, I have brought forward amendment No. 4. This amendment relates to the conditions to be satisfied for the purpose of determining the commissioning date where the applicant is not the person who has constructed the station. The text proposed in this amendment sets out clearly the test to be applied in these circumstances.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 29 to 47 and in page 12, to delete lines 1 and 2.</P>
      <P>In the part of the Bill which refers to the eventuality of two applicants being deemed to be identical in the ranking by the legislation, I seek to remove the requirement to allocate gas preferentially to the bigger stations in situations where commissioning dates are deemed identical. This unnecessarily ties the hands of the regulator as a more flexible solution involving more players may be achievable. Putting the biggest first may conflict with the overall desire to promote competition. The more players, <i>de facto</i> the more competition.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State rejected the argument on Committee Stage on the grounds that it is unlikely that there would be identical ranking, but if so, why provide for this at all? It covers the situation where there is identical ranking. It is unnecessary because, by definition, if there are two 150 megawatt plants as against one 300 megawatt plant, one will exclude a player who would otherwise be granted a licence. This is really only relevant in a situation where there will be either two or three, or three or four players. It is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the proposed amendment would be to delete &ldquo;rated generating capacity&rdquo; as a criterion for distinguishing between applicants with the same commissioning date. While, as Deputy Yates stated, I believe that this is unlikely to occur, it is nonetheless necessary to make provision for such a possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons for choosing &ldquo;rated generating capacity&rdquo; as a criterion are that it is a technical standard that can be easily measured and, in the particular circumstances of the Bill, it makes more sense to opt for a larger station that can <Col N="1053" /> generate more electricity. For these reasons I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 12, to delete lines 3 to 15.</P>
      <P>With this amendment I seek to do what I sought on Committee Stage. If a station does not fit the competition criteria, I am worried that the commission will have the power to prevent a station being commissioned within the criteria of the Bill. On Committee Stage we had a long discussion on it and the Minister of State suggested that he would look at that and how he might reassure us that the ESB, in this particular case, and Bord Gáis in the other, would not be excluded from partaking in the competition.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that while we are taking six amendments together, they are all in Deputy Stagg's my name. There are none in the Minister of State's name, which means that he has not met our point.</P>
      <P>I particularly commend amendments Nos. 11 and 13, because they do not throw out the baby with the bath water. They try to allow some flexibility in order that the competition criteria would not exclude the Dublin Bay power.</P>
      <P>I fear that this will all end up in the High Court in that if the ESB does not get an option on this gas, it will go to court. I would say that is inevitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose there is an inevitability about it. Whichever way it goes, it will take enough time for the gas to be brought ashore from the west coast or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I will not reiterate the arguments. Amendment No. 8 tries to put a time limit on the commissioning date and the ranking in terms of how far apart they need to be in order for the competition and other criteria to take effect. That might streamline the process a little.</P>

    <P>I am in favour of competition in every sector and I make no bones about that. We would not like a situation where the criteria for competition outstripped the criteria for first to market. We are facing the threat of power cuts. I am trying to see where the interests of the ESB meet those of the public and, in the event of power cuts, they meet those interests while not readily meeting the interests of competition. It is a case of balancing the position. <Col N="1054" /> These amendments try to bring balance to sections 4 and 5 and perhaps the Minister of State will consider them favourably.</P>

      <P>In deference to the Deputies, we had a serious look at these amendments since we discussed them on Committee Stage. In relation to all these amendments, it may be useful to recall that applications are ranked in order of precedence by reference to their respective commissioning dates. The text, as amended on Committee Stage, obliges the commission to have regard to a competition criterion, regardless of the time period separating the applicants' respective commissioning dates, subject always to the overriding consideration of the need to ensure the security and continuity of electricity supplies.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, very aware of the concerns that were expressed in relation to this section in the Bill as published originally. I welcome the opportunity provided by these amendments to revisit this important section and reflect further on the issues involved. Having considered and reconsidered the matter, I believe the amendments made to this section on Committee Stage address the concerns raised in a straightforward manner and in a way that is compatible with the objective of the Bill and legal obligations under competition rules.</P>
      <P>Deputies may recall that this provision was included in the Bill, in the first instance, because the allocation scheme dealt with the allocation of a scarce resource, that is, scarce gas capacity. The EU electricity and gas directives have entered into force and the electricity market has been opened to competition since last February. The Attorney General has advised me that, in allocating capacity to prospective power producers, the Commission for Electricity Regulation should have regard to competition criteria in selecting winners under the scheme. The competition directorate of the European Commission also expressed this view.</P>
      <P>The effect of the Committee Stage amendment to this section is that, while subsection (b) in both sections 4 and 5 is retained, which I think is necessary to comply with competition rules, the overriding consideration is security of supply. Thus, if the commission is of the opinion that security and continuity of electricity supplies in the State would be jeopardised by altering the ranking of applications or excluding an application because of the adverse effect that application would have on the development of competition in the electricity market, then it may not alter the rankings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Stagg proposes the deletion of the competition criterion from the selection process. The thrust of Deputy Yates' amendment is that the competition criterion should only be considered in the event there is a period of six months between two applicants' commissioning dates and where granting capacity to the former <Col N="1055" /> would mean that the next ranked person could not get capacity at the time of their commissioning date. In these circumstances, the amendments propose that the question of whether granting capacity to the first ranked person would have an adverse impact on competition in the electricity generating market should be considered in accordance with the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. In addition, Deputy Yates proposes to give the commission discretion in deciding whether to alter the rankings of persons in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should explain that in carrying out its functions under the 1999 Act, the commission is obliged to have regard to a wider variety of issues. Competition is simply one of those matters and it does not take precedence over other matters that the commission must take into account, for example, non-discrimination, the environment and the needs of rural customers. Introducing a reference to the 1999 Act in this regard would, we believe, complicate the selection process in a way that is both unnecessary and open to interpretation.</P>
    <P>I reiterate it is absolutely essential that subsection (b) be retained as drafted at present because of competition rules. However, the Bill, as amended by the committee, ensures that the competition criterion cannot be the overriding concern. The commission will, first and foremost, have to ensure that the State will have enough electricity generating capacity to ensure that demand is met.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have already given in relation to the competition provisions, I cannot accept the introduction of a discretionary power, whereby the commission may decide not to alter the ranking of applicants on competition grounds in sections 4 and 5 as proposed. The commissioning date is decided by reference to technical criteria. It is objective and can be measured. The introduction of the proposed additional rule in relation to the ranking and selection process would, I believe, create ambiguity in a procedure that ought to be objective and transparent. I regret I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;6.&ndash;In its application to any function conferred by this Act, section 9 (functions of Commission) of the Act of 1999 shall be deemed to be amended in subsection (4)(a) by the deletion of 'to promote competition' <Col N="1056" /> and the substitution therefor of &lsquo;subject to the subsequent paragraphs of this subsection and in particular paragraph (f) (sustainable energy), to promote competition'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We had a long discussion on this issue on Committee Stage. I am well aware of the Minister of State's support for renewable energies. My fear arises from statements made by the regulator that he intends to put a cap on the amount of renewable energy that will be supplied or produced in the name of competition. Has the Minister of State looked at this and can he meet the case?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Stagg for raising this issue. I stress the importance I attach to the promotion and development of renewable and alternative sources of energy. I know the Deputy and I share a lot of common ground on this issue.</P>
      <P>I understand the intention underlying this amendment is not to discriminate in favour of sustainable energy against such interests as the needs of rural customers, the disadvantaged and elderly, but rather because the Deputy has concerns that an imbalance may exist in the relative priority afforded to those duties by the commission. The Deputy is aware that when we enacted the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, we did so in a manner which does not give any one requirement in section 9 precedence over another. Moreover, in this section we made a clear distinction between the policy functions which are a matter for the Minister, and policy implementation, which rests with the commission. Like Deputy Stagg, I would be very concerned if any adverse impact on the promotion and development of renewable and alternative forms of energy was to arise from the manner in which the Act was being interpreted.</P>
      <P>Following our discussions on Committee Stage on this amendment, I directed my officials to clarify the position with the commission and to report back to me. When I have that report, I shall, if necessary, take the matter up with my senior colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, who has responsibility for the Electricity Acts.</P>
      <P>I reiterate my shared commitment to sustainable energy and assure colleagues that if a problem is identified, I will vigorously pursue that matter. However, if it is established that a problem exists, I believe there are mechanisms within existing legislation to deal with such matters. Amending this Bill, as proposed, would alter the balance between all of the duties of the commission under the 1999 Act and I do not think it is appropriate to do this.</P>

      <P>In page 14, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" />&ldquo;(3) The Commission shall consult with the Board before giving a direction to it under this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 8 gives the commission for electricity regulation power to give direction to BGE concerning the use and management of the national gas network, solely for the purpose of ensuring that the selected power generators can enjoy the capacity rights awarded to them under the allocation scheme. It is envisaged that the commission will only have to resort to invoking this power in an emergency in order to ensure the selected power producers can avail of their capacity rights.</P>
    <P>Members will recall from our discussions on Committee Stage that I concur, in broad terms, with the sentiment of the amendment proposed by Deputy Yates. Therefore, I have brought forward amendment No. 15 which requires the commission to consult with BGE before giving any such direction. This is the best way to address the Deputy's concerns in respect of this section.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 is more appropriate because it imposes a positive duty on the commission to consult with BGE before giving it any directions. BGE, as a statutory body, has a number of functions including maintaining and operating the network in order to provide a safe and efficient service for its customers. Accordingly, BGE is well placed to take necessary account of the interests of customers and other key interests such as safety and technical issues and, if necessary, to bring these matters to the attention of the commission.</P>

      <P>I support amendment No. 15, to which amendment No. 16 is analogous. Concerns were expressed by BGE that existing users of the network would be obliged to play second fiddle to those conferred with rights under the Bill. I am not sure whether amendment No. 15 deals with that matter. Will the Minister of State indicate whether the matters with which amendment No. 16 deals will be catered for by amendment No. 15, under which the commission is obliged to consult with the board of BGE? Does amendment No. 15 ensure equal treatment for all?</P>

      <P>In page 14, line 22, before &ldquo;(1)&rdquo;, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) Where, in the opinion of the Board it would not be in a position to meet the capacity requirements of a holder of relevant <Col N="1058" /> rights, the Board shall not enter into a contract (otherwise than pursuant to section 10) whereby it agrees to make available to any other person the use of an amount of capacity of the natural gas network for the purpose of supplying natural gas to a generating station for the purpose of providing energy for the generation of electricity at that station:</P>
    <P>Provided always that the Board shall be entitled to enter into contracts that maintain the gas transmission capacity to the Electricity Supply Board for gas-fired generating stations that have been commissioned to generate electricity before the passing of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 9, to which this amendment refers, deals with the locking in of contracts. We debated a similar amendment on Committee Stage. Will the Minister of State indicate whether he has had an opportunity to give this matter further consideration?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy stated, we debated this matter at length on Committee Stage and the section was altered radically as a result of our discussions. Members may recall the high level of concern in respect of section 9 as originally drafted. However, our combined efforts on Committee Stage have helped to allay those concerns. I appreciate that Deputy Yates may, quite naturally, wish to review the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> section 9 at this point by means of the amendments he has tabled and I welcome the opportunity to reflect further on the section.</P>
      <P>Section 9, as amended on Committee Stage, allows BGE, subject to the prior written consent of the commission, to enter into contracts with power stations commissioned after the passing of this Bill which have not acquired capacity rights under it. The section also removes the restriction on BGE contracting with the ESB for capacity or gas for existing power stations. In addition, the new subsection (4) will allow the Minister to lift the restrictions on BGE in relation to contracts for capacity if he or she is satisfied that such contracts would not jeopardise power stations selected for capacity rights under the Bill. I consider that the current text meets the various concerns raised by Members on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The amendments proposed by Deputy Yates remove the commission's role in supervising new contracts between BGE and power plants commissioned after the passing of the Bill. I am not satisfied that, in the overall scheme of the Bill, it is appropriate to diminish the function of the commission in such a manner. The function of the commission in this section is to ensure that the rights of the selected persons are properly protected. In my opinion, that function ought to be retained. Moreover, amendment No. 18 seems to envisage that the Minister may become involved in BGE's contractual arrangements by means of section 11 of the principal Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1059" /> Section 11 of the principal Act, as amended, envisages a situation whereby the Minister may give general directions on transmission to the board and, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, give general directives with regard to pricing policy. Even if I thought that, as a matter of policy, it would be good for a Minister to become involved in BGE's contractual arrangements, section 11 of the principal Act does not appear to provide an adequate legal basis for such intervention by a Minister in the day to day affairs of this semi-State company.</P>
    <P>The amendments made to section 9 on Committee Stage addressed the very real concerns that existed at that point. The current text of the section offers most direct route to solving the earlier problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State will recall that, on Committee Stage, I indicated that we should be supportive of CHP. Section 9 places a prohibition on Bord Gáis not to enter into any new contracts to provide gas capacity for the purpose of power generation, beyond the allocation envisaged in the Bill, until September 2004. I accept that there is a simple logic about that, but the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> CHP, which has tremendous advantages in terms of efficiency, is unclear as a result.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 19 proposes the insertion of a new subsection in section 10 to provide that the selected persons may not, in effect, be locked into a capacity with BGE, other than for the period set out in the regulations, unless the selected person so requests. Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 are consequential on amendment No. 19.</P>
      <P>The three amendments are not necessary because the timeframe for the enjoyment of the exclusive rights to capacity will be specified in the Bill by virtue of amendment No. 1 to which the House agreed earlier. The statutory terms and conditions and BGE's terms and conditions, modified to take account of the statutory terms, should operate to preclude BGE taking advantage of the winners of the competition by locking them into a long-term contract or <i>vice versa</i>.</P>
      <P>I consider that the detailed appeals mechanism to the commission and the independent arbiter of this process should be sufficient to prevent abuse by any party. I must emphasise that this appeals system, if required, is available to an aggrieved or concerned party before contracts are signed. Any changes to the terms and conditions of the proposed contract which may be necessary are made on the direction of the commission, again before contracts are signed. On the other hand, it does not preclude the parties, if both sides agree, from entering into the contract for a longer period than that envisaged for the guaranteed rights.</P>
      <P>On the conclusion of the period whereby the selected persons have a right to capacity, they must compete equally with other participants in the power generation market for capacity in the BGE network or other gas pipelines which may have come into existence by that time.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 20, which is consequential on No. 19, proposes the insertion of text to allow disputes as to whether the terms and conditions of contracts, as modified by BGE to take account of the statutory terms and conditions, to be referred to the commission. I understand that disputes of this type may be referred to the commission under the Bill as drafted. That may be done, for example, in accordance with section 10(8).</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 2, which is also consequential on No. 19, proposes the deletion of the word &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; in section 10(12) and its replacement by the words &ldquo;without prejudice to subsection <Col N="1061" /> (6)&rdquo;.

      <P>Deputies will recall the concerns expressed in regard to section 11 as originally drafted. A number of amendments were agreed on Committee Stage which render the bond requirements far less onerous and which, I believed, met our concerns. Under the current provision, I will have the facility to call in a bond in stages rather than on a single occurrence of failure to have the plant capable of exporting electricity on the commissioning date. This allows for a progressive calling in of the bond on a daily basis after the commissioning date. In addition, if capacity rights are forfeited or caused to be forfeited following the commissioning date, liability for bond payments will cease from that date of forfeiture. This will encourage any generator to whom capacity rights have been allocated and who may encounter serious trouble after the commissioning date which he failed to meet to trigger the forfeiture procedure at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates is proposing the deletion of the entire bond provision. I firmly believe the bond provision is necessary. This competition is being held in the national interest to ensure the security of our electricity supplies and the requirements outlined in section 11 reflect this fact. In effect, the section is a penalty clause to ensure that successful applicants fulfill their side of the bargain and complete all necessary work within the timeframe they specify in their applications. It is important to bear in mind that it is the applicants themselves who, when submitting their applications, specify the project time scale.</P>
      <P>Further to our discussions on Committee Stage, I have tabled amendment No. 23 to include a provision that the bond shall not be payable in the event of <i>force majeure</i>. Consequently, the question of whether the bond is called in is very much in the successful applicants' hands. If these amended bond requirements were to be further diluted, the entire allocation process would be undermined.</P>

The formula £5 million x (C/100M) in section 11, where C is the rated generating capacity of the planned generating station expressed in megawatts and M is a megawatt, would result in quite hefty payments. A 400 megawatt plant would be liable to a £20 million payment. That is quite a lot of money; the Minister of State could have halved that formula without breaking his heart. We hope these bonds will never be called in and that everyone will perform satisfactorily.

      <P>The background to this amendment is very simple; it seeks to allow anybody who might find gas off the west coast to sell that gas and to ensure that IPPs and others would not be locked into a particular situation.

The proposed amendment makes distinctions between new and existing gas producers, domestic sources and foreign sources and between independent power producers, such as the ESB, and other State-owned power producers. A text containing such distinctions would be discriminatory and inappropriate. Moreover, if the amendment were accepted and the Bill enacted, the proposed new section would become law and, notwithstanding the fact that it is unnecessary, it could fall to be interpreted by the courts at some future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consulted with the Office of the Attorney General, as promised, and serious concerns were expressed about the possible impact an amendment of this kind could have on other provisions in the Bill. I reiterate that the amendment is unnecessary and that there is nothing in the Bill to prevent independent power producers buying gas from <Col N="1064" /> sources other than BGE should a new source of gas become available in Ireland or elsewhere. In that context, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 20, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Section 32(3)(a) of the Act of 1999 is amended by the deletion of &lsquo;High Court which leave shall only be granted where the High Court certifies that its decision' and the substitution therefor of &lsquo;High Court or the Supreme Court which leave shall only be granted where the court certifies that the decision of the High Court'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Individuals, corporations and all forms of legal persons are entitled to access to the courts, up to the Supreme Court. I am advised that there is a mistake in section 32(3)(a) in the 1999 Act and that it has the effect of preventing access to the higher level of court. Under the amendment if the High Court refused an application to challenge a decision of the commission an appeal could be made to the Supreme Court. The Minister accepted this correction to the aviation Bill in the Seanad and I hope the Minister of State will do likewise on this Bill.</P>

      <P>The provisions of the Bill amending the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, provide that unsuccessful applicants may apply to the High Court for leave to apply for a judicial review within two months of the commission's decision. If the application for leave to apply for judicial review or the actual application for judicial review is turned down by the High Court there is an avenue of appeal to the Supreme Court on points of law of exceptional public importance. This amendment proposes to introduce an additional avenue of appeal to the Supreme Court. Obviously, this would create the potential for delays in the implementation of the allocation process if legal proceedings were to be initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures proposed in this amendment are inappropriate in so far as the allocation scheme is concerned. An important element of this scheme is that it provides for certainty both as regards access to capacity and the important timeframe here within which litigation can occur. I am satis<Col N="1065" /> fied that the appeal mechanism available to unsuccessful applicants is sufficient for the purposes of this scheme. An additional avenue of appeal could lead to an unduly long delay in the scarce capacity being awarded which ultimately could threaten electricity supplies.</P>
    <P>As has been mentioned by Deputy Stagg, I am aware an amendment of this type was accepted to the Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000. As a matter of policy I will examine whether such an appeal mechanism should be provided in the context of legislation which I will bring forward in due course dealing with the restructuring of the natural gas industry. That is the next one we will be talking about. In the context of the very narrow confines of this Bill and because of the importance of not having delays, I do not believe such an amendment is necessary.</P>

      <P>I am told the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party is soft. I propose to allow the regulator to become involved where BGE proposes to engage in activities that might not help the regulator to promote competition in the energy markets. The Minister always has the final say in terms of giving consent or not and the amendment simply allows the regulator to express a view and have account taken of it.</P>
      <P>It is similar to amendment No. 27 which has already been debated. In the gas industry BGE has a monopoly and CER has a function, even if it is time limited, up to the time of full deregulation of the market. Will the Minister accept the amendment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Stagg is consistent on this issue. He had something similar to say in a trenchant way on Committee Stage. Amendment No. 26 proposes to insert a new subsection in section 17 to allow the commission to make recommendations to the Minister on BGE's business activities, having regard to the commission's duty to promote competition in electricity and gas. It is proposed that the Minister should take account of these recommendations, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, in consenting to BGE's proposed new business activities.</P>
      <P>Section 17 gives BGE additional powers and functions on the production, transmission and distribution of energy and other business activities, subject to ministerial consent. As I explained earlier, this Bill is intended principally to provide for a scheme to allocate scarce capacity in the gas network and take account of competition requirements in the implementation of the scheme. It is not the purpose to give the commission any other additional functions. It is my understanding the commission does not enjoy such powers in relation to any other entity in the energy sector. I am not aware why it should be given these functions regarding BGE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of the commission becoming involved with BGE proposals before they are approved would be to treat BGE differently from other players in the regulated energy sector. I see no justifiable reason for BGE to be singled out in this way. If BGE becomes involved in the energy market in a manner that is within the scope of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, then the com<Col N="1067" /> mission will have all the powers necessary to examine its activities in the same way as it may examine the activities of any other entity under that Act. I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(6) The compulsory purchase powers granted to parties other than the Board in this Act shall not be a basis for undermining any existing powers of Bord Gáis Éireann in relation to the laying of pipelines.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was requested by BGE. It retains a legalistic fear that the way this is set out in terms of a level playing pitch between it and new operators, if there is a legal challenge to the legislation its powers will be threatened. The Minister said he had legal advice to the contrary. I cannot see that it has any negative knock-on effect.</P>
      <P>This is not an academic matter because we now see they will greatly expand the pipelines and it is possible that they may engage in a joint venture if Corrib comes ashore. It would be a pity if there was a legal challenge, say, to Premier Transco. If the red tape is wrong a state of paralysis might occur. They will obviously have legal people looking at this Bill and will get legal advice on it. The Minister of State owns the company, so he might think of its best interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Never before was such consultation given to all of us on legislation. I understand this amendment proposes that the extension of BGE's compulsory purchase powers to private operators shall not undermine the existing powers of BGE in relation to the laying of pipelines. I am not sure this amendment would necessarily achieve what I understand to be its objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not put BGE in a different and more favourable legal position than other companies operating in the natural gas sector. To do so would be incompatible with Community law. It might even undermine the creation of a level playing field for BGE and private operators as proposed by the Bill. I am aware of the issues underlying the proposed amendment and that there is concern in some quarters that a court challenge by a private operator to the exercising of these powers could affect BGE. The Gas Act, 1976, sets out elaborate procedures for the acquisition of land. The functions are divided <Col N="1068" /> between the Minister and BGE and this gives the system a built-in system of checks and balances. This position will not change with the extension of these powers to private companies.</P>
    <P>The Bill as presently drafted does not provide that applicants automatically obtain compulsory purchase powers; applicants will only be able to avail of such powers after I have given my consent in relation to the construction of a pipeline &ndash; in other words, after there has been full public consultation on the application and environmental impact statements. The procedures of the 1976 Act have withstood the test of time. They will continue to apply and I am not aware of any reason why the extension of the compulsory purchase powers to private operators, in accordance with these procedures, could undermine BGE's position.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 19 and 20.</P>
      <P>This amendment may be late as some of this work has already commenced, but it is designed to ensure there would be worker representation in what is described in the Bill as the transferee company, which is the company which will oversee the transference from the two port authorities to a single port authority. The provision that has been made excludes this particular activity from the provisions of the Bill which would otherwise apply. There is a small transferee board and we are seeking to ensure there is worker representation. I appreciate that the work has begun already, but I would appreciate the Minister of State's comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan will understand that sometimes a small board can be much more effective. However, subsection (2) provides that the Minster may by order, where he is of the opinion that the efficient and effective implementation of an order under subsection (1) so requires, provide that the number of directors of the transferee company shall not exceed five. The duration of any such order shall not exceed two years. Provisions in the Harbours Act, 1996, which relate to employee and local authority directors &ndash; section 30 &ndash; and the chief executive as an <i>ex officio </i>director &ndash; section 36 &ndash; shall not apply for the period of the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hallmark of the implementation structures provided for in the Bill is that they are designed to be simple, effective and non-divisive. It is of vital importance that the implementation board, which has a short shelf life, be tightly focused and for that reason I have decided to keep the numbers low. There is a balanced representation from each company and an independent chairperson. It also has a clear-cut and focused remit. While <Col N="1070" /> one could argue for more or less members, in my judgment a board limited to five members will facilitate the orderly and speedy conduct of its business.</P>
    <P>Among the tasks of the implementation board overseeing the unification process will be close liaison with the port company boards and their successor advisory boards in order to ensure the smoothest possible transition to a new single port company structure. The advisory board, which is comprised of the directors of the two or more port companies being amalgamated and includes the employee and local authority directors, will have a real and important role in assisting the implementation board to pursue the difficult decisions that are vital to the success of the new company, the development of the business and of the port facilities.</P>
    <P>I hope the implementation process will be complete within a 12 to 18 month timeframe or sooner if possible and for these reasons I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) Where, for the purpose of honouring the terms and conditions of office of existing harbour masters transferred to a new company, a new company deems it expedient to employ more than one harbour master, each having jurisdiction over a different part of the new harbour, such new company may appoint more than one harbour master each with a limited geographical jurisdiction as defined by the new company and each harbour master so appointed shall be responsible to the Board for his or her geographical area and sections 17(5) and 37 and Part III of this Act shall be construed accordingly.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Harbours Act, 1996, which was the primary legislation governing the 12 semi-State ports at the time, designated the Foynes and Shannon Estuary Ports companies as separate entities. The terms and conditions of employment of the staff of both locations were sacrosanct within the Act.</P>
      <P>The new port company will have an initial phasing-in period. The new Bill will impact on the terms and conditions of one of the harbour masters. It will not impact on the chief executives because the chief executive of the Shannon Estuary Ports Company has resigned and the only remaining chief executive is in Foynes. I propose this amendment because it is important that the new company enjoy the goodwill of everyone involved from the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1071" />
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for staff transferring from one company to the other and for the continuation of the protections afforded by the Harbours Act, 1996, in relation to scales of pay and conditions of service. It also provides that statutory office holders of chief executive and harbour master posts of a transferrer company are not required to be appointed as chief executive or harbour master of the new, or transferee, company. It is clear that in a new single port company entity there can only be one chief executive officer and one harbour master in charge and responsible.</P>
      <P>There is no intention to undermine the employment protections given under the Harbours Act, 1996, that staff members transferred from predecessor harbour authorities shall be brought to no less beneficial conditions of service or of remuneration than those to which they were subject immediately before vesting day of the new port companies.</P>
      <P>No business can be run efficiently with two or three heads in charge and it would undermine the whole thrust towards unification of two or more companies if any elements were to be left separate whether in the technical, management, administration or other areas.</P>
      <P>Under section 37(1)(b) of the Harbours Act, 1996, a harbour master cannot assign a member of his staff to perform functions conferred on him or her by the Act. In discharging such a delegated function the person to whom it is delegated assumes the full authorities and powers of the harbour master under the Act. It will be a matter for the new Shannon and Foynes Port Company to decide how best to deploy the significant resource of six persons currently employed as harbour masters, deputies or assistants. Such delegation of functions can be put in place in the interest of good governance and has the benefit that it can be retracted as well as given to meet particular circumstances which vary from port to port so flexibility is provided for under existing harbours legislation.</P>
      <P>Enshrining this amendment in the Bill would undermine the whole thrust of unification and help to maintain, and indeed encourage, a separate empire mindset instead of a dynamic unified new company operating on the same basis as its competitors such as Dublin or Cork.</P>
      <P>As things stand, a harbour master may attend board meetings in accordance with the provisions of section 17(5) of the Harbours Act, 1996. This is an unusual provision as, for example, this statutory provision does not apply to other senior professional staff of port companies, including the accountancy and engineering disciplines all of which contribute equally to the efficient operation of ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increasing the number of harbour masters in attendance at board meetings, as proposed in this amendment, would only further exacerbate this dichotomy. It is, of course, open to the board to require any member of the staff to be in attendance at a meeting, depending on the business <Col N="1072" /> being transacted. An identical argument could be put forward for a similar provision or exclusion to apply to the position of chief executive officer. It would, of course, be equally unacceptable. Similarly, an argument could be advanced to have two headquarters rather than a single headquarters at Foynes which is the subject of another amendment put forward by the Deputy. I do not accept that doubling up on headquarters would make much sense either. Consequently, I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that if two entities, each with a harbour master, are merged one harbour master must be undermined? The Shannon Estuary Ports Company does not have a chief executive while Foynes harbour does. No chief executive will be undermined by the merger but a harbour master will.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <P>Deputy Finucane has clearly received representations on this matter and I understand his difficulty. He must also understand, perhaps more fully than other Members, that one cannot have two people in charge of a harbour. As a former chairman of New Ross Harbour Commissioners I am sure a harbour with two harbour masters would be quite unworkable. One may feel a person is undermined because he is not given a job but his remuneration will remain the same and, in the interest of the future of the company, we should not apply an easy short-term solution to this problem.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;Limerick County Council shall nominate three local authority members to be Directors of the new port company.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Limerick County Council presented a submission to KPMG Consulting. The submission was attendant on several considerations, some of which have been addressed by the Minister. The Minister has given a commitment of £3 million for the crane and dust hopper facilities at Foynes and for the crane in Limerick. A sum of £12.5 million is to be spent on the west jetty extension at Foynes. This is a <i>de luxe</i> facility but surrounding infrastructure is also required. These financial commitments conform to the wishes of members of Limerick County Council from all parties. <Col N="1073" /> There is tradition going back over 100 years in regard to the composition of the port company at Foynes. There were always three local authority members on the authority. It is in accordance with the wishes of the submission from Limerick County Council to the KPMG consultations, which was further consolidated by amendments moved at a council meeting last week, that this amendment was tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification because the Harbours (Amendment) Bill, 2000, only allows for three local authority members to be on any port company. I am not sure whether this means there would just be representation from Limerick County Council and from no other local authority. For example, Clare County Council, Kerry County Council and Limerick Corporation are three other local authorities which have an interest in the estuary. I am not clear whether the amendment proposes that representation from local authorities be confined to Limerick County Council. If it does, I will not support the amendment.</P>

      <P>This section provides that the Minister shall appoint three members of a prescribed local authority or local authorities to be each a director of a company. Local authorities are prescribed by regulation under the 1996 Act. I also indicated to the Seanad that such an amendment tabled in respect of limiting the local authority representation on the newly unified port company to one named county council was unbalanced and lacking in inclusivity. If I accepted the amendment which deals solely with the interest of one local authority, I would inevitably face difficulties with the others.</P>
      <P>To illustrate the difficulties, I would like to point out that serving local authority directors of the two companies have been nominated by Limerick County Council in the case of the Foynes Port Company and Limerick Corporation and Clare and Kerry county councils in the case of the Shannon Estuary Ports Company. I have already received approaches on behalf of Kilrush Urban District Council and Kilkee and Shannon Town Commissioners seeking representation on the new port company board.</P>
      <P>The representation by local authorities on the board of the new company will be defined by amending the Port Companies Local Authorities Directors Regulations, 1996. The criteria used to guide the choice of local authorities prescribed by the regulations included,<i> inter alia</i>, the distribution of the principal activities of the port and the economic relationships between the port and the functional areas of the local authorities in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deference to the commitment given by me in the Seanad and to the Deputies concerns on the issues, I am prepared to revisit this matter and consult with all interested parties in advance of amending the regulations, including the Mini<Col N="1074" /> ster for the Environment and Local Government and the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>I would also point out by way of explaining the procedure involved that section 30 of the Harbours Act, 1996, defines how employee, local authority and other directors of a port company are selected. I expect to be in a position to nominate up to six of the 12 directors of the new company following required statutory consultation with the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and other appropriate bodies. This presents me with the opportunity and facility to address any imbalance in the composition of the board's local authority or other representation. However, clearly there is a limit to the number of local authority directors which can, or should be, appointed given the commercial mandate of the State companies involved and the need to have balanced representation. As it stands local authority directors comprise 25% of the composition of the port company boards. I do not propose, therefore, to accept this amendment but will initiate the consultations to which I am committed as a priority.</P>

      <P>Section 1(3)(a)(ii) provides that the name of the new company can be prescribed by the making of a ministerial order. After a comprehensive public consultation, the KPMG Consulting report recommended that the name of the new company should be the Shannon and Foynes <Col N="1077" /> Port Company. I have an open mind on this issue but the name should reflect the regional composition of the ports in the Shannon Estuary.</P>
      <P>In terms of tonnage, the Shannon Estuary Ports Company has eight times that of Foynes. The implementation body should decide the name of the new company. I hope a consensus will emerge on a name which is not skewed in either direction, but which commands confidence, reflects the commercial reality and the best interests of the region. In other words, a name which is fully in tandem with the commercial needs of the new company.</P>
      <P>By laying down what the name should be, the House would be removing an important local power. I prefer to leave this issue open because the two advisory boards will have an important role in advising the implementation board.

      <P>&ldquo;4.&ndash;The transferee company formed by the amalgamation of Foynes Port Company and the Shannon Estuary Ports Company pursuant to section 43 of the Harbours Act, 1996 (as amended by section 1 of the Harbours (Amendment) Act, 2000) will maintain its principal office for commercial, administrative and operational functions at Foynes in County Limerick.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have discussed this issue at length and I referred to it on Second Stage. The Minister has clarified that the principal office for operational, administrative and commercial activities will be in Foynes. This amendment seeks to underpin that decision in the legislation. There is a precedent for this in the 1988 Bill which stipulated that the headquarters would be in Foynes, but that Bill did not proceed.</P>
      <P>In the Seanad the Minister stated it was not good legislative practice to insert a provision in the Bill stipulating that the headquarters would be in Foynes. That is surprising. Does the Department now have a different definition of &ldquo;good legislative practice&rdquo; than it did in 1988? Circumstances change and Ministers come and go, so I am proposing to insert the location of the headquarters in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a strong interest in this issue as I come from Foynes. I am also aware of the concerns of Deputy O'Sullivan who is from Limerick and is concerned about losing the headquarters to Foynes. This is an important issue and I await the <Col N="1078" /> Minister's response. The Department has not tabled an amendment on this issue so I presume it is not going to agree to my request. However, I await the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand where Deputy Finucane is coming from and he is representing his constituency. However, I agree with Deputy O'Malley's comments on Second Stage when he said we need a broader vision. I did not comment on the previous amendment which sought to insert the name Foynes before Shannon, but constant attempts to give Foynes the upper hand will not help this Bill. We need to adopt the broad vision required to make this Bill a positive, proactive opportunity for the mid-west.</P>
      <P>I have not tabled an amendment which seeks to gain advantage for the Shannon Estuary ports which are in my constituency. The Minister needs to adopt a balanced, neutral position but he is not doing so, no more than are other speakers. He has already announced that the headquarters will be in Foynes, despite the clear recommendation in the KPMG report. That report recommended that the location of the headquarters would be a matter for the new executive, but operational management should be located at Foynes while Limerick should house the administrative and commercial responsibilities. This report followed widespread consultation with all interested bodies and geographic locations.</P>
      <P>It is inappropriate to have one of the companies trying to strongly impose its view on the legislation and the Minister should maintain a balance. This development offers great potential but it will only work if there is genuine goodwill and co-operation between the two former companies. That will be forthcoming but it would be helpful if we left as many of these decisions as possible to the incoming board, rather than trying to pre-empt its decisions. The new board will represent the interests of both sides and will bring them together in an amicable, positive and proactive way in the best interests of all regions in the mid-west.</P>

Deputy Collins would perhaps have an interest in siting the headquarters in Limerick but he is being magnanimous about locating it in Foynes. The Deputy's support for this amendment adds credence to the decision to locate the headquarters in Foynes.</P>
      <P>From a Kerry point of view, it would be more balanced to locate the headquarters in Foynes because it is half way along the County Kerry Shannon Estuary coastline. I agree that the headquarters should be in Foynes. From the point of view of facilitating developments on all parts of the estuary, especially on the Ballylongford-Tarbert land bank, it is very important that it should be in close proximity to it. Decentralisation is also a factor. I have no doubt the Minister will accept this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain my motives. Before anybody spoke to me and having read the report and considered the recommendation of the consultants that the headquarters should be split in two, I made the decision that that ran contrary to the concept of a united port company. I announced it at the opening press conference in Limerick, and I claim credit for that. The reason for my decision is simple. It does not make any sense to have two divisions in the headquarters of the company as recommended by the consultant. That is not to say that some administrative work which is specific to the port of Limerick will not be carried out in Limerick. However, the main corporate headquarters should be in Foynes. The combined business of the two companies and the facilities over which most business influence can be exerted by the new port company are at Foynes. Also, the thrust of Government policy is away from centralisation in major towns and cities. I explained this fully to the boards and management of the two port companies when I visited them and believe my view has been accepted by both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I introduced a specific amendment to the Bill in the Seanad on foot of the concerns raised about the identification of the headquarters location of the new port company. The Bill now empowers the Minister, in addition to prescribing by order matters such at the company name, also <Col N="1080" /> to provide for the identification of the headquarters location. It will be at Foynes in the case of the new port company, and I was already committed to that.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat puzzling that despite public pronouncements on issues such as the location of the headquarters, there remains a degree of unease and lack of acceptance that commitments given will be delivered upon. While these fears are unjustified and are groundless, nevertheless, the more clarity there is now about future actions and the new structures the better. For this reason I announced on Second Stage that Kieran McSweeney, the current chairman of the Foynes Port Company, who lives in Limerick &ndash; that was an important factor in my decision &ndash; and who is a member of the transitional implementation board, has agreed to accept my invitation to act as chairperson of the new single port company. When the board is constituted in accordance with section 43(2)(e) of the Harbours Act, 1996, as amended by this Bill, I propose to nominate Mr. McSweeney in that capacity. I am delighted that Mr. McSweeney, an IBEC nominee to his current position, has agreed to take on this challenge and to bring his strong business and commercial expertise as well as his public service background to making the new company an outstanding success.</P>
    <P>Regarding inserting a specific provision in the Bill that the new company headquarters will be located in Foynes, I am not convinced that this is necessary or in line with good legislative practice. While I note what the Deputy says in regard to the 1998 Bill, I do not accept that it is a precedent. I do not think it was good practice then, and it would not be good practice now. However, the headquarters, meaning the principal office of the company, the company's registered office, the place where the board holds its meetings &ndash; which is not to say that it cannot hold its meetings in other places if it wishes to do so &ndash; and the core of senior executive staff will be based at Foynes. I cannot be more specific than that. I will consult the implementation board on the technical details.</P>
    <P>I intend to move very quickly once the Bill is enacted to make the appropriate order identifying Foynes as the headquarters location. My Department will ensure, in the context of its corporate governance role, that arrangements for the new headquarters at Foynes are put in place as a priority by the implementation board.</P>
    <P>Given that we want to make this the most prestigious port in the country, it is appropriate that a new building should be built to house the new headquarters, and that new building should reflect and be reflected in a prestigious and high-profile location in Foynes. I do not for a moment feel that the Ted Russell docks in Limerick would be downgraded. The headquarters in Foynes will reflect very well on the estuary. It is in the centre of the estuary. As Deputy Deenihan says, it takes in Kerry and, if Ballylongford proves successful, it will be strategically located to Ballylongford. I <Col N="1081" /> was also conscious of the existence of the ferry which gives immediate access to the headquarters in County Clare. Limerick City is developing fast. It does not need to have this headquarters. It will be a major boost for Foynes to have it there. It is not necessary for me to enshrine that in legislation. My word is my bond, and it will be a brave Minister who would come after me and change it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that when the Minister made his announcement on 26 March in the Ryan Hotel, he was quite definitive in announcing that Foynes would be the headquarters. I am aware of his clarity during Priority Questions, in the Seanad and now. However, I respect the Minister's decision because it was a logical one. Foynes is a central location. Deputy Deenihan could not have described it better. It is strategically convenient to Ballylongford developments. It is strategically well positioned with Limerick 20 miles away and the of necklace of ports, which are really private ports, that surrounds the Foynes area. The amount of revenue that the Shannon Estuary Ports Company got from ports which were probably more contiguous to Foynes is like the mythical throwing of a dart into the Shannon Estuary a long time ago. That is history. We have moved on and are talking about the present. Foynes is a logical location. The Minister said it was not good legislative practice, but the Harbours (Shannon Estuary Development Corporation) Bill, 1988, contained a simple statement in section 6 to the effect that the corporation would maintain its principal office at Foynes, County Limerick. That was logical at that stage in the context of a Bill which fell in the wake of a general election. It would be logical on this occasion. However, I accept the Minister's assurance at this stage.</P>
      <P>The officials have said it cannot be included in the Bill itself. In the course of the first discussion I had with the Minister after his appointment, he asked me what I considered to be the most important areas in the context of the location of the headquarters. This was opposed successfully over 25 years. Whoever was in Opposition always opposed it whenever it was mooted by the Department. On this occasion the Opposition has taken a pragmatic approach which was conditioned on the basis of the Minister having been magnanimous and forthcoming at an early stage in stating to me in private discussions that he would give favourable consideration to locating the headquarters at Foynes. The Minister made the ultimate decision, but he was conditioned to a degree by all the factors which pointed to Foynes as being the most suitable location. This Bill is significant and important for the future of the estuary and it should be seen as contributing positively. In recent times there have been clear-cut approaches from industrialists who may consider setting up in the estuary, particularly in the Foynes area, and I hope this comes to fruition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> The Minister is correct in terms of the headquarters and its location. I have always felt the headquarters should be located in the main harbour area. It would probably cost much to re-equip the offices at the present location. The main players are situated within the confines of the harbour in very fine offices which the agents and stevedores built. I feel strongly about the issue and will press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&ndash;The Shannon Estuary Development Company established in September 1997 will be a subsidiary of the transferee company formed by the amalgamation of the Foynes Port Company and the Shannon Estuary Ports Company pursuant to section 43 of the Harbours Act, 1996 (as amended by section 1 of the Harbours (Amendment) Act, 2000).&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In 1996 when I was Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture I decided to establish a strategy group to give the Tarbert-Ballylongford area a chance. I felt we had received numerous promises over the years. I remember one Minister visiting the site before an election in 1981 and turning a sod to much fanfare in the company of local Deputies. Over time numerous Ministers came to Listowel and made promises about the potential of the landbank, but nothing happened. I have heard people fantasising about the landbank over the years. We all recognise it has significant natural advantages, such as deep water, but nothing has happened and there must be a reason for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of this lack of commitment I thought the best thing to do was to establish a company focused on the development of the landbank and to examine all its possible uses. The Shannon estuary strategy group was established and included all the main stakeholders, including the Department of the Marine. In September 1997 a subsidiary company of Shannon Development, the Shannon Estuary Development Company Limited, was established. Subsequently it commissioned Price Waterhouse to produce a very good report, the Shannon Estuary Development Limited position paper. Much of what appeared in the KPMG report was included in that report. That position paper included three key conclusions, namely, that the estuary is a multi-use entity and must be planned as such to harmoniously accommodate a mix of industry, tourism, acquaculture recreation, shipping and so on; that all future developments would have to be carefully handled to avoid infringing on other users of the estuary or conflicting with the various existing or proposed planning conservation and environmental designations; and that a large number of statutory bodies are concerned with various aspects of the management, planning and <Col N="1083" /> administration of the estuary making a unified approach more difficult.</P>
    <P>Things have since evolved and following publication of the position paper a meeting was sought with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Woods, in early 1999. However, for whatever reason he did not meet the group and the working of the group became more or less irrelevant. The group became dormant. I made inquiries today and was glad to hear it had a meeting recently. It feels the initiative has taken on a new meaning and relevance. It would be better if the company was under the umbrella of the board being established by the Minister so it could give a focus not only to the landbank in Ballylongford but to the coastal management of the estuary. That is why I am promoting the amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to dwell too long on the issue. There have been three reports on it already and I do not wish to go back over old ground. In the context of an overall development approach for the estuary, it would be better if this company, which has thankfully been reactivated by Shannon Development &ndash; perhaps following a few tough letters &ndash; was under this arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I know there will be a focus on the development of the estuary in terms of marketing, but the organisations such as Shannon Development, the IDA and others in the area may feel on the periphery. They could be complementary to the board and it should be possible to provide for a special company associated with the new board in terms of carrying out the work, which would help the new port company and further advance the estuary.</P>
      <P>I very much respect what the Minister said about investigating the feasibility of a container business as there have been many promises and false dawns for Ballylongford. Ballylongford has often been used for general election purposes with regard to projections of jobs and various projects. At this stage it is important to clearly and quickly establish what is suitable for Ballylongford and whether the container business is feasible. The report referred to by Deputy Deenihan clearly sets out what is suitable. In the time of the late George Colley there was talk of a smelter, but in this day and age there would be no acceptance of such a project. Therefore, there is a limited niche market in terms of suitability and given the depth of water. I would very much respect a timescale being placed on the special investigation being carried out by the Minister. The previous Minister, Deputy Woods, set a timeframe for the KPMG report so it would be produced as quickly as possible and I am sure a timeframe can be imposed on the consultants examining the suitability of Ballylongford for a container business.</P>
      <P>The amendment is worth supporting.</P>

      <P>It was I who reactivated the Shannon Estuary Development Company when I discovered on taking office that it had not met for over 12 months. I did so because I was of the view that it had a very important role to play. I informed the chairman and a number of other board members that it was my intention to proceed with the establishment of the new port company. It is only appropriate that the Shannon Estuary Development Company should continue to play a role in the wider development of the estuary in the areas mentioned by the Deputy, including aquaculture and tourism. The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Shannon Development and its objectives extend to Ballylongford. I am satisfied that it will be fully represented in the new single port company. This is the best way it can contribute to the wider development of the estuary.</P>
      <P>The new single port company can act as a catalyst for the development of the estuary and reinvigorate the work of the Shannon Estuary Development Company which I intend will be represented on the new board &ndash; both can work in tandem. It would not be appropriate for the Shannon Estuary Development Company to become a subsidiary of the new single port company as they have separate and distinct roles, albeit complementary, which should be kept at arm's length. I take Deputy Deenihan's point that there is a very strong bond between the two.</P>
      <P>An examination is being conducted by my Department, the Department of the Taoiseach and SFADCo to identify once and for all whether anything can be done in Ballylongford in terms of transshipment. We hope to be in a position to make an announcement before September. In the meantime we are moving quickly ahead and talking to the major worldwide players in the container business.</P>
      <P>While I do not propose to accept the amendment, I am prepared to discuss with Deputy Deenihan and others proposals designed to ensure close integration and collaboration between the new single port company and the Shannon Estuary Development Company.</P>

It was inexplicable that it had not met for over one year given the level of commitment shown in the previous three years. I look forward to discussing with the Minister the relationship between the two companies. The objective of the amendment is to avoid duplication. The Minister has indicated that the new port company will look after port matters, such as the handling of cargo, the provision of proper facilities and ensuring the port is competitive, while the broader develop<Col N="1085" /> ment role will rest with the Shannon Estuary Development Company.</P>

These activities will be the responsibility of the Shannon Estuary Development Company while the new port company will be specifically responsible for port developments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&ndash;Section 12 of the Harbours Act, 1996, is hereby amended by the addition in subsection (1)(d) after &lsquo;environment,' of &lsquo;in particular, by carrying out environmental impact assessments of such activities, and to have due regard to the consequences of such activities on tourism,'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with harbours in general, not just the Shannon Estuary. It seeks to amend section 12 of the Harbours Act, 1996, to provide for the carrying out of environmental impact assessments. A variety of activities, including trade, commerce, industry and tourism, take place in harbours which can have a negative impact on the environment. There is a need to strike a balance as the various interests have often been in conflict. Cork is but one example. The same is true of other European harbours. It is suggested in the amendment that harbour companies would be the appropriate bodies to maintain an overview and should have the power to carry out environmental impact assessments to ensure a proper balance is maintained and particular proposals do not have a negative effect on the environment.</P>

      <P>The environmental impact assessment regulations amend the legislation governing harbours and provide for environmental impact assessments. All relevant development proposals within the consent system are required to undergo environmental impact assessment. A consent application for such developments must be accompanied by an environmental impact statement, which is a statement of the likely significant environmental effects, good or bad, of the proposal. The competent authority in its consideration of an application must carry out an environmental impact assessment of the proposal based, among other things, on the information contained in the environmental impact statement. Consequently, as port companies and harbour authorities are already obliged to comply in full with EIA regulation requirements, as prescribed by the EU and enshrined in national law, the amendment is not necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members of this House and the Seanad for the constructive way in which they dealt with this legislation, especially Deputy Finucane and Deputy Collins, who had most interest in the Bill. I also thank Deputies O'Sullivan, Deenihan, O'Malley, Wade, Donal Carey, and O'Shea and Deasy with their Waterford interest. It is a milestone that after so long, this Bill has finally been passed. I was delighted at the constructive approach taken. There were some concerns and there will be difficulties, but I have no doubt that in a spirit of co-operation, partnership and trust, they will be overcome by the implementation board. We will support the board to enable it get to the point as quickly as possible where the new port company can take over running the single port.</P>
      <P>I learned this evening of Deputy Finucane's move to be his party's spokesman on Defence. I congratulate him on his three years of work on the Marine and Natural Resources. In my time in the Dáil and watching him from another role prior to becoming Minister, I have rarely come across a more constructive Opposition spokesman. At a time when politicians perhaps tear each other apart a lot &ndash; we have all done it in Opposition &ndash; Deputy Finucane has been very effective and gentlemanly in his role as Opposition spokesman. In a very knowledgeable way he put forward the case of many people involved in the marine sector. In the few months I have been Minister I have been amazed at the depth of his knowledge, given that he would not have the back-up at my disposal in terms of departmental staff, etc.</P>
      <P>In his three years as Opposition spokesman, Deputy Finucane made a very significant contribution to the development of a Department which has come on in leaps and bounds over a number of years. That is due to the work of a number of my predecessors from a range of different parties. I intend to try and develop the Department into a major area of economic development. Deputy Finucane contributed to that since I took up office. I wish him well in his new post in Defence and I thank him for his constructive approach to this Bill and to so many other issues since I took up office. My predecessor, Deputy Woods, had the same to say of him.</P>
      <P>I thank my officials who put a lot of work into the Bill. Aspects of it were difficult and technical. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his kind wishes. It is ironic that I should leave this post with this Bill. I wish the new board <i>bon voyage</i> when it takes office with the merged entity of Foynes Port Company and the Shannon Estuary Port Company. It will be a successful entity and, overall, it will be very good for the estuary.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to be constructive and pragmatic with this Bill. I have had differences at times with some of the departmental officials, however, their hearts are in the right place when it comes to the marine sector. I found my three years as my party's spokesman on the marine most interesting. I learned much about the area, including the span of responsibility that exists in the Department. I am sure the Minister has been surprised at the scope of the Department. It has been an exciting time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins and I have always acted in the interest of Foynes and I am sure Deputy O'Sullivan can talk knowledgeably about Limerick. Now that the Bill has been passed, I hope it will be implemented speedily. I welcome the Minster's announcement this evening of the capital investment for Foynes and Limerick. It is a step in the right direction and will give a new impetus to the board of Foynes with regard to new equipment.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister's recognition of Foynes Yacht Club and I note he is prepared to provide funding. That would be very much appreciated by the yacht club community, which exists in close harmony with the local port.</P>

With co-operation on all sides it can develop the Shannon Estuary in a way that will be hugely beneficial for the whole region. I am sure the Minister will find there will be full co-operation from all of the various areas affected by the legislation.</P>
      <P>He said in his closing remarks that he intended that the Department would be an agent for development, economic prosperity and improvement. Certainly the Shannon Estuary will provide an excellent challenge. I am sure we will see much progress there in the future with this joint board.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister and his officials for bringing forward this complicated Bill. As Deputy O'Malley said, this is the fourth such Bill, three having already fallen. This Bill went so smoothly because there was a different approach by this Minister and the officials in comparison to the approaches made by previous Ministers and the officials in so far as when the other Bills were introduced it was a question of one port taking over the other. This did not happen in this case as the Minister and this officials consulted the boards of both ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a former member of Limerick Harbour Board. That was before Deputy O'Sullivan's time. I compliment the members of both boards, the Shannon port company and Foynes Port <Col N="1089" /> Company, and the good work done by all the people employed by the boards, and by the directors of the boards, the chief executive officers, the harbour masters, the employees and the dockers.</P>
    <P>I too compliment my Limerick West colleague, Deputy Finucane. In fairness to him and the other Members, we work together for the benefit of the people we represent.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be good, not only for the people of Limerick city and Limerick West, but for the people of north Kerry and Clare also. I compliment Deputy Deenihan for putting his shoulder to the wheel and making sure that Ballylongford was looked after, but it was a pity he was not here earlier when Deputy O'Malley was here. Deputy O'Malley set up the Ballylongford land bank and got Shannon Development to purchase it, and when things were bad in the late 1980s he stopped it from selling the land bank. In fairness, Deputy O'Malley deserves a great deal of credit also.</P>

      <P>I did not think we would reach this day. As the Minister will be aware, the three previous efforts fell because of elections. It nearly happened again. The Minister has brought the Bill home safely and steered it well, and I thank him.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill amends section 29(2) of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. The purpose of this amendment Bill is to extend the temporary registration period, as set out in section 29(2) of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, from an aggregate period of not more than five years to an aggregate period of not more than seven years. It is intended to do this to ease recruitment and retention difficulties being experienced by hospitals of non-consultant hospital doctors.</P>
      <P>From 1 July, some hospitals are experiencing difficulties in securing their required number of junior doctors. This amendment will remove one of the obstacles in that it will allow doctors who may have had to leave the country, to remain here and thereby ease some staffing difficulties.</P>
      <P>The staffing requirements of hospitals and the deployment of staff within hospitals is a matter for local management having regard to the services which hospitals are expected to provide. There are particular staffing difficulties being faced by the health services at present across a wide range of areas, particularly in the medical, para-medical and nursing areas.</P>
      <P>Action is being taken on a number of fronts to address these difficulties. However regarding the medical staffing of hospitals, the issues are currently being addressed by the Medical Manpower Forum. With particular regard to non-consultant hospital doctors, the forum is seeking to redress the imbalance between career posts and training posts, the need to improve post-graduate medical training to keep more Irish medical graduates in the country and the need to look at the position of women in medicine in Ireland with a view to redressing the number who leave medicine. The Medical Manpower Forum is due to publish its first report shortly.</P>
      <P>Health service employers and the Health Service Employers Agency are continuing to monitor the take up by non-consultant hospital doctors of employment offers made for 1 July 2000. The situation is likely to remain fluid until then as an NCHD may have an offer of employment from more than one hospital. I expect further positions to be filled up to and after 1 July. Hospitals are exploring different options in an effort to ensure that essential posts are filled. In the event that some posts remain unfilled, hospitals will be asked to ensure that essential and critical services are not affected. With the full co-operation from all concerned, and a commitment to making the best use of available resources, the effect on services can be minimised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, while the primary responsibility for the staffing of hospitals rests with hospital management, I am seeking the co-operation of <Col N="1091" /> the Opposition in amending the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, to extend the period of temporary registration for NCHDs from five years to seven years. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Minister earlier this week, the Fine Gael Party will not oppose this measure. The measure is a symptom of everything that is wrong with the health service.</P>
      <P>There are major structural problems in the context of the staffing of the health service. For far too long, those problems have not been addressed. We have been told that the Medical Manpower Forum will bring forward proposals which the Government will consider. The Medical Manpower Forum was originally scheduled to bring forward those proposals by the end of December 1999. Ever since December 1999, whenever I, Deputy McManus or other Members of this House raised questions about when the report will be seen, we were told it will be seen shortly.</P>
      <P>I do not know the reason for the delay within the forum. It is rumoured that there are major disagreements within the forum as to the proposals which should finally be recommended to the Minister but it seems that until we see this report, the Minister and the Department are paralysed by an inability to address the major staff difficulties in the medical area in the context of the hospitals.</P>
      <P>For a number of months I have been predicting that we will have difficulties on 1 July with NCHDs and that posts will remain vacant. Other Members of the House have made the same prediction. The Irish Hospital Consultants' Association and the IMO issued similar warnings. The only people for whom it seems to have been a surprise are the Minister, the Minister of State and those in the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Right up until the end of May we were being assured that difficulties will not arise on 1 July. As we entered June, we were told there could be one or two vacant posts in anaesthesia. We now know, one working day from 1 July, that there are in the region of 135 vacant posts and it is likely that they will remain vacant. We know there is a major crisis in the area of anaesthesia, that hard-pressed doctors working in accident and emergency units in a number of hospitals will lack the additional doctors and that posts will remain unfilled within those units from 1 July. It is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure could and should have been brought before the House months ago. Many non-EU junior doctors will have known from the beginning of the year, or at least from March, that their five year temporary registration would be expiring, and they will have made arrangements to take jobs outside the State from 1 July. My understanding &ndash; the Minister of State can confirm this &ndash; is that no more than 20 doctors may retain their posts or obtain new ones in the State <Col N="1092" /> as a result of this provision. The Bill should have been brought before the House months ago to address this issue in so far as it can be addressed. I appreciate that my time for speaking is limited and I have, in the context of comments on this issue elsewhere, listed many of the hospitals which are now in difficulty as a consequence of staff shortages in terms of non-consultant hospital doctors which already exist or will exist from 1 July.</P>
    <P>If additional junior doctors are to be attracted to the State from non-European Union countries, it must be ensured that they are shown the respect to which they are entitled and that the conditions under which we expect them to work are reasonable. It is an outrageous and racial discrimination which should not be tolerated that non-EU doctors who have temporary registration, who are given posts in this country on whom our medical services depend if they are to function properly, are not, for the first year they work in this State, allowed to have their spouses and children join them. It is an indefensible provision to have in place. I raised this previously with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and with the Minister for Health and Children, and I was told it was being examined and reviewed. I fail to understand why any doctor coming from outside the European Union, who legitimately comes to Ireland to take up a position which has been offered to him, who has temporary registration and has been given whatever visa is required, should be told that he cannot bring his wife and children with him to the State. That is intolerable. Even if there were no shortages, that should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>In the context of the urgent need to recruit additional junior doctors, I urge the Minister of State to speak with his colleague in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and ask that this issue be addressed and resolved immediately. If it is, additional applications may be made to come to Ireland by young non-consultant hospital doctors from outside European countries and it is possible that posts which will be vacant on 1 July will be taken up later in July or in August. When foreign doctors from outside the European Union come to this State, there is no reason the job they are offered should not be family friendly. I would love to hear a rational explanation from the Minister of State in his reply as to why we preserve this appalling discrimination. If we were told that people of Irish nationality who took up medical posts in the United States were forbidden to bring their wives and children with them, there would be an outcry. Representations would be made by the Department of Foreign Affairs and we would be looking to friendly Senators and Congressmen to raise the issue on Capitol Hill. I cannot fathom why we keep the provision in place.</P>
    <P>I could say much more but I appreciate that this is a brief Bill which briefly addresses an issue that requires to be addressed. The other issue that requires to be addressed is to ensure that we <Col N="1093" /> take a radically different approach to our medical education system. A number of doctors from European Union and non-EU countries would come here if they felt that the training they would receive in some of the hospitals which have vacancies would be up to scratch. That is a fundamental issue which professional bodies are taking much too long to address and the Minister of State should kick them into action.</P>
    <P>This is the last speech I will deliver in the House as Fine Gael spokesperson on health and children. I have found that I have a great interest in the brief. I was grateful to be asked to deal with health issues. I hope I have raised issues which needed to be raised in a constructive way and that, where I criticised Ministers or Ministers of State, it was understood I was doing so in the context of representing the public interest and seeking to ensure that areas within the health service and relating to child care which I believed were not being adequately addressed would be addressed. I wish the Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Ministers of State, Deputies Moffatt and Hanafin, well in their briefs for the rest of the lifetime of the Government. I hope some of the badly needed reforms in the health service which we regularly debate in the House will be brought to fruition.</P>
    <P>I say to the officials of the Department of Health and Children that I have at times been critical of the Department because I sincerely believe it is a Department which needs restructuring, additional resources to provide the type of service necessary and reform of the information technology units. The fact that the Bill was introduced at the last minute is yet another example of the difficulties experienced by the Minister in the Department in keeping track of where crises arise in the health service. I wish the officials of the Department well in their work in years to come.</P>

    <P>The Labour Party supports this amending legislation, for which we called. We regret it has taken so long for it to come before us and are highly critical of the circumstances surrounding its introduction. The medical manpower crisis is in full spate. There were many early warnings from the professions, the Opposition, myself and the Labour Party, yet, astonishingly, it has taken until now, when the crisis has taken hold, for a response from the Minister of State and the Department. That is an indictment of the diffi<Col N="1094" /> culty experienced by the Department in responding when there is a need, despite it being staffed by what I am sure are well-meaning, highly qualified and committed people. We are witnessing the fallout from the failure to address the need for fundamental reform of the operation of hospitals and the relationship between them and the Department.</P>
    <P>This proposal will only make a marginal difference. Smaller hospitals are inevitably being affected by the medical manpower shortage. Today, we have the example of Naas hospital, which is very busy, experiencing critical difficulties. Some of my constituents attend Naas hospital. It has not received much attention in the past but, fortunately, the rainbow Government gave a commitment, which is being followed through, for a major new project there. However, the immediate problem still exists. This could have been dealt with if the Minister for Health and Children, the Medical Council and the hospital management had met earlier. It is regrettable that patients are bearing the brunt of a failure on the Minister's part.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone would want to deny or take away the right of the Medical Council to protect excellence within the service and proper standards. However, it is clear that the financial requirements may be putting an obstacle in the way of non-EU doctors choosing to come here. I understand the British equivalent of the Medical Council carries out its procedures and examinations in the place of origin, which I would have thought we might be able to do here in the interests of Irish patients.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the Minister's focus should be on dealing with Irish trained doctors. I understand the wastage of medical graduates not staying after qualification at the moment is approximately 20%. A similar leaching is taking place in the nursing profession. It is very worrying that we are putting great investment into training doctors. We have no shortage of educational establishments. One of the points frequently made in the past was that we are training too many doctors. However, we are losing a great many of them. The previous Minister, Deputy Cowen, said that approximately 60% of graduates emigrate. Not all of them emigrate permanently, but that is an indication there are not sufficient attractions to hold doctors here, both in terms of pay and conditions and, in particular, the training programme and framework within which they can function and develop their skills.</P>
    <P>Our public system is still too dependent on the NCHDs. I was struck by the Minister's answer yesterday, where he pointed out there was a shortage of approximately 132 junior hospital doctors but also an equivalent number of vacant posts at consultant level. I appreciate the point he made that locums are filling places. However, we have seen where a particular 77 year old locum consultant caused a lot of grief and anxiety by filling posts around the country. He raised grave anxieties and concerns in relation to patient care. <Col N="1095" /> The system for appointing consultants is very cumbersome.</P>
    <P>Promises have been made to deal with outstanding issues raised by the Medical Council, particularly in terms of disciplinary structures. In a reply to a parliamentary question on 27 May 1999, the then Minister said he expected to be in a position to circulate the heads of a Bill in 1999. This was to meet the other demands to amend the Medical Practitioners Act. Tonight, we are just amending one word. Now, in the middle of 2000, there is still no sign of the Bill or its heads and not much indication we will see it. Given there will now be a three month recess, it is hard to see when this Bill will be published. It is certainly badly needed.</P>
    <P>We need to focus clearly on what is happening, in terms of the commitment and investment we are making to produce Irish trained doctors that we are subsequently losing out of the system. I accept the Minister's point that this has historic roots. However, it is crazy for us to, in effect, subvent richer countries, such as the US, when we should be ensuring we are attracting back people working in practice elsewhere and providing the very best training system and pathway for young medical graduates. We can certainly afford to do that. We could have a world class training programme and pathway for young doctors. At the moment, we have anything but that. In many ways, what we are doing tonight is simply reinforcing the point that this is the most important task facing the Minister and that he would want to get motoring on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support what the Minister has laid before us in this amendment. It is very fitting that, as a general practitioner, he is bringing in this Bill, on which I compliment him. I also join in the compliments to Deputy Shatter on his work as spokesperson on health and wish him the best of luck in his new responsibilities.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Shatter said about the position of junior doctors is very relevant, particularly the fact that doctors from the EU and elsewhere do not always find this a welcoming place. Doctors and their families who come to this country to take up employment should be welcomed. They have been discriminated against, particularly on the question of registration. There has been a long-standing battle with the Medical Council to have their qualifications recognised. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, has taken up this issue, particularly in relation to doctors who specialise in psychiatry. In Ballinasloe, doctors from Sri Lanka have been putting the case for many years that their qualifications have not been recognised by the Medical Council. The Department of Health and Children and the Minister should look at that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the great developments in our hospital buildings and the new facilities we have, we need more staff. For example, a £70 million tender has <Col N="1096" /> been awarded for improvements to University College Hospital, Galway. We will be very proud of that hospital in the future.</P>
    <P>Portiuncula Hospital, which has been taken over by the Western Health Board, is one of the many hospitals throughout the country that have been taken over by the health boards. I am very proud of the fact it is going to be a public hospital because there is always a danger that these hospitals could end up as private hospitals. It was a voluntary hospital run by the Franciscan order and it is now coming into the public health sector. Such hospitals should receive support and continue to get the funding they were getting directly from the Department. That support includes the provision of staff. Portiuncula Hospital will now be dealing with the midlands as well as the Western Health Board area. It covers a number of health boards because of the large number of people who will use the hospital.</P>
    <P>Although this Bill involves a very simple amendment, moving the aggregate period of more than five years to seven years, it is very important. I hope the Minister will look at the other issues I mentioned. I compliment him on the work he has done, particularly for the elderly. With the developments we know are to take place in Loughrea and Ballinasloe for welfare homes, it is very important that the necessary staffing is put in place for those two new hospitals. We will have, with the support of the Minister of State, new units in Ballinasloe and Loughrea, where we will be refurbishing the former St. Brendan's Hospital. It is important that staffing is provided there as well.</P>
    <P>I welcome this simple but important amending legislation. I hope the Minister of State will take on board the questions that have been raised in respect of junior hospital doctors. We should welcome non-national junior doctors and their families to Ireland and try to resolve the problems they have encountered, over many years, in registering with the Irish Medical Council.</P>

        <b>:</b> I welcome the Bill but I wish to sound a note of criticism. I was among a group of Deputies who met the staff of St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, and we were informed about the chaos that would arise if the current system remained in place. Those people to whom we spoke suggested at that stage that the term should be extended from five to seven years and this should have been done at least a month ago. If it had been done, we would have avoided the difficulties that have now arisen. The current lack of trained anaesthetists will cause further havoc in hospitals because consultants can only do a certain amount of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill, I reiterate that this matter should have been dealt with much sooner. If action had been taken, we would have avoided what is now the case, that vacancies in hospitals cannot be filled because successful applicants <Col N="1097" /> have already taken up other positions. However, perhaps it is a case of better late than never.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members, particularly Deputies Shatter and McManus, for their support for the Bill. I wish Deputy Shatter every success in his new portfolio. The Deputy has proven to be a responsive and good Opposition spokesperson on health and he put us under pressure on many occasions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter is correct to state that the Bill may only safeguard 20 posts. I accept his point that the conditions relating to junior doctors from outside the State who come here to work could be improved. As the Deputy indicated, we could be more flexible in our dealings with the spouses and children of these individuals. I am sure Deputy Shatter, in his new portfolio, will raise this matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>The medical education system must be improved if we are to retain Irish non-consultant hospital doctors in Ireland. As already stated, this is one of a number of measures being taken to improve the lot of the NCHDs employed in our hospitals. The threatened industrial action has been averted with the provision of £60 million, the Medical Manpower Forum is due to report shortly and the 48 hour week will also be implemented. It is clear that progress is being made.</P>
      <P>Deputy McManus inquired about the consultative process in respect of the Medical Practitioners Act. This is currently under way. The former Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children has been retained to work on this legislation. The Medical Manpower Forum is conscious of the exodus of junior doctors and will address many of the issues raised by Members during the debate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael Kitt expressed concern about the situation at Portiuncula Hospital and the position of a number of Sri Lankan doctors. This matter will be reconsidered. I thank him for his comments on the new units it is proposed to built at Ballinasloe and Loughrea. Work on these will commence as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy John Browne referred to anaesthetists and stated that matters concerning them should have been resolved a month ago. I believe the Deputy referred to this issue previously but the situation did not appear to be as critical at that stage. I take the Deputy's point because I appreciate practical criticism.</P>

    <P>
      <b>
      </b>
    </P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with the arrangements for the tenure of office of local authority managers and comprises one substantive section, namely, section 1, which amends the Local Government Act, 1991. Fixed tenure arrangements were originally introduced for local authority managers by the Local Government Act, 1991. Section 47 of that Act allowed the Minister to introduce such arrangements by way of an order laid before both Houses. These arrangements were introduced by such an order made in 1991 and provided for a standard fixed term of seven years and for interim transitional arrangements.</P>
    <P>Managers are entitled to apply for other manager posts in the same way as other local authority officials may apply for posts in other local authorities. There are benefits to this system of open competitive mobility between local authorities both from the point of view of staff progression, experience and career development and for local authorities in providing a pool of experience from which to draw on the basis of merit. However, at the most senior level of manager, undue movement of staff, with frequent departures, tend to destabilise the system. A certain level of stability is essential.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the seven year tenure seems to have had the unintended effect of increasing the likelihood of managers applying for manager posts in other local authorities. The principal reason managers apply for other manager posts is to ensure continued employment. To ensure that they have a new appointment before a current term expires, the trend is for managers to start looking for new posts after approximately four to five years' service. This has resulted in managers vacating their existing posts prematurely and has led to instances of instability in local authority management, which is not in the best interests of efficient and effective local government. The fundamental problem would seem to be that the contract periods are currently too short. A seven year contract with an option to extend by three years giving a maximum total of ten years, as proposed, is intended to address <Col N="1099" /> this difficulty. I will now deal with the provisions of the Bill in more detail.</P>
    <P>Section 1 provides for the new arrangements to be introduced by regulations in the same way the original seven year term was introduced. Such regulations by virtue of section 3 of the Local Government Act, 1991, will be required to be laid before both Houses and are subject to annulment by resolution of either. The new tenure regime will provide as follows: the basic seven year contract will continue to stand as at present, managers will, however, have the option to extend this by three years, given a total maximum of ten years; a maximum retirement age of 65 will apply in all cases; the extension option will have to be exercised by the person concerned, giving notification to the cathaoirleach within a period &ndash; the notification period &ndash; to be prescribed in the regulations; a different notification period may be specified for a transitional phase following the introduction of the new arrangements; the standard notification period for the exercise of the extension option will be specified in the regulations as the fifth year of service within the seven year tenure; the cathaoirleach must notify the members of the local authority, the Local Appointments Commission and the Minister when given notification; where a person gives notification, he or she is precluded from applying for a manager post until six months before the expiry of his or her extended term of office and the Local Appointments Commission is precluded from considering any application made within that excluded period; and the regulations can, however, specify manager posts to which this prohibition will not apply, for example, Dublin city and Cork county, to ensure a sufficiency of suitable candidates for these top posts.</P>
    <P>I should point out that identical provisions to those now contained in section 1 have recently been considered by the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Govermnent as section 261 of the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, from which they were deleted on Report Stage to proceed separately in the format of this Bill and as part of the local government code. This has been done in order that the new arrangements can be introduced without delay and in the light of the pending expiry of existing contracts later this year and early next year.</P>
    <P>The tenure arrangements now being introduced are in line with the ten years recommended by the Barrington Report and the policy in the institutes of technology where the directors are now offered ten year appointments. Finally, I should point out that the Local Government Bill, 2000, published last month, provides for the consolidation and modernisation of local government law and introduces a range of reforms. It will no doubt provide ample opportunity in the next session for the consideration of all aspects of the local government code affecting councils, managers and related matters. For the moment this Bill aims to address a specific but important issue <Col N="1100" /> which, as I have indicated, has given rise to difficulty and I commend it to the House on this basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic principle of this Bill is one which is right and proper and should be enshrined in law. However, I have a fundamental difficulty with the manner in which the Department of the Environment and Local Government, specifically the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and his colleagues, have handled this issue from the outset. The problem which we are trying to iron out tonight as we near the end of this session arises from the fact that the original Planning and Development Bill was too vast, attempted to cover too many policy areas in one code of legislation and was not as exacting as it should have been.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Government originally intended to include the provisions of this Bill in a specific section of the Planning and Development Bill but subsequently deemed it necessary to amend that as the Bill was not making the necessary progress through the House. The Bill was not making progress through the House primarily because pieces of law were added to and subtracted from the Bill at various junctures. From a parliamentary point of view, that was not satisfactory and we should not go down that road again.</P>
      <P>At this late stage in the session, we find ourselves debating an issue which should have been resolved some time ago. The latest story in regard to the Planning and Development Bill is that the President, on the advice of the Council of State, has requested the courts to consider the Bill's constitutionality. The Government has displayed a complete ineptitude to deal with parliamentary business or to deal with specific tranches of legislation in an amenable or sensible parliamentary fashion.</P>
      <P>I have some questions about the wide ranging regulations which comprise part of the first section. Throughout the Bill, there is evidence of extensive regulations which can be introduced by the Minister at any given time. Under section 1, paragraph (3) of the new section 47A provides that the Minister may make regulations for the purposes of this section and such regulations may provide for a variety of matters. It would have been far more sensible for us to have held a comprehensive debate on Committee Stage on the potential of those regulations and I regret that that did not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill relates to a very important aspect of local government administration and policy, namely, the role of the county manager. Increasingly, this is a pivotal position in terms of local government being able to deliver local services to people on the ground. It is vital that there would be continuity in the leadership provided by a county manager. One of the big problems currently besetting local government arises from the fact that a large number of companies within the private sector can readily recruit members of staff and senior officials from the sector. We are wit<Col N="1101" /> nessing that in the planning and development areas in particular. Many excellent public servants working in local government will understandably move to the private sector because the benefits and remunerations in that sector are far greater than they receive in the public sector. That problem must be addressed. A massive recruitment campaign is required throughout local government because it is currently very difficult to retain staff, particularly administrative and technical staff.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify his statement that the cathaoirleach and members of a local authority must be notified if a county manager wishes to stay on for an extra three years in addition to his or her original seven year contract? While I welcome that provision, I would like to know what would happen if local authority members refused, either by way of resolution or otherwise, to accept the county manager's application to prolong his or her contract. I am aware of the pivotal role to be played here by the Local Appointments Commission. If we are serious about giving local authorities local control, the elected members must ultimately have a greater say. In this age of supposed devolution, it will not suffice to use elected members as some kind of rubber stamp. We will return to this issue when we debate the Local Government Bill.</P>
    <P>On the prohibitions outlined in the Bill in regard to the inability of county managers to transfer from bigger local authorities, does the Minister believe this is a wise provision? Is it fair that such restrictions should be enshrined in the Bill? I believe greater flexibility is required in our public sector regime in order that people can move from one local authority to another. Such transfers would ensure that best practice and good management skills would be extended throughout the entire local government sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally accepted that one of the best reforms introduced in the public service was the provision that senior officers would hold their positions for a seven year period. That concept has wide application in the public service. The Minister is asking us to extend that period to ten years in the case of city and county managers. As a trade union official I represented city and county managers and have a high regard for their competence, skill and sense of public service. However, I am concerned about what we are being asked to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we creating a precedent? If we have a Bill stating that the term of office of city and county managers can be extended from seven to ten years will we have more legislation in the not too distant future seeking to extend the tenure of departmental secretaries general from seven to ten years? That seems to be implied in the Minister's comments when he draws attention to the fact that directors of the institutes of technology are now offered ten year appointments and that the Barrington report recommended a ten year tenure for city and county managers. It would be <Col N="1102" /> helpful if the Minister stated whether this represents a change in Government policy on the normal tenure of senior office holders and if we are to have further legislation dealing with other areas of the public service.</P>
    <P>The Minister offers as the case for this that because city and county managers are entitled to apply for county managerial posts in other local authorities there is a tendency for applications to be made in the fourth or fifth year and, therefore, there is inbuilt movement and a tenure in the system which is shorter than was expected or is desirable. I concur with that argument. However, it would be useful to know the extent of the problem. Apart from stating it is a trend, the Minister has not indicated how many cases there have been of city and county managers moving from one local authority to another in the fourth or fifth year.</P>
    <P>Presumably there are city and county managers who would have been happy to apply for an extension if this provision had been available to them but who were obliged to move. It would be useful if the Minister would indicate whether there have been cases of city or county managers who did not move to another local authority and whose tenure ended after the seven year period prior to the normal retirement age and if any application for an extension was made to him. There may be grounds for claiming that an anomaly has been created where we may have retired city or county managers who were not given this opportunity.</P>
    <P>Why it is necessary to do this now? The Local Government Bill has been published and will be debated in the autumn, if we return. I understand the Minister intends to have consultations on its provisions. That is the appropriate place in which to deal with the tenure of city and county managers. We have not been offered an explanation as to why it has been considered necessary to introduce separate legislation dealing solely with their tenure when it could more appropriately be included in the Local Government Bill.</P>
    <P>The mechanism provided for in section 1 for the extension of the tenure of a city or county manager is that six months prior to the expiry of the seven year period the manager concerned notifies the cathaoirleach of the council of his or her intention to stay on for another three years. There is no provision that allows for the possibility of that application being refused. As I said earlier, I have the highest regard for city and county managers in general. However, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that there may be occasions when there may be a city or county manager who may apply for an extension and the council might be unhappy at the prospect of being stuck with them for another three years. I would have thought it prudent to have some mechanism whereby if a manager is applying for an extension of the seven year term, it can be decided upon.</P>
    <P>Take the hypothetical case of a city or county manager who applies for jobs as manager in other local authorities after four or five years. The <Col N="1103" /> Local Appointments Commission decides not to appoint the manager to another authority and the manager then applies for an extension within his own authority. It is unwise to have a simple provision which leaves the decision on this in the hands of the manager concerned.</P>
    <P>There is need for reform of the city and county management Acts and the Local Government Act. The powers of city and county managers must be rebalanced, as must the powers of elected members of local authorities. Our system gives far too much power to city and county managers and the managerial system and far too little to elected members of local authorities. This is a subject to which I will return when and if we debate the Local Government Bill. We must look at the system of administration and administrative practices in local government. There is need for major reform in this area. A start was made on that in the better local government proposals introduced by my colleague, Deputy Howlin, when he was Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes referred to the drain of good people from the local authority system into the private sector, and I agree with him. It is particularly true in the professional area. One issue that has greatly disappointed me over the years is the unwillingness of the local government system to appoint people on other than the lowest entry grade in particular types of job or professions. We need to have an arrangement in the local government system where there is movement in and out. That would be good for the system itself. I am unhappy with the way the Minister of State is implementing some of the provisions of the Towards Better Local Government document. In general I agree with the idea of having a single reporting structure within the local government system and in rationalising that, but I am concerned by the effect that is having in undermining the professions within the local government system. The way in which this is done in some local authorities, where the posts of city or county architect or engineer, for example, are effectively being suppressed, will have serious implications for the recruitment and retention of professional staff for the local government system in the long run. I have talked to senior professional staff in local government who have pointed out clearly to me that they have no wish to apply for the new positions of directors of service which are in the process of being established nor do they wish to become county managers themselves. They work in a particular profession and wish to remain in that profession at the highest level. The new structures will effectively downgrade their position and the status of those professions. That must be looked at in the context of what the country will be doing in the next few years &ndash; the national development plan and the huge infrastructural investment which will be required in roads, housing, transport and environmental services, all areas for which local authorities are responsible. We need the highest level of pro<Col N="1104" /> fessional competence in the local authorities and there is a signal going out at the moment, arising out of the way the Towards Better Local Government proposals are being implemented, to people in professional areas that perhaps they do not have a future in their profession in the local authority service. That must be looked at by the Minister of State and he should talk to individual local authorities and county managers about how they are implementing it.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to oppose the Bill, though I intend on Committee Stage to pursue the issues I have raised in relation to section 1. We do not need a one section Bill to extend the term of office of city and county managers; we need legislation which rebalances and reforms the system of administration in local government. We need staffing structures, particularly at senior and professional levels, within the local government service through which the very best people can be recruited and retained within that service, particularly to do the major jobs in infrastructural development over the next decade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>As previous speakers have said, this is a very slight Bill. It is really a one liner which ends at achieving a specific objective. I welcome the Bill in as far as it goes, but it gives us an opportunity to reflect on the managerial system.</P>
      <P>The city and county managerial system has often been regarded as the only truly Irish initiative in public administration. When it was introduced originally in the Cork Act in the 1920s before spreading to Dublin and Limerick and subsequently, in 1940, to the entire country, it was regarded as a quite revolutionary innovation, which it was. The managerial system professionalised the local government service.</P>
      <P>The managerial system also created mandarins who were in an extraordinarily powerful position. When the managerial position was first expanded from the cities through the counties and the whole local government system in the 1940s, from 1942 to 1955 there was a series of efforts initiated by those who valued through local government to turn the issue around. Several Bills were introduced in the Dáil that did not make it to legislation until the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, was passed. When that Act was passed it was felt that we had achieved the type of rebalance to which Deputy Gilmore had referred.</P>
      <P>I too take the view that in recent years there has been an extraordinary and excessive swing of powers to the managers. If one looks at legislation passed since the 1970s, Members on all sides paid lip service to the concept of local government but, in a series of Administrations made up of all the major parties, we have consistently stripped local government of true democracy, replacing it with something approaching, if not a dictatorship, a well entrenched bureaucracy which calls the shots. There is therefore a need to regularise the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> I believe that a fixed term of tenure for local government managers is a good idea. That tenure should be relatively short &ndash; five or six years. The local government members, the council in session, should have a strong role to play in any extension of the term. That said, I suggest there is a serious need for a root and branch examination of the managerial system. The managerial system has professionalised local government, but it has also caused serious problems. In my local authority, for example, a few years ago we had the bizarre spectacle of the council chairperson, an elected representative who was the first citizen of the county, having to take the manager to the High Court to get access to a file. That should never have happened. Other local government managers find themselves in some mystification that that should have happened. There have been other cases where finding information or promoting action has prompted councillors from my county to use sections 2, 3 and 4 of the 1955 Act.</P>
    <P>That Act has become something of a whipping boy for criticism, as has the use of section 3 and section 4 motions, but essentially those are democratic devices intended to create a balance between management and elected councillors. I realise the Minister and the Minister of State in the Department of the Environment and Local Government are dedicated to improving and upgrading the local government system. I welcome the Bill, slight as it is, but I hope it is the first step in a major root and branch review of the local government system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to the transition of technical and professional staff into management staff. I differ with the Deputy in this regard. Over the last 30 years in the local government service there has been anxiety in the professional and technical ranks to make the transition into management. A person with some experience as a county engineer or assistant county engineer would be well equipped to move into a senior managerial position. Deputy Gilmore may have the loss of planning staff in mind, but that is related more to income. There has been some transition in recent years and I hope we can find measures &ndash; particularly by introducing something along the lines of a top level appointments commission within the local government service &ndash; to move more technical staff into the managerial system. I see no evidence of reluctance or feeling of downgrading among technical and professional staff that they are being downgraded by this. I know there have been applicants from the technical staff to make the transition into senior management and that all too few have been successful, but that is because of the interviewing system rather than reluctance. The Deputy did not mean to be unfair to the Minister of State, but it would be unfair to suggest that the manner in which the Minister of State has moved or intends to move has discouraged technical staff in any way from transition. Deputy Gilmore may agree that there is a bias in the system which prevents technical and professional staff from <Col N="1106" /> making the transition. Could it be that interview boards are made up of officials from the administrative grades who value the administrative experience of someone who has been an acting county manager, assistant county manager or county secretary more than the experience of a county engineer?</P>
    <P>There has been some movement from the Civil Service into local government. There has not been movement, so far as I know, from the State-sponsored sector into local government and there have been very few efforts to get into senior managerial positions from outside the public service. It would be healthy if civil servants, local government servants and the people who serve the State in the State-sponsored sector had more interraction and were regarded as a common staff pool with more transition in staffing appointments between one and the other.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it goes. It is slight legislation, anticipating changes which will come later in the year. When we discuss local government legislation we will have much to talk about. The only issue which concerns me is the lack of balance between the democratically elected councillors and the powers of the manager. The drafters of the Act which created the managerial system were fearful of a dichotomy between policy making and policy implementation and they were anxious to balance both sides. The managerial system has created a local government service which is entirely unbalanced. Far too much power lies in the hands of unelected officials who have, until very recent times, been appointed for life. It is very difficult to remove a local government manager. The powers to do so are there but I do not think they have ever been used. I cannot envisage a situation where councillors, although they might mutter behind their hands about county managers, would muster either the courage or the numbers to take effective action. The seven year appointment term is reasonable, given the need for a learning period. I am doubtful about the advisability of allowing a three year extension. Council members should have a more powerful role in this matter. If a manager has been effective and has worked with the elected members, there will be nothing to fear from a shorter period, but if he has been dogmatic, unco-operative and an abuser of his position, councillors should have some say in the matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and see no need to divide the House on it. I commend the Minister for introducing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the business of the House has been interrupted for another purpose I have the opportunity to extend my best wishes to Deputy Hayes in his new appointment. I should not say I will miss him but I probably will. I wish him congratulations and every success in his front bench appointment. I also congratulate Deputy Dukes who is not present.</P>
      <P>The Bill amends something which was done in recent years arising from a recommendation in the Barrington report. As the late Tom Barrington passed to his eternal reward recently, I extend my sympathy to his family and thank him for the wonderful contribution he made during his lifetime to the local government system. He was a forward thinker who, at times, despaired of any heed being paid to the ideas he and others promulgated. I was pleased to ask him to chair the committee which produced the report on local government reform, one of whose recommendations, the appointment of managers on a contract basis, is the subject of this Bill.</P>
      <P>It could not have been anticipated that difficulties would arise from the seven year appointment period and that excessive mobility would pose a threat to the stability of the system. The proposal contained in the Bill is reasonable and has been accepted by Members on both sides of the House. It is appropriate to proceed with the Bill and I thank Opposition Deputies for their indication of support.</P>
      <P>Other matters have been raised which are extraneous to the specific issue before us. The debate which will soon begin on the Local Government Bill will give ample opportunity to discuss every aspect of local government and I hope that opportunity will be availed of by the House when we return in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not intended to achieve this aim by bringing forward a single Bill with only two sections, but given the number of managers whose contracts will come to an end this year or <Col N="1109" /> next, it is appropriate to enact this legislation on its own. The possibility of a delay in the Planning and Development Bill, where this measure was intended to be included, made it necessary to enact this legislation in fairness to these managers.</P>
    <P>I do not have notification of the adjudication of the Council of State on this issue so I will not comment on Deputy Hayes's remark. Fundamental changes are proposed in the Planning and Development Bill on the housing strategy and the right of local authorities to acquire a percentage of land for social housing in order to meet the requirements of the housing strategy. That is a fundamental change and it is important that its constitutionality be clarified at an early stage. The matter warrants the consideration of the Council of State and I await its judgment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes referred in a critical tone to the practice of doing things by way of regulation. This is a normal provision and in this case the regulations must be laid before both Houses and are subject to annulment by both Houses. When Deputy Dukes and I were in Opposition he continually proposed that where matters could be done by regulation, they should be subject to the affirmation of the House. I am sure he will be pleased that this is what is proposed in this case.</P>
    <P>The role of local authority members involves the cathaoirleach notifying them and the Local Authority Commission of the notification he has received from the manager that within the due period he intends to apply for an extension to his contract. The Bill gives the manager an automatic right to that extension if he applies within the stated period. The members must be informed by the cathaoirleach but they have no other role in the matter. Deputy Gilmore asked what would happen if they did not agree with the request. It is not a request but a right being granted in the Bill to avail of the extension if they so wish provided they apply within the appropriate period which will be done by regulation. It is likely to be the fifth year so that there is a two year notice of the intention to seek the extension.</P>
    <P>Members, under existing provisions, have the right to suspend or remove a city or county manager by way of an appropriate vote if that is their wish and they deem or consider the manager to be unfit. I do not think there are any precedents in that regard but that provision is in existing legislation and should not be mixed up with this provision which relates to notification of the intention to apply for the extension.</P>
    <P>The situation in regard to Secretaries General is not the same. This situation does not arise in regard to Secretaries General who have a contract for a certain period and to whom the right to an extension does not apply. It is not proposed to bring forward any changes at this stage in regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>The relative position of the elected council and the manager was mentioned by Deputy Roche. This is a matter which will be a key element of the local government Bill, which was published <Col N="1110" /> recently. It sets out to redress the democratic deficit and to provide better practical supports and back up for councillors to fulfil their intended role of setting the policy parameters and overseeing the executive. The aim of that Bill is to restore the necessary balance. I am sure that during the debate on that Bill, Members will have an opportunity, if they believe it is appropriate, to strengthen the position of the elected members by way of suitable amendments. I know the Minister will be open to listening to arguments in regard to such matters and in other matters whereby the balance of power between managers and elected members can be improved. That is an important aspect of local government reform generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore mentioned the diminution of status of certain posts. He referred to the post of director of services. Information was given in the House this week in regard to this matter, and I refer to part of the reply.</P>
    <P>Proposals have been finalised for the creation of strengthened local authority management structures to meet the demands of the introduction of a programme based system of administration and the abolition of the dual structure. Under these proposals the posts of assistant county manager and county engineer will cease to exist. A new grade of director of services will be created at assistant county manager level. A number of these new posts will be filled by designation of the serving assistant managers and county engineers as directors of services. Each director of services will have responsibility for the management of all the staff, both technical and administrative, dealing with the functions assigned to him or her.</P>
    <P>The rest of the explanation in regard to these changes is contained in that reply.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned the general area of the downgrading of the county planning officer post. The new structures will not affect the level or quality of the planning advice available to local authorities. The main function of the existing county and city planning officer post in the Dublin counties and Cork city is the management of the technical planning staff. All decisions on planning matters are taken by managers and councillors who must take many other issues into account before making their decisions &ndash; for example, matters relating to roads, water, sewerage and the environment. Planning advice is just one element of the process. Technical planning matters will continue to be dealt with by senior planning staff, that is, assistant planner, executive planner, senior executive planner and senior planner. I do not know if we should get into all that detail. If Deputies want to raise those issues in greater detail, they can do so when the local government Bill is being debated.</P>
    <P>This change is something which can be justified in view of the experience to date, and I have practical experience in this regard. A fine city manager was confronted with a situation in which he <Col N="1111" /> had to make a decision. Because of his age, he had a number of years remaining in which he could serve in the public service. He had spent his life in the local government system, was an outstanding manager and made a fantastic contribution to the development of my city. He felt the options were not there in terms of a guarantee of continued employment and he applied for a position in another city. He was appointed to that position and will be moving from Galway to Cork city as the new city manager there. He will commence a new seven year contract. Galway's loss is Cork's gain. It would not have been his wish to have moved from Galway but this legislation was not in place prior to him applying for the appointment. That was going to become a major feature of the whole local government system and I expect the option to extend the contract by three years, making it a ten year contract, will, in many cases, mean this will not happen and that the situation will be stabilised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The extension is an automatic right if the manager wishes to take it up but the existing law continues in operation. If the members of the council believe the manager is not a fit person to continue as manager, they have the right to remove him from office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a subtle difference in that. The Minister of State said there were about seven or so managers who were close to the wire in regard to the seven years and that, naturally, they will be very pleased about the enactment of this legislation. What is his assessment of the level of satisfaction among assistant city or county <Col N="1112" /> managers or new directors of services, as they will be, who may consider that their ambitions to become county managers will, in some cases, be put back for three years as a result of the enactment of this legislation? Has any consideration been given to the implications of that or is there likely to be any industrial relations fall-out from such an enactment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand one contract will expire this year and five will expire next year. We have had no indications of any industrial relations problems arising from the proposed decision. Anybody aspiring to promotion would be happier now with the system in place than with the old system which prevailed whereby once a manager was appointed, he was there until the age of 65. Greater opportunities are constantly arising for the younger ambitious staff members to achieve promotion and to put themselves forward for the managerial posts because of the short contract period compared to what was there before. In my time on the council, the manager was one of the original managers who had been appointed in 1943 and he was still manager in the late 1960s or early 1970s.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

      <P>As regards prescribed notification, the manager will give notification to the chairman of the council. The Minister of State said if it is the view of a council that the person is not fit to continue, it can refuse to apppoint him or her for the following three year tenure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State might clarify that point. For example, if a resolution comes to the members from a manager seeking to continue his or her tenure for another three years, is it automatic that the three year period is in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The manager has a right to apply for an extension. If he or she does so within the prescribed regulations it is automatic. I was pointing out that the other right continues to exist whereby members can remove the manager by a majority vote if they deem him or her to be unfit. I do not think this right has ever been exercised. This has nothing to do with this Bill which gives an automatic right to an extension of tenure.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Special Educational Needs.</Title>
    <P>Mr. Browne <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i><b>:</b> I thank the Minister for coming into the House to reply to this matter, details of which I have supplied. I also express by appreciation to the staff of the Department of Education and Science, Athlone, particularly Annabel Fitzgerald, who dealt so courteously and kindly with the issues I raised.</P>
    <P>This matter arose because of a 15 year old boy attending this school who suffers from cerebral palsy and needs full-time assistance. The board of management paid £15,000 last year to provide personal assistants for this boy and another boy. Those of us on boards of management are well aware they do not have enough money. It was unfair that the board had to use this money which <Col N="1114" /> could have been spent on facilities for the rest of the pupils. However, I was informed today that a personal assistant will be appointed for this boy and I appreciate that development.</P>
    <P>However, there are other problems in the school. There are ten classes in the school comprising children with mild learning difficulties. Every four classes are entitled to a personal assistant so there are two and a half assistants. However, half an assistant is no use to two classes. I presume that will increase to three assistants and I am asking the Minister to provide an additional assistant for the ten classes.</P>
    <P>Other grades of classes have what they need. Up to lunchtime today, they had three children who needed personal assistants, but now they have two. One of these children has been assessed by the inspector twice and been judged as needing a special needs assistant. These children are severely handicapped and we should be able to look after those who cannot look after themselves when the country is flowing with milk and honey. I look forward to a positive answer from the Minister and hope that the teachers, parents and children can look forward to September knowing they will have the assistants they require for this school which deals with special children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to assure the Deputy and the House of my commitment to ensuring that the special educational needs of all children with disabilities within the education system are fully met by the Department of Education and Science. The House will be aware that, arising from a Government decision in October 1998, all children with special needs within the primary system, including children attending special schools, now have an automatic entitlement to the support they require to enable them to succeed within the education system.</P>
      <P>The supports in question may take the form of special resource teacher support or special needs assistant support, or both, depending on the assessed needs of the individual child. Already, as a result of this development, the number of special needs assistants deployed in the primary system, including the special school system, has grown from 299 in October 1998 to 1,095 at present. The number of special needs assistants in place is increasing on an ongoing basis as further needs are identified and responded to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a general rule, allocations of special needs assistant support are made on the basis of the levels of such support recommended by the special education review committee. That committee recommended specific levels of special needs assistant support for each disability category. However, in some situations, usually because of the particular needs involved, the level of special needs assistant cover required in a particular school may have to be increased. Each case is examined by the Department of Education and <Col N="1115" /> Science inspectorate on the basis of the assessed needs of the child or children involved and, where required, additional special needs assistant support above the norm is provided.</P>
    <P>The special school attended by the 15 year old boy to whom the Deputy refers caters for children with a range of special needs. This school currently has an allocation of eight special needs assistant posts from the Department.However, arising from consideration of the case made on behalf of the boy in question, my Department is making arrangements to allocate an additional special needs assistant post to cater for the boy's needs. My Department will be in touch with the school authorities in relation to this matter very shortly.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second pupil mentioned by the Deputy, I understand that special needs assistant support has already been made available to the school to assist this pupil. However, in view of the issue raised by the Deputy, I am asking my Department's inspectorate to review this case to ensure that an adequate level of special needs assistant support is made available to the child in question. The school authorities will be advised of the outcome of this review as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Education and Science, it is my intention to ensure that no child with special needs will be deprived of the support they require to enable them to reach their potential within the education system. My commitment is reflected in the manner in which the cases raised by Deputies are being responded to and in the major increase in resources which are now being devoted to the special needs area. It is my intention to continue to build on these developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that while the plan to roll out the broadband programme throughout the country is going ahead, there is now a need to focus on building on the fibreoptic system which already exists throughout the country. I would like to see that system extended in a thorough way to all the regions so that the towns and villages beyond centres of population, and including those centres of population, can play their part in the development of e-commerce and information and communications technology right throughout the country. The fibreoptic cable is in place in many parts of Ireland, including Kilkenny city, which I give as an example. It is now up to a partnership of Government and private enterprise to ensure that we build on the cable that is already in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many advantages to doing this. In Kilkenny, while we have spent £1 million through the Eircom project on providing the broadband and the necessary education and hardware to communities to enable them to participate in the development of information and communications technology, it is now essential that we provide the <Col N="1116" /> industry and the jobs that are attached to this development worldwide. The Government should focus on the participation of schools and should link up schools within regions. There is also the possibility of linking up villages and towns to ensure that they are ready to participate in e-commerce development.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the spend of nearly £4 million supported by European Union funding on the development of the infrastructure in Kilkenny city. I suggest that, in relation to the IDA development in Kilkenny and the establishment of a digital park, far more could be done by the IDA and others in relation to this broadband development and that park to attract high-tech industry to Kilkenny and fill the two factories which have been vacant for the past two years.</P>
    <P>As a model, Kilkenny city could be taken as a virtual campus, and the infrastructure which is in place could ensure that the project which is being undertaken by the Carlow Institute of Technology, by NUI Maynooth and Queen's, could be a virtual third level campus in Kilkenny city. This would be using sensibly the Government investment in this type of infrastructure in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>In relation to Eircom, a further spend is necessary, in partnership with the Government, arising from its commitment to the sale of shares and the flotation of Eircom. The Maltings project in Kilkenny could build on that investment because the infrastructure exists in the regions and in Kilkenny city. The Maltings can benefit by virtue of the fact that huge investment has been made already in education, including marginalised communities, putting in infrastructure and involving industry. The Maltings project would bring together information and communications technology projects in an incubation centre. The backdrop of a medieval city like Kilkenny, using information and communications technology as a source of jobs and a source of education, could be a model for others to follow.</P>
    <P>Portals are also very important. It is time for the Government to go into partnership with the many computer based companies that now exist in Ireland to roll out, on the back of the broadband infrastructure, portal development and other information technology developments. If we do this we will be capitalising on the huge amount of money which has been invested.</P>
    <P>Let me also focus on decentralisation. We now have a programme of decentralisation being considered by the Government. In the roll out of that decentralisation, this broadband infrastructure and the fibreoptic cable will play a huge role. In Kilkenny, and in the south-eastern region in particular, we are poised to play a major part in that development. I suggest in this regard that the Government should focus on and package that decentralisation around the development of that fibreoptic network. It is essential that we do this in order to involve everyone. If we use the structure that is there, if we build on it in terms of jobs, education, linking towns, villages and urban centres, if we move to e-Government and e-local <Col N="1117" /> government we will embrace all of the communities, those who are well off, those who are marginalised and those who are enjoying the benefits of this economy. It is essential for the Government to focus its spend in this area and in Kilkenny in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy McGuinness on raising this important issue here tonight. I am aware of the major role he has played and of the deep involvement he has had with the Minister for Public Enterprise in ensuring that Kilkenny has benefited from this crucially important infrastructure.</P>
      <P>When this Government took office the telecommunications market was very different from what it is now. It was not competition friendly. Growth in the market followed the Minister's decision to liberalise it in December 1998, ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>The telecommunications market is now much more than just voice telephony, as can be seen in the explosive growth in Internet usage. The numbers using the Internet have more than doubled over the past year or so, and it is my belief that the Internet and e-commerce offer Ireland a great opportunity for economic development, social cohesion and growth.</P>
      <P>This belief is reflected in the Electronic Commerce Bill passed earlier today by the Dáil. When the Bill becomes law, trade on the Internet will have the same legal status as that represented on paper. Ireland will be to the forefront in this regard, and the opportunities presented by this enabling legislation will be open to businesses all around the country.</P>
      <P>Developments in information and communications technologies show the potential to radically change the influence of location and distance-to-market on economic and social development. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that all the regions of Ireland enthusiastically grasp these new media.</P>
      <P>A major facilitator for growth will be the deal that the Minister signed with Global Crossing last summer. As a result of this deal, the international broadband capacity in and out of Ireland will be better than ever before. It firmly places Ireland on the world stage and companies locating here will be in a position to exploit the myriad of opportunities that the information age has to offer. That deal alone &ndash; and the project is on time &ndash; multiplies the capacity out of Ireland fifteenfold in the short term. The price of this connectivity is a fraction of the price available on the world market and the potential for growth of this project is immense as the deal also includes rights to potential capacity or &ldquo;dark fibre&rdquo;, the gold dust of the information age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland will have 300 gigabytes capacity by the end of this year compared with a total bandwidth capacity in the EU of 1,300 gigabytes. By 2001, predictions are that Ireland will have 1,000 giga<Col N="1118" /> bytes international capacity compared to 5,000 for all of the EU.</P>
    <P>Building on the initiative with the Global Crossing international connectivity project, the Minister has developed plans to roll this connectivity out to the regions in Ireland. An allocation of up to £150 million national Exchequer and European European Regional Development Fund funding has been made under the national development plan for communications and e-commerce measures to grant assist investments in less developed areas of the country. This public funding should exert leverage of the order of £500 million total investment. This puts the total investment in broadband infrastructure as a result of these initiatives at well over £700 million.This new investment taken together with my previous initiatives will go a long way to ensuring Ireland is placed in the centre of the international e-commerce map. International commentators and researchers have already dubbed Ireland one of &ldquo;the broadband four&rdquo;. We must ensure we build on our success and continue with the strategies we have been successfully pursuing.</P>
    <P>The Minister will certainly not preside over a programme which excludes any sector of society. Her initiatives to date may have had a business focus but we have to start somewhere. She has insisted that each of the 13 different projects supported last year, including one in the Deputy's own city, had a strong regional bias and a high public service element. Under the recently published national development plan, she will insist that the projects funded reach beyond the main trunk networks to peripheral and less developed regions and ultimately to more isolated communities. The Vsat call, in which up to £1 million will be available for satellite broadband services in the regions, is going out tomorrow and that again is about bringing bandwidth to outlying areas.</P>
    <P>To date, towns like Ballina, Kilkenny, Carrick-on-Shannon, Drumsna, Roscahil, Oughterard, Spiddal, Askeaton, Doonbeg, Castlelyons, Doneraile, Fermoy, Bunbeg, Burtonport, Dunkineeley, Dundalk, Thurles, Carlow and Clonmel have benefited from the broadband fibre optic programme.</P>

      <P>The Internet revolution and the emerging knowledge economy demand new ways of thinking, working, interacting and commuting. The information society and investment in the proper infrastructure can release much needed resources.</P>
      <P>As a nation our people are our most important resource. They and their skills have led to the economic success story of the past decade. Ensuring all our people have the requisite tools and access to the infrastructure required for the information age is one of the most important objectives for our country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair and the Minister for taking this important motion, namely, the need for the for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the current position on facilities for people with chronic pain and the plans for improving these facilities. I raise this matter because I have received a number of representations from constituents who, sadly, are constant sufferers from chronic pain syndrome. These people are gravely concerned that the future is very bleak because they see little in the way of facilities or personnel to help them overcome the terrible situation in which they find themselves.</P>
      <P>I understand that a person with spinal damage could be waiting an inordinate length of time for treatment due to lack of facilities. I know the Minister's attitude towards developing the Department of Health and Children is very positive and that waiting lists are a priority for him. However, the figures I have encountered are not acceptable given that a person in chronic pain suffers for 24 hours every day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. I unearthed a number of worldwide statistics in relation to chronic pain. They show that 10% of the world's population suffers from chronic pain and that 1% are severely disabled, with 22% of the total figure being over 65 years of age. To alleviate the pain many sufferers turn to drugs. Sadly, due to the extent of pain and the reliance on drugs, as many as 60% become addicted. Such sufferers, if out of work for one year, have little chance of ever returning to the workforce.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to investigate the problem and provide proper facilities and personnel to deal with this frightening problem. In many cases chronic pain is the result of failed spinal operations or is suffered by cancer patients or people who have had strokes. In many cases the patient can become suicidal. I am sure some hospital within the remit of the Eastern Regional Health Authority could be designated as a centre for such cases and that it could have the proper trained personnel to deal with the unfortunate victims. I am sure that proper pain management services could be put in place and I ask the Minister, with the assistance of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, to make every effort to achieve this. I again thank the Minister for his attendance and I look forward to a positive reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Wall for raising this issue. I have great sympathy for those who suffer from chronic pain and appreciate that it can affect all aspects of one's life. Patients suffering from chronic pain can be referred for treatment by medical staff with specialist knowledge and expertise. Pain medicine is a sub-specialty which has evolved in this country over the past two decades. In terms of development it has followed a similar pattern to other European countries and North America. <Col N="1120" /> Traditionally within Ireland and the UK it has evolved from within hospital divisions of anaesthesia and is a consultant led service.</P>
      <P>International studies suggest that one in seven adults will be partially or permanently disabled due to pain. Back pain accounts for a substantial portion of this figure. In the USA it has been estimated that billions of dollars are lost in terms of wages and medical expenses incurred each year due to persons suffering from chronic pain. It is evident, therefore, that the condition constitutes a significant medical and socio-economic problem.</P>
      <P>Patients requiring treatment for chronic pain can be seen in a number of different settings. The majority of patients are treated on an out-patient basis at our major acute hospitals and return home after treatment. Where required, patients are also treated on a day care or in-patient basis under a more intensive and structured treatment programme. I understand that departments of pain medicine have been established to varying levels across the acute hospital sector. Funding is allocated on an annual basis to anaesthetic services by health agencies from within their respective financial determinations. I am aware that specific funding has been allocated for the provision of a range of specialised new treatment devices, for example, spinal cord stimulators.</P>
      <P>There is an increasing level of demand, nationally and regionally, for this service. For example, within the eastern region approximately 7,000 patients received hospital treatment for chronic pain during 1999. At St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, approximately 140 new patients are received each year by the pain management service. I am also aware that although not designated or established as a national centre for pain management, the service provided at St. Vincent's Hospital receives a significant number of referrals from outside the hospital catchment area. At the Mater Hospital, the department of pain medicine has been in existence for 13 years and has evolved into a significant service delivered from within the division of anaesthesia. In excess of 600 day case procedures were performed last year together with approximately 1,500 out-patient referral cases. A full assessment with multi-disciplinary input takes place before treatment interventions are carried out. This can involve the neurology, radiology and psychiatry services where appropriate.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the provision of services for people suffering from chronic pain is a matter in the first instance for each relevant health agency. Decisions on the development of the service need to have regard to overall service priorities and must also be seen in the context of the general development of anaesthetic services within each catchment area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pain medicine has evolved in Ireland over the past 20 years. The need for adequately trained health care providers and pain management facilities is fundamental to the future provision of a comprehensive chronic pain service. From an <Col N="1121" /> educational and training perspective, I understand that consideration is being given to the setting up within the next year of a formal examination in pain medicine which will result in the awarding of a diploma in pain medicine to successful participants. The demand for the service continues to rise, resulting in increased demand for associated therapeutic and diagnostic services. In this regard, the service should develop on a regional basis and be accessible locally to patients who require treatment.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>The Garda inquiry into the shooting dead of John Carthy at Abbeylara, County Longford, on Holy Thursday lacks credibility. It is not credible for an inquiry into the conduct of the Garda to be conducted by the Garda. The conduct of an inquiry by the chief superintendent into a Garda operation commanded by an assistant commissioner is simply not credible. The credibility of the inquiry has been well and truly undermined by the deliberate and systematic leaking of details of the inquiry to <i>The Star</i> four weeks ago, the<i> Sunday Independent </i>two weeks ago and RTE this morning. There is only one credible course of action for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to adopt. He must immediately establish a public sworn inquiry to be conducted by a High Court or former judge. The report of the Garda Síochána to the Garda Commissioner and the report of the FBI should be part of that inquiry. The role of the inquiry must also be to establish who was responsible for the scandalous and systematic leaks and those found guilty, if within the Garda Síochána or public service, should be fired forthwith.</P>
      <P>The inquiry must establish the reason the request by John Carthy to speak with his solicitor, Mr. Michael Finucane, was neither acceded to nor conveyed to Mr. Finucane. John Carthy had indicated that he would only come out if he was able to contact Mr. Finucane. He needed a solicitor because of an alleged beating in Granard Garda station in September 1998. Had Mr. Finucane been allowed access Mr. Carthy could well be alive today.</P>
      <P>Had Marie Carthy's request to speak with her brother been acceded to, for example, Mr. Carthy may well be alive today. She did not want to enter the house. She wanted to speak to him on the megaphone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inquiry must establish why John Carthy's request for cigarettes was not agreed to. To deny a highly emotionally disturbed heavy smoker a packet of cigarettes in a siege is unpardonable. To maintain Garda safety was a factor is not credible. Gardaí had no problem climbing on to the <Col N="1122" /> roof of the house to sever the television cable. Had Mr. Carthy been given the cigarettes he could well be alive today.</P>
    <P>The purpose of a submachine gun or an automatic action shotgun is to eliminate the target. The inquiry must establish the reason automatic action shotguns and submachine guns rather than sniper rifles were used. Had the latter been used John Carthy could well be alive today.</P>
    <P>The inquiry must establish the reason stun guns or rubber bullets were not available to the Garda Síochána for this type of relatively low key siege. Had they been available John Carthy could well be alive today.</P>
    <P>The inquiry must establish the reason such a so-called highly trained elite group of marksmen were not able to maim or incapacitate the deceased instead of killing him. It must also establish why the deceased was shot twice in the back. The leaked reports all contend that on emerging from the house John Carthy threatened uniformed gardaí with his shotgun. One must ask and establish why uniformed unarmed gardaí were even in the vicinity of, let alone in close proximity to Mr. Carthy when he exited from the house. The inquiry must establish if the officer who was supposed to be in charge was actually present when the deceased emerged from the house, when gardaí opened fire or who exactly gave the order to open fire.</P>
    <P>The public has arrived at its own conclusion, that is, that John Carthy need not have died. He was totally outnumbered, not holding any hostages, had deep emotional problems, was not an aggressive individual and did not have a previous conviction. The perception is that the whole affair was very badly managed. I share that perception. The already damaged reputation of the Garda Síochána in this instance has been further damaged by the calculated attempt to condition public opinion in advance of the official report coming into the public domain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Garda inquiry has now been completed and the report on the FBI inquiry will be available to the Garda Commissioner within the next few days I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will establish a public inquiry into this terrible tragedy, which is a source of much public concern. Many people want to be satisfied that the facts will be put into the public domain. The reports of the Garda Síochána and the FBI should be part of the inquiry which I hope the Minister will establish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to respond to the issues raised by Deputies Higgins and Belton concerning the death of Mr. John Carthy in Abbeylara, County Longford. I have made clear from the outset my view that the tragic death of Mr. Carthy resulting from the use of lethal force by the Garda Síochána raises serious questions which must be answered and <Col N="1123" /> serious issues which must be addressed. The use of firearms by what is still essentially an unarmed force is an exceptional occurrence and is strictly governed by Garda regulations. Their use by gardaí is always a serious matter and when, as in this case, it results in a fatality it is a matter which demands urgent and thorough investigation. The Garda authorities fully share this view.</P>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner appointed a chief superintendent to conduct a thorough investigation into the death of Mr. Carthy. The investigation of the chief superintendent has just been completed and I expect to receive the report from the Garda Commissioner tomorrow. In accordance with standard practice the investigation file will be submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions and, in this instance, will be submitted also to the coroner in Longford. I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that the separate report being prepared by FBI officers into the operational tactics employed in this case will be with the Garda Commissioner within the next week.</P>
      <P>It is deplorable that some details of the investigation would appear to have been leaked to the media. The leaking of this material is a very serious matter. It is damaging to public confidence in the process of investigating the death of Mr. Carthy and must be a source of considerable distress to the family and friends of Mr. Carthy. The Garda Commissioner shares my concern and has begun an investigation into the leak.</P>
      <P>While I deplore the premature and unauthorised release of details of the material in question, I have previously made clear my commitment to making public the findings of the investigation at the earliest opportunity. It is important that the process of investigating the death of Mr. Carthy should be open and subject to public scrutiny, to the greatest extent possible. In this context, making public the findings of the investigation would enhance public confidence in the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Carthy.</P>
      <P>There have been calls &ndash; repeated tonight &ndash; for a public inquiry into what happened in Abbeylara but I took the view that it would be premature in the absence of more complete knowledge of all the circumstances to conclude that there were grounds for such an inquiry. I have always believed that we should first examine the facts established by the Garda investigation before we form conclusions as to further action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies on all sides will agree that the first step, given that we are dealing with a situation <Col N="1124" /> where a man was shot dead, is to allow the Director of Public Prosecutions the time he needs to examine the full investigation file in accordance with normal practice. It would be wrong to open the details of this to public debate before the Director of Public Prosecutions has had an opportunity of examining the papers.</P>
    <P>As soon as I receive the report I will consider its findings with an open mind as to what further action may be needed. In doing so I will be mindful of the statutory obligations of the Director of Public Prosecutions and also of the coroner. I will contact the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to arrange for the consideration by the committee of the findings at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>The investigation into Mr. Carthy's death has now been completed and the investigation file will be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I repeat my commitment to make public the findings of the investigation as soon as it is possible and proper to do so. I will be in contact with the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights in that respect.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to express once again my deepest sympathy to the family of Mr. Carthy, to assure them that the findings of the investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death and the FBI report, which is still awaited, will be considered openly and with scrupulous care, and to assure them that any lessons that can be learned from this tragic event will be learned. I acknowledge the restraint, patience and understanding which local Deputies Reynolds and Belton have shown throughout.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins has today been transferred to a new portfolio within the Fine Gael front bench. I thank him for his contribution to the Justice, Equality and Women's Rights area over the past three years. He was obliged to make detailed submissions in relation to no less than 33 Bills emanating from my Department, which have now been enacted.

      <P>In accordance with waste legislation and policy, the construction industry bears the primary responsibility for the environmentally sound management of construction and demolition waste. In the first instance, as an alternative to the imposition of statutory controls and obligations, the Government's preferred approach is to afford a relevant business sector an opportunity to formulate and implement proposals for an appropriate voluntary producer responsibility initiative. This approach is intended to facilitate the business sector concerned, by enabling it to bring its expertise to bear to devise workable and least-cost arrangements that are sensitive to both environmental and commercial requirements. In the absence of a satisfactory business-led initiative, it would then be open to me, as Minister, to introduce mandatory producer responsibility obligations under the 1996 Act, or other alternative measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1998, my Department formally invited the construction industry to develop pro<Col N="1126" /> posals for a producer responsibility initiative aimed at meeting the recovery targets for construction and demolition waste that are specified in the policy statement Changing our Ways.</P>
    <P>Following discussions with the main representative organisations in the industry, the broadly based Forum for the Construction Industry in September 1999 established a high level task force within its existing structures to co-ordinate the development and implementation of a voluntary construction industry programme to meet the Government's objectives. The membership of the task force includes senior representatives of the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation and the Building Materials Federation, together with appropriate representation from public and private sector clients, design professionals, my Department, local authorities, FÁS and the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>

      <P>A ground water quality monitoring programme is undertaken by the Environmental Protection Agency, in collaboration with local authorities and with the co-operation of the Geological Survey of Ireland. The EPA millennium report confirms that there is no widespread contamination of particular aquifers and that most samples reflected unpolluted conditions. It indicates intermittent or localised pollution in an appreciable number of instances by the presence of coliforms or, in some cases, elevated levels of nitrates. Appropriate measures are being taken to address these instances of pollution.</P>
      <P>Guidelines prepared jointly by the GSI, the EPA and my Department on the preparation of ground water protection schemes were issued to local authorities in May 1999. Schemes have been prepared by the local authorities, in consultation with the GSI, in relation to five counties and a further eight schemes are in preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comprehensive statutory provision for the protection of ground water is contained in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990, the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and related legislation. Additional measures are put in place as required. I made the Protection of Groundwater Regulations, 1999 (S.I. No. 41 of 1999) in February 1999 in relation to discharges to aquifers by local authorities. I made further regulations this month to strengthen the statutory basis for improvement of drinking water supplies, particularly private group water schemes, many of which are sourced from ground water. Proposals are also being developed in my <Col N="1127" /> Department for additional measures to be taken for the protection of ground water against pollution by nitrates, including the designation of nitrate vulnerable zones in accordance with EU Directive 91/676/EC.</P>
    <P>My Department's rural water programme comprises of a range of targeted initiatives to improve the quality and efficiency of rural water supply systems and includes a specific measure to monitor the quality of ground water and surface water sources nationally in order to determine the causes of pollution and to implement effective surface and ground water source protection measures.</P>
    <P>Since 1997, my Department has been pursuing a comprehensive, integrated catchment-based strategy to tackle pollution of inland surface waters. My Department is now actively extending this strategy by promoting the establishment by local authorities, in the short to medium term, of projects to address all sources of pollution in all inland and coastal waters, including groundwaters. In December 1999 local authorities were advised that financial assistance at a rate of up to 85% would be available to support expenditure to develop such projects.</P>

      <P>My Department initiated discussions with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry in late 1997 with a view to the development by the industry of a producer responsibility initiative in relation to end-of-life vehicles, ELVs. It is intended that such an initiative would, in particular, take account of a draft EU Parliament and Council directive on end-of-life vehicles. This draft directive incorporates a number of significant proposals, including measures aimed at ensuring that relevant economic operators establish collection systems for all ELVs; ensuring all ELVs collected are dismantled and recovered in a manner which does not cause environmental pollution; preventing waste from vehicles; increasing the recovery and recycling rates of ELVs and their components and minimising the use of hazardous materials-substances in vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initial proposals for an ELV management system for Ireland were submitted by SIMI in December 1999, and were circulated for consultation to various Departments and State agencies, and a number of representative associations and other bodies. On foot of the various submissions received, my Department will very shortly respond formally to the SIMI proposals. Early <Col N="1128" /> discussions will be sought with the society and other concerned parties to progress the development of a cohesive and practicable industry-led scheme.</P>

      <P>On 2 May last, I launched a major Government strategy on homelessness. The strategy is based on the report of the cross department team on homelessness which was established by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion to examine comprehensively the issue of homelessness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has issued copies of the strategy to all local authorities and is urging early implementation of the measures in the strategy. <Col N="1129" /> Local authorities have been asked to establish homeless fora, where they are not already in place, and to produce action plans, jointly with health boards and voluntary bodies, within three months and by the end of August at the latest. These action plans will detail how accommodation, health, settlement and welfare services will be provided to homeless persons by all of the agencies involved in providing these services. I understand a number of consultative meetings are taking place at local level as a first step to establishing the homeless fora and drawing up the action plans.</P>
    <P>Substantial funding has also been made available to ensure that the measures in the strategy are implemented. Capital funding for local authority hostel accommodation will be doubled over the next five years from £20 million to £40 million. Additional current funding of £6 million per annum will be available from my Department to increase payments for the provision of hostel accommodation by voluntary bodies and local authorities and to establish settlement and outreach programmes. Additional funding of £6 million will also be available from the Department of Health and Children to fund the provision of in-house care in hostels providing accommodation for homeless persons.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 envisages significant private sector investment in national road <Col N="1130" /> development &ndash; some £1 billion of the £4.4 billion provided for national roads improvements in the national development plan is to be contributed by PPP financing. Apart from the three pilot projects already identified in the plan, the NRA recently announced a further eight PPP schemes for the national road network. These new schemes, together with the pilot projects will require estimated investment of more than £1,000 million, with a potential private finance input of some £700 million, based on user tolls.</P>
      <P>The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll by-laws, and to enter into toll agreements with private investors is vested in the National Roads Authority under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993. Road authorities have similar powers in relation to the tolling of non-national roads. The exercise of these powers has been subject to the approval of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>Under the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, it is proposed to remove this requirement of ministerial approval of toll schemes, by-laws and agreements. In accordance with the revised Part V of the Roads Act, 1993, these matters will be brought fully within the discretion of the National Roads Authority or the relevant local road authority, in the case of national and non-national roads respectively.</P>
      <P>In parallel, the Roads Act, 1993, is also being amended so as to provide for the issue of policy directives to the National Roads Authority or local authorities by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government regarding the exercise of their road tolling functions, with which they will be obliged to comply. Any such policy directives would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1998 policy statement, Changing our Ways, recommended that local authorities identify and assess a range of waste treatment technologies, with a view to the development of an integrated waste management infrastructure appropriate to their particular circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thermal treatment of waste, carried on in accordance with high environmental standards, is regarded as environmentally preferable to the disposal of waste by landfill, and plays a major part in municipal waste management in many EU countries, and further afield. Accordingly, Changing our Ways proposed that, where technically <Col N="1131" /> and economically feasible, and subject to appropriate attention to materials recycling, incineration with energy recovery or other advanced thermal processes are among the treatment options which should be considered in an integrated waste management strategy. That remains the case.</P>
    <P>The United States Environmental Protection Agency, USEPA, has, since 1991, been engaged in a comprehensive reassessment of dioxin science, which it hopes to complete this year. Earlier this month, the USEPA published two chapters of its proposed report for the purpose of scientific peer review. In so doing, it cautioned that the material concerned should not be cited as the agency's final assessment of dioxin risks, and stated that the question of using the outcome of the reassessment for regulatory purposes does not arise until the review procedure is completed.</P>
    <P>The USEPA now characterises the most toxic dioxin compound as a human carcinogen, and proposes to re-evaluate upwards its own 1994 assessment of cancer risk attributable to dioxins. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, an agency of the World Health Organisation, has since 1997 classed the relevant dioxin compound as a known human carcinogen. WHO guidelines for tolerable daily intake of and recommendations for dioxins, from 1998, take this classification into account.</P>
    <P>The USEPA considers its draft findings are supportive of the WHO position.</P>
    <P>Clearly, because of the potential toxic effects of exposure to dioxins, their emission must, where possible, be strictly controlled and minimised to ensure that exposure does not exceed relevant guidelines and standards. In licensing incineration facilities in Ireland, the EPA already applies a flue gas emission limit value for dioxins of 0.1 nanograms, that is one ten thousand millionth of a gram, per cubic metre of gas emitted. This extremely stringent standard will shortly be adopted by the EU generally, under the proposed Council directive on the incineration of waste. By comparison, dioxin emission standards issued by the USEPA last year, which will only apply to US hazardous waste incinerators from 2002, are between two and four times higher.</P>
    <P>The European Commission estimates that the implementation of this directive will result in a 99% reduction in emissions of dioxins from waste incineration, relative to 1993/1995, and anticipates that the contribution of municipal and clinical waste incineration to overall emissions of dioxins in Europe would be reduced to 0.3%, assuming the output of other sources remains unchanged.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am advised that emissions from proposed new thermal treatment facilities, employing modern technologies and subject to compliance with strict environmental standards, should not have any appreciable environmental impact or contribute significantly to background levels of dioxins locally or nationally.</P>

      <P>The recently published report by the European Commission on bathing water quality in 1999 indicates significant improvements compared to 1998. Some 98.3% of our bathing sites complied with the mandatory values laid down in the bathing water directive, with 100% compliance in respect of our inland sites. The report also confirms that, generally, Irish beaches and lakes are amongst the cleanest in Europe.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the blue flag scheme is that other criteria, in addition to water quality, are used for award purposes. These include such matters as the presence of public information notices, environmental education activities, ease of access, provision of litter bins, first aid and public toilet facilities.</P>
      <P>Eleven beaches lost their blue flag status in 2000, while the net decrease in the number of flags awarded was six. Most, seven, were lost either through authorities not meeting the criteria for beach management or other factors such as non point source pollution caused by adverse weather conditions. I have no function in relation to the awarding of blue flags or the determination of the criteria for their award. The scheme is operated by the Foundation for Environmental Education in Europe, and administered in Ireland by An Taisce.</P>
      <P>As regards investment in water and sewerage services, the national development plan contains provision for expenditure on water services amounting to £2.9 billion in the period 2000 to 2006. This represents an almost threefold increase in capital spending by comparison to the 1994 &ndash; 1999 outturn. Over £1.1 billion of this figure will be allocated to wastewater measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advancement of proposals for individual waste water treatment plants in tourist and other areas is a matter for the local authorities themselves in the first instance. In this context, to assist with the preparation of the national development plan, local authorities were required to prepare assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to identify their requirements on a priority basis. The assessments are being used to develop an overall strategic plan which will take the form of a medium to long-term work programme to meet the country's national water and sewerage infrastructural requirements. The assessments are the main foundation for the three year investment programme in water services for the years 2000-02 which I intend to announce <Col N="1133" /> shortly and which will reflect the priorities the local authorities themselves have adopted.</P>

      <P>The national average waiting time for a driving test is 21 weeks, a reduction of 13 weeks relative to early 1999. The longest, as distinct from average, waiting time obtaining at any test centre is at Finglas-Raheny, which has a longest waiting period of 46 weeks. However, applicants who require a test for urgent reasons are being given earlier appointments; about 38% of applicants are tested within 15 weeks.</P>
      <P>Applications for driving tests are now running at record levels, driven by exceptional conditions of economic growth. Applications this year are expected to be at least 10% higher than in 1999 which saw a record 154,000 test applications made to my Department, compared to 118,000 applications in 1997. Very significant additional resources have already been allocated to the driver testing service, which now numbers 99 testers compared to 66 in 1998. Together with recent productivity agreements and Saturday working, this has increased the testing capacity of the service by over 90,000 tests to about 200,000 tests annually. Two new test centres have been provided in Tallaght and Raheny. Retired testers are now being employed and additional testers recruited to cope with the increased demand.

      <P>Substantial progress has been made on the mandate given by the Government to my Department to prepare a national spatial strategy which will translate the overall approach to regional development contained in the national development plan into a more detailed framework for spatial development in Ireland over the next 20 years.</P>
      <P>On foot of that mandate, my Department established a spatial planning unit to manage the preparation of the strategy. An interdepartmental steering committee, with representation from all relevant Departments, established to oversee the development of the strategy at policy level, has met on a number of occasions. The interdepartmental committee is supported by a technical working group and subgroups to facilitate a co-ordinated input to the preparation of the strategy from Departments, State agencies, regional assemblies and all other bodies whose policies, functions or operations are relevant to the achieving the objective of more balanced regional development.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have established an expert advisory group which Mr. Kieran McGowan, former head of the IDA, has agreed to chair. This group provides a vehicle for my Department to call on the expertise and experience of leading national and international figures in the area of spatial development and planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national spatial strategy will be prepared in four stages. During the first stage of the process, which is now complete, extensive efforts were made to reach a degree of consensus on the scope, structure and approach to the preparation of the national spatial strategy. To facilitate this part of the process, a discussion document, The National Spatial Strategy &ndash; What are the Issues? was published by my Department and disseminated widely. This document provoked a substantial response from a wide range of national and local groups and from individual members of the public. Taking account of these submissions and inputs from various Departments and State agencies a report entitled, The National Spatial Strategy &ndash; Scope and Delivery, was published last month. This report sets out the background to the strategy, identifies its objectives and the challenges it faces to achieves those objectives, gives details of the work to be carried out during each stage of the process of preparing the strategy, sets out the organisational structures which have been put in place and the arrangements which have been made for the participation of relevant interests and the public generally in the process. <Col N="1136" /> A copy of this report has been circulated to all Members of the House.</P>
    <P>Stage two of the process of preparing the strategy will require extensive research, to be completed by next October, into the spatial structure and functioning of Ireland under a number of different headings. External consultants will assist with a number of these research projects. This research will include in-depth analysis into such areas as population and labour force projections and future housing demand broken down on a regionalised basis, the future role of Dublin in Ireland and Europe, urban and rural functioning, enterprise development, quality of life issues, transport infrastructure, energy, educational access, environmental protection and availability of services.</P>
    <P>The research and analysis phase of preparing the strategy will be followed by the preparation of policy option papers which will be the subject of a further broad-based consultative process to conclude by April of next year. The final stage during the latter half of next year will see the drawing together and reconciliation of the emerging strands of policy and drafting of the strategy itself with a view to its adoption by the Government and publication by the end of 2001.</P>

      <P>In February 1999, I made regulations which designated the EPA as the responsible body for ambient air quality assessment and management as required by EU Directive 96/62/EC. The agency is required to carry out a preliminary assessment of national air quality as the first step in planning any measures necessary to maintain and improve ambient air quality and to meet the requirements of future air quality directives. I understand the assessment is due for completion this year. The EPA is also preparing a national air quality monitoring programme to meet monitoring requirements for the next ten years, due for publication later this year.</P>

      <P>My Department's latest house price data for the March quarter 2000 reveal that new house prices rose by just 1.6% nationally on the December 1999 quarter average, while second-hand house prices were down 0.3% over the same period. The March quarter figures for Dublin are showing reductions of 1.1% and 2.7% in the average prices for both new and second-hand homes respectively.</P>
      <P>Year-on-year house price increases &ndash; March 2000 compared with March 1999 prices &ndash; are also lower than in previous quarters. Nationally, new and second-hand house prices rose by 13% and 14% on the same period last year, the lowest increases since 1996. In Dublin, annual increases of 13% and 17% have been recorded, both significantly down on 12 month increases to December 1999, of the order of 22%. Typical first-time buyer prices are generally around 25% to 30% below the overall average house price, with new houses averaging £99,600 nationally and £126,400 in Dublin in 1999, while second-hand prices were £102,700 and £130,000, respectively.</P>
      <P>Output in Dublin city and county last year has been particularly encouraging, exceeding 10,000 new housing units for the first time ever.</P>
      <P>The Government has introduced a wide range of measures, most recently in its policy document, Action on Housing, to increase the supply of serviced land and housing generally through fast tracking of developments and targeted investment in key infrastructural projects, discourage speculative property investment and strengthen the position of first-time purchasers, increase the supply of social and affordable housing to meet rising housing needs, and improve the institutional arrangements to facilitate the delivery of housing related infrastructure and thereby increase overall housing supply.</P>
      <P>Measures to significantly increase affordability especially for first-time buyers include measures to increase significantly the overall supply of houses; revised stamp duty thresholds and rates to ease the burden on first-time purchasers, improve their position in relation to existing owner occupiers and investors, measures to discourage speculative demand, especially at the lower end of the market, and significant improvements to the eligibility criteria under the shared ownership and the affordable housing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A co-ordinating housing supply unit has been established in my Department to ensure urgent and effective delivery of supply measures, to address any infrastructural bottlenecks, and to liaise with the Dublin local authorities' strategic <Col N="1139" /> response team established by the Dublin city and county managers.</P>
    <P>The Government is committing substantial additional resources to housing and housing-related infrastructural development, over and above that which has been committed in the national development plan and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.

      <P>The question of the taking in charge of estates is essentially a matter for each individual local authority and my Department does not systematically collect such information. However, the Department did carry out an informal survey of local authorities in 1998 on the extent of the problems with unfinished estates and the factors contributing to such problems. Replies received from 77 of the 88 planning authorities revealed that 706 housing estates were then regarded as unfinished, which, along with a further 542 finished estates, had not been taken in charge. The size of the estates in question varied from two to 200 houses. My Department does not have available any estimate as to the potential cost to local authorities of taking all these estates in charge.</P>
      <P>New requirements on planning authorities concerning the taking in charge of unfinished estates are provided in the Planning and Development Bill, 1999. The Bill provides that where an estate has been completed to the satisfaction of a local authority, the authority must take an estate in charge when the developer or a majority of the residents request that the authority do so. Where an estate is unfinished, the seven year period for taking enforcement action has expired, and a majority of the residents so request, the planning authority will also be obliged to take the estate in charge.</P>

      <P>Information on the level of rent increases is not directly available to my Department. However, in his recent report on the housing market in Ireland, Dr. Peter Bacon concluded that the rise in rents was generally in line with the rise in house prices, with a moderation in the rate of increase in recent months compared with the increases experienced in 1998. Realistically, the housing demand level has created pressure on both prices and rent and, as I have said many times, the only long-term solution to this problem is to balance supply and demand. In this regard, the Government in its policy document Action on Housing recently announced a range of measures which are being taken to address housing requirements, including the maximisation of housing supply, curbing short-term speculative demand assisting first time purchasers and increased capacity in the construction sector. These measures will help us achieve a balance between supply and demand in the housing market and will have a consequential impact on both house prices and rents.</P>
      <P>In addition to the recently announced measures, the Government has also taken a number of other relevant actions in recent years. These include the integrated area plans, section 23 tax provisions, urban renewal schemes and incentives for the provision of student accommodation. In the area of tax relief in respect of rent, this Government increased the ceiling for persons renting who were under 55 years of age by 50% and doubled the ceiling in respect for those over 55 years of age.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that last July I established the commission on the private rented sector. The commission is examining the working of the landlord and tenant relationship in respect of the private rented sector and is mandated to make such recommendations, including changes to the law, as it considers proper, equitable and feasible with a view to, among other things, increasing investment in and the supply of residential accommodation for renting. Naturally, the aim is that any measures implemented as a result of the commission's recommendations will have a positive outcome for the sector and will contribute to achieving a thriving, more diverse and well managed private rented sector. The commission is due to report to me shortly and I will promptly and positively examine any recommendations made.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>In April 1999, I published draft retail planning guidelines for public consultation. The draft guidelines and a more detailed study on retail development in Ireland were prepared by the consultants referred to by the Deputy. The draft guidelines recommended that, pending the preparation and adoption of development plan policies by local authorities, the floorspace cap of 3,000 square metres, which was introduced on supermarket development, should be retained in the rest of the State outside Dublin. Within the greater Dublin area, it recommended that the floorspace cap be increased to 3,500 square metres. The draft guidelines recommended that a floorspace cap of 6,000 square metres should apply to retail warehouses, i.e. large stores specialising in the sale of household goods such as carpets, furniture and bulky DIY items.</P>
      <P>When publishing the draft guidelines, the carrying out of a further study of the economic effect of the implementation of the guidelines was announced. I expect very shortly to receive the completed report from the consultants on the likely impact of the implementation of the draft retail planning guidelines on competition within the Irish retail sector, the supply of products to consumers at lower prices, consumer choice and the supplier base. This report has been jointly commissioned by my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The report will be published and the results of this study will be considered along with the submissions received on the draft guidelines before I publish the guidelines in final form.</P>

      <P>The national development plan includes an amount of £4.7 billion for the improvement and maintenance of the national road network in the period 2000 to 2006. This is a threefold increase in the level of investment in national roads provided for in 1994-9. This funding will ensure development by 2006 of the major inter-urban routes to motorway/high quality dual carriageway standard; further major improvements on other national primary routes; and improvement of national secondary roads, with emphasis on routes which are of particular importance to economic and regional development, including links to the strategic corridors, roads serving key ports, airports, tourists areas, industry and multi-purpose roads.</P>
      <P>Details of this national roads strategy are set out in the NDP and will be further elaborated on in the operational programme for economic and social infrastructure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities have extensive powers to acquire land compulsorily, as well as by agreement, for the purposes of any of their functions. The compensation to be paid is based on the rules set out in the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, as amended by the 1963 Planning Act. The value set on the land is essentially market value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that local authorities should acquire agricultural land for housing at agricultural value in order to address the current housing supply problem, the present situation is that where local authorities believe that they can assist the housing supply issue by acquir<Col N="1144" /> ing land, then they should avail of all their powers to do so. However, if the land is intended to increase supply in the short term, it should be serviced or easily serviceable and should fit in the authority's policies in the development plan on the location of new housing.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, which last week passed all Stages in the Oireachtas, is designed to ensure that there will be no shortage of building land by providing that sufficient land is zoned to meet the housing needs of the area and making up to 20% of residential zoned land available to local authorities at existing use value for the purposes of social and affordable housing. The specific amount required to be reserved will depend on the needs identified in the housing strategy which local authorities will now be required to make.</P>
    <P>This Part was drafted following extensive legal consultation including advice of senior counsel and I am satisfied that this approach will make land available to local authorities at low cost while not interfering unfairly or in an arbitrary manner with the property rights of the land owner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Initiative strategy, which was published in 1995 with a planning horizon to 2011, provides the framework for a wide range of initiatives to respond to Dublin's transportation needs. These include major infrastructure projects such as Luas, the Dublin Port tunnel and completion of the Dublin C-Ring; other improvements in public transport such as quality bus corridors; and traffic and parking management measures.</P>
      <P>Progress with the construction and planning of these infrastructure projects is indicated in current work being undertaken on the southern cross and northern motorways, and ministerial approvals to the Tallaght to Abbey Street and Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green links of the Luas, the Dublin Port tunnel and the south eastern motorway.</P>
      <P>By end-1999, an estimated £500 million had been invested in Dublin transport management and infrastructure within the DTI framework. Under the national development plan, more than £3 billion is provided to continue DTI related funding through the period 2000-06.</P>
      <P>Good progress is being made with implementation of the Dublin Transportation Office short-term action plan which is designed to advance and accelerate a set of measures, consistent with the DTI strategy, which can be completed in the period to end 2000. For example, all 150 of the planned new buses have been delivered; work is proceeding on the planning, design and implementation of the quality bus corridor network with three QBCs now in operation; the programme of platform lengthening is well under way; delivery of the additional DART rolling stock and railcars has commenced; and the upgrading of the Maynooth to Clonsilla rail line is due for completion by end 2000.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Office of Director of Traffic, Dublin Corporation, has been established to bring greater concentration and efficiency to traffic administration within the city and has already achieved significant improvements in parking enforcement and traffic engineering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the longer term, the DTO are now finalising an update to the original DTI strategy, taking account of the strategic planning guidelines published in 1999 and of a planning horizon to 2016. The update will also include an examination of the various demand management options avail<Col N="1146" /> able with a view to ensuring that the greatly enhanced public transport facilities which will be provided, will be utilised to the greatest extent possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 181 of 2000) on 22 June 2000. The new regulations increase, subject to certain conditions, the size of extensions to the rear of houses which are exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission, from 23 square metres to 40 square metres, where the house has not been extended previously. The new regulations have immediate effect. The purpose of this regulation is to relieve pressure on the planning system by reducing the number of planning applications for extensions, while ensuring that by reason of its effect on its surroundings, such development would not be contrary to the proper planning and sustainable development of the area.</P>
      <P>My Department's circular letter to planning authorities advising them of the new regulations also asked planning authorities to review the efficiency of their current operations. Planning authorities have been asked to examine the scope for efficiency gains through the use of standardised reports and conditions. The circular letter also advised planning authorities to adopt a more structured approach to pre-planning discussions, including planning authorities assigning experienced personnel to pre-planning discussions to ensure the best advice is given to applicants early on.</P>
      <P>My Department will also promote more widespread use of UK-EU consultants for forward planning, emphasising expertise in high density design. Consideration will also be given to the use of suitable private sector planning consultants to carry out development control on a fee per case basis.</P>
      <P>My Department is in contact with the Department of Education and Science and the third level education sector on ways of producing more planners through the education system, including the current planning courses in University College Dublin and new courses under development by Dublin Institute of Technology, Bolton Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interim, to meet the short-term demand, I have already announced my intention for my Department to pursue the employment of planners from abroad on fixed term contracts. My Department will also pursue with the local auth<Col N="1147" /> orities and the Local Government Computer Services Board the use of information technology to streamline planning procedures.</P>

      <P>The integration of public transport with new housing development is central to securing sustainable high density development and maximising the return on available serviced land particularly in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>As part of the review of the DTI strategy and the DTO short to medium term action programmes which are currently under way, the DTO steering committee recently established a sub-committee to assess the transport projects and services necessary to facilitate key new housing developments proposed for Dublin city and county over the next six years. This sub-committee which comprises the Department of Public Enterprise and representatives from the Dublin local authorities as well as staff of the DTO have progressed their work in this area and made this available to my Department prior to the publication of Action on Housing.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the committee, which is now being extended to include public transport providers, will continue its work in order to ensure that the current review of the DTO's programmes fully takes account of new housing requirements and that all future actions in this regard are driven and co-ordinated.</P>

      <P>An estimated 380,000 provisional licences were current at end 1999.</P>
      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2000 acknowledged the importance of driver training and testing to road safety, with the qualification that these could not be expected to yield road safety benefits on the scale of the measures directly targeted at speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing which have been prioritised by the strategy. The strategy proposed, for the longer term, a significant reduction in the number of Irish drivers relying on a provisional licence.</P>
      <P>To attain this longer-term goal, the short-term priority is to restore waiting periods for driving tests to acceptable levels. A record 154,000 applications were dealt with in 1999. Very significant additional resources have been allocated to the driver testing service, which now numbers 99 testers compared to 66 in 1998. Together with productivity agreements and Saturday working, this has increased the testing capacity of the service by more than 90,000 tests to about 200,000 tests annually. To deal with a 10% projected increase in applications in 2000, retired testers are now also being employed and additional testers recruited. Significantly greater numbers of tests will be conducted which should lead to a reduction in the number of drivers relying on a provisional licence.</P>
      <P>Measures have been in place for some years and will be maintained to restrict the long-term holding of provisional licences. In addition, the motor insurance advisory board is in the process of finalising recommendations for improving access to motor insurance for young people. The possibility of affording greater credit for the holding of a full driving licence may arise in this context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The results of the assessment of housing needs undertaken by local authorities at the end <Col N="1149" /> of March last year, indicated a total of 39,176 households in need of local authority housing. In addition, the housing needs of a further 6,400 households were considered by local authorities as being most suitably met by other measures, including voluntary housing, rent supplementation and other social housing schemes.</P>
      <P>The number of houses completed or acquired by local authorities during 1999 was approximately 3,700 which compares with 3,290 in 1998 and 3,217 in 1997. I expect that authorities will commence the construction of, or acquire, in excess of 5,500 houses this year and that the level of house completions, including acquisitions, will be in excess of 4,000 units. Figures in relation to the number of starts-completions for the first quarter of 2000 will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>The Government is giving a particularly high priority to the issue of housing. This is reflected in the national development plan and in the package of measures recently launched by the Government's document, Action on Housing, copies of which sent to all Deputies and which include,<i> inter alia</i>, increased targets for the provision of local authority housing over the period 2000-06 together with a range of other measures in relation to social housing provision. The local authority housing programme is, of course, only one of a range of ways in which the needs of households on local authority waiting lists may be met and I am confident that the enhanced multi-annual local authority housing programme together with increased output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing stock, will enable the housing needs of some 11,000 households to be met this year, compared with some 9,200 last year and that the increased social housing output over the coming four years will meet the needs of more than 50,000 households. The number of households on local authority waiting lists at the end of this year will depend both on the extent of social housing output and the number of additional households applying for accommodation. I am not, therefore, in a position to forecast the likely outturn at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>While my Department will continue to support local authorities to achieve their housing programmes in terms of providing the necessary capital funding and forward commitment for house starts it is a matter for each individual local authority to implement the programmes which they have put forward for commencement this year. I expect local authorities to afford a high priority to meeting the social housing needs of households on waiting lists and I am prepared to facilitate any further proposals which local authorities may put forward for the current year.</P>

      <P>The position on legal actions and complaints being investigated by the European Commission in regard to environmental matters in Ireland which fall within the remit of my Department is as follows:</P>
      <P>The European Commission has initiated court proceedings in respect of the failure to implement Directive 75/442/EEC, as amended, on waste, Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste, and Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste, with regard to the making of waste plans. Ireland lodged a defence on 30 March 2000 seeking a suspension of the proceedings for three months by which time it is expected all plans would have been adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 11 January 2000, the European Commission announced that it had decided to take <Col N="1152" /> Ireland to the European Court of Justice for non-respect of certain aspects of Directive 80/778/EEC on the quality of water intended for human consumption. While my Department has not been formally advised of the terms of the court action, it is understood that the commission is concerned at the relatively high level of microbiological contamination of private group water supplies. It is also concerned that Irish legislation does not provide sufficient legal basis for addressing quality problems in such supplies.</P>
    <P>The Commission has been informed of a package of measures being introduced to tackle the water quality problems confronting the group water sector, including a record £420 million investment to improve rural water infrastructure over the period of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and a major revamp of the grant and subsidy schemes which support the group water sector.</P>
    <P>The Commission was recently notified of new drinking water regulations made on 20 June 2000, which amend previous regulations and require full compliance with statutory drinking water standards within a specified period.</P>
    <P>Proceedings by way of reasoned opinion under Article 226 of the Treaty on European Union have been notified to Ireland by the Commission in relation to the following:</P>
    <P>Proceedings arise from non-submission of annual reports under Council Regulation 259/93 (EEC) &ndash; Shipment of Waste this Regulation which covers the supervision and control of shipments of waste, within, into and out of the European Community. The Commission is aware that the information required for the reports is complex and must be gathered from a number of sources. It is intended that completed reports will now be submitted by mid July 2000.</P>
    <P>Further proceedings refer to specific issues arising under Directive 76/464/EEC on the protection of water against pollution by dangerous substances. A reply has issued to the Commission. New regulations in respect of a number of these substances are near finalisation in my Department.</P>

      <P>According to the assessment of local authority housing needs undertaken in March 1999 the assessed need for local authority housing in the Cork local authorities is as set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>The Government is giving a particularly high priority to the issue of housing. This is reflected in the national development plan and in the package of measures recently launched by the Government's programme &ndash; Action on Housing &ndash; copies of which were sent to all Deputies and which included, <i>inter alia</i>, increased targets for the provision of local authority housing over the period 2000-06 together with a range of other measures in relation to social housing provision. A total of 2,737 housing starts were approved last November for Cork city and county for the four years 2000-03. Local authorities will shortly be invited to seek an additional allocation from the 5,000 additional starts announced in &ldquo;Action on Housing&rdquo;.</P>

      <Col N="1154" /> In addition to the construction-acquisition of houses, the local authorities in Cork city and county will also be able to use vacancies arising in existing local authority housing and increased output under other social housing measures, particularly in the provision of voluntary housing, to meet the needs of households on the waiting lists.</P>

      <Quest>if, having regard to the lack of impact on the housing crisis of the Bacon (1) and Bacon (2) reports, he envisages major improvement in the housing situation with particular reference to the ability to meet demands in both public and the private sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since coming into office, the Government has implemented a wide range of measures to boost housing output, remove infrastructural and planning constraints on residential development and improve affordability for first-time buyers and lower income households. While the full impact of some of the measures will be realised in the medium term, there is clear evidence both from the most recent analysis of the housing situation and from the latest housing trends that the Government's actions over the last few years have made a significant impact in the face of strongly rising demand for housing.</P>
      <P>Housing output has risen by more than 20% since 1997, with over 46,500 houses built in 1999, and completions trends so far this year also point to further record output. Furthermore, my Department's latest house price data for the March Quarter 2000 reveal that new house prices rose by just 1.6% nationally on the December 1999 quarter average, while second-hand house prices were down 0.3% over the same period. The March quarter figures for Dublin are showing reductions of 1.1% and 2.7% in the average prices for both new and second-hand homes respectively. Year-on-year house price increases &ndash; March 2000 on March 1999 prices &ndash; are also significantly lower than in previous quarters and well below the peaks reached in 1998.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, I commissioned Peter Bacon and Associates to review developments in the housing market and to make recommendations for action required to bring supply more in line with demand and improve housing affordability, especially for first-time buyers. In conjunction with the consultancy study, my Department also reviewed the range of social and affordable housing programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following consideration of the consultants' findings and the review, the Government <Col N="1156" /> approved a comprehensive package of measures &ldquo;Action on Housing&rdquo; which was launched on 15 June and copies of which have been circulated to Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Government is committing substantial additional resources to housing and housing related infrastructural development, over and above that which has been committed in the national development plan and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. These further measures provide a comprehensive and coherent response to growing housing need.</P>

      <P>Fruit of the Loom informed its workforce and the unions on 28 October 1999 that the company would implement a number of measures to maintain its competitiveness in the marketplace.</P>
      <P>One of the measures involved implementing redundancies in the fabric, sewing and services departments at Buncrana. These redundancies 190 took place in January 2000 and are as a result of aligning the company's requirements with its order book. The redundancy terms were negotiated and agreed with SIPTU. Although the business will continue to react to challenges no further job losses are expected in 2000. Therefore it is expected that almost 1,000 jobs will be maintained at Buncrana this year. Current employment is 970. The company is still committed to maintaining a minimum of 600 jobs at Buncrana until 2006.</P>

      <P>An EMU business awareness campaign, has been managed by Forfás on behalf of my Department, since 1996. The primary aim of this campaign is to ensure business operations in Ireland are in possession of all the information necessary to fully prepare them for the introduction of the single currency the euro. The campaign has harnessed the support and co-operation of all the main business, trade and professional organisations together with the relevant State development agencies.</P>
      <P>To date a comprehensive range of publications has been produced and widely disseminated to the business community together with a number of media campaigns. These include: 60,000 copies of the campaign's information pack, which is a comprehensive guide for business on all the relevant issues; 143,000 copies of a short, user-friendly brochure summarising the key issues for SMEs in relation to EMU and the changeover to the euro; 28,000 copies of a guide to facilitate those involved in cross border trade, 94,000 copies of an initial guide for retailers Is Your Retail Business Ready for the euro? 45,000 copies of comprehensive guidelines on the IT issues that need to be considered by companies regarding the changeover to the euro; and a regular newsletter, EuroChange, of which 12 issues have been produced todate, with over 25,000 copies of each issue distributed.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the information and supports which Irish businesses require to make the necessary preparations is widely available through the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign and other business sources. I must emphasise, however, that the final responsibility for preparing for EMU and the changeover to the euro ultimately rests with each individual business firm.</P>

      <P>While it is generally accepted that work-sharing offers a number of advantages for society and the economy through job creation, greater workplace flexibility and more equitable distribution of work, I do not have any immediate plans to introduce legislation on this specific issue.</P>
      <P>In January 1997 a package of measures intended to facilitate greater work-sharing in the public service, was announced. The practical application of these measures is a matter to be discussed and worked out with the appropriate trade unions for each of the various public service organisations. As regards the Civil Service, I understand that discussions are currently at an advanced stage between the Department of Finance and the Civil Service unions on the implementation of these measures which will build on the schemes already in place.</P>
      <P>Work-sharing in the private sector is first and foremost a matter to be addressed by that sector itself. The models developed in the public service provide an example of what can be achieved and I would urge the social partners to renew their efforts to conclude a framework agreement on this issue.</P>

      <P>The Government recognises that there is a strong link between investment in the research and innovation base of the economy and sustained economic growth and has committed some £1.9 billion to this area over the period of the national development plan. The overall objective in relation to technological innovation and research and development at company level is to ensure companies have access to appropriate technological expertise which helps them to improve their competitiveness and to assist them to absorb and embed such technologies within their companies.</P>
      <P>One of the objectives of the measures contained in the national development plan is to increase the level of research activity by Irish companies. It is recognised also that it is important that Irish firms have access to the latest information on developments in research and technology nationally and internationally.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland actively assists companies to access and exploit research, development and technology from international sources.</P>
      <P>The EU fifth framework programme for research and technological development emphasises the process of innovation, and supports research in areas such as information and communication technologies, food, nutrition and health and technologies for design, manufacturing, control and production. It has a budget of 13.7 billion euros over the period 1998-2002. The programme operates by supporting collaborative R&amp;D between third level colleges, research institutes and companies across the European Community.</P>
      <P>The framework programme operates on the basis of an open call for proposals which are then assessed on a competitive basis by an international panel of experts. Enterprise Ireland disseminates information on the programme to companies and assists them to identify suitable partner firms abroad and advises on the content of research proposals.</P>
      <P>The operational programme to give effect to the national development plan pays particular attention to the area of access to new technological developments. The technology and innovation partnership, international programme, will link Irish companies and companies overseas for sharing of technology. It will also operate a &ldquo;technology watch&rdquo; activity identifying research trends arising abroad and creating new ways of exploiting the results in firms in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regional innovation systems action seeks to increase innovation at the regional level by regionally led innovation studies, and investing in innovation related infrastructure. In the context <Col N="1160" /> of enterprise Ireland's strategic remit to build company capability, the EI office in Sligo, which is responsible for the Sligo-Leitrim area, is actively promoting participation by companies in the area in relevant programmes. A particular initiative being pursued by Enterprise Ireland relates to the proposed participation by Sligo and the north west region in a thematic network for regional innovation under the 5th framework programme. This is designed to prepare the groundwork for a broader regional innovation strategy under the new operational programme.</P>

      <P>Increased investment in research, technological development and innovation, RTDI, is a key component of the Government's policy to ensure that Ireland becomes an advanced and high waged economy. In this regard a sum of £1.95 billion has been allocated in the national plan for RTDI activities in the period 2000-06. From this amount a sum of £1.2 billion is being provided for industrial development related activities.</P>
      <P>This funding will be used to enhance innovation and competitiveness in order to increase output and employment in industry. This will be achieved through focused support for in-company R&amp;D, the networking of companies with the wider S&amp;T infrastructure, the better use of technology in balanced regional development and the preparation for future technological opportunities through a technology foresight process. It is anticipated that over the period of the plan a sum of around £300 million will be allocated to the industrial development agencies to support a number of in-company RTDI measures including: an R&amp;D capability scheme which will support large scale investments building up the R&amp;D infrastructure (human and capital) within new and existing firms; a competitive RTI scheme which will support companies high quality speculative R&amp;D projects, on a competitive basis; and an innovation management capability scheme which will support SMEs achieve greater returns on their R&amp;D investments by the provision of training and consultancy in R&amp;D management.</P>
      <P>The objective of this substantial investment in the RTDI base of the country is to increase the number of companies performing effective research and development so that they become more innovative and competitive as Ireland faces greater global market pressures in the future.</P>

      <P>A focussed service strategy is something I have sought to bring about since shortly after taking up office in June 1997. The new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a specific commitment to implementation of such a strategy. I was pleased, therefore, to launch Enterprise Ireland's internationally tradable services strategy 2007, ITS 2007, last month. This arises from a study co-funded with the European Union under the small business operational programme and carried out by Pricewaterhouse Coopers. The main recommendations from that study were to stress the urgency of embracing modern technologies, especially information and communications technologies, and the desirability of encouraging high tech, high opportunity indigenous enterprise as the next wave of our economic competitiveness and prosperity.</P>
      <P>ITS 2007 incorporates a strategic approach to developing an indigenous presence in these areas of opportunity, with particular emphasis on doing so on a regional basis that is away from the current concentration of services in the Dublin and eastern region. The plan sets ambitious targets to be achieved in identified sectors, in particular, informatics, digital media, e-business and health sciences, by 2007. The aim is to increase sales from £1.1 billion &ndash; mid 1999 figures &ndash; to £3.96 billion in 2007; to increase exports from £680 million to £2.97 billion; and to increase employment from 12,500 to 29,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> Successful implementation of the plan will achieve historic and critical change. For the first time in modern history growth in the regions could be driven to a significant degree by organically growing Irish high tech firms with strong local roots. A key component in this development is the roll out of a high bandwidth telecommunications infrastructure, currently under way, to provide high capacity communications for industry in regional locations.</P>
    <P>I am arranging to have a copy of ITS 2007 sent to the Deputy for his information.</P>

      <P>I announced my intention to extend consumer protection regulations, so as to require greater transparency in advertisements for airline tickets, on 31 May 2000. My announcement followed an investigation last year by the Director of Consumer Affairs, in response to complaints made to both me and the director about the hidden costs to consumers of air travel.</P>
      <P>I have asked my officials, in liaison with the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, to follow up my decision so that statutory transparency measures in airline travel advertising can be introduced at an early date. Among the issues to be addressed, arising from complaints, will be the fact that advertisements frequently do not include charges and taxes which can substantially increase the price to consumers, and the limited availability of advertised low cost fares. My officials are in consultation with the Department of Public Enterprise and the Director of Consumer Affairs in relation to these issues.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 68 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of inquiries received by the Director of Consumer Affairs and of investigations carried <Col N="1163" /> out by her office are published in the director's annual reports. The report for the year ended 31 December 1999 shows that 1,370 inquiries were received on the ODCA's telephone helpline in relation to holidays and that 57 investigations were carried out by the office's inspectorate in relation to package travel.</P>
    <P>On airline price advertising, last month I announced my intention to extend consumer protection regulations so as to require greater transparency in advertisements for airline tickets. I made this decision following an investigation by the Director of Consumer Affairs in response to complaints received both by me and the director about the hidden costs to consumers of air travel.</P>
    <P>I intend to introduce the statutory transparency measures foreseen, as soon as possible, by way of an order under section 11 of the Consumer Information Act, 1978. My officials have been working to prepare the order in draft form, in liaison with the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and in consultation with the Department of Public Enterprise, as the Department with responsibility for air transport.</P>
    <P>Council Directive 90/314/EEC on package travel and holiday tours was implemented in Ireland through the Package Holidays and Travel Trade Act, 1995, which comes within the remit of the Department of Public Enterprise. In late 1999 the European Commission issued a report on the implementation of the above directive into the domestic legislation of member states and requested comments from interested parties. Irelands views, after consultation with the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Department of Public Enterprise, were recently conveyed to the Commission for consideration and association with the views of the other member states.</P>

      <P>The number of <Col N="1170" /> prosecutions taken by the Department between January 1999 and June 2000 was 1,297. Of these 965 were successful, 257 failed and 76 are ongoing. In addition, the Health and Safety Authority obtained High Court orders relating to places of work on four occasions in 1999 and on one occasion to date in 2000. On 22 September 1999 the High Court appointed, on my petition, three inspectors to investigate the affairs of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>My Department and its associated offices would have borne the administrative costs of preparing the cases. Identifying these costs would involve a disproportionate amount of time. The number of barristers employed and the amount of money given to each barrister is a matter that falls for payment on the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor.</P>
      <P>Where proceedings have been instituted against my Department, these proceedings, where appropriate, have been referred to the Chief State Solicitor for advice or for action.</P>

If, notwithstanding the foregoing, the person in question wishes to appeal against the decision, I will arrange for a second site inspection.</P>

      <P>The North Western Regional Fisheries Board (NWRFB) has submitted a proposal to my Department for the purchase of Lough Doon, County Leitrim. While existing policy does not provide as a general rule for the acquisition by the State of fisheries, proposals for the purchase by the State of strategic sports fisheries have been taken forward under the tourism angling measure, TAM, 1994-99, subject to full compliance with the guidelines for the acquisition of fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding of £24 million has been allocated by the Government for tourism and recreational angling under the National Development Plan, NDP, 2000-06. Of this amount, £17 million has been allocated for the Border, midlands and west<Col N="1172" /> ern regional operational programme. The detailed arrangements for the expenditure of this funding will be finalised following EU approval. The north-western board will have the opportunity to submit an application for funding the purchase of Lough Doon when the various measures within the NDP are in place later this year.</P>

      <P>In 1999, the Aer Rianta Group employed a total of 3,341 staff. A breakdown is provided in the following schedule.</P>
      <P>I am advised by Aer Rianta that staff numbers increased between 1998 and 1999 due to increased levels of business, new facilities coming on stream and significantly increased passenger numbers. The increased staff numbers are mainly employed in the principal service areas such as security, cleaning and catering.</P>
      <P>The increase in staff numbers accounts for almost half of the increase in payroll costs and the balance is accounted for principally by the application of pay increases, increments and as a result of the 24 hour opening of Cork Airport since March of last year. The other emoluments referred to in the 1999 annual accounts do not relate to directors' expenses.</P>

      <P>As part of a Government decision of 23 February 1999 to approve an investment programme to upgrade the Whitegate refinery, the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, INPC, the parent body of Irish Refining PLC, has requested to actively pursue and report on the scope for other commercial opportunities to underpin the refining operation, including possible joint ventures or a strategic partnership in activities ancillary to, or having a synergy with, the refining business.</P>
      <P>In response to this request, INPC has been conducting a search process to identify business development opportunities, including the possible sale of equity in the company. It has recently received a number of formal proposals from interested parties, which it is currently evaluating. I am prepared to consider all suitable development opportunities for the company.</P>

      <P>Bus Átha Cliath purchased 215 buses in 1999. One hundred and fifty of these were <Col N="1181" /> additions to its fleet, co-financed by the Exchequer and the EU. The balance replaced buses in its existing fleet. Bus Átha Cliath has ordered 225 buses for delivery in 2000, accelerating the original delivery schedule under the national development plan. Some 125 of this order will be additions to its fleet. Ten DART cars have been delivered so far this year and a further 16 are scheduled for delivery by end 2000. All are additions to the fleet.</P>
      <P>Negotiations are still under way in relation to deliveries of buses for 2001 and it is not possible at present to specify the exact number of deliveries expected from January to June 2001. No deliveries of DART carriages are scheduled for 2001. Iarnród Éireann has recently placed an order for 12 more DART carriages for delivery in 2002. The additions to the bus fleet are primarily intended to serve the quality bus corridors, while the additional DART units will service the extensions to Greystones and Malahide and provide for increased capacity on existing services.</P>
      <P>The total size of the bus and DART fleets serving the greater Dublin area at the end 1998 and 1999 was as follows:</P>

The combination of infrastructural improvements and the additional rolling stock proposed under the national development plan will increase DART capacity by almost 7,400 places and suburban rail capacity by 7,800 seats and will increase the capacity of both Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann by 22,000 extra seats over the period of the plan.</P>

      <P>The draft guidelines for the Leader+ programme have been adopted and published by the European Commission. The guidelines set down the template for the drafting by member states of operational programmes to be submitted to the commission for approval and clearance. My Department is currently in the process of preparing the operational programmes for the implementation of both the Leader+ and the national Leader programmes for submission to the European Commission. It is intended to place advertisements shortly inviting expressions of interest from local groups on the application and implementation of the programmes in rural areas. Consultation with relevant parties is required by the European Commission in the preparation of the draft operational programmes and a significant degree of consultation has already taken place. The consultative process is ongoing and a number of advisory seminars have been arranged for July on a regional basis to provide information to prospective participants in the new Leader arrangements. Now that the guidelines for Leader+ are in place, I am ensuring that the draft operational programmes for Leader+, together with the mainstream Leader programme proposed under the national development plan, are completed and forwarded to the Commission <Col N="1185" /> with a view to obtaining clearance and the prompt establishment of Leader funding activity to 2006. While the European Commission procedure provides for a period of months for formal negotiation and clearance of programmes, I press for acceptance of our programmes at the earliest time possible. Pending this, I have earlier put in place an interim funding arrangement for groups to help maintain the momentum of Leader activity. This funding was made without prejudice to the groups which will be selected to operate the Leader programmes in the period to 2006. The local development programme is administered by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and operated by area development management on their behalf. The report of the Task Force on the Integration of Local Government and Local Development Systems which has been accepted by Government requires a cohesive and rational approach between agencies in the delivery of development programmes. My Department will work in a practicable way to meet the requirement.</P>

      <P>Under the conditions on which the European Commission approved supplementary measure A eligibility of commonage land for payment under the rural environment protection scheme was confined to owned commonage shares on which farming rights were being exercised. Leased commonage is expressly excluded for payment under the measure. No change in these terms is proposed in the new rural environment protection scheme which was submitted to the European Commission as part of the Rural Development Plan 2000-2006. My Department is reviewing the manner in which the requirement relating to farmers owning and exercising farming rights over lands is interpreted. Any proposed changes arising from this review may require to be discussed with the European Commission to ensure that they would not adversely impact on the operation of REPS. The declaration of any lands, including commonage, for area aid does not in itself establish eligibility for payment under REPS as each application must conform to the conditions of the particular scheme.</P>

      <P>Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2603/1999, which lays down rules for the transition to the rural development support provided for by Council Regulation (EC) No. 1257/1999, provides that agri-environment commitments terminating before the rural development plan is approved by the Commission may be extended by up to a maximum period of one year, but in no case extending beyond 31 December 2000. The transitional arrangements permit the making of additional payments to participants whose five year contracts have run their full course for clearly defined periods. However, the regulatory provisions currently in force preclude the granting of further extensions. When the rural development plan is approved by the European Commission, the necessary administrative procedures for the new REP scheme can be put in place. On implementation of the new scheme it will be open to farmers to make application under the terms and conditions of the scheme in force at that time. New five year contracts will run from the commencement date of the new plan. The administrative and inspection arrangements relating to the operation of the scheme, together with the human and other resources available to it, are currently under review with a view to minimising delays in processing applications under the new scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, provision has been made for a scheme of farm waste management and a scheme of installation aid for young farmers. A significant level of funding amounting to some £211 million has been allocated for these measures. The measures are a component of the regional operational programmes for the Border, midland and western region and the southern and eastern regions. Clearance to proceed requires the approval of the European Commission. The broad clearance procedure is already well under way, as negotiations with the European Commission on the Community Support Framework for Ireland, necessary to draw down the EU element of the funds, have recently been com<Col N="1187" /> pleted. In addition, the requisite operational programmes have been finalised and submitted to the commission. The further negotiation process in respect of the regional operational programmes will follow and there is a formal EU Commission procedure for the approval of operational programmes. The procedure is complex and involves the provision of a considerable amount of documentation and detail. As it is likely to continue over a number of months, it is not possible to indicate at this stage, when this proposed scheme will commence. I will be doing all I can to ensure that approval is forthcoming in the shortest possible time. In any event, while the EU Commission procedure is in train, work on preparing the operational parameters of the schemes is proceeding. It is intended that the practical aspects of the design of the schemes will be completed so as to coincide with the issue of approval by the commission, which will enable the prompt roll out and commencement of implementation of the proposed schemes. In the meantime, the national schemes for the control of farm pollution and installation aid for young farmers currently in place will continue in operation and are open to applications. Farmers approved under the national scheme for the control of farm pollution will continue with construction works and receive grant payments as the works are completed. Until the European Commission issues its approval and sanction in respect of the proposed new scheme of investment aid for farm waste management, the scheme has no formal status and, accordingly, works could not be approved by my Department.</P>

      <P>The position is that a new area based compensatory allowance scheme is to be introduced with effect from 2001 as part of the outcome of the Agenda 2000 negotiations and in particular to protect the future of these payments in the context of WTO. As provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness a task force representative of my Department and the main farming bodies was established to formulate proposals for a new scheme and to ensure an orderly transition. Having considered a range of options the group recommended a scheme which would involve a payment per hectare linked to the type of livestock on the holding. The proposals envisaged a one hectare payment for <Col N="1188" /> each livestock unit. I announced details of the proposed scheme on 29 May last. I also announced a £120 million increase in the overall allocation of money for disadvantaged area payments for the period 2001 to 2006. At a recent meeting with officials of my Department the European Commission was not satisfied with aspects of the scheme being proposed mainly on the grounds that it did not represent a clear shift from headage related payments to area related payments. The fact that each livestock unit would attract one hectare payment was seen as continuing the link to production. The task now is to devise a scheme which is best suited to our requirements and which meets with commission approval. I have personally raised the issue with Commissioner Fischler. My officials are in continuing contact with the commission with a view to devising an alternative proposal. Further consultation is also taking place with the farming bodies.</P>

      <P>The fifth year application for payment from the person named has been chosen at random for a full plan and on farm inspection. A letter to this effect has issued to the applicant. No payment can be made until the inspection process has been completed. Where lands are transferred or otherwise disposed off during the period of a REPS contract &ndash; other than through compulsory purchase order or where lands are afforested under Regulation (EEC) No. 2080/92 &ndash; all aid already paid proportionate to the transferred land must be reimbursed. As the lands in question were not transferred or disposed of because of a compulsory purchase order or through afforestation, the applicant's fifth year payment will reflect a proportionate reduction with effect from the first year of his participation in the scheme. My Department will be in touch with him directly in the near future to inform him of the details.</P>

      <P>This application was <Col N="1189" /> lodged in the local farm development service office in October 1999. The final date for applications for the existing early retirement scheme was 31 December 1999, and as a result a very large number of applications were received in the closing months of last year, which led to unavoidable delays in processing though priority has been given to this work. It has not yet been possible to finalise the processing of this application to completion as the accompanying documentation was incomplete. The applicant's solicitor was informed by letter on 31 May 2000 that the application was invalid as one of the leases was not accompanied by section 12 consent. When this is supplied, processing will be resumed. Under the terms and conditions of the scheme of early retirement from farming, payment of the pension can be made only from the date of receipt of a valid application. A valid application is an application accompanied by all the necessary documents indicating that all the conditions for payment have been met as approved by an authorised officer of the Minister.</P>

      <P>As a preliminary measure, the Office of Public Works has had the environmental impact of the measures contained in the draft preliminary report of its consulting engineers into the flooding problems in the Ballinacarra, Kilmaine, area of County Mayo, examined by an ecologist with expertise in the area of turlough vegetation. This environmental report, now to, hand, adverts to the impacts which the flood relief proposals for lowering flooding in the <Col N="1192" /> Thomastown Turlough could have on the ecology of the important adjoining turloughs of Skealoghan and Coolisduff and points out that any environmentally acceptable scheme would be unlikely to have the desired effects of reducing the extent of the flooding in the Thomastown Turlough sufficiently to relieve the flooding problem in the Ballinacarra area.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, therefore, as neither this scheme as proposed nor an earlier drainage scheme proposal, which involved excavating a new channel into Coolisduff Turlough, would be environmentally acceptable, the Office of Public Works does not propose to progress them any further. This decision, together with a copy of the ecologist's report, have recently been forwarded to Mayo County Council with the suggestion that it may wish to proceed itself with the remaining flood relief recommendation involving the raising of the road at Ballinacarra.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 to 113, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Government is conscious of the wish that has been expressed for a recognition of child care needs through the tax system. However this raises a number of issues. There is the question of equity between parents who stay at home to care for children and those who have to meet additional child care expenses when they go out to work. There is also the need for a balanced treatment of those who are in the tax system and those who rely on social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>The expert working group on child care reported to the Government in February 1999. Its recommendations covered a wide area, including financial supports for parents availing of child care services, and a particular complaint was the lack of supply of high quality, affordable child care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following consideration of the report by an interdepartmental committee, the Government agreed that the most urgent task was to increase <Col N="1193" /> the number of child care places. As a result, in budget 2000 I decided to implement a major package of measures to that end. These measures will cost £46 million in a full year and include a £10 million grant scheme towards the cost of upgrading child care facilities.</P>
    <P>In addition, the 1999 and 2000 Finance Acts provided a number of tax reliefs to encourage the provision of child care facilities and increase the supply of places. The 1999 Finance Act introduced capital allowances for expenditure on the construction, refurbishment or extension of child care premises which meet the required standards as set out in the Child Care Act, 1991. These allowances were improved in this year's Finance Act. For expenditure incurred on and from 1 December 1999 100% capital allowances are allowable in year one.</P>
    <P>The 1999 Finance Act also provided an exemption from a benefit-in-kind charge where employers provide free or subsidised child care for their employees. The exemption applies where the employer makes a premises available or, if a joint scheme, is involved in both the management and financing of the child care facility.</P>
    <P>Child care was also identified as a priority in the national development plan which has allocated £250 million to be invested in child care over the next seven years. In recognition of the importance of the quality and cost of child care for quality of life, the Government decided recently to allocate an additional £40 million over and above the £250 million allocated in the national development plan.</P>
    <P>Taxpayers in general have benefited from the tax improvements introduced in the recent budget and Finance Act, 2000, that is, the two percentage point reductions in both the standard and top income tax rates, the increase in the personal allowances of £500 single/£1,000 married to £4,700 single/£9,400 married and the widening of the standard rate band.</P>
    <P>Under the new standard rate band arrangements the single standard rate band is increased to £17,000. Two income married couples will have a combined standard rate tax band of up to £34,000 per annum, with a maximum transferability of £28,000, which is equal to two single bands of £17,000 each. This means that the second spouse will now have his or her own standard rate band worth up to £6,000 which reduces their tax bill by £1,320 per annum.</P>
    <P>This will provide an incentive to enter employment and particularly for married women to re-enter the workforce as they will now have the benefit, of their own standard rate band. Previously their spouse would have used up all of the couples married allowances and standard rate band, meaning that, generally speaking, the second spouse would start paying tax at the higher rate from the first pound.</P>
    <P>As part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government is committed to adopting before the end of 2000 an equitable strategy to support parents in meeting their child care <Col N="1194" /> needs. The strategy will be implemented in the period of the programme and will address the question of direct payments per child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy's question relates to the comparative tax treatment of married couples, cohabiting couples and lone parents. The position is as follows.</P>
      <P>A married couple who are jointly assessed have a personal allowance of £9,400 and a standard rate tax band of £28,000 for a married one-earner couple and up to £34,000 for a married two-earner couple. As regards a cohabiting couple, each partner is treated as a single person and has the single person's allowance and standard rate band i.e. £4,700 and £17,000 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> A lone parent, who may be an unmarried person, a widowed person, a deserted or separated spouse, receives the basic single personal allowance, as above, of £4,700. In addition, he-she receives the one-parent family allowance of £4,700, giving a total personal allowance of £9,400, equivalent to that of a married couple. The lone parent has a standard rate tax band of £20,150 compared to the single person's band of £17,000. In order to qualify for the one-parent family income tax allowance, a person must not be entitled to the married person's allowance, must not be living with a person as man and wife, and must prove, in the year of assessment, that a &lsquo;qualifying child', as defined under section 462 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, is resident with him/her &lsquo;for the whole or part of the tax year'. This allows the second parent to claim the allowance if the child resides with him/her for part of the tax year. The one-parent family allowance is provided in recognition of the extra cost associated with one parent rearing a child.</P>
    <P>The tax allowances and bands are designed to take account of the differing circumstances of different taxpayers and I do not consider that they discriminate unfairly between any particular group of taxpayers and others. As regards the granting of the one-parent family allowance, this is done in accordance with the tax code and I am not aware that there is any abuse of the relevant provision.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the delay in having claims, dating back to December 1995 for overtime worked, paid to clerical officers assigned to the higher scale who were former assistant officers of Customs and Excise.</Quest>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that 21 clerical officers, who were former assistant officers of Customs and Excise, were assigned to the grade of clerical officer, higher scale, on a seniority basis as part of the agreement on restructuring of grades represented by the Civil and Public Service Union, including clerical grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assignment to the clerical officer grade could only begin in December 1999. However, the 21 <Col N="1198" /> clerical officers who were former assistant officers of Customs and Excise had a different salary scale to all other clerical officers and a specific salary scale had to be calculated by the Department of Finance for this group. This was received by Revenue on 4 May 2000 and the relevant officers received their arrears of salary on 2 June 2000.</P>
    <P>Further assignments to the clerical officer, higher scale on the basis of seniority are at present being made. When the assignments to the clerical officer, higher scale on a seniority basis are completed, and when all those are paid arrears of salary, the payment for arrears of overtime will then commence.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to give a precise date; however, this is not likely to commence prior to September 2000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1201" /> Difficulties were encountered in the latter part of 1999 and early 2000 in the regional orthodontic unit at St. James's Hospital which caused the cancellation of routine orthodontic appointments. I understand from the authority that an action plan is now being implemented to address the needs of all patients affected by these difficulties.</P>
    <P>Health board orthodontic services continue to be developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. This year I am providing an additional £0.3 million to the Eastern Regional Health Authority on an ongoing basis to further the development of its orthodontic services.</P>
    <P>Developments currently under way in relation to the orthodontic services in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area include: the recruitment of two additional consultant orthodontists, the development of a new regional orthodontic unit at St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown, and the development of a new regional orthodontic unit at Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority also proposes to recruit an additional number of dentists with orthodontic qualifications and to improve the management of the service.</P>
    <P>At my request, the Eastern Regional Health Authority has submitted proposals to me as to how waiting lists and waiting times for orthodontic treatment might be reduced. I have had a recent meeting with officers of the authority on their proposals. In the course of this meeting I made clear my concern at the waiting lists and my desire to see an early and sustainable improvement in the service. I am having the authority's proposals examined further in my Department and I hope to be able to respond shortly to the authority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 to 135, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In recent years significant additional funding has been allocated for the development of services for persons with autism. Some £4.6 million has been provided nationally since 1998, with a full year cost of £5.1 million in 2001, specifically for the development of health related support services for persons with autism.</P>
      <P>These services include assessment, early intervention services, outreach services provided by multidisciplinary support teams, day, residential and respite services. While new additional services specifically for persons with autism have been and will continue to be developed, many persons with autism are in receipt of services within the intellectual disability services and have benefited generally from the development of new residential, respite and day services which have been substantially enhanced in recent years. Since 1998, £770,000 has been allocated to the South Eastern Health Board region from the funding available for the development of autism specific services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the South Eastern Health Board, a range of services are provided which include early intervention, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy, social work, psychology and child psychiatry services. Families may also access the home support services. Support services are also provided by the nurse counsellors for children <Col N="1204" /> with special needs, who monitor the needs of individual children on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>There are 24 persons with autism in the Waterford region known to the board which works closely with their families and other agencies such as the Department of Education and Science to address their needs. The board is in the process of recruiting a full-time speech and language therapist and an occupational therapist on a half-time basis to improve the current level of service available to this group.</P>

I am also advised by the board that the sponsors of the Blakestown project are making an application for funding to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, 2000-2006.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, the provision of support services to individuals or families caring for the elderly or persons with disabilities is a matter for the relevant health board. Health boards provide a range of support services to carers, including respite-intermittent care, day care, home help, public health nursing, relief care and night sitting. Information on the number of carers currently receiving support services from the health boards is not available in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1999, £1 million was allocated to the health <Col N="1206" /> boards, specifically for the support of carers and it was used to benefit carers in a flexible manner, based on local needs. This funding was used to develop additional services for carers including day care, respite care and home support services. Assistance was also provided to aid the setting up of carer support groups and to improve training for carers. Co-ordinators-liaison officers have been appointed to assist with the development and support of carers. These initiatives have been continued this year with a further £1 million provided specifically for the support of carers.</P>
    <P>The Government has established a working group on needs assessment for carers and care recipients under the chairmanship of the Minister of State with responsibility for older people and in line with a commitment given in the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium, a pilot project was carried out in the Western Health Board to develop a standard instrument which could be used by public health nurses to quickly assess the needs of the carer and care recipients. The initial findings of this pilot project were presented to the members of the working group yesterday and consideration is being given to the possible implementation of the findings on a trial basis.</P>
    <P>The domiciliary care allowance scheme, which is administered by the health boards, is paid to parents or guardians of children with severe disabilities in recognition of the extra care and attention required. As at 31 December 1999, there were 9,804 children in respect of whom domiciliary care allowance was being paid. My Department modified this scheme in January this year to apply the scheme to eligible children under the age of two.</P>
    <P>In relation to services to people with physical and sensory disability, revenue funding of £3 million, equal to £6 million full-year cost in the year 2001, has been made available to health boards this year for the development of home support services. This funding will have a significant impact on carers.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for An tArd Chláraitheoir, the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction. The person to whom the Deputy referred has not been denied access to the records maintained by the General Registry Office. The Registration of Births and Deaths Acts, 1863 to 1996 and the Marriages Acts of 1844 and 1863 provide that An t-Árd Chláraitheoir shall retain certified copies of the records of births, deaths and marriages returned to him on a quarterly basis by local registrars and that he shall compile and make available an index to such records at his office. The Marriages Ireland Act, 1844 &ndash; section 70 &ndash; in respect of marriages other than Roman Catholic marriages, the Registration of Births and Deaths (Ireland) Act, 1863 &ndash; section 17 &ndash; in respect of Roman Catholic marriages and the Registration of Births and Deaths (Ireland) Act, 1863 &ndash; section 50 &ndash; in respect of both births and deaths provide that persons are entitled to search these indexes on the payment of the approved fees and to obtain certified copies of entries identified from the index. I understand that the person concerned has previously been made aware of the manner in which records may be accessed in the General Registry Office and that he has acknowledged that he previously used the facilities of the General Registry Office for his researches.</P>

    <P>The Freedom of Information Act, 1997, provides, at section 6(1) that every person has a right to and shall, on request therefore, be offered <Col N="1209" /> access to any record held by a public body. Section 46 of this Act, however, provides, at subsection (2)(a) that this Act does not apply to a record a copy of which is available for purchase or removal free of charge by members of the public. As birth, death and marriage entries are available for purchase by members of the public from the General Registry Office, the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, does not apply to these records.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of factors impact on the balance of funding between preventative programmes and child protection and interventions, including crisis intervention, in the child care area. First, the introduction of the Child Care Act in 1991 placed new responsibilities on health boards and this development resulted in the provision of additional resources and in the prioritisation of funding intended to enable the boards to meet their obligations under the Act.  Second, there has been a substantial increase in the level of reported and confirmed cases of child abuse in the past ten years. The number of reported cases has increased by 261% between 1988 and 1998 while the number of confirmed cases has increased by 171% for the same period. Third, there has been a substantial increase in the number of children in care &ndash;  52% over the period 1988 to 1998 from 2,614 children in 1988 to 3,984 in 1998.</P>
      <P>Against this background, it was critically important to build up the intervention services and also to further develop the services for children coming into care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Child Care Act, each health board is obliged to promote the welfare of children in its area who are not receiving adequate care and protection. The Act makes specific reference to the provision by health boards of family support services and the Government is acutely aware of the need for further development in this area. This Government has put in place a number of initiatives to strengthen the preventative and early intervention services in the last three years. In 1998 the Springboard initiative was launched. This initiative has set up 15 pilot projects across the country to work intensively with children who are at risk of being taken into care or becoming involved in anti-social behaviour and their families. The projects have established formal collaborative structures involving the health boards and <Col N="1210" /> other relevant public agencies, the voluntary sector and the local community. A sum of £7.2 million was allocated to these projects from the young persons services and facilities fund.</P>
    <P>In addition, a teenage parenting support programme has been established to help identify single teenage parents who are deemed medium risk at ante-natal stage, and once identified, provide a range of necessary support services through the pregnancy and beyond it for mother and child.</P>
    <P>Health boards also provide financial supports to certain pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at-risk or disadvantaged. Funding of approximately £3.9 million, capital and revenue, was provided by the health boards towards these services in 1999 and approximately 8,000 places were funded. An additional £1.75 million is being provided for this purpose in 2000. The Government will continue to give attention to this important issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not routinely collected in my Department. However, the Deputy will be aware, that since becoming Minister for Health and Children, I have identified reducing waiting lists and waiting times, including cardiac surgery waiting lists, as a priority objective.</P>
      <P>In 1998, my predecessor allocated funding of £2.3 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative, with the specific aim of reducing the national cardiac surgery waiting list for adults and children. In 1999, my predecessor made provision for the allocation of £4 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative and I am making a further £4 million available in 2000. I am confident that this year's funding will build on previous years' success in reducing the total number of adults and children on the waiting list. The cardiac surgery waiting list initiative has had and will continue to have a positive impact on the public cardiac waiting list. The total number of public patients, adults and children, awaiting cardiac surgery has reduced from 1,586 in September 1997 to 937 in March 2000, which represents a reduction of 41%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my priority is to address the existing cardiac surgery waiting lists and the ultimate objective is to achieve an average six month waiting period for those on the lists. I am confident that the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin <Col N="1212" /> and the proposed new cardiac surgery developments at University College Hospital, Galway will help reduce the waiting lists which exist at present. Target activity levels are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG. This additional activity will increase the existing national adult public cardiac surgery capacity by over 50%. I am also developing additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin in association with the national cardiac unit, Mater Hospital to provide for up to an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children. This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40%.</P>
    <P>When the cardiovascular health strategy was launched in July of last year, my Department set a medium term objective to bring our levels of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease in line with the EU average at a minimum. Our longer term objective is to reduce our rates to those of the best performers in the EU. At age 65, Ireland has the lowest life expectancy in the EU with the single biggest contributor being heart disease. There is room for major improvements before we attain the average life expectancy enjoyed by our European neighbours. Our overall goal is to achieve life expectancy which at a minimum compares with the EU average. The challenge now is to implement the recommendations of the cardiovascular health strategy group by developing structures and mechanisms which promote cardiovascular health, reduce inequalities, ensure a high quality of service provision and reduce variations in access to and quality of services.</P>
    <P>A sum of £12 million has been provided to commence the implementation process in 2000. I am confident that over the coming years the necessary funding will be provided to allow us to achieve our goals in implementing the various actions set out in the strategy.</P>
    <P>My officials are currently undertaking a review of bed capacity under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review will identify the capacity of the hospital system to manage the reduction of waiting times for elective treatment.</P>

      <P>Discussions in relation to the statutory registration of certain allied health professionals are ongoing with the professional bodies representing these professions. The Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists in Ireland has been consulted and is involved in this process. However, an invitation extended to the society to attend a workshop on 14 April 2000 was apparently not received by the society. Consequently, a separate meeting was organised by officials of my Department with officers of the society and the society has been involved in the two subsequent workshops. I am committed to the full participation of all of the relevant professional bodies in the process.</P>
      <P>The second issue raised by the Deputy refers to the implementation of the terms of a High Court settlement which I am obliged to implement. On 22 June, officials of my Department met with the society and the other two professional bodies representing chiropodists in Ireland to discuss same. It was stated at this meeting that while my Department wishes to move forward with the agreement of the professional bodies, I am bound by the terms of the High Court settlement. My primary concern in the implementation of this settlement is the protection of the public and this will be achieved by ensuring that only those with a suitable competence will be able to practice in the public health service.</P>

This additional funding will supplement the £4 million capital allocation which is available annually from my Department to fund the purchase of suitable premises for use as move-on accommodation, whether medium-term or long-term, for homeless persons who are long-term residents in hostels.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Current criteria for evaluation of tenders for public projects in the civil engineering field involve the assessment of all tenders for the sufficiency of individual rates and the overall tender price. In the event of the contracting authority <Col N="1218" /> considering that either the rate or overall tender is insufficient, a written explanation is sought from the tenderer. In the case of inadequate explanation the tenderer is eliminated from further consideration.</P>
    <P>Contracts between a contractor and sub-contractor do not come within the ambit of these procedures and are matters for the parties concerned.</P>

      <P>The current maximum SDA loan available to borrowers for the acquisition or construction of a house was increased on 15 June 2000 to £100,000. The maximum mortgage loan in each case is to be determined by the local authority subject to the £100,000 limit and is also subject to the purchaser's ability to repay, that is, mortgage repayments should not exceed 35% of a household's net income, after tax, PRSI and levies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where borrowers are unable to acquire a home with an SDA loan, they can consider a shared ownership loan or purchase under the affordable housing scheme. Income eligibility for these schemes is determined as follows: in the case of a single income household, the gross income in the previous tax year must not exceed £25,000 and in the case of a two income household, income eligibility is determined by a formula which takes account of the gross income in the preceding tax year of the principal earner and the subsidiary <Col N="1221" /> earner, that is, where two and a half times the income of the principal earner plus once the income of the subsidiary earner does not exceed £62,500.</P>
    <P>There is no maximum loan limit set for the affordable housing scheme. However, the maximum loan cannot exceed 95% of the sale price of the house and account has to be taken of the purchaser's ability to repay by reference to net income of the household. In the case of the shared ownership scheme, a borrower must purchase at least 40% of the value of the house and rent and the remaining share, 60% or less, from the local authority.</P>
    <P>The average house price paid by a first-time purchaser in the greater Dublin area in 1999 was £124,000.</P>

      <P>Details of the first national inventory of zoned serviced land, based on returns from individual local authorities, were published by my Department on 6 June 2000. The results of this exercise show that the position in relation to the stock of serviced building land is encouraging and is set to improve significantly going forward. In Dublin, for example, the supply of zoned and serviced land currently exceeds 1,000 hectares providing sufficient land for more than 40,000 housing units. I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement providing extracts from the survey relating to Dublin and the adjoining counties. Copies of the full survey results have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>A robust framework for the delivery of additional housing supply was put in place by the Government in 1998 with the publication of Action on House Prices, which included a range of measures such as substantially increasing the funding for the serviced land initiative, providing £5 million for specific non-national roads schemes opening up land for housing development and reducing the capital gains tax rate to 20% on disposals of residential development land.</P>
      <P>Housing output continued to expand in 1999 primed by a continuation of the measures in Action on House Prices and additional measures introduced by the Government in Action on the Housing Market. Residential density guidelines were issued by my Department to all planning authorities in September 1999 to which they, and An Bord Pleanála, are required to have regard. The national development plan published in November last provides for massively increased investment in economic infrastructure such as roads, water, sewerage and public transport which is essential to support housing development in the period to 2006 and beyond. Housing was also included in the national development plan for the first time with a provision of £6 billion for social and affordable housing measures over the plan period.</P>
      <P>Record housing output of 46,512 units nationally was achieved in 1999, an increase of 20% on output in 1997. Record output of more than 10,000 units was achieved last year in Dublin city and county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part V of the Planning and Development Bill which completed its passage through the Dáil and Seanad last week will bring about fundamental changes in the planning and provision of housing, including social and affordable housing. Local authorities will be statutorily obliged to prepare housing strategies dealing with the housing needs of all sectors of the population in their areas, including those in need of social and affordable <Col N="1223" /> housing, and must ensure that sufficient land is zoned to meet housing needs for the period of their development plan. Local authorities have been asked to press ahead with work on their housing strategies.</P>
    <P>Action on Housing, which was published on 15 June 2000 and a copy of which was forwarded to all Deputies, sets out a further range of Government measures in response to the recently completed review of the housing market. These measures aim to accelerate and increase the supply of housing, curb short-term speculative demand assist first-time house purchasers and <Col N="1224" /> improve the social and affordable housing response. The measures include the use of strategic development zones to fast-track key housing developments, the establishment of project offices to streamline the provision of essential roads, public transport, water and waste water infrastructure supporting new housing development, an exchequer allocation of £150 million for housing and other development related non-national roads schemes, initiatives to increase the capacity of the planning system, revisions to stamp duty thresholds to favour first time buyers, the introduction of an anti-speculative property tax and the expansion of the local authority housing programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national development plan includes an amount of £4.7 billion for the improvement and maintenance of the national road network in the period 2000 to 2006. This is a threefold increase in the level of investment in national roads provided for in 1994-99. This funding will ensure development by 2006 of the major inter-urban routes to motorway-high quality dual carriageway standard, further major improvements on other national primary routes, and improvement of national secondary roads, with emphasis on routes which are of particular importance to economic and regional development, including links to the strategic corridors, roads serving key ports, airports, tourist areas, industry and multi-purpose roads.</P>
      <P>Details of this national roads strategy are set out in the NDP and will be further elaborated on in the Operational Programme for Economic and Social Infrastructure. Progress reports are provided in the annual review documents published by the National Roads Authority. Further monitoring reports will be produced, in due course, by the monitoring committee for the operational programme.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the NDP, public private partnerships will play an important role in the achievement of the ambitious targets set out for the improvement of road infrastructure in the period to 2006. Three pilot PPP projects, namely, the N25 Waterford bypass, the Limerick southern ring, phase two, and the second Liffey Valley bridge, M50, are already under development as PPP schemes. In addition, eight further roads PPP projects have recently been announced by the NRA.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that significant progress is being made on the advancement of the national roads programme as set out in the NDP, and that stated targets will be met.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 197 of 24 May 2000.</P>
      <P>While air quality in Ireland is generally good, it is recognised that new EU limit values for particulate matter and nitrogen oxides will be challenging in urban areas with heavy traffic. Measures designed to ensure the standards are met include the introduction of improved fuel standards earlier this year, improved standards for emissions from new vehicles and the introduction of the national car test. In addition, the ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal is being extended to five new areas from next October.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the enforcement of the Housing (Registration of Rented Houses) Regulations, 1996, lies with the local authorities. I am anxious to see full compliance with the regulations and in this regard my Department has urged local authorities to take all available measures necessary to ensure that landlords comply with their statutory requirements.</P>
      <P>The capacity of local authorities to enforce the regulations had been adversely affected by successful court challenges by landlords to the registration regulations. These difficulties have now been addressed by the introduction of amending regulations early this year, leaving the way clear for authorities to actively pursue their enforcement. In addition, the exemption of compliant landlords of private rented accommodation from the 2% anti-speculation tax announced in the Government's Action on Housing will, I expect, lead to greatly increased levels of registration and better enforcement of the regulations generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 184 and 185 together.</P>
      <P>A waste management plan made by a local authority under Part II of the Waste Management Act, 1996, is required to include information on, or otherwise have regard to the identification of sites at which waste disposal or recovery activities have been carried on, the assessment of any risk of environmental pollution arising as a result of such activities, measures taken or proposed to be taken in order to prevent or limit any such environmental pollution, the identification of necessary remedial measures in respect of such sites, and measures taken or proposed to be taken to achieve such remediation, having regard to the cost-effectiveness of available remediation techniques.</P>
      <P>The national hazardous waste management plan, NHWMP, to be made by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is required to make equivalent provision in respect of sites at which hazardous waste disposal activities have been carried on. A local authority is required to take appropriate measures to implement any relevant recommendations contained in the NHWMP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> Where the remediation of a contaminated site involves, or gives rise to, an activity that requires a waste licence from the EPA, there is comprehensive and satisfactory provision for public notification of, and involvement in, the licensing process. Under Part V of the 1996 Act and subordinate regulations, any person may inspect an application for a waste licence and related documentation, make a written submission in relation to an application, and object to a proposed licensing decision by the EPA.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at this time to introduce further legislation with regard to remediation of contaminated sites.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that this increased level of central funding which is mainly from the local Government fund motor tax receipts, supplemented by local authorities' own resources, is providing for the ongoing and special needs of local authorities in relation to the non-national road network and for the systematic and accelerated improvement of this network.</P>

      <P>The Local Government Bill, 2000, published last month provides that local authority policy is determined by the elected council with a range of mechanisms to oversee the direction of local authority affairs and requires that the manager operate within this policy framework. Better support for the elected council with a strengthened corporate position will flow from involvement via strategic policy committees from the early stages of policy development assisted by directors of service; a corporate plan adopted for the life of the council; improved training/information; the introduction of service indicators and modern financial management and accounting systems. These and other changes introduced by the Bill such as the role of the corporate policy group; the ending of the dual mandate and the introduction of a directly elected cathaoirleach from 2004; and a salary and pension for councillors will, taken together, significantly alter the current local government system and greatly enhance the role of the elected council. Some of the changes mentioned and others such as county or city development boards are already in train and will be reinforced by the Bill while others will follow from its enactment.</P>

    <P>As stated, the number of people currently in receipt of farm assist is 7,570.

    <P>On 31 May 2000, there were 7,570 farm assist claims in payment, receiving on average £79.30 per week.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 2000, made a number of important changes to the means test for the farm assist scheme. The child-related disregards are being increased from £100 to £200 for the first two children and £200 to £300 for each subsequent qualified child.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, instead of 80%, only 70% of self-employment income, including off-farm self-employment, will now be taken into account. There are also changes in the way capital is assessed, with the first £10,000 held by a claimant disregarded, and the balance treated more favourably than heretofore. These changes will be effective from October 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 198 and 199 together.</P>
      <P>To be entitled to an unemployment payment a person must satisfy the statutory conditions of being capable of, being available for, and genuinely seeking but unable to obtain suitable employment.</P>
      <P>Where a deciding officer decides that a person does not fulfil the conditions the claim is formally disallowed. Deciding officers are statutorily appointed. Anybody who is not satisfied with a deciding officer's decision may appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
      <P>From January 1999 to end May 2000 some 6,606 claims were disallowed on the grounds that the person in question failed to satisfy the statutory condition of genuinely seeking suitable employment. Of these 2,924 were claiming unemployment benefit and 3,682 were claiming unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>In addition 3,208 unemployment benefit claims and 6,675 unemployment assistance claims were disallowed on the grounds that the claimants were not available for employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of disallowances for each month are set out in the attached table. Figures are not main<Col N="1237" /> tained on a county by county basis as the geographical areas covered by social welfare local offices cut across county boundaries in many instances.</P>
    <P>Apart from those whose claims were disallowed for failure to fulfil the statutory conditions, substantial numbers of persons withdrew their claims or ceased claiming following interview by my Department. These are not included in the figures quoted. If a person is dissatisfied with the deciding officer's decision s/he has a right of appeal to the social welfare appeals office. It is not possible to provide information on the outcome of appeals from the disallowances referred to. However in the period from January 1999 to May 2000, 5,744 appeals relating to unemployment payments were received in that office. Of these, 3,028 related to unemployment assistance and 2,716 to unemployment benefit. These figures include persons disallowed for reasons other than the &ldquo;not genuinely seeking&rdquo; and &ldquo;not available&rdquo; conditions.</P>
    <P>Of the unemployment payment appeals dealt with by the appeals office during the period in question, 28% were decided wholly or partly in favour of the appellant and 72% were not successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Support for carers is provided by a range of Government Departments, including the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Finance and my own Department. The issue for which my Department has responsibility is the carer's allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>The Review of the Carer's Allowance, which was published by my Department in October 1998, noted that it is difficult to estimate the number of full-time carers in the country. While care groups have estimated this figure to be around 100,000 carers, it is not clear that all of these are full-time carers. Based on work in the review, the current figure is estimated to be around 50,000 people, including those caring for older people and adults and children with disabilities. While details of this group on a regional basis are not available, the table below give county details for those in receipt of the carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>Number of recipients for carers allowance by county, 1999, estimated: Carlow 217; Cavan 320; Clare 399; Cork 1,269; Donegal 1,054; Dublin 2,035; Galway 1,071; Kerry 800; Kildare 393; Kilkenny 316; Laois 214; Leitrim 175; Limerick 773; Longford 244; Louth 313; Mayo 1,000; Meath 354; Monaghan 321; Offaly 308; Roscommon 329; Sligo 279; Tipperary 726; Waterford 315; Westmeath 302; Wexford 490; Wicklow 370; Total 14,387.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit.</P>
      <P>At the end of May 2000, there were 15,380 carer's allowances in payment compared to just over 9,200 when this Government came to office three years ago. This represents an increase of over 67 per cent in the number of carers receiving the allowance during that period. Over the same period expenditure on carer's allowance has grown from £36.5 million to an estimated £78.3 million this year, an increase of 115%.</P>
      <P>Following a detailed examination of the review of the carer's allowance a range of measures were introduced in the last two budgets to improve and develop the position of carers. The main supports for carers in receipt of the carer's allowance or carers who are caring for recipients of a constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance, in addition to the weekly income support payment, are as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Free Travel pass for all qualified carers. Free telephone rental allowance for all qualified carers. Free electricity allowance and free television licence schemes for all qualified carers from next October. Annual payment of £300 towards respite care. The &lsquo;full-time care and attention' rule has been relaxed to allow carers in receipt of carer's allowance to take up paid <Col N="1241" /> employment for up to 10 hours per week qualified carers are no longer required to satisfy &lsquo;13 paid contribution' rule when claiming disability benefit. Credited PRSI contributions for all qualified carers. Carers who have ceased their caring responsibilities will be eligible for the back to education allowance scheme from next September. The new carer's benefit scheme, which will be introduced next October, is specifically intended to support people who must leave the workforce to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
    <P>As already stated, the carer's allowance is an income support payment. The review proposed the introduction of a non-means tested &lsquo;continual care' payment to recognise carers providing the highest levels of care and to promote care in the community.</P>
    <P>It envisaged that this payment would be made, irrespective of income or social welfare entitlement, to carers caring for those who are in the highest category of dependency. In order to differentiate between the levels of care and care needs, the review considered that a needs assessment encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced, and that the &lsquo;continual care' payment could then be introduced following the introduction of such an assessment system. It was considered that a needs assessment would separate care needs from income support needs and could potentially be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants to those in need of care.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a system of needs assessment is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children. Establishing a pilot study was identified as a priority in the Government's review of its action programme and I understand that this is well advanced in the Western Health Board area. Developing the needs assessment system to encompass the type of register suggested by the Deputy would also be a matter for the Minister for Health and Children to consider.</P>
    <P>As is clear from the many improvements which have been made in recent budgets the position of carers is being actively advanced. Further improvements will be considered in the context of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme.</P>

      <P>During the period in question, 1/6/99 to 31/5/00 a total of 378 cases were referred to the Chief State Solicitors Office to take criminal prosecutions against alleged offenders. In the same period 159 cases were finalised in court. Of these, 140 were convicted, the remainder were dismissed or struck out. A range of penalties were imposed on those convicted, including imprisonment, fines, and community service. There are currently 526 cases being processed through the courts on behalf of my Department.</P>
      <P>All of the cases taken during the period were heard summarily in the District Courts and were prosecuted on my Department's behalf by the Chief State Solicitor's office, CSSO. There were no barristers employed to prosecute any of the cases. The CSSO also prosecutes cases on behalf of other Ministers and, I am advised, does not keep an account of the costs involved in prosecuting cases on behalf of individual Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The code of practice will contain a set of agreed measures that are aimed at managing the archaeological mitigation <Col N="1243" /> programme necessitated by the National Road Authority's road construction programme more effectively and efficiently without any dilution of my Department's policy as published last year in Framework and Principles for the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage and Policy and Guidelines on Archaeological Excavation.</P>
      <P>A key component in the operation of the code will be the proposed employment of a project archaeologist on each major road project who will be involved from the earliest design stages of the project and will work closely with the engineering consultants, the archaeological site directors and Dúchas the heritage service of my Department. This will help to ensure that all archaeological work is carried out expeditiously having regard to the time constraints imposed by the national development plan but in accordance with the highest archaeological standards and practice. In this way, I am confident that the protection of the archaeological heritage will not be compromised.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to determine in advance appropriate levels of mitigation, but general criteria and guidelines will be produced by Dúchas. Then, on the basis of detailed assessment, it is proposed that a programme of mitigation for each scheme will be agreed between the project archaeologist and Dúchas. I expect to be in a position to make an announcement about the Code in the near future when details of all the measures proposed will be made available.</P>
      <P>The national development plan will see an unprecedented level of investment in our roads and there will be a consequential and significant archaeological mitigation programme required. Rather than reducing the opportunities for the archaeological sector, such opportunities will be greatly enhanced and I envisage that there will be considerable pressure on the profession to meet the huge demand for services that will undoubtedly arise.</P>
      <P>My remit extends only to the protection of the archaeological heritage and the maintenance of archaeological standards and I am satisfied that the code will assist in my achieving these objectives. It is a matter for the archaeological profession itself to address its own regulation issues. In this regard, it would seem appropriate for the profession to enter into negotiations with the National Roads Authority, local authorities and other major developers about the types of contracts to be entered into on road projects, infrastructural schemes and other large development projects. Ultimately, the question of wage rates and labour-related issues are a matter for the marketplace and for others to pursue.</P>

      <P>It is an offence under the Wildlife Act, 1976, to either take a peregrine falcon from its nest or to export it other than under licence issued by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department.</P>
      <P>Local Dúchas management have made enquiries concerning the reported allegations of an illicit trade in young peregrine falcons from Sligo and Mayo. I am advised that they have received no information of a current illicit trade in young peregrine falcons in the Sligo-Mayo areas. On this basis I have no reason to believe that there are any current activities that could be linked to these recent articles.</P>
      <P>It is our policy to prosecute anyone who has committed offences under the Wildlife Act, 1976, subject to possession of the requisite evidence and Dúchas has in the past taken prosecutions against individuals involved in an illegal trade in peregrine falcons. If there is evidence available that such activity is currently under way I would request that it be brought to the attention of Dúchas, the heritage service, who could then take the necessary action.</P>

      <P>I have responded to a number of similar Questions on this issue already and the position remains broadly unchanged from that outlined in my response to the most recent one from the Deputy, question number 460 dated 10 May 2000.</P>
      <P>Two of the three local authorities concerned have yet to complete the legal transfer documents but I am pleased to confirm that all of the local authorities have now confirmed acceptance of the conditions governing development funding secured by my Department over the next five years for the demesne.</P>

      <P>The employment of barristers and any payments to them is a matter for the Chief State Solicitor's office.</P>
      <P>There were eight legal actions initiated against my Department since June 1999. Some ten legal actions against my Department were settled since June 1999. There are currently 79 legal actions ongoing against my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department has initiated two legal actions since June 1999. Some four cases brought by my Department have been settled since June 1999. There are 22 legal actions brought by my Department ongoing.</P>
      <P>It has not been possible to calculate the total cost of these actions for the period in question as the issue of costs in some of the actions settled has not yet been finalised or is protected by order of the court. However, I can inform the Deputy that a total in the region of £250,000 has been awarded to claims settled against my Department in the past 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to asylum seekers as opposed to refugees. Asylum seekers enter the country on their own initiative and my Department co-ordinates their accommodation and other needs under the direct provision system currently in operation while their asylum applications are being processed. Programme refugees enter the country at the invitation of the government and are looked after by the refugee agency which currently operates under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Once granted refugee status asylum seekers are entitled in general to the same rights as <Col N="1249" /> an Irish citizen and would have the same access to local authority housing.</P>
      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned the directorate for asylum support services, which was established in November 1999 under the aegis of my Department, is responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers. Under the arrangements in place since 10 April asylum seekers are accommodated by the directorate at initial reception centres in Dublin for a period of one-two weeks for the purposes of medical screening, needs assessment, the provision of information and processing of the initial stages of their asylum applications before being resettled at other locations around the country.</P>
      <P>The following properties, consisting of 10 rooms or more are used by the Directorate in the Dublin area: The Parnell West Hotel, Parnell Square, Dublin 2, 88 Pembroke Road, Dublin 4, 10 North Frederick Street, Dublin 1, 14 Gardiner Place, Dublin 1, The Viking Lodge, 34-36 Francis Street, Dublin 8.</P>
      <P>There are also three smaller properties in use by the directorate in the Dublin area with a total of 23 rooms. The Parnell West Hotel was purchased on behalf of the directorate. In respect of the other properties proprietors have been contracted by the directorate to provide full board accommodation for asylum seekers. The rates of payment to these proprietors vary from £27,216 to £114,987 per 4 week period.</P>
      <P>The contracts, are for a period of 12 months, in general. Contracts for a two year period are in place for the properties at 88 Pembroke Road and Viking Lodge.</P>
      <P>Prior to 10 April, the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers was handled, in the main, by the Eastern Health Board, in whose administrative area the majority of asylum seekers are located. Recent enquiries with the Eastern Health Board show that there are in excess of 2000 asylum seekers living in emergency accommodation in over 80 different locations within their area. However no details are available to my Department regarding the accommodation capacity at these locations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>A high priority is being given to the reduction in processing times for asylum applications including the allocation of additional staff to this area and the streamlining of procedures and processes.</P>
      <P>In 1996, there were four staff working in the asylum division of the Department. By 1997 this number had risen to 22 staff. During 1997 the Government approved a proposal for the recruitment of an additional 72 staff to help deal with the backlog of asylum cases and the ongoing intake of new asylum seekers. In July 1998 Government approval was obtained to recruit an additional 72 staff for the asylum, immigration and citizenship areas. A further 120 staff were sanctioned for the asylum, immigration and citizenship work and for the directorate for asylum seeker support services in December 1999. This represented the largest allocation of staff resources in any area of the Civil Service since the Government came into office and underlines the priority which the Government attaches to the issue of more expeditious asylum processing and procedures.</P>
      <P>There are currently 175 sanctioned posts involved directly in processing asylum applications. As I announced on 8 May 2000, when the Government approved a number of further initiatives on asylum, refugee and immigration matters, I will be making detailed proposals to the Government shortly on the further acceleration of asylum processing including staffing aspects.</P>
      <P>In relation to the processing of applications, I would inform the Deputy that between May 1998, the starting point from which the Department has began to fully address the backlog of applications and 31 May 2000, a total of 9630 interviews were scheduled of which 6,252 were completed. All applicants who lodged a claim up to the end of June 1999 have at this time been afforded the opportunity of a substantive interview with some minor exceptions and with the exception of those cases in respect of which issues are outstanding under the Dublin convention. Substantive decisions are notified to applicants within three months of interview. Manifestly unfounded decisions are notified within three weeks of interview.</P>
      <P>The aim of my Department is to minimise the time taken from the date of application to completion of the procedure in a refugee determination process which meets the highest EU and international standards and enables applications to be processed within six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has also put in place more streamlined arrangements to facilitate the use of accelerated procedures so as to deal more speedily with cases which are manifestly well-founded and manifestly unfounded. Workshops have been held with the relevant staff and instructions have issued <Col N="1251" /> concerning the use of such procedures. Manifestly well-founded cases are being identified at an early stage to ensure that a person who is likely to succeed in the asylum process gets the benefit of refugee status as soon as possible without being unnecessarily delayed. Manifestly unfounded procedures will help to eliminate, at an early stage, applications which appear to have little or no relevance to the definition of a refugee in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended.</P>
    <P>Some 75% of scheduled interviews are now with new applicants within one month of arrival, in particular, those from the highest source countries, and the remainder of interviews are scheduled for applicants who constitute the backlog. Our previous concentration on eliminating a backlog of a substantial number of applicants outstanding for a three year period from a much lower base means that all applicants being scheduled from the backlog arrived in the State within the last 12 months. This concentration of resources primarily on new applicants with maximum use of accelerated procedures is necessary to deter abuse of the system and will facilitate speedy processing of new applicants and will minimise the extent to which manifestly well founded cases go into a backlog, thereby maintaining the intergity of our asylum process. Every effort is also being made to expedite the processing of appeals and so far this year, I have appointed an additional eight appeals authorities bringing the total number of such authorities to 14. These authorities hear appeals from applicants for refugee status whose applications have been refused at first instance.</P>
    <P>In relation to the right to work of asylum seekers, the Government, as an exceptional measure, agreed on 26 July 1999 that those asylum applicants who had been in the State for more than 12 months, and who were still awaiting a final determination of their applications for refugee status, should be given the right to work. The rules also apply to those who sought asylum here up to 26 July 1999 as soon as they cross the twelve month threshold. In December 1999 the Government also dispensed with the requirement for work permits for asylum seekers eligible under the previous decision of 26 July. The Government also decided that each eligible asylum seeker should be issued with a letter which sets out their position in relation to eligibility for employment for presentation to a potential employer and the Department has arranged accordingly. To date, some 2000 letters advising asylum seekers of their right to work have issued.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to broaden the current arrangements for the right to work in respect of asylum applicants</P>
    <P>In relation to those aspects of the Deputy's question dealing with dispersal and direct provision, the position is that the Office of Public Works has approached the main religious bodies in Ireland to advise them of the situation concerning accommodation requirements for asylum see<Col N="1252" /> kers. Several undertakings were received to keep the matter under review.</P>
    <P>Regarding direct provision, it is not clear what the Deputy means by opposite measures which are proving more successful. The policy of direct provision is a national one in place since 10 April 2000 in respect of all newly arrived asylum seekers. The Government has no plans to set aside current policy in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Equal Status Act, 2000, which was signed into law by the President on 26 April 2000, is a radical and innovative measure which puts Ireland in the lead position within the European Union in terms of anti-discrimination legislation. Section 48 of the Act provides that the Act shall come into operation on such day as may be fixed by order made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and that different days may be fixed for different provisions and for different purposes.</P>
      <P>A number of necessary administrative steps are under way to enable the Act to be commenced including the putting in place of the requisite staff in the equality authority and in the office of the director of equality investigations. It is my intention to have the entire Act in operation later this year and my target date for so doing is October 2000 when the appropriate resources are expected to be in place.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that section 47 of the Equal Status Act, 2000, which is in respect of transitional arrangements for the Employment Equality Act, 1998, has already been brought into operation. I made the requisite order under section 48 of the Act on 14 June 2000.</P>

    <P>In so far as measures to facilitate recreational <Col N="1254" /> activities by persons while on the land are concerned I should say that the Occupiers' Liability Act, 1995, for which my Department is responsible, simplifies and clarifies the law on occupiers' liability. It outlines a duty of care an occupier of premises has towards three classes of entrant &ndash; visitors, recreational users and trespassers and it implemented many of the recommendations in the Law Reform Commission's final report on the subject.</P>

      <P>I am continuing my policy of increasing the Garda strength annually with a view to reaching a target of 12,000 by the year 2002.</P>
      <P>The availability of gardaí for deployment at any particular time depends on a number of factors including operational priorities, attestation of trainees, normally a group every three months, retirements, promotions and reassignments.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities &ndash; who are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas &ndash; that Garda personnel strengths and the overall policing arrangements for the Carlow / Kildare division are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of available Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided to the community.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that the allocation of resources is constantly kept under review and as personnel become available for allocation, the needs of Carlow-Kildare will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of other Garda divisions throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The likelihood that an accused will interfere with witnesses or evidence is already recognised by our courts as a ground on which bail may be refused.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, created a statutory offence, punishable by up to ten years imprisonment, for a person to intimidate another person who is assisting in the investigation by the Garda Síochána of an offence, or is a witness or potential witness or a juror or potential juror in proceedings for an offence, or a member of his or her family, with the intention of causing the investigation or the course of justice to be obstructed, perverted or interfered with.</P>
      <P>In addition the Deputy will be aware that the Bail Act, 1997, was passed into law by the Oireachtas in May 1997. It gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution which provided for additional power to be given to the courts to refuse bail. Some provisions of the Act were brought into operation in 1998 and I am pleased to say that following my signature of an order to that effect, I have brought the Act fully into operation with effect from 15 May 2000.</P>

      <P>An interdepartmental review group, chaired by an official from my Department, is currently examining the reliefs' available under the disabled drivers and disabled passengers, tax concessions, scheme. The scheme provides reliefs' from vehicle registration tax and value added tax on vehicles and from excise duty on fuel to drivers and passengers who are severely and permanently physically disabled.</P>
      <P>In order that it would benefit from as full a range as possible of experience of the scheme, the review group was asked to hold more extensive consultations than originally envisaged. Detailed meetings have been held with representatives of various organisations and with individuals who indicated a desire to make oral submissions to the review group. Additionally, advertisements seeking written submissions from members of the public in regard to the scheme were placed in the national newspapers and drew a large response with 240 submissions received reflecting over 60 different disabilities. As a result of these consultations, the review group anticipates that its report will not be completed until August 2000.</P>
      <P>The insights obtained from an analysis of the oral and written submissions, when added to the knowledge already gained from the submissions which it received from members of the public and from public representatives, will facilitate the group in bringing its work to a conclusion. On completion of the report, it will be submitted for the consideration of the Minister for Finance who will determine what action should be taken on foot of the recommendations of the review group as expressed in their report.</P>
      <P>Whilst the review process has been somewhat prolonged by the extensive consultation process adopted by the group, I am satisfied that due to the complex nature of the issues involved it was important to hold a wide consultation phase to ensure that all people with disabilities and interested parties have an opportunity to contribute to the review.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with the quality of service being provided in the tourist industry in general, be it in hotels, restaurants, shops or public transport.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said on previous occasions, I consider it extremely important that we do not lose the uniqueness of the Irish welcome for visitors to this country. I think it vitally important that the quality of service offered to visitors from abroad and indeed to those who choose to holiday at home, whether for shorter or longer breaks, is maintained at the highest levels. It is only by maintaining a pool of highly motivated, productive, committed and skilled labour within the industry that we will ensure that holiday makers impressed by the service offered, will return to holiday here or encourage their friends to join with them in experiencing the delights of a holiday in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The tourism industry is a global one and we must ensure that our competitiveness is maintained in attracting visitors to this country. We have over the years invested heavily to create a tourism product which is the envy of our competitors. We must continue to improve and grow to ensure that that we do not lose the competitive edge that we have strived so hard to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1268" /> The industry itself must work to maintain standards. In this respect I very much welcome recent initiatives from the Irish Hotels Federation, who have introduced a quality employer scheme and from the Restaurants Association of Ireland who have developed a customer charter. These and similar initiatives are very much needed in this service oriented industry.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that service standards may be adversely affected in our growing economy where employees now have greater opportunities to move within and between sectors, and where there are shortages of skilled and trained staff. The tourism sector is no exception with respect to these factors. In certain areas of the industry there are staff turnover, staff retention and skill shortage problems. However the industry is working to address the situation by offering better terms and conditions of employment. By doing so employers can ensure that staff within the industry and those considering entering it will view the sector as an attractive one to work in, with good career prospects.</P>
    <P>For the above reasons I was very pleased yesterday, 28 June to launch CERT's strategic plan, which sets out CERT's vision of its role and its plans for the development of the Irish tourism and hospitality industry over the six-year period to 2006. As I noted at the launch, the overall aim of the plan is to help industry secure and retain a professional and skilled workforce to meet existing and emerging needs of the industry, thereby enhancing the quality of the tourism product and service. This plan is an important milestone in the process of rolling out new programmes under the national development plan. Activities to be undertaken by CERT during the period will facilitate raising and maintaining the highest operational standards in tourism. They will help the industry to ensure that it has available to it a skilled workforce to meet the demands of the ever increasing number of visitors to this country where people and service quality impressions are of major importance to the projection of the unique Irish tourist brand.</P>

      <P>Architectural planning for a project at the school in question is proceeding as quickly as possible having regard to the large number of school building projects on hand within my Department.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the rate of progress to construction for a capital project depends on factors such as the complexity and size of the project, the time required to undertake architectural planning, the volume of other projects being dealt with by the design team, the period of time required for the granting of planning permission and a fire certificate and the outcome of the tender competition. These processes are by their nature lengthy and complex and can take a considerable period of time to complete. Delays can arise at any point in the process, consequently it is not possible to say when projects being processed at present will proceed to construction. However, every effort is made by my Department to minimise delays and to ensure that construction is started in the shortest period of time possible. In all cases, the school authorities will be kept informed of progress.</P>

      <Quest>the plans he has to resolve the problems of school transport to Seamount college, Kinvara, County Galway for families who wish to send their children to this college from the Gort area; if he will approve a school transport service; and his views on whether the present situation, as outlined by the Minister for State recently, is the correct stance on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The position generally is that my Department is responsible for ensuring that requests for school transport do not unreasonably threaten the viability of existing schools to which parents, teachers and the State through taxpayers have already committed resources. However, my Department is also required to consider the practical difficulties experienced by families, arising from the rigid application of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to this particular case is that a problem arose in relation to girls from the Kinvara catchment area who wished to attend Gort community school. The position was unusual in that members of the same household were appropriate to separate catchment areas on the basis of their gender. In these circumstances it was decided that pupils who would not ordinarily qualify for transport to another catchment area would be allowed to board the bus at the same point as whose with a full transport entitlement provided no extra State cost was involved. As a bus service already existed taking boys to Gort <Col N="1274" /> this condition was met. The change to the scheme was made with effect from September 1998.</P>
    <P>A similar situation did not exist in the case of girls seeking transport from the Gort area to Kinvara. There was no existing bus service from the Gort area to Kinvara and accordingly the above conditions did not exist. In the circumstances where significant additional costs would arise it was not open to my Department to establish a new service under the conditions of the school transport scheme.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to my Department's assessment of school provision needs in the Lucan area is set out in my reply to Question <Col N="1278" /> No. 308 of 16 May 2000, which was tabled by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In that reply I indicated that, among other things, the provision of a new multi-denominational primary school and an all-Irish community college, together with extensions to existing primary and post primary schools, would significantly alleviate pressure for school places in Lucan in the short term.</P>
      <P>I went on to point out that, arising from a report of the technical working group of the commission on school accommodation, two sites had been reserved in the Adamstown area, one for primary school and the other for a postprimary school. I should point out, also, that a further site for a primary school has been reserved in the Griffeen/Foxborough area.</P>
      <P>I understand that South Dublin County Council is at present preparing a draft action plan for Lucan. This plan will provide details of the extent and pace of housing development and of projected population growth in the area. Based on this information, my Department will be in a better position to determine what additional measures are required to ensure the availability of adequate school provision at first and second level.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined <Col N="1279" /> by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions between the Department and the education partners.</P>
      <P>The current staffing at the school in question is a principal and two mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 57 pupils on 30 September 1998.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at the school on 30 September 1999 decreased by seven pupils to 50 pupils. Under the staffing schedule, this enrolment, which is one pupil short of the retention figure for the second mainstream class teacher, entitles the school to a principal and one mainstream class teacher for the 2000-01 school year.</P>

      <P>As a first step in this process, the Educational Research Centre recently issued a comprehensive questionnaire to all primary schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy.

      <P>A formal application for the recognition of a multi-denominational school in Swords, County Dublin, was submitted to my Department earlier this year. This application was being processed in my Department until recently, when the promoters of the school indicated that, because of difficulties in securing suitable temporary accommodation, it had been decided to postpone the opening of the school to September 2001.</P>
      <P>However, the promoters contacted my Department again yesterday, 28 June 2000, to say that a site had been identified on which it is proposed to locate prefabricated accommodation.</P>
      <P>In the light of this latest development, my Department will renew its consideration of the application. It will be necessary, among other things, to assess the suitability of the proposed site once the promoters have furnished the relevant details. In the event that the site is suitable, the promoters will be required to obtain planning permission for the temporary accommodation. In the circumstances, it is very unlikely at this stage that all necessary arrangements will be in place to enable the school to commence operation next September.</P>
      <P>Before I can consider granting permanent recognition, I must be satisfied that, among other things, the school is likely to have a viable future.</P>

      <P>My Department does not have precise information on the total number of pupils in Waterford who have been diagnosed as having autism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under present arrangements, children with autism have access to a range of special educational support services. The precise nature of the support provided will depend on the severity of the condition in each individual case. These supports include resource teachers in primary <Col N="1283" /> schools, special classes in primary schools and teaching support in special schools.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently making provision for the establishment of four special classes in the Waterford area, two in special schools and two in primary schools. These classes will have the capacity to cater for a total of 24 pupils with autism.</P>
    <P>Each class, which caters for a maximum of six pupils, receives the support of a class teacher, a special needs assistant and enhanced capitation. In addition, the relevant health authority provides an outreach support service.</P>
    <P>My Department's inspectorate will be keeping the education provision for pupils with autism in the Waterford area under review. The need to provide additional supports for the pupils in question will be considered in this context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As matters stand there are no formalised reporting arrangements covering suspensions and this makes it difficult to estimate the full extent of the problem with any precision.</P>
      <P>School managerial authorities are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules and procedures, is drawn up and applied in schools. Circumstances vary from one school community to another, and therefore it would not be appropriate for me to set out a formal and detailed code of behaviour for all schools. However, my Department has issued guidelines to assist schools in discharging their responsibilities in this area. The guidelines outline the general principles to be followed in drawing up and implementing a code of behaviour in schools and which stress the need to regard both suspension and expulsion as sanctions of last resort.</P>
      <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999, currently before the Houses will, when enacted, require schools for the first time to prepare codes of behaviour which specify the types of behaviour requiring disciplinary measures, the nature of these measures and the procedures to be followed by school authorities. The code is to be prepared in accordance with guidelines which may be issued by the National Education Welfare Board that is to be established under the provisions of the Bill. The focus of the national authority will be the provision of assistance and support, through locally based educational welfare officers, to schools and families. The Bill also includes specific measures for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of the school system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> The enactment of the Bill together with the implementation of the Education Act, 1998, will introduce a new legislative framework for dealing with school discipline issues generally and provide an opportunity to update existing guidelines where necessary.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently in the process of planning to extend the range of data gathered as part of the development of a comprehensive database on individual primary school pupils. The new database will provide critical information to support the implementation of policies and will also provide data for research and policy development purposes.</P>
      <P>At present, my Department does not have a comprehensive database on pupils in the primary school sector and, unfortunately therefore, the information sought by the Deputy is not available.</P>
      <P>The development of a database on all primary school pupils is a very significant undertaking involving the collection and processing of information on 450,000 pupils from more than 3,300 primary schools. It will take at least three years to put the full database in place and an allocation of £4.5 million has been provided for this purpose over the next three years, including £500,000 in the current year.</P>
      <P>The IT unit of my Department is currently preparing a development plan for the project and it is intended to implement a first phase in a pilot group of schools during the coming school year.</P>
      <P>In addition the Deputy may also be aware that the Education (Welfare) Bill, which is today being considered on Report Stage in the other House, will provide a new framework to address school attendance. The Bill provides for the establishment of a National Educational Welfare Board, with a general responsibility to ensure that &ldquo;each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a prescribed minimum education&rdquo;. The legislation makes specific provision to track the attendance of all children at first and second-level, and particularly in the transition between first and second level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation also provides a specific support structure, through educational welfare officers, to address in a structured manner, the problem of early school leaving. Educational welfare officers will be responsible for supporting students who exhibit patterns of irregular attendance at school. <Col N="1287" /> The officers will seek to identify underlying problems causing such irregular attendance, and to support and assist students towards a pattern of regular attendance.</P>

      <Quest>if his Department keeps a record of the number of schools who rely on CE schemes for the purpose of caretaking or secretarial staff; if so, the number or proportion of schools who fall into this category; his strategy, if any, to meet the needs of these schools in the context of the reduction in the number of CE workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As responsibility for the operation of the community employment schemes in schools rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, my Department does not have a record of the number of schools who have the services of secretarial or caretaking staff under such schemes. However, officials from my Department are in discussions with their counterparts in that Department regarding this issue. In general, I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to the provision by my Department of additional assistance to schools for secretarial and caretaking services.</P>
      <P>At primary level, my Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking and secretarial services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of caretakers and clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. However, this scheme has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. As the Deputy is aware, I recently announced that, with effect from September of this year, I will be extending the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I will be setting a minimum grant of £2,400 which will be payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These improvements mean that with effect from September 2000 all primary schools will be receiving an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999 has increased this year <Col N="1288" /> to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    <P>At second level, the assistance provided by my Department towards the provision of caretaking and secretarial services reflects the different school management and ownership arrangements at this level.</P>
    <P>In the case of voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme, all schools with 200 or more pupils receive financial assistance towards the cost of both caretaking and secretarial services under the PESP scheme. There are also a number of secondary schools in the 1978 scheme for the employment of clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary.</P>
    <P>In the case of vocational schools and colleges, caretaking and clerical staff are allocated to vocational education committees on a scheme wide basis. It is a matter for the vocational education committee to deploy staff in the best manner possible to meet the needs of the committee and its schools.</P>
    <P>All schools in the community and comprehensive school sector have been provided with clerical and caretaking services.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am satisfied that my recent announcement of the introduction of a school services support fund at second level from next September is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. Schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to second level schools each year. The flexibility given to schools under this initiative will be supported by the putting in place of guidelines, which will strike the right balance between allowing a reasonable level of discretion and achieving the implementation of national policy priorities.</P>

      <P>There have been various initiatives put in place over the years intended to tackle educational disadvantage. In general, they have been limited and have not achieved, or sought to achieve, an impact throughout the system. It has been shown time and again that resources will not, by themselves, solve the impact of educational disadvantage. New approaches are <Col N="1289" /> required and there must be an openness to change.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I am currently implementing a £194 million three year multi-sectoral programme to offset educational disadvantage that will provide specific supports for early education, primary, post-primary and third levels of the formal system as well as life-long and continuing education. The supports will target people at risk of, or who are experiencing educational disadvantage. The supports will also be provided to those with poor levels of literacy skills as well as people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The Breaking the Cycle of Disadvantage scheme is a five year pilot project. It began in September 1996 in 33 urban and 123 rural schools that have high concentrations of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. The project is being evaluated by the Educational Research Centre in Drumcondra. Interim reports on each of the two dimensions of Breaking the Cycle have now been received in my Department and are under consideration. I propose to wait until nearer to the end of the pilot project in June 2001 and receipt of the final evaluation report before making any further plans in relation to this initiative.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a White Paper on Early Childhood Education was launched late last year. The principal objective of this White Paper is &ldquo;to support the development and educational achievement of children through high quality early education, with particular focus on the target groups of disadvantaged pupils and those with special needs&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The White Paper sets out a comprehensive early education strategy in respect of children who are disadvantaged. A key element of this strategy will involve continued support and improvement to existing programmes, including Early Start. This strategy will be informed by the outcome of evaluations carried out in relation to the Early Start programme and the need to ensure the development of best practice for early childhood education for disadvantaged pupils. Initial planning for implementation of the recommendations made in the White Paper, including proposals concerning children who are disadvantaged, is currently under way in my Department.</P>

      <P>Information in relation to the participation of different socio-economic groups in third-level education is not available on a current basis. However, the fourth in the series of national surveys of entrants to higher education, which has been carried out at six year intervals by Professor Patrick Clancy of UCD, on behalf of the Higher Education Authority, is expected to be published shortly.</P>
      <P>This series, which was last published by the Higher Education Authority in November 1995 &ndash; Access to College: Patterns of Continuity and Change &ndash; aims to describe the pattern of participation in higher education in Ireland, including the social background of entrants to higher education.</P>
      <P>The main analysis of the social background of entrants is based on the occupations of parents classified into one of the 11 socio-economic groups used in the census of population. The study has been based primarily on an analysis of personal, demographic and educational data, which were abstracted from individual student records, both from the colleges and from the CAO, supplemented by a direct approach to the new entrants in order to obtain data on their socio-economic background. The research is undertaken in conditions of the strictest confidentiality.</P>
      <P>The 1995 survey, based on data for 1980, 1986 and 1992, found large disparities by socio-economic group in access to higher education. Notwithstanding the persistence of high levels of socio-economic group inequality, the survey revealed that a significant reduction in inequality had occurred over the period.</P>
      <P>The 1995 survey gave the following data in relation to participation ratios in respect of higher education entrants in 1992:</P>

    <P>The participation ratio is calculated by applying the percentage of entrants from a particular grouping to the percentage of the national population of a specific age cohort in the grouping.</P>
    <P>A number of measures are in place at third-level to tackle educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" /> A disadvantaged fund was introduced by my Department in 1994. This comprises two main elements, namely (i) the student assistance-access fund for third level institutions and (ii) the special fund for students with disabilities. The student assistance access fund provides financial support to disadvantaged students who might otherwise, because of financial reasons suffer severe hardship or be unable to continue their third level studies. The amounts allocated to this fund have increased from £120,000 in 1994 to £1,296,000 in 1999.</P>
    <P>In addition, the third level colleges have developed initiatives to tackle the problem of access for disadvantaged students to third level education through targeted funding provided to the universities by the higher education authority and funding from within the overall financial allocations to the institutes of technology. These initiatives involve links with second level schools and local communities.</P>
    <P>Since 1996, the Higher Education Authority has provided funding for initiatives in a number of universities, including an initiative specifically related to improving the participation of socially and economically disadvantaged school leavers. Funding for this measure has increased from £260,000 in 1996 to £785,000 in 1999. The Higher Education Authority has commissioned Dr. Bob Osborne of the University of Ulster to undertake an evaluation of this initiative and I understand that his report will be published by the Higher Education Authority shortly.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Points System, in its final report, published in 1999, made a number of recommendations in relation to disadvantaged students. The principal recommendation is that the quota for disadvantaged students in third level education should be increased to 5% of the intake into third level education. It further recommends that the longer term aspiration should be to increase the percentage of disadvantaged young people in third level education so that it would reflect more accurately their proportion in the population as a whole. The report of the commission is currently being considered by my officials and planning for an implementation strategy is under way.</P>
    <P>As part of the Government's wider strategy for social inclusion, a comprehensive £194 million plan to tackle educational disadvantage was launched in December 1999. The National Development Plan 2000-2006 establishes education as a key priority of Government. The plan provides for a third level access fund totalling £95 million. Building on the existing arrangements, the development of third level access is necessary to promote the participation of students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; students.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies may be aware the staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the <Col N="1293" /> enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between this Department and the education partners.</P>
    <P>The details of the staffing arrangements for a particular year are outlined in circulars issued by my Department. The details of the staffing schedule for the 2000-01 school year are outlined in circular 10/00. The terms of the schedule are outlined in that circular with regard to the appointment and retention of teachers in primary schools. Additional staff are provided in areas of disadvantage or special need. These are not affected by the terms of the guidelines agreed and set out in the circular.</P>
    <P>I regret that the staffing resources necessary to compile the information as requested in relation to area partnerships are not available.</P>
    <P>I intend allocating additional resources next September to primary schools where there are young people at risk of educational disadvantage. Differing levels of interventions will include extra teacher support and/or extra funding which reflect the levels of need identified. Also, within this new approach, schools that are designated as serving areas of disadvantage will retain supports they already have and may be eligible for additional help.</P>
    <P>My Department is fully engaged in the work of progressing the national anti-poverty strategy, &ndash; NAPS &ndash; which includes specific targets in relation to tackling educational disadvantage. These targets are consistent with the many initiatives in place at all levels of the education system aimed at addressing educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>My Department, in consultation with the NAPS unit of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and in accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, is currently making arrangements for a detailed review and revision, where appropriate, of the existing NAPS targets.</P>

    <P>However, as the Deputy may be aware, the staffing schedule for primary schools for a par<Col N="1294" /> ticular school year is determined following consultation with the managerial authorities and the INTO. Accordingly, the terms of the schedule as outlined in the relevant circulars issued by my Department must be adhered to.</P>
    <P>I should point out that, apart from mainstream staffing, my Department provides additional teaching resources to address the needs of pupils in schools designated as disadvantaged. Furthermore, I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority and will shortly be bringing forward proposals for a major initiative in this area. I am currently finalising a new £194 million three year programme to address educational disadvantage by allocating significant financial and personnel resources to schools with pupils at risk of disadvantage.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I fully appreciate the impact that the loss of a teaching post can have on a school. In that context I would remind the Deputy that I have implemented further improvements in the staffing schedule this year. As a consequence of these improvements many schools, which otherwise would have lost teaching posts, were enabled to retain their existing staffing levels. In addition, several schools gained entitlement to additional teaching posts. However, despite these improvements, the fall in enrolments in some schools was such that they were unable to benefit from the improvements in the staffing schedule.</P>
      <P>I should add that I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority and will shortly be bringing forward proposals for a major initiative to address the needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage in the primary system. I am currently finalising a new £194 million three year programme to address educational disadvantage by allocating significant financial and personnel resources to schools with at risk pupils.</P>

The wide-ranging work programme includes representing the Department on the interdepartmental policy committee on the national anti-poverty strategy jointly led by the Departments of the Taoiseach and Social Community and Family Affairs; national steering committee for the integrated services process and fulfilling the co-ordination role for the process on behalf of the Department; and interdepartmental policy group on the national drugs strategy to which the national drugs strategy team reports.</P>
      <P>In addition the section co-ordinates material for the cabinet committee on social inclusion, maintains links with the national education co-ordinator for area partnerships based in area development management; prepares the Department annual NAPS report, represents the Department on the Dublin Inner City Partnership and other committees as required; acts in a liaison role for the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, acts in a liaison role in support of the work of the Minister of State with responsibility for Children, Deputy Hanafin.</P>
      <P>The unit will also play an important role in the work of establishing and supporting the educational disadvantage committee under the terms of the Education Act, 1998.</P>
      <P>The unit does not have a specific budget. Programme budgets to tackle educational disadvantage are channelled through the various divisions of the Department at first, second, further and third levels and youth affairs section.</P>
      <P>The current staffing levels are: one principal officer, one assistant principal officer, one shared assistant principal officer, who has other duties in the area of youth affairs, one higher executive officer and one clerical officer. It is proposed to strengthen the staffing levels in the unit in the near future.</P>

      <P>There are, currently, three national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; psychologists assigned to County Kildare.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission has now completed the process of selecting additional suitably qualified psychologists for appointment to NEPS as part of the planned expansion of the service. Approximately 50 additional psychologists have been selected in this current phase and I have already approved the appointment of 25 of these psychologists.</P>
      <P>When the current selection and appointment process has been completed, nearly 100 psychologists will be in post, doubling the present number of psychologists in NEPS. As this is half the eventual target of 200 psychologists, by the end of this year there will be a marked improvement in the level of service being offered by NEPS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall allocation of psychologists to regions will be largely based on the projected <Col N="1297" /> student numbers in each. Priorities for expansion will be informed by the results of a survey of each county that has recently been undertaken by the NEPS psychologists. Among other things, they have investigated the level of access to psychological services apart from NEPS and this will be taken into account in the planning for expansion at local level. During the development phase of NEPS, the needs of all schools, including those in north County Kildare, will be considered when assigning new psychologists to schools.</P>

      <P>The Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund Act, 1997, facilitated the payment by Government of Exchequer moneys totalling over £280 million into the fund over a three year period 1998 to 2000. An amount of £130 million was paid into the fund in 1998, £75 million in 1999 and the balance will be paid in 2000. The fund is an innovative measure which <Col N="1298" /> is parallel and additional to the normal Estimates process. The fund contains a provision of £50 million which is targeted at research and development. The figures referred to by the Deputy represent an apportionment of the research and development element of the moneys paid into the fund in 1998 and 1999. This funding of £50 million has been incorporated within the programme for research in third level institutions launched in November 1998 which involves investment of almost £230 million in research and development. This investment will be further enhanced by the £550 million investment in research, technological development and innovation which is part of the national development plan.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" /> Under the Government of Ireland scholarships scheme, the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences awards scholarships to individual students to pursue research based graduate degrees. The number of scholars and the associated financial allocations in 1998 and 1999 were 48 scholars and 84 scholars and £0.5 million and £0.9 million respectively.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1.9 million was allocated for post-graduate awards and post-doctoral fellowships under the 1998 research programme. A total of 62 post-graduate awards and 21 post-doctoral fellowships were approved within this allocation.</P>
    <P>Under cycle 1 of the programme for research in third level institutions, 260 post-graduate awards were approved at a cost of £0.6 million in 1999 and 130 post-doctoral fellowships at a cost of £1 million.</P>
    <P>A further 16 and 24 post-doctoral fellows were assisted in 1998 and 1999, respectively, under a separate provision for post-doctoral fellowships in science at a cost of £0.2 million in 1998 and £0.3 million in 1999.</P>
    <P>Statistical information on the number of awards made by individual universities and third level institutions is not readily available. Finally, <Col N="1300" /> I would point out that students pursuing post-graduate degrees, whether on a taught basis or by research, are eligible for assistance under the various student support schemes operated under the aegis of my Department. The number of students pursuing post-graduate degrees by research who are in receipt of grants is not available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>One of my main priorities is to ensure that all levels of the education sector have adequate resources, including financial resources, <Col N="1301" /> to enable schools and colleges to effectively deliver quality education and training programmes.</P>
      <P>Each education sector has specific funding requirements which derive from the length, complexity and nature of the education-training courses being provided. Within any sector there is considerable variation in the costs of specific programmes; for example at third level technological and science programmes have higher operational costs than the programmes in humanities. This is in line with education expenditure patterns in all developed countries.</P>
      <P>In allocating resources I have paid particular attention to the primary sector. The standard primary capitation grant per pupil per annum was £45 in 1996-97 whereas now it is £64 and will be increased to £71 from next January, representing an increase of approximately 60% on the 1996-97 capitation grant.</P>
      <P>Also since 1996-97 this Government has allocated 1,260 additional primary teaching posts while there was a fall in pupil enrolments of 25,000 approximately. I have decided to allocate a further 200 teaching posts from September next to tackle disadvantage in the primary sector and over the course of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will allocate a further 900 teaching posts.</P>

      <P>The teacher-counsellor project was initiated in 1995 in a number of schools in the Tallaght-Clondalkin area and in Dublin's north inner city. Teacher posts were assigned to individual schools or were shared between schools to assist in supporting pupils with very disruptive behaviours. The project was evaluated by inspectors of my Department in March 1998.</P>
      <P>As a result of the evaluation the title of the project was changed to the support teacher project and a revised specification for the role of the teachers involved was introduced in January 1999. This was done to reflect, more accurately, the teachers' qualifications and skills in helping children's development. It reflects the work they do in each of the schools in support of a small group of pupils who display the most disruptive, disturbed or withdrawn behaviours at any given time. The support teachers also have a specific role in supporting the development of school policy in relation to children's behaviours and formulating management strategies for the support of children experiencing behavioural difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 42 support teachers currently serving 48 schools and a project co-ordinator was <Col N="1302" /> appointed in January 2000 to work with the support teachers and school staffs.</P>
    <P>While there are no immediate plans to extend the project to additional schools, I intend keeping this matter under review in the context of the allocation of resources to schools following the recent survey of concentrations in certain schools of children from disadvantaged backgrounds. I am also mindful, in this context, of the allocation of resources to schools under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

The support teacher supplements the teaching normally provided by the subject teacher, acts as a resource person for other teaching staff, liaises with parents and, when required, with helping agencies.</P>
      <P>Training courses for support teachers at second level are provided in: Church of Ireland College of Education, Dublin; National University of Ireland, Cork; National University of Ireland, Galway; National University of Ireland, Dublin; Mary Immaculate College of Education, Limerick; and St. Angela's College of Education, Sligo.</P>
      <P>The courses provided in the above institutions are for persons who are already qualified as teachers and each course lasts for an academic year.</P>
      <P>In addition, many shorter in-career development courses for learning support teachers are supported by my Department. These are provided mainly through the network of education centres, and also by teachers' organisations.</P>

      <P>In September 1999 the remedial teaching service was extended to all primary schools with a pupil-teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil-teacher ratios were advised that they could seek remedial support <Col N="1303" /> where they could demonstrate a need for such a service.</P>
      <P>All available posts were utilised in the current school year to ensure that no primary school in the country should be without a remedial teaching service.</P>
      <P>However, I can assure the Deputy that the remedial needs of the pupils in the school in question will be fully considered in the event of additional resources becoming available to improve existing remedial services.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the application in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The educational needs of pupils with specific learning disability, including dyslexia, are gener<Col N="1304" /> ally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the assistance, where appropriate, of the remedial teacher service.</P>
    <P>Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability.</P>
    <P>Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, the provision is made in one of four special schools and 11 special classes dedicated to such children. These special facilities operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 11:1.</P>
    <P>My Department's inspectorate is currently examining the application for teaching support from the school referred to by the Deputy to cater for the needs of the pupils in question.</P>
    <P>When this investigation is completed officials in my Department will be in contact with the school authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is planned to provide entirely new accommodation for the student community of Coláiste Einde. This decision was taken because the estimated cost of refurbishing the existing accommodation, when compared with the cost of providing new accommodation, represents poor value for money. Additionally, the existing accommodation exceeds that which is required resulting in ongoing maintenance problems for that area not required for school purposes. A further consideration in this matter relates to the difficulties of adapting the existing accommodation to meet modern room layouts and standards.</P>
      <P>The management authority of the school has been fully consulted in this matter. It is planned to advertise for the appointment of a design team to commence the architectural planning process shortly in compliance with normal public procurement procedures.</P>
