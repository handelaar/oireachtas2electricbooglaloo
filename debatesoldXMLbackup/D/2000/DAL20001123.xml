      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic I received notice from Deputies Quinn and Jim Higgins. I call first on Deputy Quinn to state his matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31 I wish to give notice of my intention on the Order of Business today to seek to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring truly urgent attention: the need for the Government to seek a settlement of the dispute with taxi drivers to bring to an end all vehicle blockades at Dublin Airport and elsewhere and to ensure the free movement of all our citizens.</P>

        <b>:</b> I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the ongoing transport paralysis in Dublin and other parts of the country arising from the protests by taxi drivers and the suspension of all mainline rail services for the second successive day, with the prospect of a three day rail strike next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 46, National Stud (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, resumed; No. 7, Youth Work Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; and No. 47, Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, resumed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste agree the way in which ordinary commuters are being treated by the providers of public transport is appalling and that public transport under the Government is a shambolic monopoly which is not working and which the Government has shown particular unwillingness to confront, especially in the delay in dealing with the taxi issue for three and a half years? Does she further agree there are some who question whether the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, who has at last on behalf of the Government taken a decision on this matter, has the support of all his senior colleagues in the ministerial hierarchy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same topic, is the Government prepared at this stage to enter into negotiations with the representatives of the taxi drivers to bring about some resolution to the blockade across Dublin? A decision has been made, which has been welcomed by all of us in terms of the increase at last in the number of taxis. but the manner in which it was made was seriously undemocratic and contrary to the spirit of social partnership that has animated all the Government's press releases. There is an urgent need to get the blockade off the streets and that will come about if negotiations are entered into by representatives of the Government and taxi drivers. I urge the Tánaiste to open those negotiations as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the frustration expressed by Deputies Bruton and Quinn in regard to the ongoing blockade by taxi drivers and I hope it can be brought to an end quickly because it is discommoding, inconveniencing and causing great hardship to the public. With regard to negotiations, a decision has been made. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, is happy to hold dis<Col N="1099" /> cussions with taxi representatives but negotiations are not in order because a decision has been made and it will be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste agree that road blockades are not a legitimate form of industrial relations action, that they are illegal and impermissible and should not be the basis for negotiation or resolution, and that the House should clearly say that blockades should stop? Will she comment on suggestions by some taxi drivers, which may not have been authorised, that they will not pick up disabled people even though their taxis are adapted for disabled people as a means of protesting against the Government decision? Does the Tánaiste agree that any form of targeting of disabled people in that fashion in an industrial dispute is unacceptable and ought to be condemned with equal strength as one should condemn the blocking of roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is disgraceful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste agree that while a decision has been made in respect of this matter, much of the detail of the decision and how it will be implemented has yet to be finalised or communicated adequately to the people directly affected? No other group in this country has had its livelihood altered in such a dramatic and precipitous way. This group is at least entitled to discussions in respect of the implementation of that decision and I urge the Tánaiste to contact SIPTU, which negotiates on behalf of some taxi drivers, to begin negotiations today so that the blockade can be ended voluntarily by the people carrying it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton that the blockades are illegal. Everybody is entitled in a democracy to protest but they are not entitled to engage in blockades such as those we have witnessed over the past two days. I have total confidence that the Garda will implement the law without fear or favour and I believe that is already under way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind Deputy Quinn that no one is taking anyone's livelihood away. There is more than enough work for all existing taxi drivers and many more in Dublin, as he knows well. There is no question of livelihoods being taken away. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has announced his intentions regarding the £15,000 licence fee that was paid. The people of Dublin <Col N="1100" /> have been frustrated for many years as a result of indecision in this area. We now have a decision and the Government&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision will be implemented. If the blockade is called off, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, will be happy to have discussions, but not negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the fact that at last a decision has been made but we deplore the manner in which it was made. It has resulted in chaos but it can be resolved very quickly by opening up discussions today with the representatives of the taxi men and women to clarify the implementation of the decision and to fill in details which are not apparent to the people directly affected by them. That is all I ask.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Tánaiste had a number of questions to answer, but she omitted to answer one of my questions which concerned statements by some taxi representatives that they would not take a single disabled person unless they were satisfied with the Government's decision. Does the Tánaiste agree that is not an acceptable means of promoting any cause, does <Col N="1101" /> damage and should be condemned? Will she make clear on behalf of the Government and the House that that type of comment should not be made? I have no doubt it was not a representative comment but it was made publicly, could be construed as representative and should be condemned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I deplore any threats of that nature or the private threats made to some individuals in the House. Everyone would have to deplore that type of behaviour. It is not acceptable. If the law is upheld and the blockade is called off, there will not be any difficulty in having discussions.</P>

      <P>What is the position of the disabilities Bill which sets out the rights of persons with disabilities and which I understand is to be brought before the House some time next year? Will the Tánaiste ensure it is fast tracked and that any inclusion in it to ensure disabled persons have an equal right to access to taxis is put in place so that there is a firm legislative response to the remarks to which Deputy Boylan drew the attention of the House?</P>

      <P>In light of the discussion we have had, and I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle's facilitation of it, will the Government recognise the necessity for the regulations to be published in full, that is, those which will come in under the necessary legislation under which they operate? Will the Government give an undertaking that the regulations will be debated in the House so that all the concerns surrounding the implementation of the decision can be fully discussed and debated in the House? That would serve a very useful purpose. Will the Government give positive consideration to that as a matter of urgency?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment of the debate on 14 November, I was speaking about the new agreement that has been put in place for the governance of the thoroughbred sector and the racing industry generally. I am pleased agreement has finally been reached and has the support of all parties involved. The Minister will not be surprised to hear me say that some of the parties are not 100% happy with the arrangements, but it is not always possible to ensure that. It is important, however, that the strength of the views expressed by people who work in the industry, rather than those who work in governance, was taken into account by the relevant interests. That expression of support by the industry for a resolution of the outstanding issues was very useful and certainly helped to concentrate minds and bring the matter to a conclusion.</P>
      <P>I look forward, therefore, to a new phase of successful development of racing for the enjoyment of punters, without whom the industry would not exist, as well as for the continued success of our breeders, trainers and owners. The industry generally is to be complimented on having taken a constructive and forward step.</P>
      <P>I have one reservation about the new structure being put in place. On the last occasion we debated the Bill, I referred to the correspondents of the racing press who seem to have a very odd interpretation of the views they attribute to me. I would like them to take this view accurately into consideration, however. The controlling board of the new authority which will govern racing will be composed of a maximum of 13 people, but it is wrong that it will not include any voice for the punter. It seems absolutely nonsensical that we should embark on what I hope will be a new phase of development in the racing industry, yet the 13-member board will be composed of every interest except the punter's. The Minister should know perfectly well &ndash; as does my colleague, Deputy McGahon, who has just joined me &ndash;  that this industry could not exist without the punters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If we did not have people who like to watch horseracing and bet on it, we would not have an industry. Yet, we have a governing board which has no specific representation for punters. This is absolutely crazy. Punters are the final consumers of the product of the industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have to bring forward legislation to give effect to the new structure. While I look forward to seeing and going through it with him, I urge the Minister, in preparing the legislation, to remedy this serious deficiency in the structure of the board. I ask him to take this matter seriously. I do not like to criticise people who are not in the House and do not have an opportunity to defend themselves, but let me say in the most neutral way I can that previous provisions for the representation of punters in the old regime were very far from satisfactory. Rather arbitrary choices were made and I am not satisfied that the interests of punters were represented. I will not say any more; the Minister knows exactly what I mean. There is an opportunity to remedy this in the legislation.</P>
      <P>While I know an agreement has been made that there will be a maximum of 13 on the board and that, unwisely, an agreement has been made by the Ministers as to who they will be and from where they will be drawn, they do not include punters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see reasonable representation. I do not want to see a proposal in the Bill under which the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and-or the Minister for Finance will designate persons. No, there are other places to where one can go to look for representatives of punters. If one had a ballot at a decent race course, one would get good representatives of punters who would bring the specific dimension that they have in mind to the work of governing the industry. It should not be forgotten that at the end of the day punters are the consumers of the product of the industry and that it could not exist without them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same connection, breeders, trainers and owners will, ultimately, benefit from an improvement in the facilities available to punters at race courses. As the Minister, probably, knows better than I do because he enjoys them more often <Col N="1109" /> than I do &ndash; best of luck to him &ndash; there are a number of race courses where very substantial improvements have been made in recent years in the level of facilities available to punters. I am sure the Minister will agree there is nothing to match the Curragh. Punchestown has been hugely improved in recent years. Leopardstown makes a good fist of being a top class race course and venue. Cork race course or Mallow, as some of the old-fashioned among us prefer to call it, has also been hugely improved in recent years.</P>
    <P>While I agree there has been a good deal of investment to make the circumstances of life easier and more congenial for punters at many race courses, I know the Minister will agree that there are still a great many race courses where it would be a kindness to describe the facilities for punters as rudimentary. There are places where one has to be really dedicated to enjoy one's day at the races. There are a good many race courses where the basic facilities which punters need &ndash; without specifying it any further, all the normal amenities of life, including the opportunity to get something to eat or drink &ndash; are a good deal less than satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I hope the new authority will turn its attention to these issues and that we will see as rapidly as possible an improvement in conditions at the race courses concerned. We cannot, unfortunately, always bank on having good weather at the races. I have enjoyed racing at race courses where the facilities are a wee bit rudimentary on a nice day. On a fine day none of us minds being out in the elements; it is when the weather is inclement that the quality of the facilities becomes particularly important. I hope this will be a priority item for the work of the new governing body advised by good, articulate and representative spokespersons on behalf of punters without whom, I insist, the industry could not exist.</P>
    <P>The industry has made great progress in recent years. I am delighted that year after year the Irish racing industry generally, in all its facets, adds to its reputation. I hope this new governance system will help to maintain its progress. I look forward to seeing the legislation.</P>
    <P>I support the provisions of the Bill. I am glad it has been brought forward. I hope the Minister will take account of the few suggestions I have made for amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. I hope, in particular, that the Minister and the Minister for Finance will get rid of the excessively bureaucratic concern with always having the right to second guess the board of the National Stud on important issues and drop from the Bill the unnecessary provision under which the two Ministers will be able to keep looking over the shoulder of the National Stud if they are of the view it will make a substantial amount of money from the sale of property. This is important. I am sure it is bound to happen some time within the course of development, but if it is felt that all or a large part of the lands currently held by the National Stud should be sold &ndash; on which pressures will be exerted from surrounding develop<Col N="1110" /> ment &ndash; and it looks as if it will make a large amount of money, as foreseen by the Bill, I would want the Ministers to bear in mind that the land will have to be replaced, that new yards will have to be built and all the other facilities that go with the stud will have to be installed. A move in those circumstances would, obviously, make it much more difficult to run an integrated operation with the Japanese Garden. It would also be expensive and create a new situation. The Ministers, therefore, should not retain the opportunity to interfere in this unnecessarily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which is straightforward. It aims to update the statutory framework under which the National Stud currently operates. As a Deputy for south Kildare, I am only too well aware of the enormous contribution the National Stud makes, internationally, nationally and locally. Like many other Members, I am an ardent supporter of its work. I take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister, who is a strong supporter of the equine industry and his officials on the publication of the legislation.</P>
      <P>I will not dwell too long on the details of the Bill, the background to which the Minister has explained as well as the reasoning behind each section. Section 2 deals with the lands from which the National Study currently operates and changes the existing arrangements whereby these lands are held on licence from the Minister by transferring them to the National Stud. This is a welcome move. The Bill includes safeguards which require ministerial consent for the sale of any lands and provides for a dividend for the Exchequer in such a scenario. This is a sensible and logical section as the practice of holding land on licence introduced a degree of uncertainty. I am pleased this is being dealt with.</P>
      <P>Sections 4 and 6 are complementary and enable the National Stud to increase investment in its core facilities in Kildare and in other ventures into which it may enter. I strongly support the provision in section 6 to increase the upper borrowing limit from £5 million to £20 million. This will enable the National Stud to plan for the future and enter into exciting commercial developments over the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad section 5 makes explicit reference to tourist-related activities that are now an intrinsic part of the National Stud in Kildare town. The National Stud, the Japanese Gardens and the new garden are three major attractions in Kildare and the development of these facilities over recent years has been of great benefit to the local economy and that of the county. The National Stud is now a vital part of the tourism infrastructure in Kildare and has developed this role in partnership with the local community, county councils and public representatives. It is a role that has the full support of the people in Kildare and I am anxious to see this partnership develop. It would be remiss of me not to compliment the staff under the manager, John Clarke, and everyone involved with the development of the facilities at the stud. <Col N="1111" /> There have been major improvements to the infrastructure. The presentation of the area is exceptional and augurs well for the future. The design and creation of the new gardens together with the car parking and dining facilities have made this an obvious tourist attraction. If you pass by it any day of the week you will see that bus tours include it on their itineraries That is welcome.</P>
    <P>The presence of the National Stud and its engagement in tourism activities in recent years has brought great economic benefit to Kildare town. Unfortunately, Kildare town, like other parts of my constituency, has suffered from the closure of traditional industries. Unemployment is still a significant problem and the direct and indirect jobs created by tourism are crucial to Kildare town and its hinterland. I look forward to the development of the tourism role played by the National Stud and the increased borrowing facility under the Bill that will give it freedom to enter into joint ventures will be beneficial.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with an important aspect of the horse industry. This is an important and growing industry and I hope the Minister will reply to the points I make. Concern has been expressed by a number of small horse breeders regarding the new foal levy introduced in July. I would appreciate it if the Minister would indicate how this levy was applied in the first six months of its application. Small breeders are convinced that the restructuring of the levy will result in them paying more under the new scheme. They may well have a case and if their suspicions are correct, I hope the Minister will move to restructure this levy so the small players in this industry will get a fair crack of the whip. A related issue is the representation of small breeders at national level. The Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association is an effective and constructive lobby. However, it does not represent all breeders, particularly those who operate on a small basis. These breeders often feel excluded from negotiations at national level. I do not believe this is healthy for the industry. I urge the Minister to encourage such breeders to establish an effective organisation that would ensure the views of smaller and part-time breeders are fully ventilated.</P>
    <P>This is important as the Department is currently working on legislation to restructure horse racing following from the recent understanding reached between the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Minister for Finance and the Turf Club. As a great supporter of the racing industry, I am glad the unseemly row between the Government and the Turf Club has been resolved. The agreement reached provides a solid base for the racing industry to develop. I await, with interest, the legislation that will be introduced.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dukes stated in regard to Kildare, we have seen the benefit of the financial input made by the Government of the day into the three courses in Kildare. Punchestown has <Col N="1112" /> developed into a racetrack that can rival anything in the UK. Further developments there have made it into a major attraction that will challenge Cheltenham as the Mecca for national hunt racing. That is welcome. The recent restructuring at Naas was badly needed. The management has put a wonderful facility in place for the punter. Management at the Curragh want to improve facilities there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>However, we do not seem to be able to attract the numbers to Punchestown and Naas that visit the National Stud. The Mecca of track racing, the Curragh, does not attract the crowds that one would expect. There may be a bumper crowd on one or two occasions but given the facilities there, attendance is small. It does not lead to attractive fields or to the punter getting value for money when account is taken of the entrance fee and so on. The Minister should look at that and see what can be done to increase attendance at the Curragh. Deputy Power also knows that there would be a larger crowd at any rural race course than there is at a meeting in the Curragh. The Minister is aware of that as he is in attendance at any meeting I have attended there, supporting the cause. It may be that it is difficult when you have true thoroughbreds to get numbers for the particular races. At the end of the day, the punter wants to be able to gamble and get value for money. If in an eight race card there are small fields and the prices are not good, punters will not attend. The advantage of the national hunt is that there may be 20 or 30 horses in every race and you get value for the money you put on. Perhaps the Minister will indicate the Department's and Turf Club's thinking on this issue.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will comment on the enforcement of the minimum wage legislation in the industry. I know the vast majority of stud owners, trainers and breeders pay their workers a fair wage. It must be accepted that, in the past, a small number of operators abused the dedication of young people by paying them very poorly. Unrepresented by a trade union and anxious to make a career in the industry these workers were often left open to abuse. Now that there is minimum wage legislation I would appreciate it if the Minister would assure the House that the scandal of law pay is a thing of the past in the horse industry and that inspections carried out by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment confirm this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister comment on the tax free status that applies to stallion fees? As a representative for south Kildare I know only too well the benefit of this fiscal incentive to the horse industry and I would argue strongly for its retention. <Col N="1113" /> However, I understand that at present the tax incentive means that returns regarding the operation of these businesses do not need to be made to the authorities. This situation gives cause for concern and flies in the face of the new corporate enforcement regime which the Government is intent on introducing. I am in favour of the retention of zero rating but it would be in the interests of the industry if this sector were required to make returns to the authorities so there can be a clear picture regarding the turnover and profitability of the industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It updates and reforms the legislation under which the National Stud currently operates and this is a welcome development. I particularly welcome the recognition in the Bill of the key role the National Stud plays in the tourism industry and I sincerely hope the management of the stud will use the new borrowing and joint venture facility to enhance its role in this vital industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is straightforward. The Minister outlined his plans recently and they are to increase the share capital of the company from £10 million to £25 million and to increase its borrowing powers from £5 million to £20 million. This is necessary and will allow the stud to purchase top class stallions, the secret of the stud's continued success. Its record in this regard has been excellent in recent years and the House should give the stud every opportunity to continue that success.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed to allow the National Stud purchase and sell land, subject to the consent of the Minister. As the Minister, Deputy Walsh, explained last week, some of the land owned by the stud will be required for the Kildare bypass so the stud will have to dispose of it. I would be happier if the stud were given a freer hand to deal with these matters. We are lucky to have a Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and a Minister for Finance who are interested in the racing industry but that will not always be so. I do not expect them to leave office in the near future but&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;we have to look to the long-term.</P>
      <P>The racing industry is important for most people in County Kildare. Apart from providing employment to many families throughout the county, it is a great leisure resource. My family is particularly fond of the National Stud and Japanese Gardens and we visit them frequently during the year. It has become the most popular place to visit on important occasions such as birthdays, First Communions and Confirmations. That is the case for many families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House regularly criticises people or groups when things go wrong but there are few headlines to be made with good news. The story of the National Stud and Japanese Gardens is a <Col N="1114" /> good news story and it is important that its success be acknowledged. We should thank the management and workers who have contributed to this success. The stud and gardens are a great tourist attraction and will continue to be because the management has been progressive and innovative. In recent years it has continued to upgrade facilities and provide new ones. St. Fiachra's garden is an example of the wonderful progress that has been made and the tourists are responding to it. Last year there were 128,000 visitors. That figure is expected to increase this year to £145,000.</P>
    <P>The National Stud has been forward looking and progressive and we are grateful for its efforts. A proposal to build a museum of the horse is under consideration and I hope it becomes a reality. It would be an excellent attraction at the stud.</P>
    <P>The Irish bloodstock industry is well respected throughout the world. Despite Ireland's size and small population, the country has achieved extraordinary success on the international stage. We have shown a great ability to breed, train and ride the best racehorses in the world. This year will be seen as probably one of our best. It will be memorable due to the wonderful successes both on the flat and over jumps. Last March, the wonderful Istabraq won its third champion hurdle at Cheltenham. I had the pleasure of being there to witness it although I will not say that I backed the horse.</P>
    <P>Then there was the father and son combination of Ted and Ruby Walsh winning both the English and Irish Grand Nationals. Ted was honoured recently when the Minister for Finance presented him with the title of &ldquo;Kildare Person of the Year&rdquo;. People can identify with Ted Walsh. He speaks a language the people of Kildare understand and there could be no better winner of the prize. The wins in these races were followed by the great success of Sinndar, trained by John Oxx and ridden by Johnny Murtagh. They won both the English Derby and the Irish Derby and finished the season by winning the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, a feat not previously achieved.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Sinndar's owner, the Aga Khan. He did not need the prize money and was unfortunate to put a previous derby winner, Shergar, at stud in Ireland. That horse was kidnapped &ndash; the kidnapping was discussed in this House the night it happened &ndash; and was never found. The Aga Khan had good reason to move his horses out of the country and to forget about Ireland but he did not. He stayed loyal to this country and, I am happy to report, he has been rewarded.</P>
    <P>Sinndar's jockey, Johnny Murtagh, had a dream year. He won ten group one races before finishing his season with a wonderful success in the Breeders Cup. This young man is a great example to people from all walks of life. He had his share of difficulties in the past but he did not give up. His trainer, John Oxx, showed tremendous faith and loyalty to him and it was wonder<Col N="1115" /> ful to see their hard work rewarded in such a marvellous way.</P>
    <P>I should probably mention the success of Members from both sides of the House who are part of a 17 member syndicate called the Grand Alliance. It is probably the only matter on which there is full agreement among them. The alliance was formed a little over two years ago and purchased a horse called Arctic Copper. It has had tremendous success in bumpers, hurdles and, lately, chases. Many Members are already making their plans for Cheltenham next year and I wish them well. Their success clearly demonstrates the wonderful fun and enjoyment that can be had from horse racing for a small outlay. Other syndicates might not enjoy the same success but horse racing is a source of great enjoyment. It is important to advertise that and encourage more syndicates to get together.</P>
    <P>There was a tradition at one time of horses running in the name of the President of Ireland. Given the wonderful success of the National Stud and its sires, this is an opportune time for horses to run in the colours of our President once again. It is a great way of advertising the racing industry and I urge the Minister to encourage the President, if she needs encouragement, to resume this practice. It would mean a great deal to the industry to see the President's colours on the race track again and I hope we will not have to wait long for it to happen.</P>
    <P>Last December the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development offered a wonderful opportunity to the racing industry. They offered to double its funding if the IHA and the Turf Club would agree to merge. While agreement has now been reached, it was not easy. Some were reluctant to accept the establishment of one body to look after racing but these fears quickly disappeared when hundreds of people, including owners, breeders, trainers, jockeys and stable staff, protested at the delay in reaching agreement. I am delighted that agreement has been reached and that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development will bring his legislative proposals before Cabinet early in the new year.</P>
    <P>The racing industry appreciates the interest shown by both Ministers. While it is welcome that the funding for the racing industry will be doubled, it is important that the money is spread evenly. Group races are important To maintain our status in world racing, we must have top class racing. It is important that the extra money provided to the industry is spread throughout it and that those in need of an injection of funds are given it. We have more than 700 licensed trainers or permit holders, many of whom will not train a winner during the year. For some it is a labour of love, but it is important we do not take that for granted. We should try to make matters as easy as possible for such trainers. Many people put a good deal of money into the industry, but we cannot assume that will continue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> Anyone involved in the racing industry will be aware of the major developments that have taken place in recent years. Prize money has increased significantly and facilities at many of the race tracks have been upgraded. There has been a realisation of the necessity to provide the customer with what he or she wants. Punters have witnessed major improvements at race tracks and no doubt this has contributed to the increase in attendances at race meetings. While I welcome the progress the industry has made, the benefits have been enjoyed by the breeders, trainers and jockeys. One sector of the industry, the stable staff, has been forgotten. Vast sums of money were spent in providing new facilities for customers at race tracks, but very little was spent on improving facilities for stable staff. Most race course managers did not care and did not want to know. Facilities for stable staff at most race tracks are not acceptable. These staff are forced to work in an environment which employees in any other industry would not tolerate. The basic facilities one would expect in employment are not available. Proper toilet and hot food facilities, particularly in winter months, are generally not available and where hot food is available, in many cases staff must pay an exorbitant price for it. That cannot continue.</P>
    <P>The Stable Staff Association was set up a little more than a year ago, following which all race tracks were asked to ensure the facilities available are of an acceptable standard. I thank particularly the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for the interest he has shown in this area. He met representatives of that association on a number of occasions and has been very helpful. On his insistence, some race tracks decided to take action, but progress has been slow. We want to ensure major improvements take place quickly.</P>
    <P>The bloodstock industry employs more than 20,000 people in the breeding, training, riding or minding of horses. If we did not have breeders, we would not have an industry. The same applies to trainers, jockeys and equally to stable staff. I look forward to the setting up of a new unified structure, Horseracing Ireland, and to a member of the stable staff taking a seat on that body.</P>
    <P>A number of serious problems require urgent attention. A serious staff shortage exists in the industry. It is difficult to attract new people to the industry and to retain them. The British bloodstock industry is experiencing similar difficulties and it decided to take action. The British Horseracing Board set up a review group, the Stable Staff Resources Study Group, under the chairmanship of Lady Burnham to examine the wider issues of stable staff recruitment. It is vital that a similar study be carried out in Ireland. Employment in the racing industry has lost much of its attractiveness. People are happier taking up other employment where better working conditions, pay and shorter working hours are much more attractive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> Many changes have taken place recently in the industry, including Sunday racing, night racing and a continuity of racing during the summer months. Those changes have placed major demands on stable staff who must leave home early in the morning and do not arrive back until late at night, get up early the next morning, ride out and then perhaps go to a race meeting. Those changes were introduced without consulting stable staff. If we want to be progressive and secure the future of the industry, it is important we do not take any sector for granted. They all play an important part in the racing industry. We cherish that industry in Kildare and throughout the country. If we are serious about it, it is important to ensure everyone concerned is given a voice in its operation.</P>
    <P>A pension fund was established in the industry some years ago and while this was a progressive move, it has not had the desired results. The qualification criteria are far too restrictive. That coupled with the industry finding it difficult to retain employees as they get older, means very few employees draw from the pension fund. Changes will have to be made in that regard, as it does not make sense to have a pension fund that is increasing in value, while fewer and fewer people draw from it.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the stable staff bonus scheme should have been a wonderful development for the racing industry. The payment of a percentage of prize money to stable staff was a good idea. It was viewed by the staff as an acknowledgement of their contribution and an opportunity to collect a few extra pounds. That scheme was introduced at the start of the summer, but it has turned out to be a disaster. Revenue decided that trainers should pay PRSI at a rate of 8.5% on the bonus, despite their having no real role in the payment. Their only role in the scheme is that of a facilitator. The agreement under which the bonus is paid is reached among the staff. The money is paid from the turf club to the yards where it is divided among the staff. The money is not sent out to the yards unless an agreement is forwarded to the turf club. Unfortunately, many of the trainers have failed to submit an agreement.</P>
    <P>The scheme was introduced and from 1 May 330 trainers or permit holders were eligible for a distribution of these moneys, but 135 of them have not collected what is required, as no agreement has been forwarded to the turf club. This is extraordinary and should not be allowed to continue. Money is lying in the turf club account that should be in the pockets of stable staff and Revenue has made a demand on the trainers that cannot be justified. I took up this with the Minister for Social Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, as the manner in which the scheme is being operated does not make sense. If it could be regularised and operated properly, it could have a very beneficial effect on <Col N="1118" /> the racing industry. It is something on which we can improve.</P>
    <P>People from Kildare are very much aware of the Race Centre set up some years ago. Its objective is to take in young people and provide them with quality training. We often read of the successes of Frankie Dettori, Michael Kinnane and Johnny Murtagh, but very few of the people who enter the industry with the intention of becoming jockeys succeed. The idea behind the setting up of the Race Centre was to provide quality training for young people who would be trained in all aspects of the bloodstock industry. While we are now experiencing an economic boom, prior to that boom, the Race Centre was able to provide employment for all of its trainees on completion of their training, something very few other bodies could claim. Consideration is being given to the setting up of a farrier school at the Race Centre. The Minister has taken an interest in that and the Taoiseach visited the centre recently. I ask them to be as helpful as possible in ensuring the school is set up. Anyone involved in the racing industry will realise the necessity for farriers. It is a trade and a skill we should not lose.</P>
    <P>I compliment all those involved in the Race Centre for their tremendous dedication. Many older people who have retired from the industry give of their time and wisdom to the young people. That is appreciated by those young people and their parents.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister and the Minister for Finance for their interest in the industry. I do not want to be one-sided and Deputy Dukes contributed earlier. He has other business this afternoon.</P>

I compliment him for that. Many people might not have understood or accepted why he was being so helpful to the racing industry. We are fortunate to have Members who are interested in this industry. Perhaps some take too much of an interest in it but there is an appreciation of the importance of the industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of being under the baleful gaze of the Joe Rooks on the backbenches and must be mindful of what I say. The pride of Kildare Deputies in representing the home of the horse is <Col N="1119" /> evident in this debate. I sympathise with their lack of success in Croke Park.</P>

      <P>I wish them the best of luck and I will talk to Deputy Power about procuring likely odds. I know he has opted for politics full time. I find that hard to understand when other Deputies are getting into that lucrative business; it is a licence to print money according to John Banks.</P>
      <P>In supporting the Bill, I congratulate the Minister on his vision in promoting the Mallow project. I was opposed to that initially on the grounds that it was the worst performing track in Ireland and had waterlogging difficulties. I visited it to my cost last Sunday as a part owner. I came out a chastened man but I was heartened by what has been created. It is a lovely racecourse with tremendous facilities. I hope the people of Munster, particularly those of Cork, give it the support it deserves and I withdraw any previous criticism I made of that investment.</P>
      <P>This country can claim to lead the world in few areas but horseracing is one. The climate, which acts both as a deterrent to tourists and an incentive to Irish people to holiday abroad, is most conducive to breeding horses. Whatever is in the green grass of Ireland is a tremendous asset to the breeding industry. Deputies Wall and Power referred to the extraordinary success not just of Irish horses but of Irish jockeys. That is a source of wonder to the racing industry. Traditionally, because of stronger interests in national hunt racing, Irish jockeys dominated the English racing scene. Now we have a corresponding increase in successful flat jockeys due to Mick Kinane and Pat Eddery, the daddy of them all, who have now been joined by Willie Supple, John Egan, Sean Kelly, Neil Callan and Jamie Spencer. Any Irish jockey who shows promise and goes to England is immediately seized upon, he is guaranteed rides and success. That industry deserves the support of the Government, which had been lukewarm towards it until recently. I look forward to the new legislation which is to come before the House after Christmas.</P>
      <P>I echo Deputy Power's appreciation of the efforts and loyalty of the Aga Khan to Irish racing and to the Oxx family. I also applaud the success of the gentleman of Irish racing, John Oxx, who is so unassuming for a man who has scaled the heights of racing. In relation to loyalty, I commend John Oxx on his loyalty to Johnny Murtagh at a time when the latter's career was in the balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wall lamented the lack of support for the Curragh. The Curragh racetrack is on a par <Col N="1120" /> with those in Europe. Its facilities compare favourably with Longchamps and put Epsom in the shade. Flat racing in Ireland is not as appreciated as jumping and, as a hapless punter for over 50 years, I have often wondered why, as the element of chance is in jump racing. I need sedatives to watch steeplechasing, while specialising in bumpers and Irish form is a recipe for needing a psychiatrist. I prefer flat racing.</P>
    <P>The real cause of the lack of support for the Curragh is that it was dominated for years by Vincent O'Brien, the master of Ballydoyle, one of the world's best trainers. Unfortunately, his succession of odds-on winners at the Curragh turned many punters away. He has now been followed by another man all Ireland is proud of, Aidan O'Brien, who also dominates racing. That does not leave much for the small owner and the odds at which the Joe Rooks the books put up prices mean punters will take a chance in a 30 runner maiden hurdle rather than punting on the flat. However, the facilities and top class racing offered at the Curragh are as good as any available in Europe and it is a pity more people do not go there.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the horse racing industry would examine ways and means of broadening the appeal of flat racing to the average punter. While steeplechasing can be attractive to the bingo hunter who wants to get a little bit of money, the serious punters are identified with flat racing. The success of the entire racing industry centres on the flat racing industry because many small owners and trainers have farms and other businesses, all the serious stuff, and the money procured at Goff sales and other sales throughout the country are for top class flat racers. That is where the money is in the breeding industry.</P>
    <P>The one concern I have concerns the subsuming of the Turf Club into the new horse racing authority, which was not easily achieved. While it is a good move I would like to pay tribute to the Turf Club for its efforts over the years. From the beginning of racing in this country it did a fair job. Perhaps it has outlived its era but it certainly did a reason able job in helping the industry get established and acknowledged by racing industries throughout the world. I hope there will be a continued role for the Turf Club, albeit in a reduced area, because the new Tsars of Irish racing could be the Coolmore Stud, Mr. Magnier and, dare I say it, Mr. Brosnan, all of whom have made a major contribution to the industry but domination and monopoly is not what we want in the racing industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes also made a contribution to the racing industry and he could be termed the punter's friend for his memorable gesture. I have to take issue with Deputy Power on this one, who claimed the credit for the reduction.</P>

However, our confession resulted in a reduction of the penal tax from 20% to 10% with a consequent benefit to the Exchequer. Happy days have now arrived. There is no tax on Irish racing at the tote and, I hope the Minister Deputy McCreevy will continue his role and reduce it a little bit further or even eliminate it in the offices. While Deputy Power may have made a sizeable impression on it, it was our public confession that worked. The one disappointment that resulted from that was that I felt every bookmaker in Ireland should have a photograph of Deputy McCreevy and me up on the wall, and the occasional free bet, but that did not happen.</P>
      <P>I wish the racing industry continued success. It is great to have a racing Minister who enjoys racing. Perhaps he would like to join another syndicate at some time in the future. Deputy Bradford had an unhappy experience&mdash;</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister and his officials for bringing the Bill before the House. I am particularly pleased with its contents as one who has a long-standing interest in horses and the bloodstock industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my experience, most Irish people have an <Col N="1122" /> affinity with horses and all aspects of horse racing. The international standing of our bloodstock industry is very high, and deservedly so. That reputation is in no small part due to the consistently high profile and name for quality and excellence enjoyed by our National Stud. That is a great achievement for a small nation. Our horses and jockeys are excellent and are a continuing source of national pride. Along with Deputy McGahon I would like to pay tribute to Mr. Oxx for the way he treated Johnny Murtagh, who is now back in top form. Great credit is due to Johnny Murtagh and Mr. Oxx and I would like to congratulate them on their continued success.</P>
    <P>It is important that we acknowledge our gratitude to the board, management and staff of this enterprise who have kept this nation in the international limelight over the years. The National Stud is a well managed enterprise which has been raking in solid profits in recent years in particular. For example, in 1998 the profits were £400,000 and they were more than £600,000 in 1999. That is a good success story. The management adhered to its task but has also been concerned to introduce innovative developments directly linked to its core business. Also, the stud has continually attempted to widen its business base of operations so that it is not dependent on one stallion or one brood mare for its results. That is a long-term process, as we all know. It is part of the strategic vision to which the stud is committed and the Bill's provisions will be welcomed by the board and management as broadening the statutory framework within which they operate by increasing the business opportunities and the financing mechanisms available to them.</P>
    <P>The bloodstock industry is a labour intensive one and wage costs have been under pressure in a tightening labour market. It is of vital importance that the stud is able to attract and retain experienced, quality staff. We have a problem in that area in that stable boys are very underpaid, somewhere in the region of £250 per week. That should be examined because it is important that we retain the existing good staff. If we do that the stud will be even more attractive and will be able to expand into other areas of the business.</P>
    <P>The acquisition costs of stallions and brood mares are also under pressure in a rising market because the increased capitalisation by the Minister, and the increased borrowing powers to be provided by the Bill, will confer a huge degree of financial flexibility on the stud in terms of its ability to meet ongoing management challenges and those posed by diversification. One of the significant diversifications has been into the stallion syndicates. One of the major benefits of our growing international reputation as a provider of quality stallions is the support we receive from breeders who purchase shares in stallion syndicates. Such shareholders receive regular information on a stallion's stud performance and comprehensive financial accounts at the end of each season. This support is vital to the further development of the industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> I welcome the provision in section 7 which allows the stud to establish subsidiary companies and also that section 8 permits it to acquire shares in other companies. These are normal and unremarkable commercial freedoms but are very welcome. I also welcome the stud's ability to participate in joint ventures as provided in section 9. Section 5 of the Bill is particularly important in that, in addition to clarifying the stud's remit, it permits its engagement in outside business operations such as, for example, participation in stallion syndicates where stallions may be kept outside the stud farm for part of the year.</P>
    <P>The vesting of land occupied by the stud and its licences is also to be welcomed and reflects the fact that the stud is a mature and responsible business operation which should have the freedom to operate and develop its own lands for appropriate business purposes and opportunities, consistent with its aims and objectives.</P>
    <P>Tourism is an important element of the stud's operations. For example, the Japanese gardens attract many visitors. The stud recently opened the new St. Fiachra's gardens which will significantly add to its attractiveness to visitors. I also welcome the fact that this dimension of the stud's activities has been recognised in section 5 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as it will greatly enhance the industry. I thank the Minister and his officials for their tremendous support for the stud and I wish it well for the future. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill. However, like other speakers I may drift beyond the parameters of the Bill and comment on the Irish racing industry.

The Deputy mentioned his attempts to involve and encourage his Oireachtas colleagues to take an interest in racing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>One should stay well away from Deputy McGahon's invitations. This Bill is important for the Irish National Stud. Deputies Wall and Power pointed out that Kildare is synonymous with Irish racing through the Curragh and the plains of Kildare. There was a time when <Col N="1124" /> the National Stud was seen as the beacon of the Irish racing industry but that is no longer the case. We need to address this issue and examine the operations of the stud, what it is and should be doing and how it is preparing for the new millennium.</P>
      <P>There was a time when the Irish breeding industry looked to the National Stud as the Mecca of thoroughbred horse breeding but that is no longer the case. Two of the greatest stud farms in the world, Coolmore and Rathbarry, are based in Tipperary and Cork, respectively. We also have many other stud farms of international renown. It may be that the National Stud is finding it difficult to compete financially but most people involved in horse breeding do not look at the stud in the same way as heretofore.</P>
      <P>Competition is welcome and it is great to see Coolmore, Rathbarry and other stud farms thriving. However, we must give particular attention to the future of the National Stud. It is disappointing that, to the best of my knowledge, the stud no longer stands stallions for national hunt racing. Every stallion standing at the stud is a flat racing stallion. We need to address this issue and the Minister should raise the matter with the stud's directors.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGahon referred to flat racing but from an international perspective, Ireland is regarded as the home of national hunt racing. In this context it is remiss of the stud's management that genuine national hunt horses are not standing at their home base in Kildare. If this trend continues the National Stud will come to be seen as the home of the Japanese gardens and retired race horses such as Danoli and Vintage Crop, rather than a centre of breeding excellence. I acknowledge that the National Stud has some top quality flat racing stallions but that is only half the picture. The other half of the picture needs to be addressed. I may be incorrect, but to the best of my knowledge the National Stud does not stand national hunt stallions. In light of this fact, the stud's description as the showcase of Irish racing and breeding no longer applies.</P>
      <P>The stud management courses run by the National Stud are admirable and internationally renowned and must be encouraged. It is important that as many young people as possible obtain the level of training available at the stud. There is always a phenomenal demand for the courses which far outstrips supply. Students from the Middle East, Japan, Australia and all over the world come to Ireland to take advantage of the stud's fine courses in stud management and thoroughbred breeding. This is an important part of the stud's activities and it has done a great job in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with Deputy Wall's comments on the foal levy. From his deep involvement and interest in the industry, the Minister will be aware that smaller breeders in particular feel that, once again, they are being sidelined and possibly ignored. The formula devised for the levy militates against those at the lower end of the market. <Col N="1125" /> While Irish racing is quite strong in every respect, unless new people become involved on a continual basis, there is no guarantee of long-term success. New people coming into the industry will enter at the lower price level but few incentives are available for such people. I accept that people are paying extraordinary prices for bloodstock as a consequence of the booming economy. This is good if one is selling but it causes problems if one is buying.</P>
    <P>Some of the people who have recently entered horse racing and breeding will not remain in the industry if the going gets tough. Those who will stay are the smaller breeders and farmers but, unfortunately, these people are being offered no incentives.</P>
    <P>I raised the matter of incentives previously with the Minister. The tax exemption on stallion fees is a huge incentive. I have no difficulty with it and I welcome it. It has transformed the breeding and racing industry. However, we are giving 100% of the incentives to one section of the market. On the other side of the equation, there is no incentive for the small breeder and the man or woman who might own one, two or three thoroughbred mares. The Minister needs to examine putting in place incentives for that sector of the market to ensure those people will remain involved in the racing and breeding industry and to try to encourage more people in. On current economic figures it is perhaps not as much a loss leading activity as it was in previous years but everything is cyclical, times will get tougher again and those people need to be encouraged to remain in the industry by way of appropriate incentives.</P>
    <P>In that regard I trust the Minister's work, which has come to fruition in the creation of a unified body for the future of the Irish horse racing industry and Irish horse breeding industry, will be helpful. We had an opportunity here on several occasions during Adjournment Debates to comment on the amalgamation and it was a long, slow and painful process for all concerned. However, a good, fair and balanced result was achieved. During the course of that debate, as the public tuned into it, the Turf Club personnel received a slightly unfair representation. They were seen as people who were almost deliberately trying to hold back progress. Down through the years, people in the Turf Club did tremendous good for racing. I said in the House some months ago that times had changed, that we needed to change the structures and the Turf Club had to change. We must recognise that on the whole its contribution to racing has been enormous and it has been very beneficial. I am sure those people will continue under the new structures to give the level of service and commitment they have to date. I wish the Minister well in what he is attempting to do with the new structures. They will be beneficial to the industry.</P>
    <P>I hope those people who will have more direct responsibility for planning racing fixtures, examining prize money and all the components of the bigger picture will look again at the type of racing <Col N="1126" /> available in the flat racing sector of the market. Unfortunately, unless one is now a very wealthy owner it is very difficult to get into flat racing. The person who can only afford a £3,000, £4,000 or £5,000 yearling literally has no chance of winning a race with that horse. We must try to reschedule our racing calendar so there is an opportunity for those animals and for their owners to win some level of prize money. It is a known fact that anybody involved in racing does not get into the game for the money. If one can minimise losses one is doing well, but for the person who would like to get involved in flat racing with only £3,000, £4,000 or £5,000 or up to £10,000 to pay for a yearling, the chances of winning a race with that type of animal under the present conditions of Irish racing are almost as low as winning the lotto. That is a formula which can be changed with the political input of the Minister and with an understanding by the new horse racing board or authority, Horse racing Ireland, that the equation must be changed. I ask the Minister to encourage the powers that be in the new set-up to have sufficient races for that type of animal because everybody deserves some small return from racing.</P>
    <P>I hope the new structure will be successful in running better promotions to encourage more and more people to go racing. However, if one looks at the figures and takes into account that people now have much more leisure time and more money to spend on their leisure than they had ten or 15 years ago, the increase in the attendance at Irish racing is particularly disappointing. It is in marked contrast to what is happening at greyhound racing where huge crowds are thronging to Shelbourne Park and Harold's Cross in Dublin. As the Minister and I know, the new track in Cork in its short few months of operation has been a tremendous success with phenomenal crowds attending. It is happening because of the marketing being done to encourage people and it is bringing people to greyhound racing who may not previously have attended a meeting. We must do the same for horse racing. There is still the false view that it is the tweed coat and bowler hat brigade who go racing. That is a very wrong impression but it needs to be changed from a marketing perspective. All sectors of the horse racing industry need better marketing but if we are to encourage more people to attend racing we must do better marketing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation, in particular section 5 allowing the Irish National Stud to involve itself further in syndicates and partnerships, as indicated in the Explanatory Memorandum. Unless the stud does something quite dramatically and quickly concerning the profile of the stallions it stands, and in particular a move towards national hunt stallions, it will be in genuine trouble from a breeding perspective. I do not want it simply to be the home of the Japanese gardens and of Danoli. If it is to return even near centre stage in the breeding sector it should examine its stallion policy. I noted that the total amount which it may <Col N="1127" /> borrow will increase from £5 million to £20 million. That is welcome but when one recognises what it must compete against and the financial worth of the stud farms against which the National Stud is trying to compete for the purchase of stallions, it faces an enormous task. It would be a pity if the Irish National Stud could not thrive and prosper but the direction it will take must be thoroughly examined. I read through its report and there was no particular view of what the Irish National Stud wished to be over the next ten to 20 years. Perhaps a new mission statement from the Irish National Stud is required which I would like to see as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and the opportunity it has given us to comment on the industry at large. I am sure the Minister will pass on my comments to the appropriate people on the Irish National Stud board. I look forward to the day when once again the Irish National Stud will be seen to play a more central role in breeding Irish horses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. They say that to maintain thoroughbred horse stock is the sport of kings. The thoroughbred end of the industry is a luxury business. I welcome this amendment Bill. The thoroughbred and non-throughbred sectors in recent years have continued to play a very important role. However, the non-thoroughbred aspect of the industry has been somewhat overlooked. As we move into the 21st century it is gratifying for all concerned to observe the international standing of the Irish bloodstock breeding industry, but I would like us to consider the non-thoroughbred sector.</P>
      <P>It was disappointing that our showjumping team did not compete at the Olympics. Ireland has been internationally recognised for a number of decades as a producer of quality thoroughbred animals. It was disappointing that our showjumping team, which has been very successful on the international circuit this year and has done the country proud, could not compete at the Olympics.</P>
      <P>I read with interest the comments of Dr. Noel Cawley about the need for a register of quality bred mares. It is important that such a register should be kept in respect of non-thoroughbred animals. Ireland has always been blessed with people who, with little or no support, have bred good quality showjumpers. Bord na gCapall, which has since been replaced, did extraordinary work in the past. Ireland's international reputation in this area relates to the cross-breeding of the Irish draught stallion with the three-quarter bred which has produced very good showjumpers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one attends the annual show at Mill Street or the Horse Show at the RDS, one will see the Young Irelander competition, which is sponsored by the Bank of Ireland, for four year olds and be amazed by the number of spectators who come to watch it. Noel C. Duggan has done an extra<Col N="1128" /> ordinary job in terms of promoting the non-thoroughbred industry. The thoroughbred industry is elitist and it is costly to become involved in it. Previous speakers referred to syndicates owning horses but, in reality, syndicates rarely make money from owning thoroughbred animals. It is nice to be associated with a winner and I had the option of becoming involved in a syndicate.</P>
    <P>I am the owner of a showjumper that won the league qualifier at the RDS this year and I know how costly it is to keep a horse in a stable and how difficult it is to make money. The prize money in showjumping does not compare to that on offer in horseracing. Those involved in showjumping really believe in the industry and love horses. When one owns a horse it prevents one from betting on that horse because the costs involved are so great.</P>
    <P>The National Stud has done invaluable work over the years. I welcome the fact that the Bill will increase the equity invested in the National Stud. However, the Minister must open up the industry because, to an extent, it is a closed shop at present. A friend of mine recently paid £10,000 for a foal which he then had to transport to his property in the country. There are high risks involved in this business, particularly when one considers what might happen to one's investment between the market and one's home. New people becoming involved in the industry often over-stretch themselves financially when they buy horses and this often encourages them to leave the industry, never to return.</P>
    <P>It is important to ensure that those involved in the industry are more open about how it operates. I accept these people are professionals and have vested interests but they should not keep the secrets of the trade to themselves. At present, there is closed shop among trainers and owners. There is nothing to prevent a person buying a yearling at Goff's. It is like buying a lottery ticket; one can either be lucky or completely unlucky. This is a major industry. People should be encouraged to enter it and made aware of the tax write-offs they can get on the fees they pay for stallions, etc.</P>
    <P>In every town or village throughout the country one will usually come across a breeder who owns a good quality brood mare. We must ensure that these people are given stud fee allowances to enable them to produce high quality jumpers. Thoroughbreds are only raised in a certain number of counties but in every constituency showjumpers, which can compete on the international stage and generate prize money, can be bred. It must be remembered that buyers from many foreign countries come to Ireland in search of quality jumpers.</P>
    <P>Showjumping is a major sport. The majority of the debate to date has revolved around thoroughbreds that are reared to race. I accept that this is a huge industry but little or no recognition has been given, by successive Ministers, to those who are prepared to breed good colt foals or colt fillies. Those people are given very little assistance. <Col N="1129" /> Bord na gCapall tried to do so for many years but, in certain ways, it failed in that regard.</P>
    <P>Horse shows held in our towns and counties play a major role. Noel C. Duggan and other entrepreneurs have done great work in this regard and they must be saluted because it is very difficult to maintain voluntary support for county shows. There is very little funding on offer from the Department or the Irish Shows Association for these shows, with the exception of the grants given to a few of the qualifiers at the RDS Horse Show. In addition, not much is done to encourage sponsors to remain in the sport. We must safeguard sponsors and provide them with a sense of security with regard to the competitions they sponsor. I refer in particular to the Young Irelander competition which identifies the three year old horse with the best potential to become a jumper as a four year old. The Minister must take steps to encourage those involved in this hugely important industry.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that our international showjumping team did not compete at the Olympics because of the quarantine on horses. However, we should have a second panel of showjumpers which could be taken off the circuit two months before the Olympics and the team should be given State funding. These measures will allow them to compete.</P>
    <P>I accept that I am wandering somewhat from the substance of the Bill. However, when he introduced the Bill the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I am pleased to introduce the National Stud (Amendment) Bill, 2000. The horse industry, thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred, has over the last few years continued to play a very important role and is now about to undergo significant change.</P>
    <P>What plans does he have in respect of introducing significant changes in the non-thoroughbred industry? There has been very little discussion about this industry. I have a major interest in the non-thoroughbred industry because ordinary people can become involved in it. The thoroughbred industry is a different matter and while it is not particularly elitist, it is confined to a certain class of people.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to indicate his plans for the non-thoroughbred industry. Does he intend, for example, to put in place a register of the best mares in the country? The Irish draught stallion has been identified across the world as the animal most likely to produce the quality showjumper. What are the Minister's plans for Irish draught stallions?</P>
    <P>Grants, premiums and subsidies are given to people who keep quality brood mares. However, there is a need to encourage new people to enter the market. Perhaps this could be done as part of the development of alternative farming. Ireland has a reputation in the horse industry but we should consider where our alternatives lie.</P>
    <P>There is a great interest among punters in the thoroughbred industry. There are many race<Col N="1130" /> tracks, such as the Curragh, on the east coast. However, consideration must be given to racetracks in other areas. It is not possible for everyone from the north west to travel to the Curragh. If the Minister is serious about the industry he must provide funding for the development of Sligo race course, which depends for its survival on the huge commitment of the manager and volunteers. A meeting at this course attracts approximately 5,000 people and I am disappointed at the lack of State investment in it. People love to go to the races and it is important that tracks are easily accessible. The track in Sligo needs investment for drainage works, etc. and private investment could be encouraged by giving tax concessions to people who invest in local race courses. Sligo is a Border county and, in the context of cross-Border development, it is important that people who live in the North are attracted to the north west for race meetings. It is also important for the industry that the owners of quality stock are encouraged to travel to provincial race tracks for meetings. Deputy Bradford divided race horses into formula one and formula two. There is a market for both types of horse and it is important that owners are encouraged to travel to meetings.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the debate on the horse industry. The Bill covers all horses &ndash; bloodstock, cobs, ponies, sixteen hands and thoroughbreds. Many parents send their children to equestrian centres which not only give training in horse riding but also bring them to weekend shows. The Minister has a role to play in ensuring the continuity of county shows which are under threat. These shows are run by dedicated committees who get little or no support and find it difficult to secure sponsorship. It is important that some concession is given to the sponsors of county shows.</P>
    <P>The thoroughbred breeding course in the National Stud, which is in its 28th year, remains the best known and most prestigious equestrian training programme. The National Stud is doing a very good job but this course is effectively a closed shop as there are only 23 places available on it. If one wants to secure a place on the course it depends on who one knows. If one is friendly with a well known trainer or one of the inner circle then one is guaranteed a place. This is wrong. The course should be opened up so that people from disadvantaged areas who have an ability are given an opportunity to secure a place. There are many successful schools which have stables attached to them and the Minister should allow them to run courses rather than confine it to the national stud. A stable owner who has the necessary qualifications should be allowed to take in apprentices. There is huge emphasis on the thoroughbred industry, but it is also important to remember that farriers are very skilled and that there are many opportunities in the non-thoroughbred area.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that the National Stud made a profit of £2 million and has done a <Col N="1131" /> good job. I welcome the provision of funding to enable it to buy quality stallions. The Minister said the industry has played an important role over many years and is about to undergo significant change. I am anxious to hear his plans for the non-thoroughbred industry. His comments will be listened to attentively by those who are interested in the role he envisages for the Irish Show Jumping Association for the 21st century.</P>
    <P>I have been chairman of the Ballymote track for many years and a huge number of people from the North travel to our show. People love the industry and it has no political divides. There is no excuse for our failure to send a team to this year's Olympics. If the elite show jumpers do not want to compete in the Olympics as they will lose money by not competing in the European circuit, there should be a second squad to take their place. The Department should allocate funding to the team which competes and promotes the people from west Cork and south Sligo who breed quality show jumpers. I love thoroughbreds but it is a sport of kings, and I do not qualify in that respect. My father believes that owning horses stops people from betting on them. Very few people make money on horses. It is a rich man's hobby and an alternative to golf. If we want to encourage small breeders to become involved in the industry they must be given assistance.</P>

      <P>I welcome this important debate. I was not aware there were so many horse owners within our ranks. I am glad to rub shoulders with them. I am not a horse owner but I come from a farming background and have a tremendous interest in the industry.</P>
      <P>I agree with the comments made by Deputy Perry. I was interested to hear Deputy McGahon, who is well informed on this issue, say that the top stables are creaming all the prize money and that there is a downside to this. I agree that if one wants to attract good horses the prize money must be high. However a figure in excess of £250,000 seems very high. The owner, trainer and jockey are happy when their horse wins, but what happens to the owners of horses which do not win? They also have costs and there should be some system where they can share in the prize money. If we want to support the industry in a fair manner recognition should be given to the contribution made by these owners and trainers. I would not describe it as a golden circle, but a small number of owners and trainers win the top prize money at meetings, leaving a pittance for everyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Stud has done great work in making top stallions available to small breeders who <Col N="1132" /> could not otherwise afford to buy them. Our bloodstock, both thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred, has a world-wide market. Our best horses would have been exported if the National Stud had not been able to enter the domestic and international markets to purchase quality stallions and make them available to small breeders. The vast number of small breeders form the backbone of the industry. Top flight trainers are supported by syndicates which own horses and place them with them. Small farmers and owners have an interest and hope that one day they might be lucky enough to breed a good horse, as a former Member of this House has done, and salvage their outgoings.</P>
    <P>I salute the Cavan Equestrian Centre, which was set up by the Clarke family and is one of the finest in Ireland. It was felt that it would never succeed because there was not an equine tradition in Cavan, but it is an outstanding success. Top showjumping events are held there almost every weekend and showjumpers travel to the centre from both sides of the Border. They participate in marvellous sponsored events which offer good prize money. However, there are huge costs involved and the Clarke family is not receiving the support it deserves. The family has had a massive input into the region by building such an arena which has benefited breeders, North and South.</P>
    <P>I question the thinking within the Department in regard to the grant aid available for stabling and the conditions which apply. I have come across a case, about which I have made various representations, of young people with an interest in horses and ponies who set about building new stables. They drew up plans and were approved for grant aid. They upgraded the stables and blended them in with their dormer bungalow. This facelift also ensured the stables were environmentally friendly. However, they were denied the grant after they made those changes and upgraded the appearance of the stables. I have made various representations but nobody listens. The couple were told they did not adhere to the specifications as laid down. They improved the specifications but were denied their grant. If such thinking is applied throughout the Department, we will get nowhere.</P>
    <P>I also support earlier comments regarding breeders and showjumpers. They should be provided with grant aid or support because it is a costly business. However, there is a huge knock-on benefit in terms of employment as people are required for horse transportation and in equestrian centres. There is a spin-off which emanates in the first instance on farms owned by small breeders and farmers. They have the extra finance that is necessary but find that it impinges on other household activities and support should be provided to such individuals.</P>
    <P>As costs rise, inflation takes its toll and disposable cash is not as plentiful, people will give up little sidelines, such as this, in which they are involved. That is sad because there is a great tra<Col N="1133" /> dition of breeding in Ireland. There is a major nucleus of top quality breeding stock which is costly to maintain but we do not want all the stock to be purchased by wealthier people with more disposable income. The small householder, farmer or business man who has land on which he would like to keep a few ponies should be supported. He is the backbone of the industry.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the great work that is being done but I wanted to highlight one or two issues which need to be addressed. I also acknowledge the marvellous work of the national stud. It is an eye opener to those involved in other sectors of the agriculture industry to learn how the stud is run and conducts its business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to those who work on stud farms. I ask the Minister or the Minister for Education and Science to provide training in third level institutions for such individuals so that people can recognise the valuable role they could play in this field and that it can be rewarding. There is a simplistic view of how stud farms are run, the hygiene regulations that must be observed and the organisation that is involved. I visited a number of stud farms over the past year and even large stud farms have difficulty attracting young Irish men and women to take up employment and pick up the vital knowledge necessary to maintain a successful industry.</P>
      <P>As soon as people have worked on a stud farm for a year or two they leave to work in racing stables. The thrill and excitement of the racing game attracts them. If a third level course on stud farming was provided in an institute of technology &ndash; a university degree is not necessary &ndash; more people would want to enter the industry because it would be more attractive if a proper qualification was offered. Some stud managers are interested in this and I hope the National Stud will take the lead and make representations to third level institutions to promote this sector of the agriculture industry.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in his work with the National Stud. There is no political divide in this matter. There are good and bad horses and I am in a syndicate which owns a successful horse. We are lucky but we have also had bad horses. That is the name of the game. I enjoy racing, as does the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate for their supportive and positive comments on the industry. They transmitted their liking and passion for the industry. There is not a Parliament in the world which would have such an animated debate on the horse, and long may that continue. The National Stud is thought of very highly across the board and this is as it should be. It has served the State, thoroughbred breeders, the horse industry in general and the tourism sector in an excellent fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1134" /> Deputy Dukes has particular knowledge of and keen interest in the stud. He made some positive comments on the stud and mentioned how well it is regarded in Kildare. He was entirely supportive of and constructive in regard to the stud. He singled out the management, staff and board there for their professional contribution to the stud over the years.</P>
    <P>One of the issues raised by Deputies Dukes, Power and others related to section 2(3) which deals with the vesting of the National Stud farm in the stud company. I do not agree that these provisions would necessarily create a problem for the stud. That was not the intention. Deputies Dukes and Power referred to the provision whereby if the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development gives consent to the sale of vested land then effectively the Minister would, with the consent of his colleague in the Department of Finance, decide how the proceeds would be used. In my address to the House last week, I said in reference to section 2(3)(<i>a</i>) that, if the revenues from such a sale were relatively small or reasonably in proportion to the stud's needs generally, then the stud could use the entire proceeds as it saw fit. This would include any requirement of the stud to purchase other lands at a potentially very high price.</P>
    <P>The possibility mentioned in section 2(3)(<i>c</i>) of some of or all of the funds going to the Exchequer is only envisaged as being required in the exceptional circumstances where rezoned land may be sold at very high values and could be replaced by suitable agricultural land leaving a potentially huge excess way beyond the stud's commercial or other needs. In such a case, the excess could be used for other purposes to the benefit of the State.</P>
    <P>However, being a very considerate person who is always prepared to listen to a reasonable proposition, and given that a good case was forcefully made by the two Kildare Deputies in particular, I agree that these provisions could be used otherwise. I have always placed great trust in the board of the stud company. The board is appointed by the Government and such boards must be given the flexibility to do their job and should not have their hands tied. I have a high regard for the current and previous chairmen and members of the board of the Irish National Stud. I have sought to ensure they have the necessary powers, freedom and resources to do a first rate job in developing the stud in the context of the widest possible interpretation of their role and to the greatest extent feasible.</P>
    <P>Therefore, and in deference to the force of arguments made by my colleagues, I will reconsider the detailed provisions of section 2 and have already asked my officials to examine how this section could be redrafted to allow the stud company the greatest amount of flexibility while ensuring the protection of the National Stud farm as an important State asset. I hope to bring forward on Committee Stage a suitable amendment to take into account the suggestions made. I am <Col N="1135" /> satisfied we can provide a solution acceptable to all.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputies Dukes and Power, raised the issue of the foal levy. An enabling provision allowing for its introduction was provided for in the Horse and Greyhound Racing (Betting Charges and Levies) Act, 1999. The actual rates of levy and other implementing details were introduced by the IHA with my consent by means of regulations. I am aware of difficulties which have arisen in the first year of operation, especially for smaller breeders. I understand the IHA is in the process of setting up a committee to review the regulations and to include people from the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association, the IFA and other interested parties from the IHA and a senior official from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>I expect that committee to propose improvements and refinements to the application of the levy and I will carefully consider any proposal to amend the regulations, especially where the smaller breeder is concerned. I assure the House that I am most anxious to ensure that any changes to the current levy will take account of the broader industry and the person with two or three mares. The review will be concluded in time for the next breeding season. If amendment to the primary legislation is required, I will have an opportunity to examine that in the context of planning the new horseracing Bill which I am sure will require amendments to other provisions of the 1999 Act.</P>
    <P>A number of specific matters were raised during the course of the debate to which I wish to respond. Deputy Donal Carey was the most recent to raise the provision of training, education and the farriery system. It is amazing there is a shortage of blacksmiths in Ireland. I sought to address this problem a short time ago. When I was growing up there was a blacksmith in every village and they were very skilled craftspeople. In the course of recent visits to other countries, I took some time off to look at an area of my responsibility, namely, the horse industry. The number of people who have done courses in the National Stud and in Kildalton, and such places is amazing. The expertise, professionalism and empathy Irish people have with horses is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>However, in the area of farriery the skills are declining and diminishing. I sought to do something about this to provide master farriers who could train younger people. I arranged for that to be done on the farm of the Irish National Stud adjacent to the RACE apprentice school. Planning permission had to be applied for but an objection was lodged immediately and the process was delayed. It went to An Bord Pleanála and I am pleased that that has now been resolved and planning approval has been granted. Unfortunately, at that stage the money set aside for the school under the previous round of Structural <Col N="1136" /> Funds had had to go elsewhere but I ensured there was adequate financial provision made in the proposals under the new round of Structural Funds. I hope that, once EU approval is granted, we will be able to proceed with the construction of a master farriery school beside the RACE centre.</P>
    <P>As well as that specific area of training and education, I will ensure in the new Bill setting up Horse Racing Ireland that attention will be given to proper education and training structures for the industry for the future. As Deputy Donal Carey said, there are stud farms where the highest level of expertise is required. Stable lads deal with high class thoroughbreds who are so precious one could hardly look sideways at them. A tremendous amount of expertise is required. There are training courses in the Irish National Stud for the thoroughbred side and in Kildalton for the non-thoroughbred and a new equine faculty has been established in the University of Limerick. It is a matter of pulling it together and putting a proper structure in place. That is essential and I am committed to that.</P>
    <P>Deputies Wall and Power and others referred to the position of stable lads. When people go racing, they arrive during the early part of the race meeting at least and, it is hoped, before the first race. Everything is laid on for them. The horses are provided and the facilities have been improved in many tracks. They sit down to a comfortable meeting and have a bit of punting to raise the level of excitement. The jockeys get on board and, if it is national hunt, they endanger their lives every time they go out because horrific accidents can occur. We hardly ever take into account the position of the other people who facilitate all this happening.</P>
    <P>The poor lads at the bottom of the pile are the stable lads. They must set out early in the morning for the racecourse. When everything is over, they must bring the horses back, hopefully in one piece. If it is a festival meeting, they must be back again the following day and return home the following night. I have the greatest understanding of their position. People in the industry must comply with the minimum wage. However, the conditions in some of the tracks are such that stable lads must change in a horse box. If they are looking for a bite to eat or a bowl of soup, they are told: &ldquo;Well look, the restaurant is booked out at the moment by some of the salami sandwich brigade&rdquo;. That is not fair and it is not good enough. I have written to every single racecourse about it and I will not be satisfied until that changes. I am sure everyone in the House has the same concern that people in the industry should be treated well and not shabbily, as they have been up to now. Stable lads in particular are doing a marvellous job and their lot will be substantially improved.</P>
    <P>Every speaker referred to the new structure for the thoroughbred industry. With the substantial improvement in funding, we will seek to ensure the additional moneys are broadly spent and <Col N="1137" /> applied. Yesterday, when the IHA made its first funding announcement, I was pleased that it applied to the national hunt sector where the minimum prize money for grade one races will be £50,000, and up to £10,000 for ordinary races. There will be sponsorship on top of that. It is important for racecourse managements to obtain sponsorship. Although it is fun, keeping a race horse is a costly business. In flat racing, as Deputy Bradford said, if one spends £5,000 or £10,000 and in the first race one's horse is up against a £1 million or £2 million yearling, one does not have a chance. The statistics show that 17 out of 20 grade one flat races are won by horses belonging to two or three well-known owners. The ordinary person has no real chance, except in very exceptional circumstances and, so, the crowd will not be there for group one races and classics at the Curragh and elsewhere. They will be there for national hunt racing, however, which is the life and soul of the industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Perry mentioned the non-thoroughbred horse industry and even though it is not part of the National Stud or thoroughbred industries, nonetheless, the two industries are very closely related. The Deputy made some important points. I looked at this industry in the early 1990s, and in 1993 I established the Irish Horse Board under the chairmanship of Dr. Noel Cawley. Mr. Dermot Ryan from the Department provided a secretariat, and we also provided the horse register from the Department. Much support was provided from Structural Funds, particularly from 1994 to 1999. Some exciting new schemes are envisaged in the new Structural Funds for non-thoroughbreds. I agree that people are interested in the sector, from ponies up to eventers and dressage, cross-country and show jumping. It is fantastic to see Irish horses and riders performing so creditably. For example, we won the Nation's Cup event this year by a mile, and we won ten such cups throughout Europe, as well as coming out with flying colours in Calgary, Canada. Our riders do a marvellous job for Ireland in flying the flag at overseas events in the teeth of strong competition.</P>
    <P>Although we did not have an official team in the Olympic Games in Sydney, a neighbour of mine, Patricia Donegan from Bandon, gave a professional performance in the cross-country event there on her horse Don't Step Back. Well done to her. At least four of the horses competing in the Olympic cross-country events were bred in west Cork, including Cutam Mad, ridden by Mr. David O'Connor of the United States. A few other horses were bred in other parts of the country. In many ways we flew the flag for non-thoroughbreds.</P>
    <P>The Irish National Stud has helped to promote and sustain the image of the Irish thoroughbred racehorse as well as Irish racing, generally, on the world stage. It has achieved this by adopting a very pro-active and professional approach both at board and executive management level, using a high degree of acquired skills and an effective <Col N="1138" /> process of strategic planning. During the debate a request was made for a mission statement and I will bring that to the attention of the board and management.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford, who has an intimate knowledge of the industry, raised the stud's position relating to national hunt racing. The National Stud has a world-wide reputation, with world class stallions such as Indian Ridge, Desert Prince and Ashkalani. The stud also has national hunt stallions, but it took a decision a couple of years ago that it would be in the best interests of the national hunt industry to have those stallions located outside Kildare since most national hunt racing is based outside that county. For example, one of the stallions, Yashan, is with Mr. Dinny Vaughan, down in Deputy Bradford's neck of the woods in Cork. Another very good national hunt stallion, Broken Hearted, is owned by the National Stud also, but is farmed out, as is Tremblant, in the west. This year, the stud purchased a brand new and very well bred national hunt stallion, Rudimentary, which is with the Pims in Anngrove Stud. The national hunt stallions, therefore, are widely distributed for the benefit of the national hunt people. I will seek to ensure that the National Stud retains that capacity, capability and facility for national hunt breeders. It is a good thing that they should distribute them around the country.</P>
    <P>The Aga Khan has been lauded for his loyalty to Ireland as a base for his equestrian operations. His grandfather the Aga Khan, followed by the Ally Khan and now the present Aga Khan have had connections here since the 1920s. Last year, Daylami was horse of the year and retired here to stand at stud when he could have been retired to any country in the world. This year, Sinndar, uniquely won the Epsom and Irish Derbys and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, before retiring to stand at stud here. It is tremendous to see world class horses, such as Giant's Causeway and Montjeu, being retired to Coolmore Stud in Tipperary. Mr. Liam Cashman's Breeder's Cup winner, Barathea, which is a horse of outstanding international competence, has retired to Ireland, also. We have outstanding international stud farms and I compliment their managers and operators.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on the Bill, a question was raised concerning how the Turf Club would fit into the new body, and whether it had been unfairly treated in the debate over the establishment of the new structure. The Turf Club has been around for centuries and is the integrity base for the horse racing industry. That was accepted and acknowledged during the negotiations, so much so that the club is being given five members on the new body. That is a far greater number than any other interest, including owners, trainers and bookies. The Government of the day has only one member on the board. The pivotal position of the Turf Club was, therefore, taken into account.</P>
    <P>The question of punters having a representa<Col N="1139" /> tive on the board was mentioned. It was felt that 17 members was too unwieldy a number on the old IHA, and that some effort should be made to have a more compact board. There will be a facility for punters' representation, however, and I will ensure that consultative sub-boards will be provided in the new authority, so they will have adequate representation. It is more important, however, to have a representative supporters club or board at each race track.</P>
    <P>I was delighted that Deputy McGahon, a great supporter of the industry, was generous enough to say that Mallow racecourse was a success. It is a superb facility which is well patronised. It has its own board. If it is not representative, it should be broadened. The various supporters clubs in Galway and Listowel, for example, do a fabulous job and their views are taken into account.</P>
    <P>The contributions made today were positive and constructive.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Kildare bypass has to cut across part of the lands of the National Stud. We cannot, however, hold back improvements in roadways and realignment. Anyone travelling through Kildare will have first-hand experience of the difficulties in the area at peak times and will accept that a bypass is needed. Commercial realities of the day and the essential requirements of the national road network must be taken into account. Thankfully, the route chosen will have a small impact on the stud. For example, only 50 of the overall total of 950 acres will be cut off from the main farm. Preliminary works on the bypass have commenced. I understand the road will take about three years to complete. Every effort is being made to ensure disruption to the stud during this period is kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>The National Stud is only a very small part of the overall horse racing industry. I was delighted at the extremely positive reception given to the proposals which my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and I have been promoting in recent times on the restructuring of the organisation and funding of the horse racing industry which will mean substantial change, particularly for those employed by or involved with the IHA, the Turf Club and the Association of Irish Racecourses. While change is difficult, it is necessary.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that in this case it will result in substantial long-term benefits for all those participating in the industry, particularly those who depend on it for their livelihood, that is, stable staff, jockeys, trainers, owners and businesses providing essential services for the sector. I am looking forward to introducing the necessary legislation amending the relevant 1994 and 1999 Acts in this area in the coming months. I am satisfied that the overall outcome will be good for Irish racing and facilitate its development.</P>
    <P>In this context, we are providing a brand new racecourse at Patrickswell, County Limerick, <Col N="1140" /> about which I am sure my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is very pleased.</P>

We must secure its future at this opportune time. I am totally committed to this.</P>
      <P>I am equally committed to the National Stud. The various provisions of the Bill, most notably the proposed increase in share capital and borrowing powers of the company and the proposal that will enable the Minister of the day to vest all or part of the original stud lands in the National Stud company, are aimed at securing its future and ensuring its potential is fully realised and the consequential benefits for Irish breeders and the status internationally of the Irish thoroughbred and Irish tourism are maximised.</P>
      <P>I look forward to a useful debate on Committee Stage when I will bring forward an amendment to facilitate the concerns of Deputies Dukes and Power. I will welcome and examine closely any proposal for an improvement of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill provides me with an opportunity to present legislation which gives a statutory framework for the provision of youth work programmes and services. Youth work plays a very important role in the social and personal development of young people. It aims to assist all young people to realise their full potential and become active participants in a democratic society. Youth organisations and projects provide the means by which this development can take place. A central aspect of youth work is the young person's voluntary participation in the services provided by youth work organisations. Youth work also has a strong ethos of volunteerism, with many adults and young leaders giving of their time and efforts freely in the provision of services with and for young people. It is, perhaps, because youth work is based on the concept of volunteerism that it has reached out to so many people, young and old alike, in society. The many organisations which my Department supports by way of financial and other assistance support, in turn, the work of the volunteer. It is my intention that the Bill will further develop and enhance the very valuable work being done by the organisations, agencies, youth workers and volunteers in non-formal education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Youth work is rightly deserving of its own identity and the second legislative opportunity the Bill offers. The Youth Work Act, 1997, was a step in the right direction in placing youth work on a statutory basis. It was, however, predicated on the establishment of education boards which were subsequently deemed inoperable by the Government. It was necessary, therefore, to revise the Act to take account of this. On revisiting the Act it became clear that there were <Col N="1142" /> many other aspects of its provisions which required improvement and modification in the light of the reaction to it. The Bill represents a fresh start in which we can address the needs of young people and youth work in a more detailed, systematic and comprehensive manner.</P>
    <P>Ever since the report of the national youth policy committee in 1984 the issue of youth work legislation has been on the agenda. The long progress to this point has been with Governments of differing complexions and, sometimes, with opposing views of the structures which should be in place to facilitate good practice and the effective administration of the youth service. There has always been, however, common ground that the youth work service, mainly of a voluntary nature, should have a legislative basis on which to function and operate.</P>
    <P>There was widespread consultation with interested parties prior to the drafting of the Bill. It became apparent at an early stage that rather than have voluminous amendments to the 1997 Act to provide for the replacement of education boards by vocational education committees, it would be more desirable to introduce a new Bill. In the short interval since its publication my officials and I have met interested parties to discuss their views and comments. I am glad to say that there has been a positive reaction and the publication of the Bill has been generally welcomed.</P>
    <P>The principal purposes of the Bill are to define what youth work means in a clear and concise manner; to detail the policy, budget, research, monitoring and assessment functions of the Minister regarding youth work; to define the functions of vocational education committees regarding youth work, particularly the procedures for planning, prioritising, funding and reporting on the provision of youth work programmes and services; to establish a special youth work committee in each VEC area; to provide for the continuation of the national youth work advisory committee and to expand that voluntary committee to reflect to a greater degree the current composition of the youth work community; to formalise the allocation of grants for youth work; to establish voluntary youth councils to represent the needs and demands of the voluntary sector at local level, and to permit the appointment of a national assessor of youth work so as to ensure the best possible use of Government moneys in the provision of youth work programmes and services.</P>
    <P>To those Members conscious of the Youth Work Act, 1997, many of the concepts included in the Bill will be familiar. The national youth work advisory committee will be retained and strengthened through enlargement. The structures initially intended for the administration of the national youth work budget have been adjusted to take account of the existing situation and the local youth work committees and voluntary youth councils have had their roles clarified and extended. I intend to appoint at least one national youth work assessor as a result of the <Col N="1143" /> legislation before us and expect that this development will greatly assist in the best use of the resources available for the promotion of youth work. Those organisations that provide youth work programmes and services will have the added protection of a formalised system of safeguards in regard to decisions of the VEC and of the Minister.</P>
    <P>This is a development much anticipated in the sector. Of all the provisions of the Bill, however, perhaps the most important is the emphasis that is being placed on co-ordination amongst the agencies and organisations which undertake youth work. For too long, Departments and voluntary youth work organisations have worked somewhat independently of each other, each providing a youth service tailored to its own particular needs. It is expected that co-operation between all the bodies and organisations and youth work committees and the national youth work advisory committee will foster a spirit of co-operation and information sharing that will be of enormous benefit to the sector.</P>
    <P>The Bill outlines in detail the functions of the Minister in the area of policy formulation, co-ordination, budget, research, monitoring and assessment. These are key areas in youth work policy and it is essential that the Minister has overall responsibility for them and for the development of national policy. The functions will include the development and co-ordination of youth work programmes and services, including co-ordination with education and other programmes. The Bill will also allow for the Minister to provide annual funding for youth work programmes and services. It will enable the Minister to carry out or commission research in respect of youth work. It will provide for monitoring, at least once a year, of youth work programmes and services in receipt of State funding. Furthermore, the Bill provides for the assessment, at least once every three years, of State funded youth work programmes and services funded by Vocational Education Committees.</P>
    <P>A very important function of the Minister will be to appoint the national youth work advisory committee. The Bill will provide for due regard to be had to the treatment of males and females; to those aged between 10 and 21 and those who are socially or economically disadvantaged. It will enable the Minister to give directions to a VEC or youth work organisation if, after assessment of a programme or service, that is required. Furthermore, there is provision for the Minister to direct any two or more vocational education committees to act jointly in the provision of youth work. These are necessary and important tasks for the Minister to exercise as part of his overall responsibility for the development of youth work and youth work policy.</P>
    <P>I gave much thought to the manner in which delivery of youth work programmes and services might be organised at local level. I am convinced that, given the nature of youth work and its deliv<Col N="1144" /> ery in Ireland, the most appropriate statutory vehicle at local level should be the vocational education committees. The vocational education committees have a strong tradition in youth work and are much involved in youth work provision; they are uniquely and ideally placed to respond to local needs in youth work provision. I regard the decision to entrust statutory responsibility for youth work to vocational education committees to be a realistic and forward looking decision of the Government. The Bill, therefore, provides for vocational education committees to ensure the provision, within their administrative areas, of youth work programmes and services in co-ordination with voluntary youth organisations. It will require vocational education committees to prepare a three year youth work development plan for their administrative area. The legislation will enable vocational education committees to grant, withdraw or reduce financial assistance to youth work organisations as the situation demands. The Bill will enable vocational education committees to arrange for the provision of youth work programmes or services where they are not being provided. One must be conscious of the fact that every community has needs different from its neighbours and flexibility must be given to vocational education committees to allow adaptation to the conditions prevailing in each VEC functional area. That is precisely what is being proposed under the Bill. The three year planning process will enable vocational education committees to develop local youth work services in a visionary, imaginative and progressive manner.</P>
    <P>It has long been my desire to re-introduce the post of national youth work assessor. This Bill will take a step further along the road to accountable and efficient youth service. The assessor will have a central role in the proposed structures. Not only will he or she provide invaluable information on the state of the sector but will enable decision making on the basis of a full appreciation of the merits of the youth work organisation concerned. In this manner, the vocational education committees and I will be able to promote best practice and value for money among the various groups which will come under the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>During the consultation process, the widespread desire for a review process for decisions made by the administrative bodies was patently apparent. With this in mind, the national youth work assessor will be charged with a range of duties designed to allay any fears within the voluntary youth work sector that unfair or unreasonable decisions might be taken with regard to their funding under this new scheme. The process whereby many of the decisions of the Minister or the vocational education committees will only become final when the organisation concerned has had an opportunity to restate its case to the assessor, must be seen as a major safeguard for the providers of youth work services and programmes. As such, it is a very welcome addition to the youth work landscape. It reflects, I believe, <Col N="1145" /> the consensual approach to catering for the needs of the sector, which is a hallmark of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The national youth work advisory committee has, over the past three years, proved itself invaluable in the development of youth policies. A number of issues of vital importance to the youth of Ireland have been and are being examined by the committee. Since its inception following the 1997 Act it has been responsible for, and has been an invaluable source of, advice for the production of policy guidelines and direction in the youth work area. At my request, it has also been active in the commissioning of a five year national youth work development plan. I anticipate that the committee will be in a position to present me with this plan by March next year.</P>
    <P>Through this Bill, it is intended to expand the duties of the committee and formally give a role in the administration of the youth sector to the voluntary bodies and those statutory agencies with an interest in the field. Following what we all hope will be the successful passage of this Bill, the committee will set about the mammoth task of producing advice on the implementation of almost every aspect of it. The committee will provide guidelines for the vocational education committees as to the constitution of local voluntary youth work organisations and the standards to which they must adhere. Perhaps most importantly, it will examine how we can achieve the greatest degree of co-ordination of services, both within and outside the sector, to provide the very best return on investment in the young people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In order to provide the best possible service the membership of the committee will be expanded from a maximum membership of 22 to 29. The reason for this increase is twofold, first, to allow for the increased work load the committee will face and, second, to ensure the widest possible representation of interested parties. The membership structure has been adjusted to allow for two representatives from the Irish Vocational Education Association, and a representative of the chief inspector of the Department of Education and Science. The former reflects the greatly increased role envisaged for the vocational education committees in the operation of the new structures and the latter marks the intention to ensure the highest level of co-ordination between the formal and non-formal education sectors. The enhanced participation of the statutory side is matched with a major advance in representation on the voluntary side. In a development that epitomises the spirit of co-operation between the State and the voluntary sector, the national representative body of voluntary youth work organisations will be guaranteed 50% of the representation on the committee. Similarly to youth work committees at local level, the public and voluntary sector partnership embodied in the national youth work advisory committee will facilitate greater co-operation and co-ordination of services for young people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> In order to give full effect to the legislation, it is proposed to enable vocational education committees to appoint specific sub-committees for youth work. These will be known as youth work committees. The composition of these committees will be inclusive of statutory and voluntary agencies in order to give the widest possible representation. Each committee will provide a most important advisory service to its VEC in matters relating to youth work. It is my wish that the youth work committee will act in a positive and enlightened fashion in shaping the manner of youth work policy in its respective VEC area. It will also reflect the needs of the community in youth work by virtue of its wide, representative nature. In short, it will have a most important role in the development of youth work policy in each VEC area.</P>
    <P>As regards the provisions in the Bill for the creation of voluntary youth councils, it is essential in order to recognise the voluntary nature of youth work provision to give due recognition to those volunteers involved in youth work. It is essential to recognise the voluntary nature of youth work provision and to give due recognition to those volunteers involved in youth work. Accordingly, I propose that a minimum of 75% of the members should be volunteers and at least one fifth of the membership of the council should be young persons under 25 years of age.</P>
    <P>The voluntary youth councils will nominate one half of the membership of local youth work committees. This situation clearly illustrates the high regard and respect I have for volunteers in youth work. This provision is further recognition in the most positive manner of the key role played by volunteers in the youth work movement.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the various categories of youth work organisations and their recognition in this legislation. The Youth Work Bill envisages four categories of youth work providing organisations, three of which require recognition by the Minister and one &ndash; local voluntary youth work organisations &ndash; by the local VEC. The first category of youth organisations is the national youth work representative organisation. In accordance with section 18 of the Bill, the principal role of this body will be to nominate 50% of the members of the national youth work advisory committee. Accordingly, it is felt that the importance of this body and its national role deserve emphasis and for this reason it should be prescribed by ministerial regulation for a period of three years at a time. It is only to be expected that the National Youth Council of Ireland will be prescribed as the national youth work representative organisation.</P>
    <P>There are well in excess of 30 national youth work organisations funded by my Department. I expect these organisations to form the core of the second class of organisations, the approved national youth work organisations. These bodies operate nationally and include organisations which are known to everybody and, in many <Col N="1147" /> cases, could be said to be household names. Through national lottery funding, the Department of Education and Science gives grant-in-aid towards the administration budgets of these national organisations in the form of the youth service grant scheme. While they will interact with each VEC at local level, a coherent national youth work policy requires that they have a close relationship with the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>The voluntary sector through its membership of the national youth work advisory committee will have ample opportunity to help shape policy in regard to organisations in this category. The Minister will have the power to revoke &ldquo;approved national&rdquo; status for good cause. However, the national youth work organisations concerned will have the safeguard of the national youth work assessor to ensure that their positions cannot be questioned unreasonably.</P>
    <P>Designated local youth work organisations are those which provide youth work services at community level. These services are often affiliated to members of the national youth work representative organisation. The intention of the Bill is that where these organisations receive grant-in-aid from their local VEC they will also receive their designated status from the VEC. The guidelines the vocational education committees will follow in determining whether an organisation is eligible for status as a designated voluntary youth work organisation will be issued by the Minister with the advice of the national youth work advisory committee. The designated local youth work organisations will form the electorates for the local voluntary youth councils and will be eligible to receive grant-in-aid through the vocational education committees in the form of measures such as the local youth club grant scheme, the disadvantaged youth grant scheme and the youth information network.</P>
    <P>The Minister may, from time to time, need to expend funds on organisations not directly involved in the provision of youth work or which are not voluntary organisations but which can provide a service required for the effective delivery of youth work services. For the purposes of the Bill these will be known as authorised organisations. Bodies to be included in this category may be consultancy service providers or non-national youth work providers who are needed to provide services outside the scope of the local vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>The youth work functions of the Minister and the vocational education committees require that particular regard be had to the youth work requirements of those who are socially or economically disadvantaged. The concept of social inclusion is extremely important in the sphere of non-formal education and development of young people. Voluntary involvement in youth work programmes and services provides a real alternative to the formal route for many disadvantaged <Col N="1148" /> young people. It can help bring these young people back into the formal education sector with renewed enthusiasm and self-confidence.</P>
    <P>Schemes funded by the youth affairs section of my Department to assist disadvantaged young people include grants for special projects to assist disadvantaged youth and the young people's facilities and services fund. There is also provision in the new local youth club grant scheme for particular regard to be had to the requirements of disadvantaged young people.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill have sought to uphold the Government's commitment to ensuring an equal opportunities ethos in the provisions of policy and legislation. The Minister's functions include a requirement to have regard to the treatment of young male and female persons in relation to access to youth work and to the number of male and female young persons likely to participate in the youth work programmes and services. These requirements are also applicable to the functions of the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>Current information available to my Department indicates that there is equal participation of young males and females in organisations receiving funding from my Department. While the Bill aims to ensure that regard is had to the treatment and involvement of both genders, it does not, and should not, aim to fix gender quotas. While many of the long established youth organisations in this State are single sex organisations, they continue to work closely with other groups and organisations in developing their young members' overall youth work involvement. Committees both at national and local level &ndash; the national youth work advisory committee, the youth work committees of the vocational education committees and the voluntary youth councils &ndash; are required to have regard to appropriate gender balance.</P>
    <P>The important role of information in today's society is also recognised by the provisions of the Bill. Information is of paramount importance to those who are making decisions on further education, possible career paths and other life decisions. The Minister and the vocational education committees must endeavour to ensure that in carrying out their functions regard is had to the information needs of young people.</P>
    <P>My Department currently provides resources for the development of a network of youth information centres which provide young people with easy access to information on rights, opportunities, benefits, health, welfare and other matters. This service also has relevance to those seeking advice and assistance in regard to travel and to the issue of mobility within Europe. These youth information centres, by providing information to young people on a wide range of subjects of interest to them, help them to develop their abilities and to overcome their problems more effectively.</P>
    <P>In assisting them through the effective dissemination of information to identify their own <Col N="1149" /> resources, make their own decisions and take their own actions, they promote personal autonomy and resourcefulness and encourage their active participation in society. Through the youth information grant scheme the Department of Education and Science is able to provide practical assistance to vocational education committees and other bodies to provide this vital service. This Bill, in acknowledging the information needs of young people, pays tribute to the excellent work of all those involved with the youth information centre movement in every part of the country.</P>
    <P>I emphasise again the degree of co-ordination and co-operation between statutory and voluntary interests envisaged in this Bill. The composition of the national youth work advisory committee and youth work committees clearly underlines this position and is one of the main strengths of the legislation. This will become more apparent when the legislation is in operation.</P>
    <P>The Youth Work Bill, 2000, has been criticised for having a long gestation period. Perhaps this is so but we can argue plausibly that the wait has been worthwhile. Time has been taken to allow for full and mature consideration of what is needed to consolidate the youth work sector and to prepare a framework that should last for many years. There has been a comprehensive process of consultation which has built on the findings prepared in advance of the Youth Work Act, 1997. The result is a Bill that addresses the wishes and needs of the voluntary sector in a detailed manner as well as catering for the needs of those charged with the implementation of the new structures.</P>
    <P>Above all, the Bill defines youth work in a fashion that is simple yet complete. Emphasis is placed on the voluntary nature of the service and that youth work's goal should be the personal and social development of young people. I am satisfied that the Youth Work Bill provides a logical and coherent framework for the delivery of youth work programmes and services at national, regional and local level for the new millennium. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this long awaited Bill. The Bill has had a long gestation period and I hope it will prove worthwhile. I do not intend to delay the House unduly by going through the Bill on Second Stage, as we will have an opportunity to go through it in detail on Committee Stage. It is expected that every party will support it on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is before us because of a Government decision to change the focus of the delivery of education by the removal of the regional education boards and reverting to the previous <i>status quo</i>. Were it not for a decision to alter the plans of the former Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathneach, for our regional education structure, this Bill, or something along the lines of it, would have been implemented by now. Notwithstanding that, a political decision was made to <Col N="1150" /> remove the regional education boards and, accordingly, changes were necessary, one of which is this legislation.</P>
    <P>On a lighter note, on many occasions when I have spoken on legislation I have prefaced my remarks by saying, &ldquo;as a young person&rdquo;, but given that a young person is defined in the Bill as someone under the age of 25, I will no longer be able to refer to myself as such.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill's definition of youth work as the planned programme of education designed for the purpose of aiding and enhancing the personal and social development of young persons through their voluntary participation and which is complementary to their formal, academic or vocational educational training and provided primarily by voluntary youth work organisations. The word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; is very important. Today, the words &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; and &ldquo;community&rdquo; have almost disappeared from everyday use. In today's society we put a price on everything but a value on nothing. This legislation covers the active participation of up to 40,000 in youth work groups, assisting and liaising with up to 600,000 to 700,000 people. That is the scale of youth work carried out on an almost voluntary basis. At a time when work tends to be measured in terms of its commercial value, it is great that voluntary work is very strong in our youth work sector, and long may that continue. I hope that with the passing of this Bill the necessary structure will be put in place to ensure the continuance of voluntary youth work in our society.</P>
    <P>The focus the Bill places on the role of the VEC is welcome. Given that vocational education committees have a long record of assisting in this field of endeavour, they are the ideal vehicle for implementing this legislation. They will be at the core of the operation of the proposals in the legislation. Having been a member County Cork VEC for almost nine years, I am aware of the commitment of the majority of VEC members and each VEC chief executive officer to youth work and the development of that sector. Being at the fulcrum of this legislation, a major role is being placed on them and I am sure they will meet that challenge head on. I am also sure that various VEC members will be eager to play their role on the youth work advisory committees, as they will be aware of the value of youth work in their communities and counties.</P>
    <P>This legislation was flagged as far back as 1984 when the Costello report laid the foundations for it. Excellent work was done in researching this topic and many problems were highlighted and possible solutions flagged, but in the interim period successive Governments did not act on them. It was not only a question of money, there was a political difficulty in accepting that voluntary effort, voluntary organisations and youth work should be recognised on a statutory footing. Arising form reports published in this area and the work carried out in preparing them, we are now in a position to tie up the loose ends.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1151" /> In doing so, it will be important to examine the financial cost of the legislation. We must ensure that value for money is obtained and I have no doubt it will be. The assessor of youth work will have a role to play in this regard. Those of us involved in voluntary groups witness first hand how well the small amounts of money available to local voluntary groups are used. The budget for youth work and the grants allocated to the groups working with young people have been modest, but the money has not gone to waste. Last year approximately £15 million was allocated to such groups. It was stretched to the limit in terms of being used to maximum effect. When this new structure is put in place, further funding will be required. I am sure every VEC, through the plans they will draw up, will set new targets for funding for the delivery of these services. There will be an onus on the Minister of State and his Department to deliver to the vocational education committees the finance required in this regard. I ask the Minister of State to give a commitment in that regard, as all the legislation and plans in the world will have little practical effect if the necessary resources to implement their provisions are not made available. I expect strong demands will be made by the vocational education committees for funding to deliver these services. The level of funding allocated to date for youth work and voluntary effort will have to be greatly increased if we want to ensure this legislation works.</P>
    <P>To date, there has been a degree of duplication in the delivery of services in this area by various Departments. One of the big advantages of the legislation is that the delivery of such services will be streamlined, as this will allow the Minister of State and his Department, a youth work assessor, the vocational education committees, various committees, the youth work advisory committee and the youth work committee for each VEC to ensure best value for money is obtained, which is important.</P>
    <P>Although record resources are available at present, that may not always be the case. We must put in place a structure that will ensure money is spent effectively and the duplication and possible waste of resources that could have occurred through the years will come to an end. If one goes back to the 1984 report, the targets outlined at that time were not reached. One hopes with this fresh start we will not just match the financial targets but will go beyond them, ensuring the Bill not only works in theory but in practice.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned the assessor's role, which is obviously of crucial importance; the Bill will not work otherwise. I look forward to the reports of the assessor. When one considers youth work around the country, in some regions work is being done more effectively than in others. When there is a national referee who can comment, adjudicate and advise, in areas where youth work is not as strong as it should be, people will be able <Col N="1152" /> to learn and act on the advice that will be available from people such as the assessor.</P>
    <P>I take the Minister of State's point about increasing the membership of the national youth work advisory committee from 22 to 29. Those Ministers with the power to nominate include the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Environment and Local Government, Education and Science, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Tourism, Sport and Recreation and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. Will the Minister of State consider including the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development? There is a tradition of significant voluntary effort in rural areas and it would be appropriate to allow that Minister to make nominations for this advisory committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned disadvantage, which is a broad term that can be used loosely. Perhaps he will outline what he means by it? Sometimes we hear areas described as disadvantaged as if everyone there &ndash; students, workers, unemployed and lone parents &ndash; all suffer from the same disadvantage. Disadvantage in relation to youth service and involvement in youth work does not apply only in impoverished areas, as one may have young people from some middle class areas with strong economic backgrounds who have no access to youth work or youth service. That must be looked at. When the Minister of State looks at disadvantage he should see it as being more an individual matter than a community or economic issue. In my experience it is not necessarily people in an impoverished area who are disadvantaged when it comes to youth service or activity. Often disadvantage can come from a parental view of involvement in youth clubs and youth organisations. Some people put such a high premium on education and on leaving certificate results, CAO forms and honours degrees at university level that they see no room for youth, community or voluntary work. That is sometimes from where disadvantage arises.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of the Bill and look forward to its enactment. It is of crucial importance that vocational education committees have the funding and staff to deliver on the commitments and plans they make. Those plans will be ambitious, particularly when the local youth work committees mingle with the voluntary youth councils. There will be a huge range of new proposals and plans, even if those ambitions are not realised in the first year or two. The vocational education committees will be expected to chart a new course and without the necessary personnel and financial resources they will not be able to meet their targets. I am surprised there has not been a greater debate about this Bill at VEC level. I spoke to some of the members of Cork VEC and few of them seemed to know anything about the legislation. They were interested in finding out what it would mean for their committees but the level of knowledge among vocational education committees, given what the Minister of <Col N="1153" /> State is proposing, is quite limited. Staff resources in every VEC are very stretched, as the Minister of State will be aware from Limerick, and that is certainly the case in Cork. Without the extra resources this Bill will remain a piece of paper rather than deliver a service.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister of State's reply and to examining the Bill in detail on Committee Stage. I welcome the commitment the Minister of State gave to recognising the National Youth Council of Ireland's role on a statutory basis. It represents 98% of youth groups, which is as close to an overall majority as one will get. It is only proper that its importance is recognised in the Bill.</P>
    <P>If we have reasonable amendments I trust the Minister of State will take them on board. He said the gestation period for the Bill was quite lengthy and we will be able to judge whether that period was worthwhile on Committee Stage. Both funding and personnel resources will be necessary for this Bill to work and if it works it will be great, as words like &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; and &ldquo;community&rdquo; will go back on the agenda at a time when people are rushing around to get their share of the Celtic tiger and when fewer people want to get involved in helping their neighbours or young people. It is time to redress the balance and this Bill is a step in the right direction</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. An ultimately inoperable Act was introduced in 1997, with only some parts being implemented. I hope this Act, when complete, will be comprehensive, workable and will produce a good result for youth work in Ireland; I believe it will. The co-ordination of youth work and education programmes as well as other programmes providing services for young people is very appropriate and will bring structure and coherence to the sector.</P>
      <P>It is a pity we had to wait for three years for any movement to address the problems that arose as a result of the abolition of the regional education boards and the Minister of State has acknowledged that inordinate delay. Leaving the Act to ferment quietly for three years did not inspire confidence that youth work was a priority issue for the Government, yet every day I am confronted with the reality of the need for a structured, operable and professional youth work service.</P>
      <P>Young people, by and large, are idealistic and enthusiastic but sometimes they are also very vulnerable and they frequently need reassurance. There is a crying need for available, attractive, interesting youth activities that will allow young people to become valued citizens who will be encouraged to play an important role in the community. I have no doubt that, through structured youth work, that can be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are so many negative reports relating to some youth activities, and we tend always to hear predominantly about the negative aspects &ndash; underage drinking, joy-riding and the ever <Col N="1154" /> present scourge of drugs. Talking to young people in disadvantaged communities in particular, it is clear that the lack of structured and positive activities is a major reason many of them end up in trouble of one sort or another. The provisions of the Youth Work Act introduced in 1997 are now coming home to roost and, hopefully, we will see it moved through fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the Youth Work Bill is about management of youth work in Ireland. I welcome the fact that it will define youth work and the way it is carried out, who decides on the provision of the youth work and on the providers of youth work. The Minister for Education and Science will have overall responsibility for the operation of the Act, when it is in force, with the local vocational educational committees playing an enormously important and powerful role. They will be responsible for assessing local youth work needs, developing youth work plans and deciding which groups and organisations will have access to the funds to carry out that work. This powerful role, however, is moderated by the need to consult with local youth work groups and organisations through the youth work committees and voluntary youth councils and operating within a framework as set out by the Minister. I welcome that.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committees will be given statutory responsibility for the development of youth work. It is significant that the Act provides for the bringing of youth work within the framework of the State. They must ensure the provision of youth work and youth services by co-ordination with approved, designated and authorised voluntary and local youth organisations and provide assistance, including financial assistance. For the first time, therefore, the future provision will be determined by a three year development plan produced by the youth committee in consultation with local communities and the voluntary youth council. If the VEC is not satisfied that there exists a community group which has the capacity to manage its own service, it will be appropriate, for example, that where the VEC provides a programme or service it should ensure the transfer of it to local management within five years of taking on direct delivery.</P>
    <P>It is a welcome move in the right direction that youth work services and programmes will be co-ordinated with other educational services provided for young people. This role is also reflected in the proposed changes to the membership of the youth committees where it is proposed to include representatives of FÁS, the Garda, county councils and county boroughs. That is a significant development and attempts to ensure that co-ordination and integration of youth work with other educational provision at local level. This co-ordination is very important given the different sources of youth funding that have emerged in recent years such as local drugs task forces, young persons facilities and service funds, area partnerships and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1155" /> The Minister and Deputy Bradford referred to the important role of volunteers, and I want to draw attention to that again. For many years, volunteers, through sheer dedication and interest, gave their expertise, time and energy to the process of providing youth work. That raises two important issues which we should examine carefully. We have been taking volunteers for granted, to a large extent. By their very nature they do not ask for or expect remuneration but times have changed and the traditional volunteer is no longer as available as they were heretofore. That is true not just of youth work but generally in many aspects of committee work. They also cannot be expected to dedicate their free time to the management and organisation of youth work and activities at a cost to their personal lives, which, unfortunately, is often the case. They give enormous commitment to voluntary activities often at the expense of their own families. Many times men and women have taken precious time from their own family time to dedicate themselves to the community. More recently, pressures of time have made these demands too great for many of them so it is not unreasonable that the State should recognise the important role of the volunteer and offer some recognition for their time and efforts.</P>
    <P>Most volunteers are not remotely interested in monetary reward but it would be worthy to consider that volunteers, within the framework of the new Bill, should be recognised in some way. Perhaps they could be given extra time off work, extra holidays or some such recognition but there should be something positive and structured built into the legislation to recognise the important role of volunteers. We recently debated the demise of the volunteer in many aspects of society. The time and commitment of those who continue to have a philosophy of <i>pro bono</i> should be recognised.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed establishment of local voluntary youth councils in each VEC area. I hope such a forum will be fully supported by provision of the Act so as to ensure that volunteers, upon whom we depend to deliver the vast amount of the youth work, receive the necessary support to allow these councils to have a meaningful say in assisting youth work in their area.</P>

    <P>Tá súil agam go dtógfar an cheist seo ar bord, nuair atá na rialacha toghcháin á bheartú amach anseo.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to raise in relation to youth work is the need for training for those who undertake the work. That training should be done in a professional manner. Professional youth workers, like any other professional, should be suitably qualified. Youth work is complex and demanding and not everybody should or can do it. Comprehensive training is needed to do it properly and professionally. A number of colleges provide training and a number of organisations provide certification in youth work. Qualified persons required by most organisations carrying out youth work. It is important that agreement is reached between the different bodies as to what we mean when we refer to a qualified person and how the various levels of training relate to one another. Other areas of education and training have bench-marked their training effectively. I hope youth work is well on the road to the same end.</P>
    <P>Careers in youth work should be available and open to everybody interested and equipped to participate. Nobody should be precluded on the basis of their disadvantaged background, for example, and for that reason the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act is relevant in this context. The purpose of that Act is to provide a ladder system that people can access and work their way through providing equality of opportunity for anybody who wants to engage in obtaining appropriate qualifications.</P>
    <P>The number of people doing youth work in recent years has increased enormously. Many organisations and institutions, apart from the traditional ones, are also now engaging in youth work &ndash; health boards, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, special projects, Youthreach and Youthstart programmes and numerous community and partnership settings. Given this proliferation, it is important for all stake-holders to know what is meant by youth work, how it differs from and is related to other forms of provision or intervention, and how one gets to be called a youth worker.</P>
    <P>Community employment schemes have influenced the increase in numbers of youth workers, many of whom see youth work as a stepping stone to a full-time career in youth work activities. There is nothing wrong with this aspiration <Col N="1157" /> which is to be welcomed. However, it is equally important that there is formal accreditation and recognition for those who wish to make a profession of youth work.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that there will be a tightening up of requirements, and rightly so, for those wishing to enter the profession and the Bill will go some way to further professionalising youth work. There will be a legal definition of what we understand by youth work and a system of accreditation and certification is essential for any profession to have credibility. The national youth work development plan, which is now under way, will consider the human resource requirements of the youth work sector for the next five years, including the issue of training. Training, accreditation and certification are highly sensitive issues. It is vitally important that the process is not driven by vested interests and that the ultimate goal is one of ensuring the highest quality service for youth.</P>
    <P>The level of funding one attributes to any effort is an indicator of one's commitment to it and how one perceives its relative importance. The funding of youth work is probably a good indicator of the importance attached to this whole area. My criticism of the process is that, in November, the national youth committees do not know their exact allocations of funding for the current year. There are six weeks left in this year and the committees are expected to be able to gaze into a crystal ball and know the amount of moneys available for the full financial year. This lack of information and commitment raises major questions for the youth committees, particularly regarding the uncertainty of staffing and how they will address possible shortfalls in funding. Above all else, they need to be able to plan and ensure they have sufficient funding to deliver their responsibilities to the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the losers are the youth who are serviced by the various organisations in place. It is an indictment of the Department of Education and Science that the total budget allocated to youth work is about 0.6% of the Department's total budget amounting to a paltry £25.5 million. In 1985, the Costello report recommended that £20 million be spent that year. We are 15 years on from that recommendation and the total funds dedicated to youth work are, relatively speaking, less than those recommended 15 years ago.</P>
    <P>Every organisation needs adequate funding to achieve results. It also needs to know that funding is guaranteed and the amount available so it can plan effectively. Youth workers are being treated in an off-hand manner by the Minister and do not know what their funding will be until the end of the year. I appeal to the Minister to review the Estimates and the paltry increase for the current year. This should be reviewed as this is an important sector which should be supported and funded.</P>
    <P>Unprecedented amounts of moneys are now available and funding is being lashed out in all <Col N="1158" /> directions. Sometimes this is done to appease a local lobby group when a Minister sees fit. If the structure is not in place to ensure continuity, confidence and quality in one of the most deserving and needful sectors, this leaves youth work as the Cinderella of the education system. This is a dangerous situation which will ultimately cost us in terms of our regard for youth and the response we can expect from them. Day after day we hear about how vulnerable young people are. If we are to make any in-roads into the provision of decent youth services we must start, in this time of unprecedented wealth, to provide the formal, practical recognition of that need through adequate funding. There should be no more lip service and adequate moneys and back-up should be provided.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that no additional costs are expected other than funding the assessor and the operations of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee, the Youth Work Committee and the voluntary youth councils. This statement is a serious indictment of the thinking concerning youth work. The view of the Department is that there is, for all practical purposes, sufficient funding in place, and only new elements are to be considered for additional funding. In other words, it is the view of the Minister that enough funding is dedicated to youth work, despite the recommendations of the Costello group over 15 years ago. This leaves us all in a time warp regarding the needs of youth and youth services.</P>
    <P>A total of £302 million will be spent over the life of the national development plan which can be accounted for from existing funding. There is an increasing need for the expansion and development of services and research, all of which should be factored into the level of funding. It is not just a case of maintaining the <i>status quo</i>. We have to look to the future and emerging and research needs, which will be costly and demanding. Unless these costs are built in now, we will feel the consequences in the long-term.</P>
    <P>The Cinderella factor is a reality and not an illusion. The commitment to youth falls down not alone in the area of funding, but also because youth should have a full ministerial post. We recognise the importance of youth so we should consider including the word &ldquo;youth&rdquo; in the title of a ministerial portfolio. Could we not include &ldquo;youth&rdquo; in the title of a Department so young people are recognised as a group in their own right? It would not over-burden the system to incorporate the word as a first step in recognising the importance of youth who deserve full ministerial responsibility in their own right and not a miserable 0.6% of the budget of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>The idea of the youth work development plan being carried out by the National Youth Work Advisory Committee is to be welcomed. The plan provides an opportunity to think creatively about youth needs for the future and the type of youth service which will be needed. The plan needs to be innovative and to formalise ways in which all <Col N="1159" /> the stakeholders can work together. The opportunity for long-term planning is very important. In addition, the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to implement the plan gives the process added value.</P>
    <P>Up to now funding has generally been made available on the basis of applications formally submitted. The formulation of a plan should provide a solid basis for the distribution of funding, not just on the basis of an organisation being in the know and making an application. In the past the outcome was that those who knew that funding was available made an application and had a reasonable chance of success. The imposition of a structured plan will add rigour and value to any application. Formulated within the framework of the long-term plan, the next three to five years should see the shape of youth work for the future and the plan should outline the steps needed to implement it. For that plan to be realised and to be worthy, funding must be included in this year's budget. I ask the Minister to review the level of funding.</P>
    <P>If we do not provide the necessary back-up to drive and implement the plan, it will fall by the wayside or become one more document gathering dust in our nice new offices. The plan will succeed and will be implemented if funding is in place and not by the production of a glossy report with pious recommendations. The implementation of the plan is what will count.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation, the IVEA is named as an appropriate representative organisation and this is entirely appropriate given the key role of vocational education committees within the framework of the new Bill. However, this should not preclude the National Youth Council of Ireland as the body representative of 98% of voluntary youth organisations. In the legislation the treatment of the National Youth Council is at variance with the treatment of other bodies in the education field. In the Education Act of 1998 the National Parents Council has been named and recognised as the body representing the interests of parents in education. At national level, there are a number of precedents. There is no reason the National Youth Council should not be named as the body representing youth organisations. For example in the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999, ICTU and IBEC are both named as bodies with an entitlement to nominate members of the authority.</P>
    <P>The appeals process and the appointment of an assessor is very important. It is important that the appeals procedure should be available, open and accountable. I welcome the recommendation that an assessor be appointed. However, it is questionable whether the appeal should be to an assessor in cases where the assessor would already have considered the appeal. I intend to raise this point again on Committee Stage, as it seems inappropriate to have an assessor review a case twice, which in effect is what would happen under the current recommendations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> The Minister mentioned disadvantaged groups. It is appropriate that priority be given to young people who are disadvantaged and that this should be spelled out in the Bill. However, the Bill should be clear that age and disadvantage should be separate. Young people who are disadvantaged socially or economically should be the priority. A professional approach to the operation of services and work for youth is good and desirable. It means that targets will be set, outcomes will be measured and those delivering the services will for the most part be professionals. All of this is positive, but excessive bureaucracy must be avoided and the special needs and aspirations of specific sectors must be accommodated. It must be possible to arrive at a formula that will allow moderation of the process without excessive interference. However, all young people between the ages of ten and 21 should also be given special consideration. I am referring to the separation of age and disadvantage. In the Bill as it stands, those between the ages of ten and 21 who are disadvantaged are placed together. We should look at those who are between the ages of 10 and 21 but not necessarily considered to be in the disadvantaged group.</P>
    <P>The shift from centralised provision for youth work to a more involved model of youth work at local level is desirable. Involvement of local providers in the development of a youth work plan for the area is central to success. Ownership by those who are really involved is essential if the plan is to succeed. Local needs must be identified locally and the most appropriate services for an area must remain with youth work providers on the ground. Involvement of young people directly in the planning process through local voluntary youth councils is also central to the development of a service which will address the real issues for young people. At local level it will also be important to ensure that other initiatives such as area partnerships and the drug initiatives are co-ordinated and related to the youth work programme. The piecemeal approach has been necessary up to now in the absence of any more formal structured approach. We should not ignore the very valuable contribution of many sectors, organisations and groups, both statutory and voluntary, who contributed so effectively for so long. The Bill intends however, to put in place formal arrangements to ensure that the providers and the recipients will each be better positioned to avail of the appropriate services.</P>
    <P>The Youth Work Bill proposes the formalising of the partnership approach to youth work with the State, its agents and the voluntary youth groups all involved in the process. It lays out the precise role and responsibilities of each player, with the State taking overall managerial responsibility for youth work and existing youth work organisations being the deliverers of the product.</P>
    <P>Existing provisions by youth organisations will be recognised and built on rather than replaced following the establishment of new regional and local structures and funding mechanisms. It is <Col N="1161" /> important the status and current good practice in youth organisations is built on and that organisations feel secure following the implementation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The final outcome must ensure that youth will benefit and that we develop a society where young people are valued citizens who can make a meaningful contribution to their community. I welcome the introduction of the Bill in the House today and look forward to its quick passage, to seeing it in place and hope that the people who will benefit will be the youth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I may share time with Deputy Dick Roche. Like other speakers, I welcome the publication of this Bill and compliment the Minister on its publication. It has been a long time in gestation but the consensus the Minister has managed to achieve is significant. Like others, I would welcome the fairly speedy passage of this Bill through this House.</P>
      <P>I take the opportunity to thank the many thousands of volunteers who have given a great deal of time to developing youth work. I am glad to hear the Minister emphasise again that youth work is essentially pinned and delivered on the concept of volunteerism. I compliment the vocational education committees throughout the country who with very little funding over the years have supported youth work. I also compliment the voluntary organisations, in many of which I have been involved, such as the National Youth Council, CYC, the National Youth Federation, Fóroige, the small ones like ECO, the uniformed and non-uniformed organisations, for the work they have done.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to put in place structures that will support their work. However, as other speakers said, there is no point in developing structures if we do not have the assent of the people to whom the services are being delivered and if we do not provide the resources. The Government has shown a commitment to do that. There are many important initiatives in the Bill, a few of which strike me as acutely important. The National Youth Work Advisory Committee, which meets people involved in the youth service and its various levels of participation will make an important contribution to the success of the delivery of the youth service. I welcome the Minister's proposition that a minimum of 75% of the members in the voluntary youth councils should be volunteers. That is an excellent suggestion. I hope some of the voluntary organisations will be democratic and open enough to ensure that young people can manage to make their way into these councils because &ndash; let us call a spade a spade &ndash; many of the youth organisations at the moment are top heavy with bureaucrats and administrators. There is merit in the Minister's proposal to give primacy to the volunteers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all the developments in youth work that have occurred since 1984 has youth work had an impact on the problems facing young people? It has had an impact on the problems facing many <Col N="1162" /> individuals but as a system it has had little impact in addressing the inequalities in society that create the problems faced by young people in marginalised communities, in cities and rural areas. Despite the individual models of good practice and the commitment of many innovative and creative youth workers throughout the youth organisations, the influence on national policy and on the institutions of the State that impact on the lives of young people has been very limited. I cannot think of any legislation that has been influenced by national youth organisations either working alone or together.</P>
    <P>Regarding the understanding of youth work, there are almost as many interpretations of it as there are people. Early this year in my constituency of Dublin north west there was a forum for young people. The degree of confusion about the role of the youth service arose there. Among the various contributions by young people were a number of complaints about the lack of recreation facilities in the area particularly discos and a cinema. While nobody has yet gone so far as to suggest that the youth service should provide a cinema for young people, it has been suggested that it should respond to the demand for discos. Both the costs and risks of visiting discos in Dublin were cited as reasons for the youth service to respond to the fact that there is nothing for the young people to do in my constituency. Leaving aside the many practical reasons for not taking on the task of providing local discos for teenagers, it needs to be emphasised that it is not the role of the youth service to provide subsidised entertainment for young people. The role of the youth service in this area extends at most to providing young people with the support, encouragement and opportunities to formulate and articulate their opinions.</P>

      <Quest>the actions he proposes to take on the CIRCA report dealing with the aquaculture sector; if the Government will act on the many recommendations contained in the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>The CIRCA group was commissioned last year to carry out a comprehensive strategic analysis of future directions for Irish aquaculture. The report was published last June and I fully concur with its analysis that sustainable development of the aquaculture industry makes sound economic sense in national and regional terms. The report <Col N="1163" /> recommends a range of strategies to achieve critical mass and value added in production, diversification into new species, best environmental practice, quality assurance and innovation. These are the key challenges which must be met if the aquaculture industry is to succeed in a very competitive international market for seafood.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully committed to supporting the sustainable development of the aquaculture industry. Funding of £25 million has been allocated under the two regional operational programmes to underpin investment strategies for the aquaculture sector up to 2006. This level of investment support, which is fully in line with the CIRCA finding, is more than double the funding available under the last round and underlines our commitment to realising the full potential of the sector. My Department, BIM, Údarás and the Marine Institute will continue to work with the industry to deliver on all the strategic priorities identified by the CIRCA report.</P>
      <P>Work is under way to finalise the investment schemes under the regional operational programmes. These will underpin delivery of the targets and objectives of the strategic plan. I look forward to launching the schemes in the near future. In tandem with the investment support strategies, work is continuing to ensure that the licensing process delivers as effectively and speedily as possible. A solid licensing framework which has the confidence of the industry and all interested parties will continue to be a key priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I am in favour of the recommendations put forward in the CIRCA report because if we can create 600 new jobs in the most peripheral areas around our coastline, we are obviously doing a good job. However, there are huge question marks over this area because it is difficult to see how production could be increased from approximately 39,000 to 160,000 in light of the infrastructure that exists. At whom will the £25 million to which the Minister of State referred be targeted?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State indicate the new species that are to be targeted? I accept that salmon, sea-reared trout, mussels and oysters are commercially viable species, but is the Minister of State in a position to indicate the other species on which we will have to focus before the scheme can be made to work? What type of research and development activity is ongoing in this area at present? If we are not involved in research and development or if we cannot import research and development expertise from outside this jurisdiction, we will not be able to develop the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Connaughton on his promotion. Perhaps later today he will be elevated to an even higher position. I assure the Deputy that, as far as I am concerned, we will <Col N="1164" /> achieve the targets we have set out and we will create 600 jobs in peripheral areas. I am pleased the Deputy agrees that, other than in the area of aquaculture, it is difficult to create jobs in remote coastal areas. I am confident that we can achieve our goals in this area and in order to do so we intend to develop old reliable species such as oysters, mussels and salmon.</P>
      <P>We are considering moving into the development of abalone, turbot and other species in respect of which we have not yet carried out sufficient research. At all times we use research resources from at home and abroad. I am satisfied that the research facilities on offer here are of the highest calibre. However, research carried out at home is not always completely comprehensive and we have sought advice from abroad. In that context, I recently visited New Zealand and Chile where we procured an enormous amount of research that will help us to achieve our ambitions in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify for the Deputy that there is no EU ban on drift netting for salmon. My principal policy objective in relation to the national salmon resource is to increase returns of salmon thus enhancing the availability of stocks for tourism and domestic sport angling to the national benefit. The legitimate entitlements of commercial salmon fishermen as stakeholders in the resource are also reflected in policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal to be done on a range of complex challenges facing the salmon resource. In addition to progressing tagging as a management information tool, I have invited the National Salmon Commission to formulate analysis and advice on a number of key priorities. <Col N="1165" /> These include spring salmon conservation, catchment management strategies and incentivising reduction of commercial fishing effort.</P>
    <P>Commercial drift net fishermen are represented on the commission with all key players. There is a long-standing body of opinion at home and abroad which sees the buy-out of commercial licences as the key to restoration of salmon stocks. The situation is far more complex in reality and the international experience is mixed. I am expecting the consensus advice of the commission shortly, but I would underline that overall policy will continue to be informed by all relevant factors, including the tangible benefits to be gained through all stakeholders co-operating in the catchment management process.</P>
    <P>At present we are co-financing two pilot schemes at catchment level for voluntary set aside of commercial nets for salmon. Both of these schemes are based on matching contributions by other stakeholders. I have requested the regional fisheries boards to encourage the development of similar projects based on consensus and local contribution. The Southern Regional Fisheries Board informs me that discussions are taking place with the relevant stakeholders on a pilot set aside for drift nets in the Suir and Blackwater estuaries. The board plans to present a fully developed and costed proposal for consideration prior to the start of the 2001 fishing season. All such voluntary schemes, will be considered for matching funding, having regard to all the relevant criteria and in consultation with the National Salmon Commission.</P>
    <P>I am available to meet representatives of the drift net fisherman to hear their views. I would also commend to the Deputy the long-standing salmon management model in the Foyle where fishing effort by commercial and angling interests is managed each season based on real-time stock information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear we are moving in the right direction. Will the Minister agree it is universally accepted that drift net fishing is the biggest cause of the reduction in the level of salmon and the diminishing salmon stocks in Irish and international waters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult on anecdotal evidence to be sure what is causing the reduction in the salmon resource. Over-fishing by commercial interests is a contributing factor. It is interesting to note that in Canada all the commercial net fishermen were bought out by the Canadian Government approximately five years ago. My Canadian counterpart informed me that there has been no increase in the wild salmon stocks in rivers as a result of the buy-out, which was a very expensive exercise. It is difficult to be definitive and say the reduction in salmon stocks is caused by one or other reason. There is no question that if salmon are caught in the north-west and west Atlantic then fewer of the species get back up the rivers. It is a contributing factor.</P>

      <Quest>if he has assessed the cost of the increased oil prices to the fishing industry; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this extra cost factor has seriously impacted on the financial returns to fishermen; and the steps he is taking to cushion these effects on fishermen and their families.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have previously advised the House, I have thoroughly assessed the impact of increased fuel prices on the fishing industry in consultation with the industry. The industry is currently experiencing severe difficulties as a result of the price rise which is impacting on the profitability of fishing operations and wages. This is also exacerbating the labour shortage and crew retention problems emerging in the sector. I assure the Deputy that I have highlighted the crisis to my colleagues in Government and am working intensively to secure measures which will address the difficulties.</P>
      <P>The fishing industry is exceptionally exposed to the dramatically increased fuel prices because of the relatively high proportion of fuel costs to overall costs. The exposure is compounded by the fact that the sector is a &ldquo;price taker&rdquo; with little or no scope for passing on costs. The fishing industry, in common with those in other member states, is rebated excise and VAT on marine diesel. As a result, fuel cost increases directly reflect movements in the supply price. In effect, fuel costs to the fishing industry have doubled since January 1999, with an increase of the order of 30% since January this year.</P>
      <P>In my discussions with industry representatives, I have focused on strategic actions to alleviate the problem. The industry has put forward a number of proposals, including changes to taxation and PRSI, and I am discussing with my ministerial colleagues. In addition, my Department is working closely with the industry to ensure that investment support programmes under the national development plan are strategically focused on the short and long-term needs of the sector. All available options are being pursued to assist the industry to alleviate the immediate crisis and to deliver longer term strategies which will ensure the viability and competitiveness of the sector.</P>
      <P>I also discussed the fuel prices crisis with Commissioner Fischler, Minister Glavany and EU colleagues at the Fisheries Council last week. I pressed for urgent consideration of the scope of Union action to tackle the difficulties for the EU fishing industry as a whole.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. He spoke on this matter in the House some months ago and I would like to know what the Government has done since to help the fishing industry. It appears from his utterances that the Minister is backing the case, but what proposals has the Government come up with? The price of oil is a huge component in fishermen's shopping <Col N="1167" /> list and they cannot pass on the increase. All the owners of fishing fleets are hearing from the Government is that help is at hand. However, nobody has told them what help they will get or when they will get it. Will the Minister outline the nature of this help?</P>

Decisions will be taken in the context of the Estimates and budget, which will soon be brought before the House. I will announce at the appropriate time, in association with my colleagues, the measures to be taken to assist the industry.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to advise the House that the National Strategy Review Group on the Common Fisheries Policy, chaired by Padraic White, presented a comprehensive report to me which was published earlier this month. The report will inform our negotiating strategy on a range of priority issues from now up to the actual CFP review in 2002. We have also put the report into the EU domain with the strategic objective of influencing directions in the Commission's Green Paper on CFP reform which will be published early next year.</P>
      <P>The review group, which is widely representative of the industry, had already published a number of excellent interim reports. These reports dealt with national investment priorities for the seafood sector, technical conservation measures, control and enforcement, regionalisation of the common fisheries policy and fisheries management and the marine environment. I fully endorse the analysis and proposals in the series of interim reports and final report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group's work has been characterised by a highly proactive, open and consultative approach backed up by solid research. It also represents to a striking degree a new and welcome consensus among fishermen on the way forward. The report contains comprehensive analysis and proposals on a range of strategic issues which must be systematically tackled. The key challenges identified by the strategy group are radical new approaches to conservation, fleet management and fisheries enforcement; recognition of the socio-economic dimension of the CFP; greater involvement of fishermen in the decision-making process through <Col N="1168" /> decentralised and regionalised structures; and an enhanced role for coastal member states and recognition of the importance of inshore fisheries through the extension of the 12 mile limit.</P>
    <P>I am working to ensure the strategy group's findings are reflected in the Commission's Green Paper and that the Irish contribution to EU thinking on future directions for the CFP will be positive and far reaching.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister in welcoming the report and congratulate the review group.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the extension of the coastal limit to 24 miles is the most important recommendation in the report? Has he had discussions at EU level as to why this cannot be done successfully?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that an extension of the coastal limit to 24 miles would be desirable. However, the Deputy will be aware of the long and difficult negotiations in the past which yielded a 12 mile limit and no more. While I welcome the proposal in the report and will fight hard to have it implemented at EU level as part of the review, we should be in no doubt that such an extension will be difficult to achieve.</P>
      <P>I have raised the issue with Commissioner Fischler and his officials and lobbied some member states to try to achieve that result. The European Parliament passed a motion to that effect some time ago and this has been helpful. I will fight the case for the extension and many other recommendations in the report so that there is fundamental reform of the common fisheries policy.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a stronger case is not being made at EU level to have all forestry grant payments index linked in the future; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there are more than 7,000 forestry farmers who are severely discriminated against due to the fact that retrospective forestry premia have not been paid to this group; if he has satisfied himself with the forestry uptake this season; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that there is a lack of confidence among many farmers because of his inability to get premium updates for all farmers and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The application for higher forestry incentives submitted to the European Commission last year included a provision allowing for review of the rates at three yearly intervals. Such reviews provide a better safeguard in maintaining the value of the forest premium for farmers and other beneficiaries. For example, had last year's application been based on indexation the level of increase would have been about 6% compared to the average of 30% actually achieved and <Col N="1169" /> announced by me last March. The rationale behind the premium is to compensate farmers for the income loss in changing from farming to forestry.</P>
      <P>The application also proposed increased premium levels for those who planted in earlier years under Council regulation 2090/82, but it did not prove possible to secure increases in the negotiations which were concluded last March. I indicated at that time that, having secured my immediate priority of increasing the incentives for current planting, I would shortly pursue the question of adequate increases for those who planted in earlier years and I have done so. A further proposal was submitted to the Commission in April and the matter has been pursued vigorously by my officials and me in the meantime. I was involved in useful discussions on our proposal with the Commission last month and will be having a further meeting next week. The House can be assured that I will do all in my power to secure satisfactory increased premia for those involved.</P>
      <P>In recent years planting levels, while very substantial, have been significantly below target for a variety of reasons. Following two good years in 1995 and 1996 planting fell to a low of 11,403 hectares in 1997. The outturn for 1998 and 1999 was 12,928 hectares and 12,668 hectares respectively. It may be too early yet to say that we have turned the corner in terms of planting with the revised rates expected to have an impact next year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information</i>I am nonetheless pleased that the latest planting forecast for this year is 15,000 hectares. Planting projections for the next five years are in the range of 16,000 to 20,000 hectares. Apart from the impact of higher levels of financial incentives, the provision for increased integration of forestry and REPS, included in the Rural Development Plan 2000-2006, should contribute to reaching those targets. I am in regular contact with the farming bodies and they are fully supportive of my proposals.</P>

      <P>Like everybody in the forestry business I congratulate the Minister of State on one part of the programme. I always believe in complimenting a man when he is entitled to it. However, the Government has made a major tactical error. More than 7,000 farmers should be compensated with a retrospective top-up of forestry premia. The uptake of the new system, good as it may appear, will not approach the level outlined by the Minister of State and his advisers because people are afraid of what will happen as a result of the lack of indexation due to inflation. They believe they will not be compensated in years when inflation is running at 6% or 7%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister of State is unable to negotiate at EU for a retrospective top-up of premia will he give a commitment to the House that the Government will pick up the tab because of the significance of what is involved? He cannot <Col N="1170" /> expect that those involved in forestry will be able to withstand the devaluation of their plantations. It is a serious matter of confidence for the future. Should the EU not come up trumps, will the Government bridge the gap?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Having achieved a 30% increase it proved wise to pursue one aspect of the programme rather than pursuing all aspects and achieving little. The EU view is that the 7,000 farmers signed a contract, accepted what was available and, therefore, should be satisfied. However, neither the farmers nor I am satisfied. I was in Brussels two weeks ago and I intend to travel again next week to pursue this issue. The Deputy also mentioned indexation as opposed to a three yearly review. During the previous discussions at EU level, the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Yates, sought a three yearly review&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> The terms of reference of the task force are to review labour market supply and demand in the industry and in coastal communities and to determine medium-term demographic and labour market projections; analyse the existing employment relationships and conditions of employment with particular emphasis on safety; examine the existing position in relation to remuneration, working time, continuity of employment, social insurance, health and other benefits; review training, qualifications and career structures; and make recommendations on actions needed and the financial and sectoral implications.</P>
    <P>Since the task force began its work last year the overall climate has altered further with the acceleration of labour shortages and drift out of the industry. Processors and vessel owners are experiencing considerable difficulty in retaining and recruiting staff. In common with other sectors, recruitment of personnel from abroad is being actively explored to fill the critical gaps.

      <P>My Department has investigated the recent activities of several fishing vessels in the Shannon Estuary, between Scattery Island <Col N="1172" /> and Kilrush. Two fishing vessels were trawling for sprat in the area in question for a period and they have since moved on. Two other small vessels have been reported to be engaged in some fishing for sprat in recent days. This fishing activity was legitimate under the terms of the sea fishing boat licences of the vessels concerned. Sprat is a migratory species and the advice available to me is that the stock itself is moving on.</P>
      <P>The lower River Shannon, including the Shannon Estuary, has been identified by Dúchas as a candidate area for designation as a special area of conservation &ndash; SAC &ndash; in accordance with the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997. My Department's sea fisheries control division advises that fishing for sprat and the gears used in the Shannon Estuary will not adversely affect the ecological integrity of the area or pose a threat to marine mammals and other marine life or ecosystems.</P>
      <P>On the broader front my Department is engaged in detailed consultations with Dúchas on arrangements and parameters in relation to the future protection of SACs.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The sea anglers will have to speak for themselves but my understanding is that they feel the activity interferes with the integrity of the SAC, and they have an interest, as we all do, in conservation. The area is renowned for dolphins which are an important tourism attraction for the area. The fishing activity is, in essence, an interference with their habitat and they have been recognised under the SAC designation as having an entitlement not to be disturbed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is confusing two separate issues. We all want to see conservation and ensure sea angling is not affected by intensive fishing by commercial fishermen in areas which have potential for sea angling. The question of interference with dolphins or other mammals is a separate question and I am sure everyone would be of the view that we should ensure that no activity takes place which endangers the presence of dolphins in the Shannon Estuary or any other area. I am satisfied, given the limited amount of sprat fishing which occurred in this area, that that would not happen.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that we would all be concerned were there to be fishing activity which would interfere with dolphins or other mammals because it is a most welcome development to see dolphins coming into the Shannon Estuary and other parts of the coast. As has been proved in the case of Dingle, we welcome them and like to see them stay. We are not going to endanger their presence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Youghal has been identified as the principal coastal protection priority in the east Cork region by Cork County Council. Under the coastal protection programme for 1999, I provided funding of £40,000 towards an engineering study of the protection needs at Youghal. My Department has been advised by the county council that this assessment is completed and that it will be forwarded to my Department within a <Col N="1174" /> matter of weeks. My Department has underlined to the county council the need for submission of proposals without further delay given that the Coastal Protection Programme 2001 is being finalised.</P>
      <P>The funding requirements for coastal protection in County Cork generally, including Youghal, will be considered fully in finalising the coastal protection programme for 2001, but I stress that my Department is dependent on the timely input by Cork County Council and other coastal local authorities of coastal protection priorities.</P>
      <P>As regards marine infrastructure development, Ballycotton and Youghal harbours are both owned by Cork County Council. The county council is responsible for maintenance and development and, to date, no development proposals have been received from Cork County Council in respect of Youghal. Comprehensive development proposals for the harbour at Ballycotton were put to my Department last year by the Ballycotton Development Association. Cork County Council supports the association's proposals and has sought financial assistance to allow the proposed works to be undertaken on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>The funding context for all such proposals is as follows. My Department is developing an investment support scheme for the marine tourism and leisure sector. One of the main objectives of the marine tourism grant scheme is to improve marine tourism access infrastructure. A sum of £20 million has been allocated to the sector under the national development plan of which £6 million is allocated to the south and east regions. The scheme will be launched early in the new year.</P>
      <P>I visited Youghal some months ago, as the Deputy is aware, and examined the proposals presented to me by the local association. These will be considered in the context of the overall expenditure programme.</P>

The Minister has seen the place and I thank him for coming and inspecting it. Is he not aware that the harbour is silted up, that the lifeboat has a problem getting in and out, that the sea wall, the breakwater, is in danger of collapsing and that a great deal of work is needed?

I am conscious of the need for work in the area. I am anxious to be of assistance and it is my intention to be so.

      <P>I would be the first to admit that we always need more. However, we have a comprehensive programme of infrastructural development going on around the coast. There is no question but that the amount of money currently at my disposal is adequate to meet requirements. When I asked the Deputy &ldquo;which one?&rdquo;, he said &ldquo;both&rdquo;. As politicians, we have to be responsible. We cannot put multi-million pound developments every couple of miles along the coast. We have to make choices and we must be careful to obtain a commercial economic return from the strategic infrastructural planning we undertake. One of my major concerns is to obtain a proper return on the expenditure of taxpayers' money. I am also anxious to avoid any duplication of resources, which is what the Deputy seems to want, given his earlier answer to my question.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in answer to a similar question raised in the House on 17 October, my Department has set up and is facilitating discussions between representatives of the Irish Offshore Operators Association, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Offshore Suppliers Association on the utilisation of Irish resources and services in the offshore petroleum industry. These discussions are ongoing. Exploration and production companies employ Irish workers in offshore exploration and development, particularly in the Kinsale gas field. I have continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators Association and the individual operators that Irish workers and suppliers of goods and services, including service ports, must be given opportunities to participate fully in such activities and I will continue to do so. In a recent address to the Institute of Petroleum, I made it clear that the Government does not expect the industry to avail of Irish goods, services or employment where they are clearly uncompetitive. The Government expects the industry to encourage and facilitate potential Irish suppliers to compete for the services required. This should be done in partnership with State agencies and should be seen as part of the industry's commitment to Ireland, within a long-term commercial and marketing framework. Any company operating in Ireland for the long-term should see that it is in its own best commercial interest to build strong links into the economy and to demonstrate a significant economic and social dividend both at regional and national level.</P>
      <P>I have designated Enterprise Ireland as the State agency to act as facilitator between operators and Irish providers. However, the industry should engage even more intensively with Enterprise Ireland and FÁS in ensuring that the potential for Irish personnel, goods, services and technology transfer is fully exploited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's policy is to ensure that the economy benefits to the maximum extent possible from any current and future offshore explor<Col N="1177" /> ation activities, within the constraints of EU legislation. Crucial to that is the need to ensure that all potential contractors or suppliers of service are made aware of present and future requirements of operators and main contractors.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>I have asked Enterprise Ireland to intensify its business awareness efforts. In that context, my Department organised a contract awareness seminar for the offshore sector. This was held in Westport on 14 April last. The seminar, which was a success, brought together the main parties involved in the offshore industry and enabled Irish companies in the goods and services sector to hear at first hand of the opportunities available in the offshore sector. On 14 September last, Enterprise Ireland organised a Corrib gas seminar in which the probable contractual requirements and their structure was addressed by Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited.</P>
    <P>In addition, it was agreed that Enterprise Ireland would work directly with the Irish Offshore Operators Association and specific operators to ensure that there is early notification of future offshore work to potential Irish participants. I am glad the Irish Offshore Operators Association is committed to fully supporting these opportunities.</P>
    <P>I am confident that as a result, Irish companies will realise they have the skills to participate in the exploration industry through the supply of goods and services. Enterprise Energy Ireland gave a commitment to increase servicing activity from Ireland this year and a number of contracts were agreed with Irish companies for the provision of various services. The onshore work likely to be involved in connecting any offshore gas supply to the national grid will be a major employer of Irish goods and services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there any indication from the Westport conference as to whether consideration will be given to hiring and/or training Irish workers? It was indicated in some of the national media that Irish workers did not have the skills required to man some of these rigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had ongoing discussions with the IOOA and with individual companies concerned, such as Enterprise Energy. I impressed upon them the need for positive discrimination in favour of Irish workers. I have had a positive response from the industry. While there have been some difficulties in the past, I am quite satisfied that, following discussions with SIPTU in the past week and with the industry, we can overcome these difficulties and that Irish workers will be employed on all aspects of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the difficulties for the industry and for Enterprise Energy is that if a rig comes in once a year for two or three months during the summer, like any boat it is fully crewed. It is not easy to bring in some people for a short period who may then wish to depart. A compromise might be to <Col N="1178" /> have more Irish workers working on these drilling rigs when they come here, as well as travelling with them when they go away. I am satisfied that any training requirements will be made available through FÁS and Enterprise Ireland which is also working on this matter. I am satisfied that the necessary contacts are now being made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister inform the House if the offshore companies are taking these contacts with Enterprise Ireland and FÁS seriously? It has been represented to me that many offshore companies do what they like and do not take a great deal of notice of what Enterprise Ireland and FÁS do. Will the Minister indicate the volume of contact there has been with Enterprise Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been constant contact between Enterprise Ireland and the industry which is not offshore. Enterprise Energy is based here. There has been much co-operation, but the contrary impression has been created by a small minority, and it is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed this with representatives of the industry recently and they are very committed to the process of involvement with Enterprise Ireland and with FÁS. They are also interested in employing Irish workers. The proof is there in the amount of services provided out of Killybegs this summer. A significant increase in the servicing that was done out of Scotland the previous summer was done from Killybegs this year. I have made it known in no uncertain terms to the industry that I want the maximum number of Irish people employed in all aspects of the industry. I will continue to reinforce that message with them.</P>

    <P>Under the grant scheme, grants of 50% are provided for the purchase of new safety equipment from an approved list of equipment. The list includes a wide range of life-saving, fire-fighting, navigational and communications equipment. I will be happy to arrange for the Deputy to get a copy of the full list. The 50% grant allocation is <Col N="1179" /> subject to a maximum eligible cost for each item on the approved list.

There are maximum eligible costs for each piece of equipment on the list. As far as I am aware, however &ndash; and I may have to confirm this &ndash; there is no upper grant limit, although it is subject to 50% of the total cost.</P>

      <P>A thorough examination of the final report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into accident DH 248/Rescue 111 Tramore, 2 July 1999 has taken place in my Department. The following is the response of my Department to the recommendations which relate specifically to it. It follows the numbering set out in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recommendation 4.14: my Department has in place training programmes for coastguard units in dealing with hazardous situations. This training is being upgraded in the case of incidents of serious aircraft accidents. On 14 October 2000 the chief <Col N="1180" /> fire officer at Shannon Airport delivered a lecture on the subject of downed aircraft search and rescue techniques at the coastguard area officers' annual conference in Limerick.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 4.15: my Department accepts the need for formalising current relationships and such agreements will be put in place as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 4.16: my Department in its contract relationships with private operators ensures appropriate agreements to its satisfaction are in place between service providers and airport authorities. The Department is not a party to relationships between the Air Corps and airport authorities.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 4.21: my Department has an ongoing training and review programme in place which encompasses, <i>inter alia</i>, aviation requirements. However, a thorough review of aviation requirements will be instituted.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 4.22: the maritime circumstances that gave rise to the rescue mission are well known and documented. Unfortunately, these types of circumstances are all too common despite continuing intensive media and publicity campaigns led by my Department assisted by the RNLI, Irish Water Safety, Civil Defence, CIL and sporting, fishing and various representative organisations. The chief marine surveyor has advised that a formal investigation is not required as all the details are available. The level of call-out to assist leisure craft in difficulty is more than 300 annually. A key aim of my Department is to bring about a fundamental change in safety culture.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 4.25: my Department has to be satisfied when taking on private contractors that they will be fully capable and proficient in providing the required service from date of contract. The relationship with the Air Corps is not contractual in nature and proficiency of crews and assets is primarily a matter for the military authorities.</P>
    <P>My Department is working closely with the Department of Defence to ensure immediate and sustained action on the implementation of recommendations made in the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in my reply of 17 October to similar questions raised in the House, there are developments in relation to two hydrocarbon discoveries in our offshore, the Corrib gas field and the Helvick oilfield. Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited, EEIL, completed a fourth appraisal well in the Corrib gas field in September. The company and its partners are assessing the results from this well in conjunction with the data from previous appraisal wells with a view to determining the extent and characteristics of the reservoir.</P>
      <P>EEIL is of the view that the Corrib field might have in place recoverable reserves of more than 1 trillion cubic feet of gas. This compares to over 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas produced to date from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields. It is too early at this stage, however, to give a precise figure for the size of the gas accumulation and the licensees will not be in a position to do so until they have fully evaluated the discovery. I expect EEIL and its partners to be in a position to decide on the commerciality of the Corrib field in the very near future.</P>
      <P>Offshore petroleum exploration activity continues with 21 exploration licences in place covering 106 blocks or part blocks. In addition, there are eight offshore licensing options and two leases in place. Applications for two further licensing options and two lease undertakings are under consideration in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the likely extent of test drilling in 2001, I expect to see a substantial increase in offshore drilling activity. While no firm proposals have as yet been received in my Department, it is anticipated that up to five exploration wells, one appraisal well and two development wells will be drilled next year. Well commitments beyond 2001, however, only amount to between three and six for the entire Irish offshore and it <Col N="1182" /> is probable that many of the frontier exploration licences issued in the last two to three rounds will be relinquished next year.</P>
    <P>With this in mind I have commenced an initiative aimed at conserving areas of the Irish offshore, that is, closing them off from development, and gauging interest on the part of the industry in making well commitments in certain other limited areas. To that end, I am commencing a consultation process involving companies active here in order to gauge their views on whether well commitments might be forthcoming in the event that a limited number of new licences might be offered. In the light of this process and having regard to other issues, I will early next year consider asking the Government to decide on a limited number of possible further licences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his very detailed response. When is he likely to receive information on the commercial value of the Corrib field? Are we talking about the first quarter of 2001?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of commercial value; the companies involved must first decide on the commerciality of the field, whether they should proceed with a proposed investment of £500 million over the next two years with a view to bringing gas ashore by January 2003. We await this decision, which I understand is to be made shortly by the companies involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Minister is relatively sure that the announcement will be made. Everyone genuinely believes that a huge volume of gas will be brought ashore. All the plans being spoken about will come to naught if the owners decide that, commercially, it is not worth their while bringing it ashore. I assume, therefore, that they know at this stage that the commercial aspect is positive and that we are talking only about procedural matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>While I cannot speak for the companies involved, a decision to spend £500 million is a little more than a procedural matter. While all the indications are positive, the boards of the companies involved have to make a final decision. I cannot anticipate that other than to hope it will be the correct one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can state categorically that my Department is in receipt of accurate information from Enterprise Energy Ireland and is receiving the same information on the drilling results as <Col N="1183" /> that being received by its board in London. I take this opportunity to refute suggestions made by a small number of ill-informed individuals. There is no question but that the State is fully aware of what is happening and the expertise in the Department is fully <i>au fait</i> with everything that is happening on the drilling rig.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>No financial support from the Government is being given towards the investment made by Enterprise Energy Ireland.

Investment by the State involves the gas pipeline from Pollathomas in Mayo to Craughwell in Galway. That is being invested in by the State and part of that investment is being taken up by Enterprise Energy Ireland.</P>

      <Quest>if he will seek the extension of Ireland's exclusive coastal limits to 24 miles as recommended by the Irish national strategy review group; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As I have already advised the House, the CFP strategy review group has produced a wide-ranging and substantive analysis of the key issues to be tackled in the CFP review. The review group has made a strong case for the extension of exclusive coastal limits which would more realistically reflect modern day scenarios. The European Parliament has endorsed the extension of the 12 mile limit to 24 miles and this provides a key reference point for the extension of coastal limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing CFP regulation recognises that there should be special provision for inshore fisheries. This recognition should be enhanced in the 2002 review by expanding the coastal limits which would enable the optimum management and conservation of inshore fish stocks. In Ireland's case inshore fisheries represents 20% of the value of <Col N="1184" /> overall fish landings and over 50% of direct employment in the sector. I will be discussing the group's report with Commissioner Fischler in the next few weeks with a view to ensuring that the Irish perspective directly contributes to Commission thinking in the forthcoming Green Paper. We will also be working to influence other member states and developing strategic alliances, accordingly, on the access issue and other strategic priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will no doubt recall the response I gave to his earlier question on 28 June last. I then advised that in February 2000 my Department furnished Waterford County Council with a working document which detailed the likely terms and conditions of a foreshore licence, which it was prepared to recommend to me for approval. In March the council sought clarification on a number of the proposed conditions, including necessary conditions for monitoring of <Col N="1185" /> effluent standards and provision of additional treatment of effluent if required.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, and while the issues raised by the council were being considered, my Department received representations from a major local shellfish co-operative concerning the possible contamination of their mussel beds that lie just outside Cheekpoint. Waterford County Council was immediately requested to comment on the concerns of the local fishermen and did so in October this year.</P>
      <P>My Department has considered the council's reply and has accepted the view of its specialist advisers that the Cheekpoint sewerage scheme should not be allowed to adversely impact upon the water quality of the adjoining mussel beds and that, in consequence, the council must make provision for retro-fitting of tertiary treatment should post construction monitoring of effluent standards so require. The council was advised, accordingly, on 16 November and my Department is currently awaiting the council's acceptance of the principle of retro-fitting of tertiary treatment. It is fair to say that, at present, the Deputy has priorities other than this question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Current projections of the level of afforestation over the next five years are as follows: 2001 &ndash; 16,000 hectares; 2002 &ndash; 18,000 hectares; and 2003-05 &ndash; 20,000 hectares per annum. The cost of afforestation over the period is estimated at approximately £390 million, which is provided for in the rural development plan 2000-2006.</P>
      <P>Planting in recent years was as follows: 1998 &ndash; 12,928 hectares; 1999 &ndash; 12,668 hectares; and 2000 &ndash; estimated 15,000 hectares. While it was substantial, it was below target. Measures to boost afforestation levels in the years ahead include the substantial increase of approximately 30% in the financial incentives for new planting which I negotiated with the European Commission earlier this year, together with my ongoing discussions with the Commission to secure adequate increases for those who planted in earlier years, and the provision for closer integration of forestry and REPS contained in the rural development plan.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the plan, broadleaf planting is forecast to increase to 30% of annual planting, compared with approximately 20% in recent years and 3% in the 1990s. The balance will be made up of conifers, including diverse conifers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Being an optimist, I will not even consider not reaching the target, although it is a possibility. If the targets are not met with regard to hectarage, the moneys could be put towards an increase in planting grants. However, I am extremely keen, particularly from the point of view of climatic change, to use forestry to improve the removal of carbon from the atmosphere. The conifer has the greatest ability to do that. It acts as a lung and releases oxygen into the air. An interesting statistic shows that the average tree, if there is such a thing, will be able to provide sufficient oxygen for a family of four for one year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The projection for planting trees will depend on how the other lines in agri<Col N="1187" /> culture progress in the next few years. They all impinge on the amount of land that will become available. However, the Government must show concern and consideration for the people who did commit themselves to forestry over the years. Newcomers to the industry will take note of how they are treated.</P>
      <P>With regard to planting in designated NHAs, SACs, SPAs and God knows how many other &ldquo;As&rdquo; there might be, will the Minister give an undertaking that under certain conditions farmers who own such properties will be allowed to grow trees on them, if only for the environmental reason the Minister just mentioned? He will be aware that there is almost a blanket ban on planting by farmers who own land in these designated areas.</P>

      <P>Gabhaim mo bhuíochas le Fine Gael as ucht an t-am a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an mBille um Obair Ógra, 2000. Bille an-tábhachtach é seo ach beidh daoine i bPáirtí an Lucht Oibre agus i bPáirtí Fhine Gael a mbeidh brón <Col N="1190" /> orthu go bhfuil deireadh tagtha leis an reachtaíocht dheiridh a bhí ann toisc go raibh sé bunaithe ar chóras dílárnaithe.</P>
      <P>This Bill, which has been generally welcomed &ndash; and I would welcome further support for youth work &ndash; provides for a number of decentralised structures. It is slightly schizophrenic in that it appears to propose to close down decentralised structures on the one hand, yet to bolster them on the other. The objective of the Bill stands on its merits and should be supported, which I propose to do here.</P>
      <P>This Bill contains an aspect of youth work policy, which in itself could give rise to considerable debate regarding the voluntary sector and training that would lead to employment. Much of the Minister of State's contribution was devoted to the monitoring and assessment aspect of the work and the establishment of a national youth work advisory committee. The establishment of these new bodies have been noted by the National Youth Council, Comhairle Náisiúnta nÓg, which contacted me, and I am sure, every Minister and Deputy, to make it clear that it considers its position is not recognised as a co-ordinating body for the voluntary youth organisations. The Bill provides for the establishment of voluntary youth councils for the voluntary sector. I would like the Minister of State to clarify where the responsibilities of one of those council's begins and the other body's ends, whether there will be an overlap in their responsibilities or whether they will share responsibilities in certain aspects?</P>
      <P>The National Youth Council also points out that the Bill, while focusing and correctly prioritising areas of disadvantaged, seems to be focused exclusively on those areas. It points out that all young people should be entitled to the work and resources embodied in this legislation. That aspect requires clarification. When an organisation is not explicitly referred to in legislation, it may consider it is being excluded. The National Youth Council of Ireland has been the natural representative body of voluntary organisations for as long as I can remember and I understand that will continue to be the case, but the Bill raises a question mark over that, given that the reference to other bodies in the Bill is explicit while the reference to the National Youth Council of Ireland is not so explicit. I would like the Minister of State to clarify that point.</P>
      <P>An increase from 22 to 29 members of the national youth work advisory committee is envisaged, taking into account the greater workload it will have and the need for it to be more representative. While those objectives are contained in the Bill, to be consistent, it should also take account of the concerns of the National Youth Council of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality many of us face in dealing with our constituents of all ages has been highlighted in this debate. That is helpful, as it grounds the issues concerning young people. From my contact with young people, two major issues of concern for young people are obvious. One is transport. <Col N="1191" /> Today of all days has been one when transport has been on everyone's mind. The lack of adequate public transport facilities affects young people more as they make up a higher proportion of the population who use public transport.</P>
    <P>A young constituent recently told me that at an interview for a job at Dublin Airport it was agreed that public transport times would be part of the consideration when it came to rostering, yet that person had ended up being rostered to finish work at 2 a.m., 3 a.m. or 4 a.m., and it is a case of &ldquo;like it or lump it&rdquo;. Employers do not appear to recognise not only the concerns but the requirements of young people regarding public transport, particularly when they cannot afford car insurance and through a lack of choice must depend on public transport. I hope the concerns of young people will be heightened by the debate on this Bill to ensure everyone will be able to relate to the experience that is particularly pertinent to young people.</P>
    <P>Another major concern of young people is the lack of facilities available, ranging from the lack of playgrounds for the very young to not having a drop in centre or sports facilities. The provision of resources would partly address that problem. I hope Deputy Carey was correct when he gave a commitment that the Government would not be found wanting in providing resources. However, there is an added problem that requires the full co-operation of the insurance industry. The Bill provides that the Minister would arrange for the carrying out of research. I presume that is not a new development. The Bill is explicit in stating that there will be increased levels of research into the concerns and needs of young people. If I could make one request for research, it would be for research in that area. I have attended a number of conferences, one in particular on the needs of young people in Trinity College. The speakers who came from the UK and other countries outside Ireland were able to report that those countries appear to have got their act together in relation to satisfying the needs of insurance companies regarding facilities for young people of all ages.</P>
    <P>The lack of playground facilities is a sad indictment of our failure to meet the needs and development of young people. In the UK it appears that one can establish a playground in an area which is overlooked by housing that is maintained once a week and get public liability from an insurance company for it. Every institution is afraid of litigation &ndash; that is why public liability insurance is required &ndash; but we must grasp the nettle and not be bullied into taking so many precautions with facilities that we have none in case there is litigation. Then the losers are young people and that affects the future of the country, so we are all losers due to this head in the sand approach.</P>
    <P>This is a big concern that should be tackled, though not with the same disruptive effect as the <Col N="1192" /> taxi issue. I am not sure whether one will see young people engaged in that kind of law-breaking activity but it is important to grasp the nettle on behalf of those young people who are being denied basic facilities. Any time I canvass some adult says to me: &ldquo;There is a gang down there and they are going to cause trouble, I know it. They are hanging around in the dark and they are a threat.&rdquo; I go down to those young people, as most Deputies would in those circumstances, and talk to them. I do not say that a person down the road says they are a threat but I ask them what they like to do and what they would like to see done. Almost always they say: &ldquo;If only there was somewhere we could go.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sometimes they have been thrown out of or do not fit into local youth organisations. However, the most basic facility would be a drop-in centre with a couple of pool tables, a coffee machine and some chairs and tables. We are talking about providing little more than that yet it is not available and when available it is so restrictive as not to be practical. I hope the issue of insurance for youth facilities will be researched and that dialogue will bring about an improvement in those facilities, as currently they are sadly lacking. It seems to come down to insurance; that is what local authorities are pointing the finger at.</P>
    <P>Different Departments should also discuss the issue. Recently I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation about sports facilities and the difficulties being experienced by those trying to start such facilities due to insurance costs. The only reply was that any of the applications received for grant assistance did not mention a problem with insurance. I would be very surprised if anyone looking for grant assistance would point out the problems in establishing the facility if they get the grant; chances are they will let that go until they get the grant and then try to make use of it. That is the reality. Although the Minister may not be told about it I could name many people who could tell him about it; the Minister of State probably knows about it. That is what I would like to see happen here. It is even more important than the resources issue, which is important, but there is a blockage in the system in providing facilities for young people. That blockage must be broken.</P>
    <P>Next year is the United Nations Year of the Volunteer and hopefully this Bill will fit in well with that objective. There is no doubt that youth work is suffering badly due to the shortage of volunteers. I have been a scout leader in Dublin and Cork and have done youth work through the years but at present I find it very difficult to find time for anything other than being a Deputy, a view which other Deputies will understand. There is a general lack of willingness and time among people to become volunteers and hopefully it can become part of the developmental work following the passing of this Bill to target adults who are in a position to pass on some of their experiences which might be of benefit to young people. <Col N="1193" /> That could provide the volunteers who are so badly needed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey said that many of the administrative positions in youth organisations can be top heavy with people who may be young in mind but not in body. That works both ways, however; one needs the experience of people who have been around and who know what life is all about, whether in business or other fields. There is a shortage of such volunteers and I hope the Bill addresses that, as it is dragging down and breaking communities throughout the country which can no longer depend on volunteers.</P>
    <P>The experience of youth work in other countries is fascinating. I had a rare opportunity that I will always treasure to attend a meeting of the World Scout Parliamentary Union, a body that is strongest in eastern Asia and eastern Europe. It developed out of a tradition in many Asian countries where youth work was not optional but was part of youth development. In many countries one had the choice of joining the scouts, the guides or the Red Cross. A person chose one of the three but not choosing was not an option. That may be going too far with the mandatory option and does not tie in with the spirit of the Year of the Volunteer but it highlights the importance associated with youth work, whether that is youth training or the involvement of the young in their own development. It is seen as integral and vital for the development of young people and the building of a free-thinking, diverse, democratic society. We should get the message across that when people are deciding whether or not to become involved in a youth organisation it should be pointed out that it is not just an alternative to looking at television but is an integral part of a country developing its greatest asset and resource &ndash; its young people.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will help develop that debate and put in place necessary resources. It should also help to clear the blockage that I mentioned in relation to insurance, the provision of facilities and the recruitment of volunteers.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to the debate on the Youth Work Bill, 2000, an Bille um Obair Ógra, and I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, on bringing in this legislation. This is a timely opportunity to discuss legislation that affects young people. Last year, when I was a member of the foreign affairs committee, I received an invitation to a youth parliament meeting in the Philippines. We were asked to send two members who were under 40 but we only had one member under 40 on the committee. We are often reminded that we have some young Members here but we did not have enough young people under the required age on the foreign affairs committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is welcome. The Minister said it was a long time in gestation but he has got it right and I am glad we are debating it. From speaking to people in the voluntary sector, I am aware that they have always been concerned that there would be recognition of the work they do and that they would be represented in the committees to be formed from this legislation. I was glad to hear the Minister say that it was essential to recognise the voluntary nature of youth work provision and to give recognition to that in the Bill. He proposes that a minimum of 75% of the members should be made up of volunteers and at least one fifth of the membership of the council will be made up of young persons under 25 years of age. That is welcome. The fact that the voluntary youth councils will nominate one half of the membership of youth work committees is welcome also. The Minister has addressed the important concerns of people who are working in a voluntary capacity for young people.</P>
      <P>Many youth councils and federations do not operate on a strict county basis. That is important when one considers that the role of the vocational education committees is very much to the fore in the Bill. An organisation which calls itself the County Roscommon Youth Service looks after many of the youth clubs and young people in north Galway. Organisations such as that which cross county borders to look after the needs of young people should be recognised in some way.</P>
      <P>One of the finest organisations I know in the west is the No Name Club, which is geared to providing entertainment for people in an atmosphere where alcoholic drink is not served. It is called a different name in Mayo, Dóthain, the Irish for &ldquo;enough&rdquo; and a different name again in Roscommon. The people who are involved in these organisations, which run discos and quizzes in venues where alcohol is not served, are doing very good work and I would like the Minister of State, under some heading, to help them with funding. They get some small sums of money through the Department and the various vocational education committees but they need more encouragement and assistance from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grants such as the sports for all and the youth project grants are available. They provide small sums of money on an ongoing basis and are very useful. All sporting clubs and the no name clubs benefit from those grants but the only scheme in the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation that is of major benefit is the sports capital grants. When we talk about capital grants we are talking about constructing buildings or developing sports fields or community halls but there is little by way of help for the smaller clubs faced with ongoing finance and maintenance costs. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and <Col N="1195" /> Recreation, Deputy McDaid, has talked about allocating money for equipment, which is useful for people who have equipment in halls or sports centres. If that commitment is honoured, we will be able to get more money for young people because the money that is going towards capital projects presupposes that there will be construction or development of the type I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State referred to the functions of the vocational education committees, which have shown their commitment to sport through the sport for all grants and the youth project grants. It was encouraging also to hear the Minister refer to the setting up of a youth work advisory committee. That committee will foster a spirit of co-operation in the youth sector. The Minister stated also that he will be increasing the number of members on the VEC to take account of the extra workload of the vocational education committees in relation to the provision of services for our young people. The vocational education committees are doing excellent work and they are made up of a broad cross-section of people. Under the new proposal, people from the IDA will be part of the membership. That is important because that organisation deals with the education of young people. I hope the vocational education committees will be successful in the work they are doing.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the work of the Roscommon youth service. I recently attended a launch of its proposals for next year and up to 2003. One of the interesting points made at the launch was that the service was getting a grant of £70,000 to cover youth clubs in Roscommon and three clubs in north Galway. The people at the launch made the point that in the region of £70,000 would be paid to look after a young person in a detention centre for a year. When young people get into trouble, it is important to have a system in place where they can get involved at an early stage in these clubs. That would be of great benefit.</P>
    <P>There are three clubs in Galway and 12 in Roscommon doing that kind of work and an indication of their success is that they have been able to progress their services every year. Obviously they need more money and they have lobbied successive Governments to get more funding. FÁS has been helpful to them in that regard. These clubs had a long struggle to get a premises. One such club is Day One in Roscommon, which Deputy Fahey, when he was Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, opened. They have a library in Castleblakeney, County Galway, so they have a basic office and library which they can build on. That organisation can do even more work for the young people of Galway and Roscommon. I ask the Minister to consider the development plan sent to his Department which covers the period 2000-03 and which highlights that volunteers and part-time and full-time staff are working together. This is a <Col N="1196" /> non-profit organisation which works with the young people of Roscommon and north Galway.</P>
    <P>The plan highlights that the group is pleased that, in future, it will know the amount of funding it will receive. Up to now the allocation of funding for youth organisations has been on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis but the Bill will mean that organisations will know how much funding they are to receive. For example, the youth federation has stressed the need for the establishment of a youth service. It is important to put in place the financial, human and policy resources needed, and to develop the national youth service. Legislation is important is this regard and that is why I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <P>On 13 September, when he launched a White Paper called A Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, mentioned the formal recognition we should accord to the community and voluntary sector in contributing to the creation of a vibrant, participative democracy and civil society. The Minister also stated that the voluntary and community sector is seen as an essential partner in economic and social development. This comment highlights that youth work deserves Government recognition for its educational value in addition to its community development potential.</P>
    <P>The National Youth Federation has identified a number of priorities which must be put in place to ensure the future delivery of quality youth services in urban and rural settings. These strategic priorities must be implemented in a co-ordinated and incremental way so as to achieve the comprehensive delivery of improved services. These priorities are linked and cannot be traded off one against the other.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a sectoral framework for the first time. New procedures resulting from the enactment of the Bill and the implementation of the national youth work development plan, should take account of establishing a transparent system for the operation of existing grants schemes for youth work and youth service delivery before further expansion of existing schemes or new schemes are put in place. It is also important to audit existing services to identify quality and effectiveness and significant gaps in provision, thus targeting specific areas for service delivery within the lifetime of the plan. The Bill also challenges and eliminates unnecessary overlaps by existing providers.</P>
    <P>The National Youth Federation would like to see the establishment of a policy and evaluation unit which would provide the relevant experience and skills through departmental officials for the implementation and development of youth services based on quality and best practices drawn from local, national and European learning. The federation is of the opinion that a team of youth work assessors and policy makers should be put in place to source relevant information and undertake research which would inspire volunteers and staff to work towards a brighter future for young people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> Policies are needed in areas such as child protection, youth participation, volunteer development, arts and cultural activities, quality assurance and curriculum development. The federation is keen to see the introduction of multi-annual funding to ensure a stable and credible range of services for voluntary youth organisations. I hope the Government's commitment to this area will be the norm for priority services.</P>
    <P>The issue of salary scales and common grades across the sector has been brought to my attention. The contribution of paid staff is vital for each organisation in the areas of retraining and developing human resources. As I understand it, the grant-in-aid from the Department of Education and Science does not recognise salary scales while the investment by organisations in the training and development of staff gives rise to valuable personnel being poached and-or attracted by higher scales, particularly those available within the statutory sector or through new initiatives such as the partnership companies.</P>
    <P>Departments are funding youth initiatives at different benchmark levels. The Department of Education and Science appears to operate a lower level than other Departments such as the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Social, Community and Family Affairs. It is time we introduced benchmarking which incorporated recognition for human, programme and capital structure costs. This should be agreed and adhered to as part of the recognition accorded to the community and voluntary sector, including the delivery of youth services.</P>
    <P>Local youth services provide a unique facility for the provision of integrated, community-based services whereby youth projects and initiatives sit within a single organisation, thus achieving economies of scale, effective co-ordination and a significant profiling of young people's needs by virtue of the multiplicity of services available. However, this requires financial assistance which is the major bone of contention with youth services.</P>
    <P>The National Youth Federation also proposes that any new funds would operate through the proposed VEC administrative systems, based on agreed procedures and criteria, and approved by the national youth work advisory committees. This will require that between the enactment of the legislation and the implementation of the youth work development plan, there should be an interregnum to examine this situation.</P>
    <P>The current infrastructure for youth services requires examination. I referred to the long wait for premises experienced by the County Roscommon youth service. Well maintained buildings and access to facilities provided by statutory agencies such as vocational education committees would be a key resource. Funding is required to ensure infrastructural requirements such as buildings, equipment, transport and educational and recreational facilities are put in place in a co-ordinated fashion within the catchment of each VEC and under the management of youth service <Col N="1198" /> organisations. Where a national youth organisation overlaps two counties, there should be co-operation between the two vocational education committees involved.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation but it will not succeed unless we increase the participation of young people. We must examine this issue, including democracy and the importance of people exercising their vote. We know from the turn-out at elections that young people have not been engaged in the democratic process. Improved participation at local level in the first instance would be assisted by local government, Dáil and other kinds of reform about which we talk.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister on introducing this Bill. Young people will contribute to the design and implementation of services which will have to be attractive, accessible and relevant to their peers, in partnership with the vocational education committees to which I pay tribute and the committed volunteers who are so important in the provision of services for young people.</P>

      <P>Like my colleagues, I am delighted we have the opportunity to discuss this legislation. It is a pity that on a Thursday evening at 4.30 there are not very many Members interested in it. This type of legislation has been long awaited. I was in college in 1984 when we first discussed the national youth policy committee report. We all were naive at the time in UCD in thinking this would be implemented immediately if not sooner. We had discussions in 1997 with the introduction of a previous Bill and thank goodness Fianna Fáil got into Government and removed the notion of regional education boards and that we have referred the structures back to the vocational educational committees. It has never been more important to support young people and in particular to support youth work. Our population is very young and the necessity to support young people outside of the sporting arena and ensure personal development and assertiveness must be recognised. I am familiar with the youth services in my constituency involving drop-in centres providing youth information. They have been used by the statutory services, in particular the health board and the juvenile liaison officer in supporting young people who have found themselves in trouble with the law for instance. The youth services have been very involved in the probation service and have had referrals from the juvenile liaison officer and from other services. That is commendable work and I thank all of those involved in youth work in County Donegal. There are 18 permanent youth workers currently, who have really made a difference for the young people in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation will provide for people between ten and 21 years of age. Perhaps the Minister could reconsider that. Why should it apply at 10 and not younger? I thought this could perhaps encompass children in primary school from five years of age and up to 25, which is the normal definition of someone in youth work. Many youth <Col N="1199" /> organisations, for example the scouts and some youth clubs start with children who are just beyond the pre-school and play group age. Perhaps the Minister will consider if there could be an extension of the age group in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am delighted Donegal VEC has been forthright in addressing the legislation. It has always been very aware of youth work, and has been involved with Foróige which has been tremendous for the young people in rural Ireland in particular. It holds achievement days, and is very involved in all sort of activities with the elderly, with environmental projects and with all sorts of awareness projects. It is suggested that nowdays there is a notion of paid volunteers and that the concept of volunteerism is dwindling. That is not so along the western seaboard, where Foróige had 19 clubs last year and 38 very active clubs this year. That shows that volunteerism is alive and kicking. That is also attributed to the youth workers who are there to support and generate enthusiasm and to many of the parents. Perhaps it is not the volunteerism that has gone but the support from the parents, which is also very important. The youth work done currently is not a baby-sitting service, it is an all-encompassing service in which parents should also be encouraged. Teachers and people involved with young people should be encouraged in supporting young people through the youth work systems. My colleague Deputy Keaveney and I have been very strong in trying to ensure that County Donegal has a drugs and alcohol abuse awareness programme through the youth projects. The Garda are keen to support that through community development programmes. The link with the educational aspects of the vocational education committees will also be very important. That is why I commend the co-ordinating role of the vocational education committees which ultimately will link to the Minister's Department, which is important.</P>
    <P>A number of issues could be further clarified by the Minister on Committee Stage. the legislation refers to the vocational education committees, the sub-committee and the link through the national youth work committee which will link with the Minister's Department and the statutory authorities. If the Minister tells the vocational education committees they have a co-ordinating role in consultation with the youth work services already there, what is to stop another statutory agency, for example, setting up something that the VEC considers unnecessary? Will the VEC and the youth work committee have the ultimate co-ordinating roles so that people will not be able to set up almost anything if they think they can obtain a few pounds to set it up? Quality assurance will be very important in youth work provision and I wish to be assured by the Minister of the role of the VEC in co-ordinating youth work projects and that there would not be <i>ad hoc</i> procedures in the administrative areas.</P>
    <P>Funding will be very important. The Department says the introduction of this legislation will <Col N="1200" /> not have a huge financial implication. Perhaps that was just to get it through the Cabinet and past the Minister for Finance. Now that we have the opportunity to provide the proper structures for the service to be provided, we must have financial and administrative back-up. It cannot be done willy-nilly. It is important to ensure that there will be administrative people available to support it and not to the detriment of other parts of the VEC structure. Also, the groups should be financially viable for three to five years. A three year plan is proposed. Perhaps we could have a five year initial plan which would allow a lead-in period so that people can be set up and at least have achieved something?</P>
    <P>One of the concerns locally regarding the financial aspects of support of the youth work services is that the partnerships have been very involved. The partnerships have taken up the slack in respect of which the Government and the Department of Education and Science have not been in a position to take action. There are three partnership companies in County Donegal which have established a group in the Gaeltacht areas to deal with specific needs and they have taken action to cater for the needs of the disadvantaged. One of their concerns is that youth workers have not been appointed on a permanent basis. It is difficult to set up and maintain projects if the people involved are only appointed on a temporary basis. The funding mechanism will be very important in that context.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State indicated that a policy of gender-proofing will be pursued in respect of the people who will be elected or selected to serve on the relevant committees. In my opinion a policy of &ldquo;rural-proofing&rdquo; should also be pursued. The Minister of State indicated that there is a desirability to have representations from Traveller groups and other minorities. I ask that a more stringent line should be taken and, of necessity, people from the groups to which the Minister of State referred should be appointed to these committees. The disabled and those with special needs should also be able to participate in the youth work services in their locality. These people must be given recognition.</P>
    <P>A number of young people have informed me that the national youth work advisory committee places too much emphasis on the statutory bodies and not enough on the voluntary youth groups. A balance must be achieved in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are many youth clubs and organisations in County Donegal which are denominational in nature. I am in favour of young people growing up and working together, regardless of their denomination, but there are some clubs in the Protestant community in my constituency that wish to retain their current denominational status and they should be allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>There should be some freedom in terms of appointing people to serve on the sub-committees and as representatives on the vocational education committees. In my constituency, there would be a need to appoint spokespersons who <Col N="1201" /> are involved with the Gaeltacht youth clubs, the disabled etc. There must be an element of flexibility in terms of those who will be appointed by the Department.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, a number of undesirable individuals have been involved in youth work. I ask the Minister of State to put in place a code of ethics similar to that which applies in respect of those working in sport. Those involved in youth work should be properly trained and there should be a code of ethics by which they must abide. A voluntary code of ethics applies in the area of sport and I see no difficulty with introducing such a code and a set of national guidelines in respect of youth work.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the debate relating to youth committees is that the young people involved want to be paid. I do not believe the legislation makes provision in that regard. However, I promised those with whom I was in contact in respect of the Bill that I would bring this matter to the Minister of State's attention because these people feel they receive no recognition while members of the statutory bodies obtain travelling expenses etc.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter in respect of which I wish to seek clarification, namely, the appointment of assessors. This is tied in to the quality assurance aspect of the legislation. I live in a county which has a landmass of 483,000 hectares and a population of 130,000. Given that my county is so sparsely populated, it will be very difficult to assess the various clubs.</P>

      <P>In recent years streets and roads in urban areas, particularly those in the greater Dublin area, have been continually wrecked and devastated by telecom operators, with subcontractors behaving like cowboys in an old gold rush film with repeated excavation. In one case a telecom company secretly excavated the excavation of another company in order to <Col N="1203" /> install an extra channel. The road network in the four county council areas, particularly in the north and west sides, has been devastated. For example, Dame Street has been excavated approximately 100 times over the past 20 months, while East Wall Road has been excavated 38 times and Beaumont Road in my constituency no less than 60 times in the past year. The same applies to an entire network of roads, including Kilmore Road, Tonlegee Road and Baldoyle Road.</P>
      <P>On the Minister's instructions, local authorities have installed new bus lanes, cycle routes etc. on many roads in Dublin. However, within a few months of the installation of the new bus lane on the Malahide Road telecom cowboys destroyed it. There are similar examples throughout the north of the city. Local authorities do not receive a penny for these excavations, which are very dangerous. Last week in my constituency a 75 year old woman stumbled over an excavation, while I had the horrible experience of falling over a flagstone in Lower Exchange Street while rushing to a Dublin City Council meeting.</P>
      <P>The Government is responsible for this chaos. There are 72 licensed operators claiming the right to excavate the streets, 11 of which are currently laying facilities on streets on the north side. For example, NTL is installing massive infrastructure to link up with the broadband network in Clonshaugh, while Esat, which is now British Telecom, Cable &amp; Wireless, Worldcom, the City of London Telecom's COLT, are pulling streets and roads apart. All these companies claim the right to excavate. Local authorities do not receive a penny for these excavations which cause disturbance to pedestrians, cyclists and drivers and massive long-term damage to roads. In cases where excavations should be completed roads and streets are beginning to subside and holes are starting to appear.</P>
      <P>Some months ago during the debate on the planning legislation, Deputy Gilmore identified the reason for the problem, that is, this area is governed by obsolete legislation, the Telegraph Act, 1863. When deregulation was introduced in 1996 and 1997 we should have had a major overhaul of this area, including the recasting of the Act or the introduction of new planning legislation to regulate the 71 companies which claim the absolute right to excavate streets and roads. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, are proposing a new infrastructure Bill which apparently will attempt to grapple with the key issue of property rights in subterranean areas and public spaces. We need a new telecom Bill to regulate the behaviour of these people and the amount of money they should pay for disrupting public space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The core issue is that a valuable national resource, public streets and roads, are being seized and devastated by cowboy operators with <Col N="1204" /> impunity, and there has been no response to the problem by the Government to date. Local authorities are currently negotiating with the Association of Licensed Telecom Operators to put forward some solution but so far the Dublin City Manager, John Fitzgerald, the Fingal County Manager, Willie Soffe, and the road engineers in the two counties I represent have not received a response from the Government to repeated requests for legislation. Alternatively it could, as suggested by Deputy Gilmore, recast the planning legislation in such a way that there is control. We are totally exacerbated with the failure of the Government to regulate these utilities and introduce a proper legal structure against which they can operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be present in the House to respond to his matter and has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on this important issue. There are extensive powers available to local authorities to control road openings. Section 101D of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as inserted by the Dublin Transport Authority (Dissolution) Act, 1987, empowers prescribed road authorities to issue directions to statutory undertakers, including telecommunications operators, and others for the purpose of co-ordinating road openings and minimising traffic disruption. Under the Road Traffic (Co-ordination of Roadworks) Regulations, 1992, the following urban authorities are authorised to exercise these powers: Dublin Corporation, South Dublin County Council, Fingal County Council, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway Corporations.</P>
      <P>General guidance on the need for an efficient and expeditious approach to the carrying out of road works, whether by road authorities or other statutory undertakers, is contained in the Department's memorandum on grants for non-national roads. Similar advice is issued to road authorities by the NRA in relation to national roads. The detailed operation of relevant controls is, however, the responsibility of the road authority concerned. Dublin Corporation is making extensive use of the powers vested in it through its Directions for the Control and Management of Roadworks in Dublin City.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999, which is currently before the Seanad, proposes to modernise legislation in relation to road openings by telecom operators. It is designed to enhance local authority powers by obliging telecommunications operators to obtain the consent of the local authority before opening a road to lay underground telecommunications infrastructure. Under section 15 of the Bill, a local authority will be empowered to make its consent subject to conditions. Such conditions could involve a <Col N="1205" /> reduction in the number of telecommunications-related road openings by ensuring that road openings are co-ordinated, trenches are shared and spare ducts are laid for future use by other operators. In addition, the Minister recently indicated that he will consider the need for strengthening legislation to control road openings, and that process is currently under way. In the meantime the Minister has asked the Dublin Transportation Office, in consultation with local authorities in the DTO area, to assess to what extent the approaches taken to the opening and reinstatement of roads and paths for the installation of telecommunications infrastructure could be better managed.</P>
    <P>As regards a possible strengthening of the statutory controls relating to road openings, there are a number of factors that must be taken into consideration when looking at these issue. On the one hand, there is considerable pressure to improve the telecom infrastructure, while the deregulation of the telecom market, together with the proliferation of telecom operators, has added to the pressure for rapid development and the extension of services in this area. On the other hand, such works cause considerable disruption and delays and need to be controlled in the public interest. Any additional regulation of road openings would, therefore, have to balance the interests of local communities and their desire to restrict road openings with those of the telecom sector and the acknowledged need to improve our telecom infrastructure. This approach is also reflected in the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill.</P>
    <P>Given the importance of the sector for the economy and in the interests of efficiency, it would also be important to ensure that any new system of controls on road openings is not overly bureaucratic or rigid as this could delay the provision of infrastructure and possibly lead to increased costs, which would be borne by the consumer. It must also be pointed out that the scope for strict regulation on road openings will be limited to some extent by the need to provide emergency access to underground infrastructure.</P>
    <P>In so far as the period immediately ahead is concerned, the Dublin Transportation Office is preparing and co-ordinating Operation Freeflow 2000 with the other agencies concerned in order to optimise the management of traffic in the Dublin area during the traditionally busy pre-Christmas and new year period. Details of the Operation Freeflow 2000 programme, which will run from early December to mid-January 2001, are being finalised. No new roadworks, except emergency works, will be permitted from 1 December to 15 January 2001. All existing works must be ceased by 8 December at the latest.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that efforts are being made to address this issue and that a balance must be struck which will cater for the interests of all parties concerned.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter and I thank the Minister for being present, however belatedly. The price of beef has fallen dramatically and farmers are under severe pressure. The price of heavy beef has fallen by between £60 and £70 a head and in some cases by £100 a head. The Minister will agree this is not sustainable and farmers will not survive.</P>
      <P>Live exports are under pressure and have been stopped in many locations for the past two weeks and in some cases for the past month. What is the position in regard to live exports? What action has the Minister taken? What action does he intend to take? We do not want a blockade of factories similar to that which occurred last January. Has the Minister met the factory owners and farmers? Has he investigated the scenario overseas? What has he done to address this issue in Europe? A similar situation occurred in 1996 and last year and we have been around this course previously. The resolution of the problem should be in the Minister's hands.</P>
      <P>What early warning system is in place in the Department? How long has it been since the fall in prices was noticed? What happened at that stage? How long does the Minister envisage this crisis continuing? What compensation, support and help will his Department provide to farmers? Are jobs at risk in the meat factories? Is it true that factories are on the verge of closing because of the crisis?</P>
      <P>I did not come into the House to lambast the Minister but there should be action on this issue. What has the Minister done or what does he intend to do both nationally and at European level to resolve this problem speedily? We do not want the issue drawn out until after Christmas. Farmers and their families will not survive because they cannot sustain such enormous losses. Farmers must take heavy beef off the land. Beef prices were guaranteed in the 1990s but they have fallen. I hope the Minister has positive news for farmers and people working in the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to you, Acting Chairman, the House and Deputy Stanton for being late. There was a complete misunderstanding and I profoundly apologise for this discourtesy to the House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the recent developments on BSE and its effect on the beef market. The market is suffering from a serious reduction in consumer confidence in some of our major markets as a result of certain events in France. This in turn has led to a sharp fall in consumption and, accordingly, a contraction of market outlets for Irish beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My approach is to tackle the problem on two fronts. Consumer confidence in beef needs to be restored and the decisions taken at the Council of Ministers meeting last Monday were important <Col N="1207" /> in this regard. The standing veterinary committee also took decisions in regard to increasing testing of cattle for BSE. This should make a considerable contribution to the achievement of that objective.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, Ireland has a rapid, reliable system for testing cattle. The decision by the Council of Ministers was to introduce this system for animals at risk from 1 January next but I believe it should be extended to more than cattle at risk. The cost is approximately £50 per head but under a tendering system that could be reduced substantially. If the test cost, for example, between £12 and £15 per head for an animal worth between £700 and £1,000 it would be reasonable. We succeeded in getting the Council of Ministers to agree the co-financing of the test by the EU and national governments. We can speed up the introduction of a more extensive testing system than that envisaged by the EU.</P>
    <P>For example, it was suggested that the extension of the testing should be re-examined on 1 July 2001 but that is not way to treat consumers. Measures should be implemented to ensure absolute security and safety. Ireland is more vulnerable than any other European country because it is dependent on export markets for 90% of what it produces.</P>
    <P>Given the dependence of the beef industry on export markets it is not surprising that the beef market has been affected by the current difficulties in the French market which, unfortunately, have spilled over into the Italian and Spanish markets. Outside the EU there was a problem in the markets of Oman and Russia. France is an important market for beef, particularly cow beef, and the considerable fall in beef consumption there has led to a major reduction in Irish beef exports to that market.</P>
    <P>The impact of all this is evidenced in the fall in cattle prices in recent weeks, particularly cow prices. I emphasise that the high volume markets remain open. Our biggest market is Egypt, which imports 150,000 tonnes of beef, and the last thing we want to hear is that it has closed its market as that would leave us in a dreadful position. Thankfully, there has been no indication from Egypt in this regard. We have sorted out a number of technical matters in the Russian market and there is no commercial difficulty there.</P>
    <P>I have made strong representations to Commissioner Fischler for an effective measure to support the markets and to address the current urgent problems. I am pleased the Commission has already introduced an aids to private storage scheme. It is a scheme for cow beef which takes effect from Monday next. It will provide for an EU contribution to storage of cow beef for a minimum of three months from 27 November to 2 February at a rate of 17 pence per pound and thereafter for another three months at 73 pence per pound. Hopefully, after that period the market balance will have been restored because we <Col N="1208" /> are trying to calm the market and restore normality.</P>
    <P>I have urged the beef processing sector to make maximum use of the scheme so that the full benefits can be passed on to farmers. I believe, however, that more needs to be done. At the Council of Ministers meeting last Monday I urged the Commissioner to increase substantially the export refunds to third country markets because it is extremely important. I am keeping in touch with our embassies in the countries concerned and Bord Bia on a daily basis in regard to the markets.</P>
    <P>A delegation from farmers' organisations and the meat factories is in Agriculture House now and I am late for the meeting but this is an urgent issue.</P>

      <P>There is no problem with live exports. Some trucks were prevented from entering Italy but we resolved that matter through our Italian Embassy. I have received no indication of a difficulty in any of our other markets. I recognise the difficulties facing the sector arising from the fall in consumer confidence in certain member states but I am hopeful that the discussions at the Council and the standing veterinary committee and the decision to be taken later this evening with the farming organisations and factory representatives will help to resolve the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures released yesterday by Focus Ireland on the number of homeless families living in temporary bed and breakfast accommodation are a shocking indictment of the type of society in which we live. In the Dublin area alone, it is now clear that 1,200 children and their families live in temporary bed and breakfast accommodation. In the space of ten years, the numbers of families in this type of accommodation has increased by an incredible 570%.</P>
      <P>Under this Administration homelessness has reached a new peak and adopted a new and horrifying face. Yesterday's report vindicates what I have been saying for some time, that the largest growth in homeless figures is among children and their families. This aspect of our booming economy is very disconcerting and is something which the Government has failed abysmally to tackle.</P>
      <P>This Administration wants to be judged on its record on the economy. Each member of the Government has learned by heart a mantra of facts and figures which he or she whips out when challenged over the management of the economy. However, facts such as those brought to light by Focus Ireland are hardly ever discussed and, where possible, are ignored. The people will judge the Government on its treatment of the weakest in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" /> The 1,200 children and their parents who are roaming the streets of Dublin are not there by choice. They are there because of the Government's abysmal failure to manage the housing crisis. The fact that each morning over 1,000 children and their parents in the greater Dublin area are forced on to the streets at around nine o'clock after spending the night in a bed and breakfast is a crime. With no permanent accommodation, these families are forced to spend the days roaming the streets and public parks until nightfall when they can return to their temporary accommodation. The consequences of this type of lifestyle is very detrimental to young children. They are denied access to proper nutrition, an indoor play area, heating and the security of having a place they can call home.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's Focus Ireland report served not just to vindicate what most of us know about the new face of homelessness but highlights the fact that hostel provision in this city is highly inadequate. Hostels cannot deal with the current demands and by 6 p.m. each day they are forced to turn people away to sleep on the streets. Bed and breakfast accommodation is now full with people who have been homeless for a prolonged period and people who have become homeless for the first time find it almost impossible to find accommodation in bed and breakfasts. It is clear that the inadequate supply of local authority housing and the unregulated nature of the private rented sector is pushing people on to the streets who in the past and during the worst economic dips would never have been at risk of becoming homeless.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year when the Government published its strategy on homelessness I welcomed it to the extent that it pointed in the right direction. However, the report still remains largely on paper. At the time of its launch, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, said that money would not be an object in implementing the recommendations. However, there appears to be some lack of will in implementing the recommendations. As the economy continues to boom and the number of disenfranchised children and their parents on the streets continues to grow, the Government needs to give a new seriousness and urgency to providing accommodation to those children who, in these bad winter days and nights, find themselves homeless in this city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was invited by Focus Ireland to launch its report on the use of bed and breakfasts as a source of emergency accommodation in Dublin and I was pleased to do so last night. As the Deputy is aware, the Government is very committed to tackling the ongoing problem of homelessness and, last May, I published a formal integrated strategy to tackle homelessness. This strategy provides for an integrated response to homelessness by all agencies involved, both statutory and voluntary. As part of the strategy, local authorities and health boards are drawing up local action plans, detailing how accommodation, <Col N="1210" /> health, settlement and welfare services will be provided to homeless persons by all the agencies involved in these areas. This work is ongoing at present and I have urged local authorities to complete these plans as a matter of urgency. I am pleased the action plan for the Dublin area is very close to being finalised. They asked for a short extension on the grounds that it was better to get it right than to meet a deadline and I agreed to that. However, it will be available shortly in a week or two.</P>
      <P>A key element of the Government's strategy is the provision of additional and a greater variety of accommodation to cater for the varying needs of homeless persons, including homeless families. In particular, additional transitional and move-on accommodation will be provided to enable people to move out of emergency accommodation, whether in bed and breakfast accommodation or hostels, into accommodation more suitable to their needs. The strategy recognises that the lack of stability, privacy and necessary support structures makes bed and breakfast accommodation unsuitable for the long-term needs of homeless people, especially homeless families. Therefore, it is intended to phase out the use of bed and breakfast accommodation for anything other than short-term emergency accommodation of less than one month, especially for families.</P>
      <P>At the instigation of my Department, Dublin Corporation, as a first step, carried out inspections of all such accommodation in the past year and entered into agreements with landlords whereby many of these facilities have been converted into shared living accommodation rather than simply bed and breakfast accommodation. The residents now have free access to come and go so that they do not have to vacate their accommodation during the day and there is 24 hour management and security. While this is a move in the right direction in that it resolves some of the acute difficulties, we still have a long way to go. This will take some time as alternative sources of accommodation will need to be found.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, local authorities will need to continue to use bed and breakfast accommodation to accommodate homeless persons on an emergency basis, but the use of it will decrease as alternatives become available. In addition, local authorities, Dublin Corporation especially, are examining the possibility of adapting existing emergency hostels for single persons to make them more suitable for families as it is expected that many hostel spaces will be freed up through the provision of additional move-on accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made substantial additional funding available to local authorities to ensure the measures in the strategy are implemented. Capital funding for the direct provision by local authorities of accommodation for homeless persons is being doubled from £20 million to £40 million over the next five years and I have indicated publicly that current funding is being increased by £6 million per annum to increase bednight contri<Col N="1211" /> bution rates to voluntary bodies and other support services.</P>
    <P>Output in the voluntary housing sector is being increased to a target of 4,000 units per year over the lifetime of the national development plan. It is expected that at least half these units will be provided under the capital assistance scheme which is used extensively to provide special needs housing for certain groups, especially the homeless. In addition, the expanded local authority housing programme of 25,000 units over the four year period 2000 <Col N="1212" /> to 2003 will also provide additional accommodation for homeless persons.</P>
    <P>The use of bed and breakfast accommodation for other than a very short-term response to homelessness is not satisfactory. We already recognised this long before the publication of the report by Focus Ireland. We are clear in our overall strategy that we must eliminate the use of this type of accommodation and the Government is providing the resources by which this can be achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware from my replies to the previous parliamentary questions that my Department's difficulty in relation to the recognition of qualifications and sea service of certain Naval Service engineering officers towards the granting of merchant shipping certificates of competency relates to our obligations under the 1995 amendments, STCW 95, to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping 1978. The STCW 95 Convention requirements are that qualifying sea service should be served on ships to which the convention, and our regulations, apply and Naval Service vessels do not fall under this category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding this, the Marine Survey Office of my Department, which is responsible for the examination and certification of seafarers under the STCW Convention, earlier this year concluded an examination of the type and duration <Col N="1214" /> of the sea service performed on Naval Service vessels. As a result of this examination, my Department wrote to the Department of Defence on 8 May 2000 proposing the following as a way forward to facilitate Naval Service engineer officers gaining merchant shipping certificates of competency: this arrangement would apply only to those Naval Service officers who have been trained under the engineer cadet training scheme at Cork Regional Technical College; such officers would attend for an oral examination at class two level. This examination would concentrate on merchant shipping practice, including certification, safe manning, health and safety, pollution prevention, cargo operations, stability matters, emergency procedures, ISM code etc.; if successful in this oral examination and subject to all other documentary requirements being satisfied, a class four certificate of competency would be issued. This would enable these officers to gain employment on a merchant vessel in a watchkeeping capacity; after serving five months on merchant vessels, these officers would then be eligible to sit for the class one, motor examination, engineering knowledge, written and oral only.</P>
    <P>I understand that these proposals are currently being considered by the Department of Defence in conjunction with the Naval Service and my Department is awaiting a response from them in the matter. Nevertheless, I am confident that these proposals offer an acceptable mechanism for recognising Naval Service engineering qualifications and at the same time ensure that we can honour our obligations under STCW 95.</P>

      <P>The primary policy objective is to eliminate the illegal activities of flagships through effective controls. The priority is to ensure compliance with the conservation rules by all EU fishing vessels.</P>
      <P>The rules have been tightened by virtue of the new EU fisheries control regulations which came into force last year. The regime now in place allows for enhanced inspection and monitoring arrangements for flagships.

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware fully of the concerns of the Irish Exporters Association concerning the shipping industry and I share their view that the sector needs regeneration. The Government is committed to the development of our maritime sector as highlighted in the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium, as reviewed in November 1999.</P>
      <P>To further the development of our shipping industry the Government set up by statute last December a new dedicated Irish Maritime Development Office, within the Marine Institute, with the following remit: to promote and assist the development of Irish shipping and Irish shipping services; to promote Ireland as a centre for ship registration; to develop and implement a strategic framework for the shipping industry and its ancillary service sector; and to liaise with and support the industry and advise on policy initiatives and overhaul of the legislative framework for the mercantile marine so as to underpin industrial development and safeguard and generate employment.</P>
      <P>An expert advisory group for the IMDO, comprising representatives of the shipping industry and shipping services sector, IDA Ireland, independent financial, legal and business people and Departments, chaired by Mr. Padraic A. White, was formally established in December 1999.</P>
      <P>The IMDO has presented its first report to me which, <i>inter alia</i>, sets out proposals aimed at promoting the development of Irish shipping and shipping services and at attracting to Ireland additional marine related service sector operations and major players in the sector's manning, technical, chartering, legal and financial areas. The report is being considered in the context of the forthcoming budget and in the light of EU policy concerning State aids for maritime transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's purpose in setting up the IMDO is not just to encourage the growth of the Irish merchant fleet, but also to facilitate the <Col N="1216" /> growth in Ireland of a wide range of shipping related services: ship financing, insurance, chartering, brokerage and maritime legal services. This growth will be achieved through the development of existing Irish services and the attraction of such services from abroad and an overhaul of the legislative framework governing merchant shipping.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that I support the case of the industry for incentives and fiscal measures beyond those already in place in terms of corporation tax, income tax allowances for seafarers and PRSI refunds to their employers. I am also looking at the possibilities for modifying the existing reliefs to make them both more attractive and more effective. My Department is particularly monitoring the introduction and application of tonnage taxes in Europe and factoring this in to ongoing discussions with the Department of Finance on the development of an appropriate fiscal regime for our shipping sector.</P>
    <P>In May last the Government formally approved the establishment of a new national maritime college costing some £30 million. The new college will be a state-of-the-art centre of excellence for maritime training, capable of meeting Ireland's seafarer training needs into the future. It will service all the needs of the merchant marine and Naval Service in a unique collaborative venture between the Navy and the Cork Institute of Technology. I am advised that by mid 2001 the Department of Education and Science expect to be in a position to go to the market with tenders for the construction of the college.</P>
    <P>There are signs of confidence returning to the sector underpinned by these Government initiatives. We especially welcome the commissioning by Irish Ferries of the world's largest cruise ferry.</P>
    <P>I believe that with the developments which I have outlined, our shipping sector will be well positioned for the future and we can look to it to capture real opportunities and generate new and sustainable jobs.</P>

    <P>My most recent report for the six months to 30 June 2000 showed 486 extant licences. In the context of a major cut back on world wide minerals exploration expenditure in the last three years it is an achievement for Ireland to have maintained its attraction for exploration in terms of expenditure and increased the area under exploration.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of a prospecting licence the holder is required to report for every two year period on his activities under the licence and to satisfy me that he has carried out the programme of works which I had accepted from him as a condition of the licence. The continued interest in holding licences is an indication of the value of Ireland as a prospecting territory. I am pleased to say that several new areas of base metal mineralisation have been discovered in the past three years.</P>
    <P>Commerciality of any find is a matter for the business decision of the intending developer. It is evidenced to me by an application for a State mining facility which I would scrutinise in detail in parallel with the necessary applications for planning permission to the relevant local authority and for integrated pollution control licence to the Environmental Protection Agency. All three applications require the publication for public scrutiny of an environmental impact statement.</P>
    <P>There are currently 15 State mining facilities of which 11 are in production. Operations at Tara, Galmoy and Lisheen brought Ireland to eighth in the world for mine production of zinc at the end of 1999. When Lisheen reaches full production it is expected that Ireland will rank sixth in the world. The major gypsum opencast mine at Knocknacran, County Monaghan, provides all the raw material to the nearby plaster and board mills in Kingscourt and has provided raw material for cement manufacture to each of the manufacturing plants on this island.</P>

      <P>As the western region's representative in Government I am pursuing with my colleagues, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, the question of progressing gas <Col N="1218" /> supply options for the west and advancing economic development in that area.</P>
      <P>The configuration of gas pipelines will be a matter in the first instance for Bord Gáis and the Minister for Public Enterprise. In this connection, I recently met with the Bord Gáis chief executive officer, Mr. Gerry Walsh, and requested that a natural gas supply, be made available to towns adjacent to the pipeline between Pollatomish, County Mayo and Craughwell, County Galway to link with the proposed ring main from Dublin to Galway. The response to this request was positive and towns such as Castlebar, Claremorris, Tuam and Athenry will receive natural gas. The Dublin Galway ringmain will also bring natural gas heating to 150,000 homes in Galway city and Oranmore and facilitate gas powered electricity generation in Connaught.</P>
      <P>In addition, I will pursue the building of a further pipeline from Pollatomish via Ballina to Sligo to service towns in north Connaught as a first phase of bringing a gas supply to the whole north west region. Bord Gáis have indicated that this will require further Government investment. I can say that the Government is committed to ensuring that the necessary pipeline infrastructure is in place to bring gas to customers, both domestic and commercial in the west.</P>
      <P>BGÉ is already committed to connecting the natural gas network to as many major towns as can be reached within their commercial mandate. In addition to providing a gas supply to certain towns in the catchment area of the proposed pipeline and spur-line, I understand that BGÉ is examining the prospect of supplying gas to other centres of population in the north west as part of a national study to determine centres that can be supplied with gas on an economic basis. When this assessment has been completed, a fuller picture as to the costs and viability of such extensions will emerge.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that, as happened in Cork with the Kinsale gas field, the availability of gas in the western region is used to promote the location of industry in that part of Ireland. My priority is to see the extension of the gas network and a new supply off the west coast used to accelerate economic development in the Border, midland and western region.</P>

With the support of the Irish industry, and backed by the findings of the national CFP strategy group, I am continuing to press for radical new conservation measures including additional stock recovery programmes, as well as increased mesh sizes which will demonstrably deliver significant reductions on discard rates. Rigorous enforcement by all member states of existing conservation, measures including minimum size restrictions and mesh sizes, is a key imperative also. The problem created by discarding slipping and high grading of fish must be addressed systematically through <i>inter alia</i> observers on boats programmes and a review of other potential measures such as the Norwegian strategy of banning discards altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are developments in relation to two hydrocarbon discoveries in our offshore, the Corrib gas accumulation and the Helvick oil field.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited completed a fourth appraisal well in the Corrib gas field in September. The company and their partners are currently assessing the results from this well in conjunction with data from previous appraisal wells with a view to determining the extent and characteristics of the reservoir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EEIL are of the view that the Corrib field might have in place recoverable reserves of more <Col N="1220" /> than one trillion cubic feet of gas. This compares to over 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas produced to date from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields. However, it is too early at this stage to give a precise figure for the size of the gas accumulation and the licensees will not be in a position to do so until they have fully evaluated the discovery. I expect Enterprise Energy Ireland and their partners to be in a position to decide on the commerciality of the Corrib field in the very near future.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Helvick oil field, Providence Resources completed an appraisal well last September. The operator is currently analysing the data acquired in the course of the appraisal drilling. The results will be integrated with existing knowledge about the field in order to establish a soundly based estimate of the hydrocarbons in place and the potential recoverable resources. All the data and information relating to the appraisal drilling have been submitted by the company to my Department. The Deputy will appreciate that all material associated with the assessment of the field is commercially sensitive and therefore must remain confidential.</P>
    <P>Offshore petroleum exploration activity continues with 21 exploration licences in place covering 106 blocks or part blocks. In addition there are eight offshore licensing options and two leases in place. Applications for two further licensing options and two lease undertakings are at present under consideration in my Department.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, next year will see a substantial increase in offshore drilling activity. While no firm proposals have as yet been received in my Department it is anticipated that up to five exploration wells, one appraisal well and two development wells will be drilled.</P>
    <P>As regards non-petroleum minerals I am pleased with the current level of exploration. Indeed it is gratifying that we have not only maintained, but increased in real terms, our share of world exploration funding in the context of a major global cutback over the past three years. The most recent report that I laid before the Houses under the Minerals Development Acts showed that at the end of June 2000 there were 486 prospecting licences being operated. The number of licences has increased over the last three years.</P>
    <P>The State itself does not carry out prospecting. In setting and agreeing the exploration programme under any licence, I ensure that the licence is awarded to the candidate proposing the most advantageous programme. By monitoring the reports of licence holders and site visits, I ensure that the terms of the commitment are met in each case and that there is a suitably aggressive pursuit of any positive results.</P>
    <P>As part of our ongoing efforts to ensure the attractiveness of Ireland, my Department is at present carrying out a comparative study of international royalty and tax regimes. The results of that study will inform policy decisions in the <Col N="1221" /> future and allow us to maintain our competitive status.</P>

      <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the reason I did not disclose the registered owners of the sunken tug boat at Clogher Head Pier, County Louth was because, as stated in my reply on 14 November last, I have no direct role in relation to the removal of the said vessel.</P>
      <P>However I can now confirm, having checked with both Louth County Council and Customs and Excise in Dundalk, that the tug boat that sank at Clogher Head Harbour during the recent gales is named the <i>Buron 1</i> and I assume, therefore, that this is the vessel to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>According to the relevant records the registered owner of the <i>Buron 1</i> is Marine Blast Limited, Cartown, Ballymakenny, Drogheda, County Louth. Marine Blast Limited became the registered owner of the vessel on 26 September 1994.</P>
      <P>The location of the tug boat <i>Buron 1</i> at Clogher Head Harbour was brought to the attention of officials in my Department by the Clogher Head Fishermen's Organisation in July of this year. At that time the local receiver of wreck concluded that the tug boat could not be classified as a wreck as it was moored at Clogher Head pier. Section 39(2) of the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act 1993 defines a wrecked or stranded vessel as including a vessel which is sunk, partially sunk, wrecked, grounded, stranded or abandoned.</P>
      <P>Following the recent sinking of the tug boat Louth County Council decided that while the vessel could not be considered a hazard to navigation it was an obstruction to other users of the harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already given details of the county council's powers in my reply of 14 November. As previously advised, section 52 of the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act, 1993 gives the appropriate authority the power to remove or render harmless an offending wreck and to recover the expenses incurred from the relevant person. In this instance Louth County Council, in <Col N="1224" /> addition to having the power to remove a wreck where it is likely to be an obstruction or danger to navigation or lifeboats, also have the discretion to act if the wreck constitutes a threat to the marine environment or to related interests.</P>
    <P>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</P>

      <P>As regards sea bed levels in Dublin, the Deputy will be aware that Dublin Corporation commissioned a report, which was published in 1996, into accretion at Bull Island. That report recommended that a further study should be commissioned in 2001 in order to provide a firm basis for further action, if any, to be taken. My Department has approved grant aid for Dublin Corporation at the rate of 75% and subject to a maximum of £112,500 towards the cost of such a study. A breach of the Bull Island causeway would primarily be a matter for Dublin Corporation to pursue. This report is now expected to be completed in July 2001.</P>

      <P>With the full support of the Irish fishing industry, I am insisting on comprehensive action to protect juvenile and spawning fish stocks through recovery programmes. In the context of very hard decisions on TACs next month, all member states must shoulder their responsibilities and collectively agree these conservation plans. Having led the way with the Irish Sea Cod Recovery Programme, Ireland will continue to be at the forefront of these initiatives.</P>

      <P>Land-based surveillance and control of sea fisheries is undertaken primarily by my Department's sea fisheries inspectorate, and control at sea is carried out by the Naval Service and the Air Corps. All of these agencies co-operate closely on an ongoing basis to ensure the most effective deployment and utilisation of the resources and equipment available for sea fisheries protection.</P>
      <P>The resources available for land-based sea fisheries protection have improved considerably in recent years, through, for example, the recruitment by my Department of additional sea fisheries officers, and the further augmentation of these resources is in train. The capability for surveillance and control at sea has also been enhanced, by the acquisition of an eighth patrol vessel for the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>The resource requirements for effective policing of sea fisheries in future will be kept under review, in light, <i>inter alia</i>, of the overall budgetary position and the financial assistance available from the EU towards the significant costs of this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am always striving to improve the level of coverage available on all Irish coasts to meet growing demands both offshore and onshore and <Col N="1229" /> to ensure the coverage continues to meet both national and international requirements for marine search and rescue operations.</P>
    <P>Major strides have been made in recent years in bringing the quality of resources, readiness, training and management up to a level in Ireland that is second to none in Europe at present. The Irish Coast Guard, a division of my Department, has contracted two civilian Sikorski S61N search and rescue helicopters, one based in Shannon Airport and the second in Dublin Airport. These helicopters are available on a 24 hour 365 day basis for emergency response on any part of the coastline. The coast guard has 65 full-time staff and more than 600 volunteers. It manages and operates three co-ordination-communication centres at Dublin, Malin Head and Valentia, 12 remote VHF sites, two voice repeater sites and 52 coastal emergency response stations providing shore coverage.</P>
    <P>In addition to its own resources, the Irish Coast Guard has a number of declared resources available to it on a 24 hour basis all year round. These include two Air Corps search and rescue helicopters based at Finner and Waterford, the RNLI which has 24 lifeboat stations around the coast and eight community inshore rescue service boats based in strategic locations. It can also call on the Department of Defence naval vessels and divers, the Air Corps fixed wing aircraft, the Garda and their divers and the UK Coastguard and all vessels at sea in a marine emergency situation. In addition, many local volunteer groups, such as sub-aqua clubs, assist in searches and I would like to put on record my appreciation of the work done by all those involved.</P>
    <P>We are constantly assessing the case, based on risk assessment by location, for improving resources. We are also undertaking a major programme of re-equipment and refurbishment of facilities available to coast guard volunteers and I can assure the House that I am responding positively in all cases where it is made clear to us that the provision of new facilities and the re-equipment and up-grading of existing facilities will add to our capacity to save lives at sea.</P>
    <P>With regard to proposals for future developments, a departmental group modelled on the principles of partnership and consisting of staff, unions and management is assessing the recent IMES expenditure review, including the recommendations concerning a coast guard and will identify the necessary organisational and service delivery changes which might arise with a view to maintaining and enhancing the high quality provision of search and rescue and pollution response in our marine and littoral areas.</P>
    <P>Work is in progress on the preparation of legislation, a coast guard Bill which will give the Irish Coast Guard a firm legislative base and statutory duty of responsibility for all activities associated with the discharge of its remit.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Smith, the Minister for Defence, announced on 12 July 2000 the first <Col N="1230" /> stage of a process to acquire new medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps. This major investment programme involves the acquisition of two medium lift helicopters, with an option for a third, for search and rescue purposes as well as an option for two medium lift helicopters for general purpose military transport. The acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps for search and rescue is a positive indication of the Government's commitment to the Air Corps and is welcomed by the coast guard.</P>
    <P>A working group of my Department and the Department of Defence has been set up on the subject of dedicated helicopter search and rescue assets. This group will, in tandem with the current tender competition for the supply of medium lift helicopters to the Air Corps, determine the overall helicopter resources required, civil and military, and the optimum deployment of same to cover the Irish search and rescue region. It will identify and make recommendations on the specific Air Corps resources which will have to be committed and deployed to meet those requirements. It will also consider all options, lease, extension of current contracts etc., for the provision of interim solutions for the overall requirements taking into account the lead time for the delivery of new medium lift helicopters to the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>I hope that once a medium load-carrying helicopter is based on the north-west coast, and agreement is reached with the IAA, and the level of increased taskings is assessed and accepted by the declared resources, discussions should commence with the UK to expand the Irish search and rescue region to the north-west to coincide with the Irish pollution responsibility zone, which includes the ocean areas where it is the custom and practice for Irish fishing vessels and the Irish naval vessels to operate.</P>
    <P>The Irish Coast Guard helicopter coverage is being upgraded from September 2001 in that from that date the backup helicopter will have the same auto-hover capacity as the other two helicopters.</P>
    <P>In recognition of its pollution protection responsibilities, my Department commissioned an Irish emergency towing vessel study which was conducted under the direction of a steering group comprising representatives of the Marine Emergency Advisory Group and was published in January of this year.</P>
    <P>Arising from the recommendations of that report, in May of this year I brought proposals to Government that an emergency towing vessel should be deployed for the protection of the coastline and the marine resource and processes from the consequences of major oil pollution and vessel strandings. In addition to agreeing this proposal in principle, the Government also agreed in principle that the marine safety information services should be extended to incorporate the functions of a vessel traffic management information service, as a means of monitoring vessel movements around the coast, and that in consultation <Col N="1231" /> with the International Maritime Organisation, the coasts of Donegal, Mayo and Galway be designated as marine environmental high risk areas and that passing vessels be required to maintain a specified minimum distance from the coast.</P>
    <P>The Government also agreed that my Department would, in consultation with the Departments of Finance, Defence and Environment and Local Government assess and identify the most cost effective means by which Ireland would acquire an emergency towing vessel capacity; propose in the light of the above other uses, if any, to which an ETV capacity might be applied; make proposals regarding the positioning of the ETV capacity, and propose the specification, costing, ownership, manning, operation and management, financing etc. of such an ETV capacity, and report to me before end October 2000. On foot of the recommendations made by this group, I intend to bring further proposals to Government shortly. I am striving to improve the level of coverage available on all Irish coasts to ensure it continues to meet EU and international standards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>I am always striving to improve the level of coverage available on all Irish coasts to meet growing demands both offshore and onshore and to ensure the coverage continues to meet both national and international requirements for marine search and rescue operations.</P>
      <P>Major strides have been made in recent years in bringing the quality of resources, readiness, training and management up to a level in Ireland that is second to none in Europe at present. The Irish Coast Guard, a division of my Department, has contracted two civilian Sikorski S61N search and rescue helicopters, one based in Shannon Airport and the second in Dublin Airport. These helicopters are available on a 24 hour 365 day basis for emergency response on any part of the coastline. The coast guard has 65 full-time staff and more than 600 volunteers. It manages and operates three co-ordination/communication centres at Dublin, Malin Head and Valentia, 12 remote VHF sites, two voice repeater sites and 52 coastal emergency response stations providing shore coverage.</P>
      <P>In addition to its own resources, the Irish Coast Guard has a number of declared resources available to it on a 24 hour basis all year round. These include two Air Corps search and rescue helicopters based at Finner and Waterford, the RNLI which has 24 lifeboat stations around the coast and eight community inshore rescue service boats based in strategic locations. It can also call on the Department of Defence naval vessels and divers, the Air Corps fixed wing aircraft, the Garda and their divers and the UK Coastguard and all vessels at sea in a marine emergency. In addition, many local volunteer groups, such as sub-aqua clubs, assist in searches and I would like to put on record my appreciation of the work done by all those involved.</P>
      <P>We are constantly assessing the case, based on risk assessment by location, for improving resources. We are also undertaking a major programme of re-equipment and refurbishment of facilities available to coast guard volunteers and I can assure the House that I am responding positively in all cases where it is made clear to us that the provision of new facilities and the re-equipment and up-grading of existing facilities will add to our capacity to save lives at sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1233" /> With regard to proposals for future developments, a departmental group modelled on the principles of partnership and consisting of staff, unions and management is assessing the recent IMES expenditure review, including the recommendations concerning a coast guard, and will identify the necessary organisational and service delivery changes which might arise with a view to maintaining and enhancing the high quality provision of search and rescue and pollution response in our marine and littoral areas.</P>
    <P>Work is in progress on the preparation of legislation, a coast guard Bill which will give the Irish Coast Guard a firm legislative base and statutory duty of responsibility for all activities associated with the discharge of its remit.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Smith, the Minister for Defence, announced on 12 July 2000 the first stage of a process to acquire new medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps. This major investment programme involves the acquisition of two medium lift helicopters, with an option for a third for search and rescue purposes as well as an option for two medium lift helicopters for general purpose military transport. The acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps for search and rescue is a positive indication of the Government's commitment to the Air Corps and is welcomed by the coast guard.</P>
    <P>A working group of my Department and the Department of Defence has been set up on the subject of dedicated helicopter search and rescue assets. This group will, in tandem with the current tender competition for the supply of medium lift helicopters to the Air Corps, determine the overall helicopter resources required, civil and military, and the optimum deployment of same to cover the Irish search and rescue region. It will identify and make recommendations on the specific Air Corps resources which will have to be committed and deployed to meet those requirements. It will also consider all options &ndash; lease, extension of current contracts etc. &ndash; for the provision of interim solutions for the overall requirements taking into account the lead time for the delivery of new medium lift helicopters to the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>I hope that once a medium load-carrying helicopter is based on the north-west coast, and agreement is reached with the IAA, and the level of increased taskings is assessed and accepted by the declared resources, discussions should commence with the UK to expand the Irish search and rescue region to the north-west to coincide with the Irish pollution responsibility zone, which includes the ocean areas where it is the custom and practice for Irish fishing vessels and the Irish naval vessels to operate.</P>
    <P>The Irish Coast Guard helicopter coverage is being upgraded from September 2001 in that from that date the backup helicopter will have the same auto-hover capacity as the other two helicopters.</P>

      <P>At present, all dogs and cats entering this country from countries other than Great Britain, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, must undergo a period of at least six months detention and isolation in approved quarantine premises on arrival here and be subject to one anti-rabies vaccination during quarantine.</P>
      <P>Since February 2000 the UK has been operating a pets pilot scheme which allows pet cats and dogs meeting certain conditions to enter the UK along certain approved routes without a quarantine requirement. In Ireland, we made a minor adjustment to our laws to allow pets that have entered the UK under the pets pilot scheme to travel on to Ireland without quarantine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From February 2001 the UK intends to extend its scheme to approve all points of entry into the UK, and to extend the list of qualifying countries to include rabies free islands. I am carefully monitoring the progress of the UK pilot pets scheme with a view to making a similar adjustment to our quarantine laws next year, provided our examination reveals no additional risk to public or ani<Col N="1238" /> mal health. It is hoped to have an Irish pet passport scheme in place next year.</P>
    <P>The objective in changing the quarantine regime is to facilitate the maximum possible number of travellers, while ensuring that public and animal health in Ireland continues to be protected. I envisage maintaining the common control area which at present exists between Ireland and the United Kingdom and consequently the list of qualifying countries for pets entering here is likely to be the same as that for the UK. It is not anticipated, for the present at any rate, that the USA will be one of the countries included in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is at present a draft Commission proposal to regulate the movement of pet animals in Europe. This proposal is broadly similar to the UK pilot pets scheme and provides for the free movement of pets subject to a number of criteria in relation to vaccination, blood testing and identification of the animal being met. This proposal is unlikely to be in place prior to the introduction of a direct entry scheme in Ireland next year.</P>
    <P>The following are the rabies-free islands qualifying under the pet travel scheme from February 2001: Ascension; Australia; Barbados; Bermuda; Cyprus; Falkland Islands; Hawaii; Japan; Malta; Montserrat; New Caledonia; New Zealand; St. Helena; Singapore; Vanuatu.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The consultant's report on the sheepmeat regime which was prepared for the EU Commission by independent consultants recommended that the Commission should consider three options relating to the ewe premium.</P>
      <P>The three options put forward were the retention of the status quo; the correction of the inaccuracies in the price reporting system and the simplification of the current system by introducing a fixed premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultant's overall conclusion was that the current regime broadly meets its objectives at EU level but results in substantial variation in impact between member states. They concluded from this that there are sufficient serious weaknesses in the system and that the second and third options should be evaluated. On the second option, the consultants concluded that this option would improve the accuracy of the information on which the premium is calculated, but would result in a system which is more complicated to administer. They suggest that such changes could only be justified if they resulted in significant improvements in the calculation of the premium <Col N="1240" /> and that the real benefits to member states would need to be carefully evaluated.</P>
    <P>The third option proposed by the consultants was a simplification of the current system by adopting a fixed headage or area based premium, with the possibility of differentiated payments taking into account different production systems and enterprise locations. They recommend, however, that the costs and benefits of moving towards a fixed premium should be further explored by the Commission.</P>
    <P>The report is currently being considered by the Commission.</P>
    <P>My Department is also examining the report, particularly the proposals for a fixed premium. The advantages of a fixed premium from the point of view of administrative convenience, budgetary certainty and consistency with the WTO are clearly set out in the report. However, there are also some disadvantages with such an approach, particularly in view of the wide fluctuations in prices from year to year. The variable ewe premium does have the important advantage that the premium is generally higher in a year when prices are low and, while it does not compensate fully for low prices, it does help to reduce income losses in difficult market conditions. The issue of the level at which a fixed premium should be set would also have to be addressed.</P>

      <P>In my reply of 9 December 1997 the number of taxpayers liable to income tax at the higher rate for each of the years 1988-89 to 1998-99, inclusive, were expressed as a percentage of the total number of taxpayers paying tax at the various rates of tax. This did not include those income earners on the tax file who were exempt from paying tax because their income was below the relevant income tax exemption limits or personal allowances.</P>
      <P>Because of the radical changes to the income tax structure in the 1999 and 2000 budgets, and the substantial increase in the numbers of those exempt from tax, it is now more appropriate to look at the percentage of taxpayers on the higher rate in terms of the total number of income earners on the tax record categorised by those who are exempt, those on marginal relief, those liable at the standard rate and those on the higher rate of income tax. The figures I provided in my replies to Questions Nos. 187 and 188 on 15 November last were compiled on this more accurate basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The exemption limit currently applying for probate tax is £40,000, above which a fixed rate of 2% is payable. The limit was increased from £11,250 in the budget 2000 &ndash; the largest increase of its kind since the tax was introduced in 1993. Prior to this increase, the threshold was indexed annually in line with the consumer price index and will again be increased in line with this index from its current limit for estates passing where the death occurs after 31 December 2000. The new threshold amount will not be available until January 2001.</P>
      <P>An additional exemption applies where a dwelling house passes to a dependent child or dependent relative. In such a case, the house is exempt from probate tax provided the dependent child or relative had been residing in the dwelling house at the death of the deceased and had an income not exceeding the specified amount applicable in the tax year prior to the date of death &ndash; for the tax year 1999-2000, the specified amount is £5,152; for the tax year 2000-01, the specified amount is £5,536. To qualify as a dependent child, the child must have been under the age of 18 years, or if over 18 years, in full time education. To qualify as a dependent relative, the person concerned must have been a relative of the deceased or of the wife or husband of the deceased, who was incapacitated by old age or infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or the widowed father or mother, whether or not he or she was so incapacitated, of the deceased or of the wife or husband of the deceased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the capital acquisitions tax code, there <Col N="1244" /> are three exempt thresholds applying for gifts and inheritances. These are as follows:</P>
    <P>Group I: £300,000, increased from £192,900 in budget 2000 &ndash; where the recipient is a child, or minor child of a deceased child, i.e. certain grandchildren. This threshold also applies to a parent where he or she takes an absolute inheritance on the death of a child. Stepchildren and legally adopted children are entitled to this threshold;</P>
    <P>Group II: £30,000, increased from £25,720 in budget 2000 &ndash; where the recipient is a brother, sister, nephew, niece, lineal ancestor or lineal descendant, other than those covered by Group I;</P>
    <P>Group III: £15,000, increased from £12,860 in budget 2000 &ndash; where the recipient does not fall within Groups I or II, that is, non-lineal relations and strangers.</P>
    <P>As with probate tax, the capital acquisitions tax thresholds will be further increased in line with the consumer price index for gifts and inheritances taken after 31 December 2000. The new threshold amounts will not be available until January 2001.</P>
    <P>In relation to special savings accounts, where a special DIRT of 20% is payable, individuals, including married persons who choose not to invest jointly with their spouses, may invest up to £75,000 in one special savings account. A married couple investing jointly may invest in one or two joint special savings accounts, up to £75,000 in each account. The various thresholds mentioned above are indexed on a calendar year basis and so are liable to change during any given tax year.</P>

      <P>The Government recognises services for older people as a priority for development. The amount of additional revenue funding for services for older people increased from £3 million in 1997, to £7 million in 1998, to £16 million in 1999 and to £23.6 million in 2000. Significant increases in the level of capital investment have also taken place, from £6.75 million in 1997, to £14 million in 1998, to £17 million in 1999 and to £20 million in 2000. The total amount available for services for older people under the national development plan is over £200 million. While I am confident that there will be significant improvements in our facilities for older people during the lifetime of the national development plan, the increase in the number of older people in the population necessitates a continuous planning and review process in relation to the development of appropriate services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index, which is the index used to calculate changes in medical card income guidelines. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guideline, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. I am advised that revised <Col N="1249" /> guidelines for 2001 have not yet been determined by the chief executive officers.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government identified in its programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, the need to review medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families and decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled. This improvement, which is being introduced over a three year period, began on 1 March 1999. The income guidelines for those aged 70 to 79 and 80 years and over, which are already higher than the normal guidelines increased by one-third in 1999. The second stage of this process was implemented on 1 March 2000 and the third and final stage will be implemented in March 2001. The sum of £4 million has been provided for in the 2001 abridged Book of Estimates which represents the expected costs to be incurred by the improvement of this scheme in 2001.</P>
    <P>The latest agreement between the Government and the social partners, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, refers to the fact that health <Col N="1250" /> board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of families with children, and on moving anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total amount of funding allocated to the nursing home subvention scheme has been significantly increased by this Government and reached £38.5 million in 2000. Over £5 million in additional funding was allocated in 2000 to provide for an increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency &ndash; resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions &ndash; and the change in the regulations whereby health boards no longer take account of the ability of adult sons and/or daughters to contribute towards the cost of their parents care. A further £4 million is included in the Estimates for 2001 to meet increasing demands on the scheme. The question of increasing rates of subvention, and amending general rules governing the assessment of means, are being kept under review in light of the availability of funding, other competing priorities and the results of the expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme currently being undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I should point out that a health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. The application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within available resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations, 2000, which I made on 21 November 2000, provide a revised basis for taxi licensing following the recent High Court decision. The new regulations do not place or authorise any restriction on the numbers of new taxi licences which shall be granted by local licensing authorities, and revoke all earlier restrictions of this kind.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need to promote and incentivise the provision of wheelchair accessible taxis, the fee for the grant of a new wheelchair accessible taxi has been fixed at £100, with a £5,000 fee for ordinary taxi licences. It has not been practicable to maintain a universal requirement of wheelchair accessibility in the short-term given that early and rapid progress is needed to respond to customer demand for taxis. However, I have put on record my intention that, by end 2003, the process will commence of making all taxi vehicles wheelchair accessible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look forward to a rapid improvement of taxi services under the new arrangements. In addition, I intend to consult extensively with representatives of consumer groups, of disabled persons and of taxi service providers to develop further quality improvements for taxi services in the medium term; these could include further improvements <Col N="1253" /> of the specification for wheelchair accessible taxis.</P>

      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, which was enacted on 28 August 2000, specifically empowers planning authorities to provide in their local development plans that development in areas at risk of flooding may be regulated, restricted or controlled. A planning authority will in future be able to designate areas as flood-risk areas, and if development is proposed in these areas, the risk of the development being flooded can be carefully evaluated and planning permission refused, if necessary. The provisions on development plans in the Planning Act will come into force on 1 January 2001. The importance of these provisions, particularly in light of recent events, will be brought to the attention of planning authorities in guidance notes to be issued shortly on the provisions of the Act.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95, 96 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>The 2001 Abridged Estimates, published last week, include a summary of the Public Capital Programme within which provision is made for local authorities non-Exchequer capital allocations with respect to house purchase and improvement loans, disabled persons and essential repairs grants, shared ownership and affordable housing. These non-Exchequer allocations are limits to the authorities expenditure for loans etc. The actual expenditure is funded either from their own resources &ndash; mainly redemptions of their existing housing loans &ndash; or by borrowing from the Housing Finance Agency. The 2001 Abridged Estimates also includes Exchequer funding for recoupment to local authorities of two thirds of eligible expenditure under the disabled persons and essential repairs grants, rent subsidy payable under the shared ownership and the mortgage subsidy under the affordable housing schemes and any increases referred to below.</P>
      <P>As part of the measures set out in Action on Housing, I increased the eligibility limits for the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes with effect from 15 June this year. The income eligibility limit for a single income household was increased from £20,000 to £25,000. In the case of a two income household the eligibility limit was raised from £50,000 to £62,500 using the formula 2.5 times A+B where A is the principal income and B is the subsidiary &ndash; lesser &ndash; income. The maximum local authority loan limit was increased from £50,000 to £100,000, which in the case of the affordable housing scheme can be up to 95% of the cost of the house, subject to the purchaser's ability to pay by reference to net household income.</P>
      <P>The income limit for availing of the mortgage subsidy under the affordable housing scheme and the rent subsidy under the shared ownership scheme was increased from £16,000 to £20,000 per annum and the subsidy levels payable have also been increased as follows:</P>

    <P>The revised mortgage subsidy limits will apply to all transactions completed under the affordable housing scheme. The revised limits of rent subsidy payable under the shared ownership scheme will apply to all transactions completed since 1 January 2000.</P>
    <P>The current maximum local authority improvement loans are: £15,000 &ndash; £20,000 on offshore islands &ndash; where the loan is secured by a mortgage on the house, and £6,000 where the loan is not secured.</P>
    <P>The interest rate on local authority housing loans is determined by the Housing Finance Agency by reference to mortgage rates prevailing in the financial market. The current variable rate to borrowers is 5.75%. The current fixed interest rate available on local authority loans is 6.5% for a period of five years. These rates compare favourably with the equivalent rates charged by commercial lending agencies.</P>
    <P>Under the disabled persons grants scheme grants are available from local authorities towards the adaptation of existing houses to meet the needs of disabled people. I have also introduced significant improvements to the terms and conditions of the disabled persons grants scheme in recent years. The effective maximum grant available under the scheme has increased from £8,000 in 1998 to a current level of £14,000 with the grant now covering 90% of the approved cost of the works compared to two-thirds previously.</P>
    <P>The intention of the essential repairs grant scheme is to assist elderly persons to secure basic improvements to their houses which will prolong the useful life of the house and thereby enable them to remain in their existing accommodation. The effective maximum grant available under the essential repairs grant scheme was increased from £1,800 in 1998 to £6,000 and the scheme now operates in urban as well as rural areas.</P>
    <P>The terms and conditions of the various schemes are kept under review on an ongoing basis and I will announce any improvements as appropriate. Where it is necessary to provide additional funding in respect of any improvements such additional funding will be made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent to any person in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a rent supplement is determined by the health boards in accordance with the relevant legislation. Supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which a person is required to pay from his/her own resources towards accommodation costs.</P>
      <P>In addition to the minimum contribution, all applicants, including pensioners, are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their rent. This is known colloquially as &ldquo;the claw-back rule&rdquo; and the health boards do not have any general discretion in relation to this rule. The result is that in addition to the minimum £6 contribution, pensioners also contribute the difference between the rate of pension and the standard rate of SWA. If the rate of pension increases, for example if a pensioner's dependent spouse reaches pension age, the rate of SWA rent supplement will be reduced by the same amount.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to annual budgetary increases is similar but with one important difference. The rate of SWA rent supplement payable to pensioners decreases only when the budgetary increase in pension rates is greater than the increase in the basic rate of SWA, as has been the case in recent years. For example, the personal rate of retirement and old age pensions increased by £7 per week in last year's budget while the personal basic rate of SWA increased by £4 per week. Consequently, the amount of SWA rent supplement payable to single pensioners fell by the difference between these two amounts or £3.</P>
      <P>The effect is that, after paying their rent, all recipients of SWA rent supplement have £70 per week in the case of single people, £117 in the case of couples, plus an additional £13.20 per week in respect of each dependant child, regardless of what type of primary weekly payment they have.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the capital assistance scheme (CAS), capital grants are made available by the Department of the Environment and Local Government through local authorities to approved voluntary bodies to provide accommodation for persons accepted as qualified for local authority housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CAS scheme and rent supplementation to its tenants were examined as part of the <Col N="1257" /> December 1995 report of the review group on the role of supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; in relation to housing. It was noted in that report that in addition to the non-repayable capital grants, subsidies were being paid under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988, and SWA rent supplement was paid to the tenants.</P>
    <P>Given all of the circumstances, it was decided to set a limit on the amount of rent supplement payable where the tenancy is in accommodation provided under the capital assistance scheme. This is set at £21 per week for a couple and £19 in any other case.</P>
    <P>Rent supplements in general will be examined under the review of the SWA scheme which is currently being undertaken as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations. A working group comprising officials from my Department and other relevant agencies has been established to carry out the review and a report is expected by the end of next year. Both the level of rent supplementation to tenants of CAS schemes and the &ldquo;claw-back rule&rdquo; will be examined by the working group. Any proposals for changes in this area would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

I understand that as flooding was a problem the level of this road was raised and protective railings placed on both sides. I also understand from Mayo County Council that due to this expenditure the condition of the road has greatly improved. The county council has also informed me that they have provided a separate route that can be used when there is a problem with the road due to high tides.</P>

      <P>The assessment centre will be staffed by members of the Garda Síochána and officers of the South Eastern Health Board when necessary. As such it will be in replacement for the existing unsuitable facilities for receiving asylum seekers in the arrivals area of the port. So far this year, close to 1,500 asylum seekers have made their applications at Rosslare Harbour. The detailed allocation of staff to work in the centre is a matter for the agencies concerned.

    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the statutory provisions relating to the fingerprinting of asylum <Col N="1259" /> applicants became operable on the full commencement of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended.

As such it will not be used as an accommodation centre.</P>
    <P>A monitoring committee, which will include representatives of local residents, the gardaí, the South Eastern Health Board and the directorate for asylum support services will be established to monitor the operation of the centre and the committee will be consulted in relation to the directorate's future plans for the area.

      <P>Following prolonged discussions at the Garda Conciliation Council, agreement was reached in March 1994, which provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for the pensionability of unsocial hours allowances for members of the force who retired after 1 January 1993.

      <P>The person referred to arrived in the State on 19 June 2000. Her claim was determined initially following an interview on 25 July 2000 and her application for refugee status was turned down. She appealed this decision on 30 August 2000 through her legal representatives. The Independent Appeals Authority recommended that the appeal be refused and the person referred to was informed of this decision in writing on 25 October 2000. At that time, the person referred to was informed that it was proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her and she was given the opportunity to either leave the State voluntarily, consent to a deportation order or to make representations as to why she should not be deported.</P>
      <P>Representations have been received from her legal representatives and from several other individuals. It is now my intention to give consideration to the making of a deportation order having regard to the provisions of section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, subject, of course, to the prohibition of refoulement as set out under section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>

      <P>Neighbourhood Watch has been in operation in Ireland since 1985. There are currently over 2,600 independent schemes countrywide and they provide a sound basis for a partnership between the gardaí and the community, the aim of which is to prevent crime and Neighbourhood Watch receives considerable support from An Garda Síochána. The Garda community relations section conducts training seminars for both gardaí and area co-ordinators as part of their input to Neighbourhood Watch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious that there is now a need for some form of overarching structure to co-ordinate the entire Neighbourhood Watch operation, and my Department has been considering how best to develop this. This has necessitated careful consideration of the recommendations contained within the evaluation of Neighbourhood Watch <Col N="1262" /> and Community Alert which was commissioned by my Department. The evaluation raised many issues and I look forward to the development of the new structures which will bring about a more cohesive scheme with greater participation from the community at large and support for individual schemes. The new structure should also enable the development of links with international neighbourhood watch organisations.</P>
    <P>I can inform the Deputy that I have already obtained Government approval to provide additional posts within An Garda Síochána at inspector level and I am pleased to note that the Commissioner will assign one of these posts to work with the new structure. As well as this, officials of my Department have been in contact with the Department of Finance in relation to the provision of the necessary funding to enable the new structure to be put in place.</P>
    <P>I hope to be in a position to proceed with the establishment of a new structure to support and develop Neighbourhood Watch in early 2001.</P>

      <P>At 1 January 1999, there were a total of 1,216 persons subject to a community service order under the supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service. The Probation and Welfare Service was notified of the making of a further 1,342 community service orders by the courts during the calendar year 1999 and all of these orders are either being implemented by the Probation and Welfare Service or have been subject to revocation. It should be noted that under the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, persons who have a community service order imposed on them by the courts have 12 months from the date of the order to complete the number of hours work specified in the order.</P>
      <P>At 1 January 2000, there were a total of 1,351 persons subject to a community service order under the supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have secured in excess of £350 million for tourism measures under the national development plan. As tourism will not have a dedicated operational programme, these moneys will be spread across a number of operational programmes-productive sector OP &ndash; £150 million for tourism marketing, employment and human resources development OP &ndash; just over £100 million for tourism training &ndash; and regional operational programmes for the BMW and south and east regions &ndash; £100 million for tourism product development.</P>
      <P>While the various OPs remain to be agreed with the EU Commission, I can give an indication of how I have proposed that the tourism funds should be spent. It is proposed that the tourism marketing sub-programme, with an allocation of £150 million, will consist of two measures, a destination marketing measure and a niche marketing measure. Decisions as to the allocation of funding under this sub-programme will be a matter for Bord Fáilte in consultation with the tourism marketing partnership, which is composed of Bord Fáilte executives and tourism industry representatives.</P>
      <P>Tourism training is dealt with under the employment and human resources OP which will have three training measures to be implemented by CERT, including sectoral entry training for school leavers, sectoral entry training for persons who wish to re-enter the work force and ongoing sectoral training for persons already employed in the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Support for tourism product development will be made available under the tourism measure within the two regional OPs. Bord Fáilte will be responsible for the implementation of three sub-measures, that is, major attractions and clusters, special interest activities and tourism and the environment. Detailed operational guidelines for the tourism measure are being prepared at present by Bord Fáilte in consultation with my Department. These guidelines will incorporate a public call for proposals. Project proposals will be assessed by Bord Fáilte and the decision-making in terms of grant approval will fall to independent product management boards as was the case under the tourism OP. Funds will be allocated on a competitive basis rather than a first-come-first-served basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" /> It should be noted that two of the tourism product development sub-measures require State aids clearance by the EU Commission and relevant negotiations have commenced.</P>
    <P>I should also say that other Ministers have secured funding for tourism-related projects, particularly in the areas of tourist and recreational angling, marine leisure, rural tourism and heritage.</P>

      <P>An interdepartmental group, comprised of representatives of my Department, the Departments of Environment and Local Government and Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development, carried out a review of the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas based on information available on the scheme's operation up to mid-1999. It concluded its work in December 1999.</P>
      <P>The review estimated that the scheme was successful in stimulating some £600-£700 million in private sector investment in the 15 designated areas up to mid-1999, contributing to the regeneration of the resorts. However, the Revenue Commissioners advised that the exact amount of qualifying relief under the scheme could not be separately identified on individual tax returns, and it was tentatively estimated that the tax foregone was in the region of £250 million.</P>
      <P>The group's findings have been noted by the Departments and agencies involved. It is to be hoped that the lessons learned and evolving best practice, which now points to greater integration with local planning, particularly in terms of infrastructure and a more targeted approach to investment incentives, will be taken into account in the design of any relevant tax incentive schemes in the future. The scheme expired in December 1999 and there are no plans for its reintroduction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111, 112 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>My approach has been to follow the practice of recent years and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. I approved an increase of 5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2000-01 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1998 to March 1999, which was 4.5%. I also increased by 5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
      <P>Similarly in relation to the value of the grant, the practice in recent years has been to increase the level of maintenance grants annually at least in line with inflation. Last June, in line with this policy, I announced increases of 5% in the rates of maintenance grant. The reference value for inflation is the annual percentage increase in the CPI to mid-February 2000. The increase of 5% in grant rates for 2000-01 was higher than the reference value, which was 4.3%.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to depart from these indices as a guideline.</P>
      <P>The abridged Estimates, which were published recently, do not generally represent the total planned provision for public expenditure. It is normal practice for the Government to review and adjust the expenditure provisions in the context of finalising the budget and in the light of more up to date outturn figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, the Estimate provisions are only the first stage in the process of determining specific <Col N="1266" /> allocations, improvements and initiatives across all sectors of education. This process is continuing and I will convey the necessary details as decisions are taken.</P>
    <P>I have set out in the table below the existing rates of maintenance grants, and the existing reckonable income limits, for the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
    <P>In view of the scale of expenditure involved and the representations being made by students and other groups, I announced on 11 November that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants and other student supports to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. Issues in relation to mature students will also be considered in this context. The project team is to report to me by the end of March 2001.</P>
    <P>Some 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants. The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins our approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I recently established an action group on access to third level education with the aim of tackling under-representation of disadvantaged students. This action group will advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by such students. I have asked the group to provide a report to me within three months.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as an initial step, pending the findings of the action group, I have announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates as follows: from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college. Tentative indications are that up to 10,000 students may benefit from this measure.</P>
    <P>The following are the maintenance grants rates for the 2000-2001 academic year:</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of this measure is to facilitate and improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries while improving their long-term employability. In particular, it will meet the specific needs of students with disabilities in terms of equipment and support services; provide financial support to disadvantaged students by way of additional support to the existing maintenance grants scheme; develop outreach initiatives currently undertaken by a number of third level <Col N="1268" /> institutions which involve links with second level schools and community groups and are designed to both assist students to meet the points requirements for the standard CAO entry procedures and to provide complementary special entry arrangements; and expand the provision of particular services, such as counselling and mentoring services, to meet the needs of non-traditional students.</P>
    <P>In the current year, total funding of £3.4 million is provided under this measure, principally for: my Department's special fund for students with disabilities; my Department's student assistance-access fund; funding for access officers and seed funding for access schemes within the institute of technology sector; and assistance to the Northside Partnership's higher education support scheme.</P>
    <P>At present, the vast bulk of funding benefits individual students and the institutes of technology for specific access measures.</P>
    <P>In relation to students with disabilities, I have increased the provision for the special fund for students with disabilities from £700,000 to £1 million this year. The special fund was introduced in 1994 and operates under the aegis of my Department to provide funding to students with disabilities attending courses in third level institutions and, since 1998, in post leaving certificate centres. The purpose of the special fund is to provide students with serious physical and-or sensory disabilities with grant assistance towards the cost of special equipment, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters. The provision of £1 million for the academic year 2000-01 will enable an even greater number of students to benefit. Applications are normally forwarded to my Department by the disability officer or college officer with responsibility for that area.</P>
    <P>I have also increased the provision for the student assistance/access fund. This fund is administered by the third level institutions and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college to complete their studies. I have allocated £1.828 million to this fund in 2000. This significant increase over the previous year's allocation of £1.296 million will enable greater support to be given to disadvantaged students immediately.</P>
    <P>As regards the remaining period of the plan, on 14 September 2000, I announced the creation of an action group on access to third level edu<Col N="1269" /> cation to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities to third level education, building on the experience of current initiatives, and to make findings and recommendations accordingly.</P>
    <P>The group will provide a report to me within three months, advising on the specific interventions which would be most effective in making further progress in achieving these objectives. I am awaiting the recommendations of the action group before determining the full allocation of funding under the third level access fund for the period 2001 onwards.</P>
    <P>However, I have already announced the establishment of a millennium partnership fund for disadvantage with a provision of £1 million in 2001. This fund will be administered by my Department in conjunction with the area partnerships. It will build on the experience of the support scheme for students from disadvantaged families operated by the Dublin Northside Partnership which assists students to participate in higher education. The area partnerships will be invited to submit proposals.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as an initial step, pending the findings of the action group, I have announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates as follows: from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
    <P>The first instalment will be made to eligible students early in 2001.</P>
    <P>I have indicated that I expect that up to 10,000 students will benefit from this measure. This is a tentative estimate and the actual number of students to benefit will depend on the outcome to the action group's work. The group's terms of reference specifically require that it advise me, <i>inter alia</i>, on the development of targeted interventions and actions and the identification and tracking of the target groups. It will not be possible to identify the target groups or to define eligibility criteria until then.</P>

      <P>The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme was established in 1989 with the objective of providing second-chance education and training opportunities for unemployed adults over the <Col N="1270" /> age of 21 and in receipt of an unemployment payment for at least six months. Participants in VTOS cease to receive unemployment payments and are paid training allowances by the vocational education committees at a rate equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment benefit, including any appropriate increases due for a qualified adult and dependent children.</P>
      <P>VTOS students in receipt of a one-parent family payment or disability allowances transfer to a VTOS allowance but continue to receive it from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Their allowance is also payable at the maximum rate of their payment.</P>
      <P>Participants in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for 12 months or more immediately prior to starting the VTOS course are entitled to a training bonus of £25 per week.</P>
      <P>VTOS participants are also paid travelling expenses, where they reside three miles from the centre, and a meal allowance in line with those payable by FÁS.</P>
      <P>There is also a scheme of grants for child care to facilitate the attendance of people who would otherwise be prevented from doing so by child care responsibilities.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to alter the terms and conditions of the VTOS allowances.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Adult Education states that, over time, and providing for the necessary transfer of resources, it is intended that overall responsibility for the payment of all existing training-welfare allowances for VTOS should transfer to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>The professional role of a teacher encompasses the performance of teaching and non-teaching duties. There is a long tradition of teachers supervising students within the school environs during the normal school day. However, all teachers would not be required to undertake these duties on a daily basis. It is a matter for local management to agree these operational arrangements with their teachers.</P>
      <P>The rules for national schools oblige teachers to take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of pupils and to participate in supervising pupils when they are on the school premises.</P>
      <P>While there are no specific rules governing the arrangements in second level schools there is an established tradition and practice that teachers undertake the necessary supervision of students under their control as required by school management.</P>

      <P>Breaking the Cycle is a five-year pilot project for the period from 1 September 1996 until 30 June 2001 and the evaluation of aspects of it will continue until this latter date. The salient feature of the project in urban schools is a significant reduction to 15:1 in the pupil-teacher ratio in the junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; in the schools. The main feature of the project in rural schools is the provision of a local co-ordinator in each of 25 clusters of schools to promote parental involvement, support school staffs and give direct support to the targeted pupils who are at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving. Both dimensions of the project have funding for books and learning materials and for local initiatives and a requirement that the schools concerned engage in planning, in-career development and the evaluative process.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated that the final report from the Education Research Centre will be forwarded to my Department at the end of 2001. When that report has been considered fully, decisions will be made regarding the future of the programme.</P>

      <P>The higher education grants scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. An approved institution is defined to mean a university, university college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course or courses which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.</P>
      <P>Each year, the higher education grants scheme specifies a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the scheme. The approved institutions mainly comprise publicly funded third level institutions. Any extension to the scope of the grants scheme, to include private colleges such as Portobello College, can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector.</P>
      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges.</P>
      <P>Portobello College is not an approved college for the purpose of the free fees initiative. As the question of the non-inclusion of courses in private colleges within the free fees initiative is currently at issue in the case of Patrick Jordan junior, Patrick Jordan senior, Raymond Kearns and Barry Acton <i>v.</i> the Minister for Education and Science, Ireland and the Attorney General, I do not consider it appropriate for me to comment further on the matter.</P>
      <P>Tax relief at the standard rate of tax is available on certain tuition fees paid to certain private colleges in the State, including Portobello College, in respect of approved undergraduate courses. Further details and conditions in relation to such tax relief are available from any tax office.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Finance Act, 2000, provides tax relief for fees paid in respect of approved postgraduate courses, including courses in approved private third level colleges.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of this particular school is a principal and 16 mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 474 as at 30 September 1999. This is the authorised staffing of the school, and represents a decrease of one mainstream class teacher on the previous school year's staffing. The school also has the services of two learning support teachers, two resource teachers, a home school liaison teacher and a resource teacher for travellers.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of the school as at 30 September 2000 will determine the staffing for the 2001-02 school year. The enrolment at the school has decreased to 451 pupils on 30 September 2000.</P>
      <P>The organisation of classes is the function of the managerial authorities of the school, who should ensure that classes are arranged in such a manner that no individual class is too large.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which an anomaly exists on one school campus at Scoil an Spioraid Naoimh, Bishopstown, County Cork, where the boys' school has disadvantaged status and the girls' school has ordinary status which discriminates against the girls' school and where the boys' school has better funding and access to more teachers.</Quest>

      <P>In 1997 my Department proposed an amalgamation plan to the boards of management of Scoil Cholumbáin &ndash; Buachaillí &ndash; Scoil Therese &ndash; Cailíní &ndash; both of which were designated by the Department of Education and Science as serving pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, and Scoileanna an Spioraid Naomh &ndash; Buachaillí agus Cailíní &ndash; which did not have any such designation. The preferred option at local level was for one amalgamated boys' school and one amalgamated girls' school.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, Scoil Cholumbáin amalgamated with Scoil an Spioraid Naomh (Buachaillí) and the girls' schools did not amalgamate. As a consequence of the amalgamation of the boys' schools, the designated status of Scoil Columbáin was extended as an exceptional matter to all of the pupils of the amalgamated Scoil an Spioraid Naoimh (Buachaillí). Consequently, that school attracted the enhanced capitation grant in respect of its entire enrolment. Also the amalgamated boys' school was allocated the staffing concessions that are part of amalgamation arrangements.</P>
      <P>At present, I am finalising proposals for a major new three year programme at primary level. This programme will involve the allocation of 200 new teaching posts and financial assistance to schools with the greatest concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. A key feature of the new programme is that participating schools must agree, in advance, to target the additional resources being provided at those pupils identified as being at risk of educational disadvantage. Schools will also be given appropriate support for the development of holistic and integrated in-school and out-of-school supports for the pupils concerned, in collaboration with other statutory and voluntary services. The programme will cost in excess of £25 million over three years.</P>
