    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: motion re Referral to Joint Committee of proposal to approve terms of Memorandum of Understanding for a Framework of Co-operation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the State of Israel; motion re Referral to Joint Committee of FOI Civil Service Users' Network Report and proposal to approve draft FOI regulations; Planning and Development Bill, 1999 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); and Statements on the White Paper &ldquo;Ensuring the Future &ndash; A Strategy for Rural Development in Ireland&rdquo;, to be taken not later than immediately following the announcement of matters on the Adjournment under Standing Order 21 and the order shall not resume thereafter.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 17 and 18 shall be decided without debate and the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 44: the opening statement of a Minister or Minister of State and the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael and Labour Parties shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; the statement of each other Member shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; and Members may share time.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 17 and 18 agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 44 agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Although it is not strictly in order, I take this opportunity to wish the Taoiseach well in the task he and the British Prime Minister are undertaking today. No one under estimates the difficulty of that task. Will the Taoiseach make time available for a debate on this issue in the House next week so that the outcome of his discussions with the British Prime Minister may be considered? Given that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has indicated that the Government is not contemplating the suspension of the institutions, what then is it seeking in the event <Col N="1234" /> that no clear timetable for the decommissioning of weapons is vouchsafed by the paramilitary organisations? What is the Government seeking if that situation, which we hope will not occur, arises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same topic &ndash; as Deputy Bruton indicated, it is not fully in order but it complies with the convention we have established &ndash; in the likelihood that there will be fairly substantial developments by Tuesday next, will the Taoiseach make time available at the earliest opportunity on that day to discuss the Good Friday Agreement and its implementation in light of the developments which may take place? Prior to such a debate, perhaps the Taoiseach could arrange a briefing for those parties which require it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I also request a debate on this issue, given people's interest in it. The Green Party has been excluded from the statements on rural development which will be taken later today and I wish to ensure that we are included in the debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bruton for his remarks. It will become clear during the course of the day whether progress can be made. I will make arrangements for a debate on this matter next week. Deputy Bruton can rest assured that there are not any alternatives if clarity is not achieved on the decommissioning issue. The comments of the Minister for Foreign Affairs were made on the basis that clarity and certainty would be achieved. Product is not the issue, it is a question of achieving clarity. I made it clear yesterday, in the straightest and bluntest terms possible in front of a number of witnesses, that that is what the Government and the House desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was for clarity that the people voted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My officials are in Belfast at present and I will travel to meet the Prime Minister immediately following the Order of Business. If any urgent matters arise, I will arrange for the Opposition leaders to be briefed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On another matter related to the Order of Business, the Ceann Comhairle received a letter yesterday afternoon signed by the Whips of Labour and Fine Gael requesting a special meeting, at the earliest opportunity, of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Is he in a position to indicate when that meeting might take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is due within the course of the next two weeks. I cannot give a <Col N="1235" /> commitment in respect of the day on which it will be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No one can be quite sure where we will be in two weeks, given the way things are going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be disorderly but we have a crisis in the interpretation of the Order of Business in relation to another matter. It is not usual that the Ceann Comhairle should receive a letter of the kind to which I refer. With respect, we are seeking a more committed response than the one he has just given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that there will be a response in a number of days with regard to the date and time of the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are seeking a meeting as a matter of urgency. The issuing of a response to our request in a number of days does not indicate the sense of outrage I feel about the way we are being frustrated from asking questions about matters which are legitimately in the public domain. We have the nonsensical situation whereby individual citizens can get more information from Departments under the Freedom of Information Act than we can get as elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated that such a meeting will be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can you indicate when, Sir?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I invite you and your officials to understand the sense of urgency which is our concern about this matter. We will have to consider our position as regards how we co-operate in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same issue, a Cheann Comhairle, another matter has been referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which needs the urgent attention of the committee, and not just its Chairman. This matter should be dealt with this week. Will you advise us of the date and time of the meeting today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my request, a Cheann Comhairle, it is a request of the two main Opposition parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the week the Taoiseach informed the House that the Finance Bill will be published on 10 February. The heads of the Bill were published last week. A number of announcements are arising from the pay talks which will have major implications for the Finance Bill and will have to be reflected in its provisions. Will the Taoiseach arrange for amended heads of the Bill to be given to Opposition parties and tax practitioners in advance of the publication of the Bill so that what happened in the past will also happen this year, and people will know the general areas of tax changes before the Bill is published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will inform the Minister for Finance of the Deputy's request. I am not sure that there are other heads but I will make the Minister aware of the Deputy's request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>We recently saw the effects of a very serious strike where health professionals &ndash; nurses &ndash; picketed hospitals. We are still experiencing the impact of that strike. A serious situation is building up and junior hospital doctors will be balloted shortly regarding industrial action. The Labour Party published the Protection of Patients and Doctors in Training Bill, 1999, which deals with the protection of patients and junior hospital doctors. Will the Taoiseach agree to take this Bill in Government time to pre-empt and prevent the serious industrial situation which is building up in hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see doctors on picket lines unless action is taken by the Taoiseach to ensure that patients are protected.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children is more interested in criticising doctors than ensuring they work proper hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is happening to the minimum wage legislation? Carers cannot be employed by the Eastern Health Board because the rate is only £3 per hour. Very expensive acute hospital beds are being taken up because basic community care services cannot be provided at that rate. Where is the minimum wage for the Department of Health and Children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has been published and must be passed by both Houses before 1 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that Kerbside Recycling in Dublin is in crisis with about 40% of waste collected going to landfill sites? In spite of this, the Minister for the Envir<Col N="1237" /> onment and Local Government continues to tell people to recycle waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the EPA should have a monitoring role in recycling? In that context, will he speed up the introduction of the EPA Bill because he seems oblivious to the environmental problems we are experiencing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The EPA Bill has nothing to do with Kerbside management.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>It should have. We need a proper EPA Bill and the Taoiseach should expand it. If he cared about the environment he would introduce a proper EPA Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a waste management plan and I hope the Green Party will support the plan implemented by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will time be made available to debate the Freedom of Information Civil Service Users' Network report in the House because of the nonsensical situation where Members are refused replies to parliamentary questions but can obtain the information under the Freedom of Information Act? It is absurd that we can get information under the Freedom of Information Act but Ministers will not supply that information in the context of parliamentary questions. Will the House be given on opportunity to debate this matter so that this point can be raised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been agreed that this issue will go to committee. Perhaps when the committee has completed its deliberations the matter could come back to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach be more precise about the publication date of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, other than the information given in the Government's programme of legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>When will the firearms Bill be published? Will consideration be given to changing the current legislation whereby a 16 year old can hold a legally-licensed firearm?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>During the last session I asked the Taoiseach if he would review the timing of legislation coming before the House. There are 18 Bills on one list of the Government's legislative programme for which heads have been approved by Government, but the texts of which <Col N="1238" /> are being prepared. There are 63 Bills for which heads have not been approved by Government. Will the Taoiseach consider changing the drafting monopoly of the draftsman's office to make it possible for any Government's legislative programme to be achieved in the period between elections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislative committee meets every week with all relevant people to look at the stages of legislation to see if the legislation proposed for that session is moving on. There have been a number of recent debates in the House on this issue which the Deputy raised.We have started to involve more people from outside in the preparation of Bills which is speeding up the system.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> In light of the extremely sinister development in Austria where an extreme right wing, racist party is poised to come to power, and the fact that people seeking refuge in this country can, under the Dublin Convention, be sent into the arms of such a regime&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Will the Taoiseach bring forward the immigration and residence Bill as a matter of urgency so that those seeking refuge in Ireland from political persecution are not delivered into the hands of an extremely anti-immigrant, right wing party which might come to power in Austria, with control of sensitive ministries such as justice?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of a debate in the House on the emerging social partnership agreement was raised at the Whips meeting last night. Further to my question to the Taoiseach yesterday, and in view of the fact that a new procedure is being adopted by ICTU which will consult its <Col N="1239" /> members prior to a ballot, is it the Government's intention to enable the House to be similarly consulted prior to a final decision in light of the many legislative commitments that would form part of that agreement? Can the Taoiseach indicate whether time will be made available in the next week or so for such a debate, assuming that the total programme is agreed by this weekend?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The talks are still going on. I am not sure when they will be completed. They are well advanced but there is not a deadline for their completion and there is no great urgency. I understand the Government Whip last night agreed there would be a debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will that debate take place before it is voted upon by the social partners and will the Government give an undertaking, in light of the fact that there will be consultations with the only body which will vote &ndash; the workers, through their respective trade unions &ndash; that there will be a debate in this House simultaneous to the consultation process that will take place with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and its members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I restate that we cannot have a debate until we have something to put to the House to debate. I do not accept it is very different from any of the other agreements. Every agreement since 1987, whether <i>Programme for National Recovery   </i>, PESP, PCW or Partnership 2000, was put to the unions for consultation &ndash; how it was put does not matter. All of them were debated by the delegated unions to congress before they were voted on and that is what will happen this time also.</P>

      <P>Tá ceist agam maidir le dhá Bhille ar an liosta atá geallta. Bhí an chéad cheann geallta i 1999. It was subject to the determination of the former Minister for Education and Science but it has come to naught. On the teaching council Bill, cathain a fhoilseofar é sin?

      <P>The sea pollution, hazardous and noxious substances civil liability and compensation Bill is particularly relevant given the House of Commons debate on MOX fuel and the transport of MOX fuel from Sellafield through the Irish Sea. It needs to be taken quickly on that account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This side of the House welcomes many parts of the new Planning and Development Bill. Legislation, in whatever order it comes before the House, will not in itself deliver additional housing units on the housing market. There was a good deal of speculation about this matter during last summer when this Bill was first produced. The Minister attempted to present the new Planning and Development Bill to the country as a great panacea which would ultimately sort out the housing crisis, but it is not a panacea. While there are many welcome sections in the Bill, ultimately it will not result in one additional new housing unit on the housing market before at least 2002 or 2003. That point must be emphasised. Legislation will not sort out the housing crisis but rather political action and responsibility.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years there have been two fine reports from Dr. Peter Bacon who made specific recommendations on density proposals, local authority house building plans and planning problems. Yet we have still to see those decisions implemented. On the matter of density, there is no point in the Department of the Environment and Local Government publishing guidelines and giving them to each local authority planning department if they are not implemented. We have seen countless examples since the original publication of the density guidelines, particularly in the Dublin area, of local authority planning and development departments not adhering to the guidelines. There are countless examples where, with specific allocations of new housing units, particularly public housing, the guidelines are not adhered to and some local authorities cannot build their allocation of new starts which in a given year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was stated by all speakers in the debate yesterday, there are constant problems relating to planning and the absence of planners to expeditiously deal with planning applications which come before local authorities is referred to at every council meeting. Legislation in its primary form or regulations will not sort out the <Col N="1242" /> housing crisis. The Department of the Environment and Local Government should take a lead on the issues I have mentioned, such as density, the completion of local authority housing starts and planning, to ensure that good practice is adhered to in local authorities countrywide.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dukes said last night, a raft of legislation has been introduced in the past ten to 20 years by various Governments, but it is not implemented by local authorities. Legislation by itself, therefore, will not sort out the problems.</P>
    <P>There are many welcome sections in the Bill. In the Dublin area in particular there is a difficulty in starting various infrastructural projects which should have been completed some time ago. The C-ring around Dublin city is a classic example. The M50 motorway, a key arterial route around the city, still has not been completed 15 to 20 years after it was first proposed.</P>
    <P>There are also problems relating to the implementation of Luas. There is no doubt that the planning process is causing major infrastructural difficulties. The problems will become more acute in the next ten years. It is worth contemplating on the population trends the ESRI and others have predicted for the next ten years. According to the last census of 1996, there was a population of 3.6 million people. If the current trends continue, it is reckoned that by 2011, the population will be 4.2 million and by 2016, 20 years from 1996, that figure will be 4.4 million. It is possible that in a 20 year period, the population will have increased by 20% to 25%. The problems this will cause in getting new housing units on the market must be realised and acted upon by the Government.</P>
    <P>There will be problems with the population structure in the next ten to 15 years. Ireland's population structure is unusual in comparison with other EU countries as the vast bulk are aged between 19 and 65 years. It is argued that there has been a problem with housing supply in the past five years because those in their thirties, who are at an age when they want to purchase a house, have been unable to do so because of the massive increase in demand. Since 1980 there has been a decline in the birth rate which will provide an opportunity to change the culture of dependency on social welfare etc. In the next ten years the population will increase but will also include more people who are unable to buy houses because of demand.</P>
    <P>It is reckoned that in the next ten years 500,000 new homes will have to be built to deal with the housing demand. This is a massive increase in housing output. In 1996, 26,000 units came on the housing market and last year the figure was 48,000. However, it is reckoned we will have to produce 50,000 units every year for the next ten years in order to deal with the demand for houses. The current housing stock is about 1.4 million units &ndash; by 2010 and 2011 there could be almost two million. This represents a 25% increase in the total number of housing units. One of the worst recent predictions is that if the <Col N="1243" /> current rate of growth in the Dublin area continues, it is likely that in ten years 50% of the population will be living in the Dublin region. That cannot be countenanced. We cannot have 50% of the population living in a radius of 40 miles from Dublin city. That is, to use the Minister's words, not sustainable.</P>
    <P>We need to ensure there is better spatial planning and to select the areas where there will be a massive increase in housing demand. The Government has put this process on the long finger. It refused to specify these hubs of development in the national development plan. There is no point in delaying a proposal which needs to be implemented in the next 12 months. The Government has made a curious commitment in the plan &ndash; it says it has set up a new unit and that in three years it will have decided the location of the developmental hubs for housing output but it has not made a decision. That is not proper decision making. Many of the commitments in this legislation are highly suspect because the Government is refusing to decide on the new population growth centres. We cannot have 50% of the population living in the Dublin region within ten to 15 years.</P>
    <P>There are a number of assumptions to be made. Obviously we need to build more houses quickly. We must utilise our land to provide for the increasing population. We must take a radical look at the development of our cities and towns and ensure that people live in the heart of those communities. We do not want Ireland to be the same as America, where people live on the verge not at the heart of the cities. This needs to be addressed in the Bill. We must plan new developments in a sustainable way &ndash; I referred to the establishment of new population growth centres in the next ten years. Politically, long-term decisions must be taken. One of the interesting points in the recent NESC report on capacities and choices is the issue of long-term political decision making. We must decide in the next 12 months where we are going to put the increasing population and we must make those long-term decisions in favour of certain areas. The typical political response of all Governments is to give a little bit to all parts of the country rather than designate certain areas as growth centres.</P>
    <P>I wish to address Part V of the Bill and also to discuss the fundamental flaw of the Bill, which is the Minister's failure to deal with the issue of quality and standards in the construction industry. The Minister spoke about the fundamental principles which are supposed to be enshrined in this Bill &ndash; sustainable development and a better and more accountable planning process. However, he did not refer to the key aspects of housing supply and demand which are quality and standards. The Government has not treated this issue seriously. The Bill needs to be amended to provide for the establishment of an independent building standards agency which would effectively police the construction industry and <Col N="1244" /> guarantee quality to people purchasing houses at a cost of £170,000 and more.</P>
    <P>The Department has a building advisory group, but it does not have the resources, it is not enshrined in law and makes virtually no difference. I recently brought the issue of hollow block construction to the Minister's attention. This is one of the greatest scandals emerging in the construction industry. Hollow block construction is recognised worldwide as one of the most deficient forms of construction in terms of its thermal and insulation performance. The vast majority of the houses built by speculative developers in this city are built with hollow blocks as opposed to wooden frames or cavity walls. It is a scandal that the Department will not abolish this form of construction. This is compounded by the fact that a memo sent to the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, in 1998, by a section of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, highlighted the fact that hollow block construction would have to be allowed for in building regulations. That was made clear in a note sent to the Minister in 1998 which stated that the Department would probably have to revise technical guidance document L on the consolidated building regulations sooner than was planned, due to the CO2 emissions target set by the Kyoto Convention, but that it was not desirable to signal this to the outside world just yet because the next leap in building standard insulation would probably involve making it difficult for hollow block construction, used widely in the Dublin area, to survive. This has implications for manufacturers of hollow blocks, builders and the cost of new houses.</P>
    <P>This causes conflict for the Minister. He signed the Kyoto and Buenos Aires agreements on the reduction of CO2 emission and is responsible ultimately for the sustainable development policy. How can the Minister, who is trying to meet the targets set out in the Kyoto convention, also be responsible for setting minimum targets for insulation in the construction industry? There is a fundamental conflict, between his responsibilities for road development and for the environment. The Minister has a strong tack when it comes to the car industry but he does not have the same views about the construction industry and the establishment of houses using hollow block construction methods which have been proven to be deficient in terms of insulation.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the report &ldquo;Homes for the 21st Century &ndash; the Costs and Benefits of Comfortable Housing for Ireland&rdquo; was launched and one of its clear conclusions was that standards of thermal efficiency in Irish housing were among the lowest in northern Europe. If we are to build 500,000 new houses in the next ten years, many of them in the Dublin area, we will have to raise the standards of construction techniques. The Building Advisory Group will present its report to the Minister by 2001, with the new guidelines coming into force in January 2005. Five years will be lost during which time it will be permissible for hol<Col N="1245" /> low block construction to continue. That represents 25% of new housing stock.</P>
    <P>Quality will have to be stitched into the Bill because it is fundamentally flawed. The Minister has refused to face his responsibilities on construction quality. We will revisit this matter on Committee Stage and I will propose the establishment of a separate authority to ensure building standards. That will ensure that continuous problems with builders walking away from housing estates, is dealt with. The Bill does not make any commitment to deal with that issue convincingly.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity to get planning and development right for the next 20 years. The Minister was open to suggestions on Committee Stage in the Seanad. I hope he will be as open on Committee Stage in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the dramatic departure signalled by the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, which envisages a structured hierarchy of plans and the beginning of a strategic approach. It is a huge undertaking and I am concerned that the matter is kept under review, with progress and effectiveness being monitored. Who will be charged with that function? Swift progress is desirable but it is not provided for in existing structures.</P>
      <P>The traditional local authority plan will retain its pre-eminence while strategic development zones will be introduced, with the whole process being underpinned by the national development plan. Local authority county development plans will be debated in a more vigorous manner and will receive more attention than they have in the past because the scale of development now outstrips the scale when local authorities were considering their previous plans ten years ago.</P>
      <P>It must have been a daunting task for the Minister and his staff to draw up this Bill. I commend them for their work. I welcome the fact that this Bill consolidates nine Acts and five sets of environmental impact assessment regulations. That makes it difficult for anyone outlining the provisions of the Bill to encompass everything in it and to notice every change made. I look forward to debating the Bill on Committee Stage although, if the experience in the Seanad is used as a yardstick, some of us will curse the Bill for the length of time it will take on that Stage. It will, however, be an interesting debate which examines in great detail the changes taking place as a result of the consolidation of so many Acts and regulations, not to mention the new provisions being introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning gets a bad press. To an extent, unfair perceptions arise from tribunal coverage, rumour and anecdotal evidence, inconsistency in the decisions made by planners, lack of adequate staffing in local authorities and kite flying by politicians and the media. The poor quality of planning applications can also be a significant factor in some instances. The administrative system is excessively cumbersome. A straightforward planning application must be dealt with by several <Col N="1246" /> sections of a local authority when it is lodged; the roads department and sanitary services have to have their say. It is a difficult process through which to go. At first glance it would seem sensible to incorporate all the requirements of planning infrastructure when considering an application but, on occasion, it would be easier if the planning considerations of an application were looked at separately by those responsible.</P>
    <P>The whole system is flawed for many reasons. That being the case, it will take much more than legislation to address the problems. The system must, however, have the support and confidence of the public, something it manifestly does not have at present. The Minister cannot address that lack of confidence through legislation or regulation. It manifestly does not have that at the moment. The Minister cannot address this issue by way of legislation or regulation. I compliment him on holding a number of regional seminars while the Bill was being prepared. These seminars were well attended by local authority members and all the interested parties. The feedback was excellent, and much of it is reflected in the Bill. A fundamental difficulty in planning is that applicants or appellants who are disappointed by a specific decision will naturally be disposed to bad-mouthing the system. This is a factor in the perception of planning.</P>
    <P>The strategic approach of the Minister, particularly the introduction of local area plans, will help considerably in this regard. It would be extremely successful if there were a high level of local participation in the preparation of local area plans. There is an onus on local authorities, including local authority members in particular areas, to ensure there is the maximum level of participation by people in local communities in the local area plans. Unfortunately, one of the short-term effects of the provision for making local area plans is that local authorities are using the fact that the plans have to be prepared, to defer decisions on existing applications. This is entirely unreasonable. While it is true that the granting of permission in certain areas would have an impact on the long-term development of the area, in the context of the need for housing and in some instances the need to disperse housing pressure from major towns into villages, it is entirely unreasonable and counter-productive that local authorities should take this approach.</P>
    <P>This matter needs to be addressed because this should not happen at this juncture. Certainly, local area plans must be prepared but this cannot be used as a reason for wiping out development prospects in villages and towns throughout the country. This would have two detrimental effects. In the first instance, it would prevent affordable housing land coming on stream to provide affordable housing for people and, in the second instance, it would increase the pressure on major towns from Dublin in a national context, to county towns throughout the country. Everyone wishes to see this issue dealt with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" /> I concur with many of Deputy McGuinness's criticisms in this regard. It is a joke that the Minister and his Department are committed to considerable infrastructural development in many towns and villages throughout the country, developments sought by the local authority through its sanitary services and roads section, while the same local authority is simultaneously refusing to consider plans for housing in the towns and villages where it sought and received the infrastructure because it must wait for the preparation of a local area plan. This type of foot dragging is unacceptable and needs to be addressed in the short-term.</P>
    <P>Regardless of what considerations come into play, it seems the biggest single obstacle to providing sufficient housing is the planning process and land usage policy. There is a different culture nowadays to that which existed five, ten or 15 years ago. In many local areas the culture of objection seems to have replaced the compensation culture about which we heard so much three or four years ago. This is no longer confined to the Dublin 4 element who were once accused of sticking their noses into other people's business throughout the country. In many instances local knowledge would suggest that an agenda other than a planning one is at play in many of these objections. The Minister some time ago rightly referred to the activity of those who accept financial inducements to withdraw objections. Clearly, planning consideration is not the factor which encouraged these people to lodge their objections in the first instance. While there are frequently advantages in having the option to withdraw an objection, particularly in relation to An Bord Pleanála, there is good reason to consider removing that option in the context of what has been happening.</P>
    <P>In County Clare the county council recently introduced a development plan which drew considerable odium on councillors in respect of one tiny aspect. Any legislation, albeit a budget or matters coming before a local authority, sometimes tends to attract all the media coverage and discussion on just one minor point. Clare local authority members attempted to widen the provision under the 1963 Act which enabled farmers' sons and daughters to obtain due consideration of their applications. However, some might have seen this as preferential treatment. Members believed that families of local people, whether the postman, county council workers, anyone who lived in the area for a long time or had a legitimate employment interest in the area, should also receive a certain level of consideration. Unfortunately, this was portrayed as though they had sought to exclude numerous people who heretofore might have been entitled to due consideration. This was not the case. In fact, they were trying to extend the categories of people who would get favourable consideration as provided for in the 1963 Act. This should be commended as worthy and worthwhile. I am pleased <Col N="1248" /> the level of negative media coverage which the proposal received following the draft county development plan stage did not frighten the councillors who adopted the provision in the plan.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím freisin roimh úsáid na Gaeilge sa Bhille seo. Choimead mé súil ar an Seanad nuair a bhí an Bille á phlé ann agus bhí roinnt mhaith Seanadóirí a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge ag glacadh páirt sa diospóireacht. Táim cinnte go bhfuil suim ag an Aire féin ann. Ba chóir go gcoimeadfaimis súil ar an nGaeilge agus ar úsáid na Gaeilge go ginearálta sa Bhille seo. Fáiltím roimhe sin.</P>
    <P>There is enormous difficulty in addressing one of the objectives set out by the Minister, that of ensuring the planning process takes due cognisance of sustainable development. As he said in his statement, there is even a difficulty in having a tight definition of sustainable development. The EU directive on strategic environmental assessment is virtually completed and I am pleased the Bill reflects this. I also welcome the undertaking in the Bill to define the relationship between pollution control licensing and planning control. This has hitherto created some difficulties for practitioners. There is quite a deal of confusion among ordinary people regarding the role of the EPA and local authorities. In relation to sustainable development, the Minister's Department obviously treats this issue as a priority, but one wonders if all other Departments are aware of our commitments under the Kyoto Agreement and other requirements. As a nation, we have been lax in this regard and this laxity could cost us dearly.</P>
    <P>Another aspect in the Bill is the entire enforcement code. Traditionally, this has been among the two or three most difficult problems in the planning area going back over a very long period. I welcome the manner in which the Minister has strengthened the enforcement code. Much of the bad press to which I referred earlier arises as a result of either laxity in pursuing the enforcement code or lack of clarity in underpinning legislation going back over the nine or ten cases which have been repealed. In the case of large developments in particular, the Minister might consider introducing some type of developer permit for the site rather than the commencement notice required at present. One of the weaknesses of the commencement notice is that it is issued to somebody who frequently has no role in the development of the site. The applicant initially may have been the landowner or somebody who passes it on to another developer at a certain stage. It should be possible to devise a system of permits for developers which would place responsibility for the development specifically on the developer in place at the time. In the event that he transferred that responsibility to somebody else, a further permit would be required so that a local authority, in seeking to enforce the code, could identify somebody specifically in law rather than approach somebody who ceased to have any dealings with the matter five or six legal transactions previously and was entirely out of the picture. I <Col N="1249" /> do not know exactly how such a system could be devised, but it should be considered.</P>
    <P>I question the proposal in the Bill to transfer responsibility for compulsory purchase orders, local authority EIA projects and road schemes to An Bord Pleanála, notwithstanding the suggested time limit in that regard. There is considerable merit in leaving responsibility where it currently rests. There have been many discussions about An Bord Pleanála and this matter will feature in the Committee Stage debate. The change would create much difficulty and, in many respects, the issue should remain within the remit of the Department.</P>
    <P>A major part of the Bill relates to the provision of housing. I was interested in Deputy Hayes's contribution and I agree with his comments about the quality of building. However, my memory is that his party's recent proposal was that 32,000 houses should be built each year. In fairness, that was the ESRI projection two and a half years ago, but I am glad the Deputy's party now agrees with the Minister's view that 50,000 houses per annum might be more appropriate. This aspiration can be reached. It is set against the background of the wish of almost all people to own their own homes. It has served us well and it should be encouraged through Government policy, as the Minister and Minister of State have sought to do.</P>
    <P>However, in the current climate, that is obviously impossible for many people and the attempt in the Bill to ensure that the land use policy is not a deterrent to the construction of social and affordable housing is as good a provision as possible. I also welcome the £6 billion provision for social and affordable housing in the national development plan. Unfortunately, local authorities have tended to be less helpful and sympathetic to the providers of social housing than they should have been. I am aware of a case in my county where a social housing provider in the pre-planning stage has already dealt with three different planners and is having difficulty securing a meeting with the person responsible for it.</P>
    <P>It is appalling that somebody who is setting about providing social housing in an area where it is urgently needed is not accommodated in every way possible in terms of pre-planning meetings because, ultimately, that system ensures the requirements of the county development plan and county council are likely to be met in the short to medium term. In the context of the current housing difficulties, local authorities should be required to be pro-active in terms of encouraging providers of social and affordable housing rather than be seen to put obstacles in their way or to be less than sympathetic in their dealings with them.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this has an historical basis because county councils considered themselves the providers of social housing in the past and they have an obvious role in the provision of affordable housing. However, the agencies involved in the provision of social housing have done a tremen-<Col N="1250" /> dous job and have a key role to play in conjunction with the local authorities. An overlap in terms of responsibility is not by any means a justification for local authorities not to help them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the opportunity it affords the House to discuss planning issues in detail. It is a major overhaul of planning legislation and given the contributions made in the Seanad and this House, it is obvious many aspects are of concern to Members. The purpose of the Bill is to consolidate existing legislation and streamline the planning process. The Bill is overdue and deserves much thought and attention to detail because it will shape the development and planning of the country for many years.</P>
      <P>I welcome the attention given to local development plans in the Bill and that there will be co-ordinated plans in regions in the future. At present, each local authority has its own development plan which stops at its boundary. There is not any consultation or co-ordination with adjoining areas. It is important that development plans will now be incorporated in regional planning guidelines. This aspect also focuses attention on the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The Bill mentions the regions and how development can be co-ordinated from a small local area plan to a county or borough development plan through to the regional area and on to national level. From the point of view of Government planning, it is unsatisfactory that it is still necessary to wait almost two years for a national spatial plan which will map out the development of the country as a whole in terms of where people will live, how housing densities will develop, industrial regions and transport corridors and routes in areas. The cart is being put before the horse. It may be two years before the spatial plan is available but the national development plan was published recently. If that goes ahead, it may be in contravention of some aspects of the spatial plan when it is released. This is disturbing. We are racing ahead with one programme while the spatial plan has not yet been produced.</P>
      <P>Local development plans will provide a foundation block for the future of areas. However, it is essential that they are co-ordinated in terms of boundaries to ensure smooth, efficient systems can be developed for the population and communities of those areas. It does not make sense that one local authority should develop housing units or even estates if it has not co-ordinated them with transportation systems which may cross local authority boundaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding local plans, I am disappointed the Bill excludes suburbs because there are major problems in many of the areas developed near towns and cities. The current population limit for such areas is 1,500 but I am aware of an application in my area, close to where I live, for 700 houses. This would instantly create such a population on the basis of 2.2 people per house and probably exceed the 1,500 limit recommended in <Col N="1251" /> the Bill. Other speakers mentioned this aspect and it must be considered. Local areas are building blocks and this should be incorporated in the development plan.</P>
    <P>Certain plans are important to the public. Third parties and interested bodies can have their say and make an input to the future of their areas. Many development plans have received much criticism because they are obsolete by the time they are introduced. Matters have moved on and there has been pressure from developers to develop areas which may not be suitable for housing or part of a development plan. However, times change and the development plans in many areas must catch up as it is produced.</P>
    <P>Many local authorities are currently working under outdated development plans which do not take account of housing demands and needs and transport and road infrastructure. Planners did not anticipate the economic boom or the large number of immigrants. They did not anticipate the demand for certain types of houses. Given that many young people wish to live alone there is a huge demand for one and two-bedroom dwellings. For various reasons families break up, couples separate, and the female moves to a smaller housing unit with the children and the father has to find accommodation for himself. There is a need, therefore, for different types of housing units. This type of development was not anticipated. Many old people would like to move out of their large family homes close to city centres but there are no alternative houses for them and no consideration has been given to the need for different house types.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the demographic norm in European cities is that families with children account for only 25% of households. In the United Kingdom 800,000 homes will be required in London in the next 25 years, 80% of which will be occupied by one person. The number of family homes throughout Europe is reducing. We have not got to that stage yet but we are getting there. Social trends need to be incorporated in our development plans.</P>
    <P>A positive aspect of the Bill is that it includes a housing strategy. It is essential that each local authority examines the needs of its area and its future housing requirements. Cork Corporation, of which I am a member, has consulted widely with housing bodies and voluntary housing organisations, and is producing its housing strategy. This will be an essential plank of our development plan.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism of the large sprawling suburbs in Dublin and Cork. Many of these areas are in my constituency which have been allowed to develop on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, acres of housing responding to a demand but with no co-ordination and development. There are up to 3,000 houses in some of these areas. In my constituency, Grange, Donnybrook and Rochestown have no schools and have little or no public trans<Col N="1252" /> port. Public representatives are constantly requested to put in place footpaths in these areas.</P>
    <P>It is unsatisfactory that housing estates can be built without the correct infrastructure being put in place. Priority should be given to the provision of infrastructure. How can we expect people to live in these areas if proper infrastructure is not in place? What type of lifestyles will they lead? In many parts in Meath and Kildare there is a similar lack of infrastructure with acres of housing. There is no provision for those who have to queue to get out of their housing estates to take their children to schools outside the area. Given that there is not a proper public transport system, the people must use cars. This in turn means they queue in traffic jams to get on to the main roads and to their places of work, school or wherever. This type of planning must cease.</P>
    <P>A development plan should include planning for infrastructure which should be put in place before any houses are built. Many of the areas to which I referred have populations greater than the towns of Mitchelstown, Fermoy or Midleton and they do not even have a local shop, a church or a school which is an essential part of a community and its development.</P>
    <P>Planning and development plans, words used regularly by local authority members, dictate people's quality of life. In regard to Cork Corporation's development plan, there is little comment from people in local areas about how their areas should be improved. Development plans are an important element of the future of this country and how we will alleviate the stresses under which people live. We may have a great deal of money and a Celtic tiger economy, but we have a huge demand for housing and a society living under much pressure because of the many jungles created in our cities and their suburbs.</P>
    <P>Landscape is a word which heretofore has not been mentioned in development plans. I am pleased it is included in this Bill. Landscape does not mean the mere planting of trees and grass verges. For many urban dwellers it means concrete walls, brick walls and hard structures. I was struck recently by a comment from a landscape architect who said most of our children who live in urban areas get up in the morning and, because of the lack of a proper public transport system, travel to school by car. All they see from the car windows &ndash; those who are tall enough to see out &ndash; are bus shelters, some of which are broken, plastic signs, litter and concrete or brick walls. They see very little greenery. This has a psychological impact on children and the population as a whole. We live in a beautiful country which has magnificent sights and breathtaking views. Many of us visit these places only for a week in the summer or at weekends. The area in which people live on a daily basis is an essential part of their lives and the psychological effect of the landscape on the nation as a whole has to be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>A recent study in the United Kingdom examined this issue. There was much thinking around the old tradition of having green belt areas <Col N="1253" /> around our cities and towns but that is irrelevant to many people. People know there is a green belt ten or 15 miles from their housing estate but they do not benefit from it. They want their own green patch. We need to create more green belts and plant more trees in city centres, towns and villages. I welcome the inclusion of the landscape in the development plans. At the end of every development plan there should be a question asking how many trees, green areas and pleasant surroundings have been provided so that the development will have a positive impact both aesthetically and in terms of quality.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; is incorporated in the Bill but it is difficult to define. I was struck by a description from the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland which said the word &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; should be linked to or substituted by the word &ldquo;quality&rdquo;. A quality development would be aesthetically pleasing. The Kyoto principles, to which Ireland has signed up, were mentioned this morning. The quality of our buildings and their structure must be examined if we are to reduce our output of carbondioxide, which is an important part of the Minister's agenda. Many of the homes being built today are not sustainable from that point of view. Lines and lines of the same type of housing is not aesthetically pleasing.</P>
    <P>In my county there is a village scheme of 50 houses where there is a proposal for a development of between 150 and 200 houses which will completely change the nature of the village. Acre after acre of houses of the same type is not sustainable development and it is something which should be looked at. We all recognise that we must development these communities which are within five miles of the city centre due to the pressure to provide houses, but one should not be allowed to build 200 houses of the same type in such an area. Sites should be given over to people to build individual houses and the type of housing unit should be varied. The impact on the existing village must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Many local authorities do not employ an architect. There are only seven city or county architects. This is a pity. If there could be more architectural input to the development plans it would improve their quality. A proposed development or house should be scrutinised on the basis of how it will improve the visual aspect of the area and whether it will be sustainable rather than merely whether it will fit in. Therefore, an architectural input as well as a planning input is essential.</P>
    <P>One purpose of the Bill is to speed up the planning process, but I have grave doubts that the personnel exist to do that. There is only one school, University College Dublin, turning out 25 planners a year. Last night the Minister mentioned in his speech that he had been in consultation with UCD. I am glad to hear it. I had hoped he would have addressed this with the Minister for Education and Science also. Sadly there are too few planners. The Minister is aware of this and he has addressed it, but I have grave <Col N="1254" /> doubts that he will be in a position to enforce the measures in the Bill because of a lack of personnel and expertise in the areas required. Each year the 25 graduates are snapped up by private enterprises which are becoming conscious of the need to produce more professional planning applications. This is a real concern. The Minister can produce all the legislation in the world but if he does not have the personnel to implement it, then the whole thing will collapse.</P>
    <P>Part V has gained the most attention in the media and elsewhere. Whereas I agree that we must look at social inclusion, we have made many mistakes in cities and towns. Acres of social housing were built in the past and integration was not on top of the agenda. We all agree that we have made mistakes, but the developers to whom I have spoken have grave doubts about the feasibility of Part V.</P>
    <P>Part V will create more exclusion in itself. If up to 20% of an area is to be set aside for social housing, will the houses be of a different quality to that of the other houses in the area? Will it be fenced off or walled in? I have seen examples like this. The words &ldquo;up to 20%&rdquo; are open to interpretation. Can a local authority pick one developer over another if it gets its nose out of joint about one of them? This has the potential to be unfair.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the major planning issues. There are many other matters involved and, as a Member of the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government, I look forward to working on the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I have waited for several months to debate the Bill and I welcome it. Last year when it was published it generated a great deal of controversy. In my few short years in public life since 1997 when I was elected to the Dáil, the matter of planning has been the most contentious issue in County Laois. Listening to my colleagues in the Opposition, the situation seems to be the same in most other counties and cities. Since I became a member of Laois County Council last summer, I have had a further insight into the planning activities of local authorities and I want to share some of those views with the House.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that the Bill brings together many other Acts which dealt with planning and development over the years, but it is not a consolidation Bill. It is a misnomer to refer to this as a consolidation Bill although many people have referred to it as a consolidation Bill. A consolidation Bill consolidates a number of Bills but nothing new is added.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many positive aspects to the Bill and I am pleased to deal with some of them. However, there are a number of other issues which I would like to see included in the Bill and I ask the Minister to take on board my suggestions on Committee Stage. I also have a number of questions for the Minister which I hope he will <Col N="1255" /> deal with when he replies and during the passage of the Bill through the House.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest issues in planning is the question of planning by public authorities versus an application by a private individual. I recognise that the Bill is a major step in modernising, streamlining and improving the planning process. Ultimately I look forward to coming into this House to debate a Bill, the main thrust of which will be to remove the sections dealing with exempted developments. For many people the principal problem is planning applications by public bodies, be they local authorities, roads authorities, housing authorities or government Departments. It is wrong that any statutory body can build a structure anywhere without having to go through the same planning process as every other private citizen. It is something we in Parliament must ultimately accept. I know there are great administrative and convenient reasons for it, but it is not good enough in this day and age that public bodies can attempt to short-circuit the procedures which apply to everybody else when making planning applications.</P>
    <P>Recently we have seen examples of this. I am critical of a number of the public bodies who have proposed major developments which, traditionally, they might have felt should be exempted. They need to understand that when a public body must go through Part X and it is exempted from going through the planning application process, the body is only exempted from filling out the planning application form and receiving formal planning permission. Every other aspect of planning the development should and must conform with the standards which would apply if the application was from a private individual.</P>
    <P>To take as an example, the proposed spike at O'Connell Bridge, the fact that Dublin Corporation did not opt to undertake an environmental impact study before it announced the plans was indicative of the arrogance of the local authority. No private individual could have attempted to put that there without having produced such a report. The same has happened in relation to the Kildare by-pass which affects everybody travelling south from Dublin by road. If a private developer had intended putting a motorway along that route, he would have been obliged to go through all the environmental procedures. I am critical of local authorities who feel that these issues do not apply to them because they do not have to go through the normal planning process. The normal planning concerns apply to them the same as everybody else. They must understand that they have to apply the same standards to themselves as they would apply to an application from a private citizen.</P>
    <P>If there is a proposal to build a big new office development with car parking and other services in any town or city, the application should be judged on its merits in terms of the scale of proper planning and development. It should not be <Col N="1256" /> judged on who is the owner of the individual development &ndash; i.e., if it is a Government development it does not require planning permission, but if it is being built by a private developer it does. The same procedures should apply to both.</P>
    <P>That leads to a far bigger issue of who should adjudicate on these plans. Ultimately, we will have to set up a separate division within An Bord Pleanála to adjudicate and decide upon planning applications by public bodies. Obviously, it would be improper for a local authority to submit a planning application to itself. To an extent that matter is dealt with under section 10, but it undermines public confidence when a local authority is essentially both the applicant and the adjudicator.</P>
    <P>The planning system has come in for much criticism from the general public over a number of years. Some of that criticism is merited but some is not. In many instances it is not the system that is at fault but a lack of personnel. There are planning delays in every local authority, but if a good application is submitted by a proper professional planner, who knows everything that is involved in submitting a good application, it should go through smoothly. In such a case, there should be no need to come back for further information and clarification on that extra information some months later. These are the issues that are causing problems but if people involved in planning nationwide were submitting higher quality applications in the first instance many of the difficulties could be avoided.</P>
    <P>When appeals go to An Bord Pleanála they seem to take several months to be dealt with. The legislation obliges the board to deal with them within four months but that does not happen in the vast majority of cases where people can be informed that a decision will not be reached for some more months. That has led to people incorrectly concluding that An Bord Pleanála's procedures are wrong, but they are not. The system is correct; it is just that there are not enough staff to operate it as legislated for by this House on previous occasions. Unfortunately, these issues give the planning process a bad name in some instances when all that is required are additional staff and resources to process the applications in a prompt and proper manner.</P>
    <P>Earlier I cited the example of the Kildare by-pass where people wrongly criticised the planning process for causing the delays involved. However, the delays are solely the responsibility of the people who planned the motorways in the first place, without taking due consideration of all the issues that they are ultimately being forced to consider by the European Union. Had those people done the work properly from day one and engaged in the proper consultation and research &ndash; including environmental impact statements and considering the proposed location &ndash; it would not have been delayed in court or in Europe. The reason for the delay is that those responsible for the initial plans did not get them right. Blaming <Col N="1257" /> the system for that is like trying to find a scapegoat.</P>
    <P>Another reason for such delays is when a judicial review is taken to the High Court, and sometimes to the Supreme Court. Those delays are not due to the planning process. The fact that it takes so long for a case to be heard in court is not the fault of the planning process, it is due to the backlog of cases. The answer to solving those problems is to ensure that the courts service is provided in a speedier manner. People who are frustrated by planning delays start blaming the system and everybody involved in it, while they should more accurately focus their criticism where it belongs. In other words, if people got their plans right in the first place there would not be as many objections later on.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify the role of public representatives in making representations on behalf of constituents to a local authority on a planning matter? The Bill contains provisions for a fee to be paid by people who wish to make a planning application, lodge an objection or be informed of the outcome to either process. A public representative who is not personally involved in the process is not making an objection and is not providing any information one way or the other in respect of the planning application, but if he or she is making a representation on behalf of a constituent in connection with information that should properly already be in the planning file, they should not come in with new information on a planning application. It is the duty of the person making the application, or the objectors, to provide that information themselves. TDs, Senators or councillors are really only making representations to follow up what is already in the system. There should be no fee for doing so, otherwise it is one way of taking the public representatives out of the system. If there is a hidden agenda to take away the one element of public consultation we have in the planning system, I would like to see that attitude changed.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is a concern that people will go to the local public representative to submit a letter on their behalf, thereby avoiding the fee for lodging an objection. It should be specified that where a representation by a public representative includes new information relevant to the planning application it should attract a fee, but only if it attempts to provide information for or against the application. If, on the other hand, the representation arises from a public meeting and consists of issuing a letter in support of, or against, a particular planning application, the public representative should not have to pay a fee. That should be taken into account by the Minister on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In general, the Bill introduces a more open procedure for drawing up county development plans. Such development plans will now have a six year term and the Bill will ensure that the delay in introducing new plans will not be a feature in future. The last development plan in County Laois was passed in 1991, and is almost <Col N="1258" /> nine years old at this stage. I will return to that point in more detail later. I welcome the introduction of a time limit in the Bill so that there will be no way out in future.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that a housing strategy will be necessary as part of the county development plan, both for private and social housing. The strategy should also include a policy for housing members of the travelling community &ndash; an issue that too many local authorities have dodged in the past.</P>
    <P>I still do not know what &ldquo;sustainable development&rdquo; means and it is not defined in the Bill. I am worried that it will mean different things to different people, depending on whom one is talking to. I would like to see more guidelines to provide a clearcut understanding on this matter for the general public. I am afraid that various planning officers in different local authorities will interpret that phrase in whatever way suits them. I would appreciate clarification from the Minister on that point.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes a streamlined procedure for varying development plans and it will also facilitate the provision of public infrastructure. There is, however, a major question mark over this. Traditionally, a local authority may have wanted to consult with the ESB, Eircom or Bord Gáis about where such infrastructure is to be provided so that it can be taken into account in the county development plan.</P>
    <P>However, now that many of these traditional public infrastructure services are being provided by private operators, how will we differentiate between services provided by State or semi-State organisations and those provided by the private sector?</P>
    <P>We must understand what is meant by &ldquo;public infrastructure&rdquo;. This will present a real practical difficulty. Telecommunications companies which wish to build up their business in particular regions will not want to outline their plans in public as part of the preparation of a draft county development plan and it would, perhaps, be unfair to expect them to do so. Nevertheless, there is a real issue here which must be addressed. In the past, a town's main street could be dug up over a period of months by Bord Gáis then Telecom Éireann, then the local authority for water services and then for sewerage services. That is bad enough, but there would be mayhem if that were added to by three or four telecommunication service providers. I understand the rationale behind the provision, but I would like to see how it will operate in practice.</P>
    <P>The type of business which can take place in the strategic development zones must be specified early in the process. I would like the Minister to clarify if that is the intention. It is not enough to have a bland blanket designation of an area as a strategic development zone without specifying whether it is for office, commercial, light industry, heavy industry or dirty industry use. People are entitled to know that in the early stages, rather <Col N="1259" /> than having it foisted on them when it is too late to object.</P>
    <P>I am pleased there are strong enforcement provisions outlined in the Bill. I am particularly pleased there is provision, subject to the consent of the High Court, to refuse a grant of planning permission to any developer who has seriously failed to comply with a previous permission, such as leaving a housing estate unfinished. This has been a source of outrage of many people living in housing estates for many decades. I am also pleased that local authorities will have a legal obligation to take housing estates in charge. There have been too many difficulties between developers and local authorities and it is good this provision is included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The recently enacted architectural heritage Act has been fully incorporated into this Bill, thus making the conservation of the built heritage a central concern of development and planning control. I would like clarification of the position in relation to archaeological heritage.</P>
    <P>In regard to county development plans, there is a possible loophole in section 241(2)(b) in terms of County Laois. The section states that where a county has already started work on its draft development plan, it can proceed with it. Laois County Council is currently about four years working on its draft development plan. I would like the intent of the original Bill to be followed, that is, where there is not a new development plan councils will be asked to set about drawing up a new development plan within one year of the commencement of the Act. We have been in the draft development stage for four years and I would like that loophole dealt with. I would like to see a new county development plan for County Laois.</P>
    <P>I welcome the emphasis on the full development of a county, rather than just specific scheduled towns. There was an over-emphasis on that in the past and the rural areas were overlooked. In many counties, at least half the population live in rural areas. Those areas should be fully incorporated in future county development plans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to contribute to this debate primarily as a member of two local authorities, Wexford County Council and Enniscorthy Urban District Council. Since last year's local elections, I have had some firsthand experience of dealing with the planning process. While the legislation has many welcome features, it does not seem to get to grips with the real world with which I am dealing. Planning has become one of the most time consuming issues I must deal with at my clinics. In 1997 Wexford County Council had a little over 1,000 planning applications, last year it had 3,700. The demand for planning permission has exploded. They can vary from a single house to a scheme involving 500 houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning department of Wexford County Council cannot cope, through no one's fault. The problem is the lack of planning staff. In the past <Col N="1260" /> year, three planning executives were recruited, all of whom left after less than a month for the private sector or other local authorities. The scale of demand for planning decisions in eastern counties is incredible. This does not apply to just Meath, Kildare and Wicklow &ndash; the counties closest to Dublin &ndash; but is spreading to Carlow and elsewhere. In my constituency, there is demand from tourism developments and also from people who have sold semi-detached houses for extraordinary sums in Dublin and want to retire to cheaper housing in the country or people who are tired of the traffic in Dublin or of rearing their children there and want a better quality of life by living 70 miles from Dublin and commuting once or twice a week. The planning process cannot cope with the explosion in demand, as described in the Bacon report and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Well meaning laws and regulations are not enough, we also need reasonable conditions for staff. I am told our planners are in the office until 11 p.m. trying to cope with the volume of work. The amount of work before Christmas was incredible. We need to train more planners and remunerate planning executives at a level which ensures they stay in the public and local authority sector. What is being done to plan the manpower needs of planning executives? If this is happening in Wexford, it is happening everywhere. The aspirations in the national development plan will not be met unless this is dealt with. Enforcement will go out the window if a statutory decision must be made within 30 days of receiving further particulars or within 60 days of the original application because the people dealing with the requirements for a planning decision are too busy. The current staffing level is crazy.</P>
    <P>We need a spatial development plan immediately. It is unwise to proceed with a national development plan which cannot be delivered without a spatial plan. That involves three nationally designated regional centres of growth. Six large towns must be selected to be made cities by 2010. That means they must have third level colleges and the necessary transport, rail links, infrastructure and so on. The local authorities can then decide whether the north, east, west or south of that city should be developed and how all the services will be put together in tandem.</P>
    <P>The alternative is to have an increasing level of the population living in the greater Dublin area and a continuous stream of housing along its perimeters. Mass housing development on the southside used extend as far as Sallynoggin and Cabinteely but it now extends as far as Greystones and Delgany. This is resulting in huge commuting demand. It takes me an hour and ten minutes to get from Loughlinstown Hospital to the Dáil on Tuesday mornings. That is crazy for people who must commute that distance every day. People have been forced to live out that far because house prices in the city are so high.</P>
    <P>However, Colm McCarthy and others from DKM Limited told the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport that there are brown <Col N="1261" /> piebald sites in this city which are derelict. I cannot understand why we cannot use all the CPO and other powers to identify derelict sites in the city and have proper in-fill schemes as there is a demand for residential development. That would reduce the commuting requirement and so on. We need to identify those sites. We need proper Dublin in-fill, six designated cities and to pick out about a dozen provincial towns with populations of about 7,000-10,000 and make them into towns of critical mass. The difference between Margaret Heffernan, Tesco or Fergal Quinn deciding to open a new shopping centre in a town is the critical mass of population and the knowledge that land has been zoned and plans have been put in place to upgrade towns into major towns, equivalent in size to Navan, Drogheda or Wexford. Provincial towns, such as Enniscorthy, Athy and so on, can be upgraded.</P>
    <P>A different tiered approach needs to be taken. Until we do that, and despite the projected 20% increase in population and 25% projected increase in the number of housing units over the next 15 years, things will be done on the basis of market forces. It will be <i>ad hoc </i>and sporadic and we will have more transport chaos and it will be done in a totally unplanned way based on who makes planning applications for what. I cannot emphasise enough that unless we have adequate staff in our planning departments and a national spatial plan with all these regional and local development plans, we are going nowhere.</P>
    <P>Often an anecdote outlines exactly what is wrong with the planning process. There are two major impediments to the Celtic tiger &ndash; one is the shortage of staff to sustain it and the other is the planning process. I have a friend and constituent who is a well known national building developer who constructs houses to a very high standard. He has a particular housing estate development outside Waterford city, and there is nothing particularly special about. However, he has spent nearly a year going through the proper high-spec standard of requirements of the local authority &ndash; that is fine &ndash; and he finally got planning permission. Needless to say, with the current objective culture, people who were glad to get houses objected to An Bord Pleanála and that went through the process. The Legislature set out time limits for An Bord Pleanála to deal with matters but at the end of the time limit, the board sent a letter saying this case was such that it needed an extension in the time limit. The time limits do not work and do not matter. That went through and he got planning permission a year and a half later.</P>
    <P>Now he is being told by Dúchas, the Heritage Service, that he has to get an archaeological excavation licence from the National Monuments and Historic Property Service. He said that was fine and he would apply for a licence. He got a letter from Dúchas to say that at present there is a serious backlog of archaeological excavation licence applications waiting to be processed. It said the problem was compounded by an inability <Col N="1262" /> to update its essential database or maintain its archive of applications and incoming reports in such a way that the professional integrity of the archaeological licence system is undermined. This was a circular letter sent to everyone applying for such a licence. It also said urgent measures were required in order to resolve these problems and, therefore, no excavation licence applications would be processed from Monday, 17 January 2000, for a period of seven to eight weeks. It will not even receive a goddamn application form let alone process one.</P>
    <P>We can have all the time limits and processes we like but this particular procedure has put this project in a state of paralysis. Of course it is a different Department and Minister and one goes from Billy to Jack and everybody's business is nobody's business. We wonder why we cannot build enough houses for our people and why we need a Bacon report to know why house prices are going beyond the reach of people's wages. It is simply that not enough houses are being built. It is a simple fact of supply and demand. The supply is not matching the demand for houses and the reason is that the planning process cannot cope.</P>
    <P>I want somebody to contact Dúchas to find out exactly what are its database problems, problems with incoming reports, what is the staffing situation and what urgent measures are being put in place to solve these problems. That means the whole system is as strong as the weakest link and it does not work. I can give the Minister the details of the particular case but I can assure him that letter sent by Dúchas to a particular applicant is not exceptional. That was sent on 18 January 2000 and everyone who applies for a licence is being told not to do so. They cannot, therefore, go ahead because one of the conditions of planning is that one must get an archaeological excavation licence.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with housing. Housing and transport are the two major political problems we face. Young couples on good wages and in good secure jobs cannot afford a house. That, coupled with the fact we have 45,000 applications for local authority housing, clearly shows that we have a housing crisis. It will get worse because demand will increase at a pace more rapid than that in which we will be able to supply houses. The Minister's response to this affordability issue was the 20% condition in relation to social or affordable housing for every land zone and housing development proposal.</P>
    <P>As I understand, up to 20% will be earmarked for this particular social programme. In broad terms, there is a certain laudable dimension to that. We have ghettos of social exclusion. Areas have been built on a large scale in which there are horrendous social problems. A good example is Ballybeg in Waterford. There is a part of Limerick city and several parts of Dublin about which one could say the same. Without in any way stigmatising them, people know the problems they have if applying for jobs from such addresses. <Col N="1263" /> There is the problem of early school leavers as well as other problems. I can see that the right geographic socio-economic mix is a good thing.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister I found that the important thing when dealing with civil servants was to tell them the outcome I required and not lay down the way to do something. If one did not get the outcome, that was all that mattered. In my view, the outcome here will not work. The CIF and others, for their own reasons, said they will challenge the constitutionality of this proposal. If one looks at the terms of this proposal, the specific percentage will vary from one local authority area to another when one takes into account the existing land bank of the local authority. What is being imposed is a random imposition. Anything as uncertain as a random imposition will mean there will be debate. They will seek to minimise the 20% to 2% or whatever. There will be much wrangling during the planning process as to what will be the affordable housing element and a legal wrangle in the Supreme Court, which will take at least two years, as to whether this law is valid in relation to property rights. The Minister will be long gone out of the Department by the time this is resolved.</P>
    <P>It would be much better to be honest with the people and say that we will build 10,000 local authority houses per year, we will develop the sanitary services on 29,000 acres throughout the country to ensure affordable housing and the scale of housing development will be met, we will give a tax break to private developers to build social housing, we will try to cut a deal with the CIF to up the number of affordable houses and that we will have particular schemes whereby the land banks of local authorities will be dedicated to affordable housing, which is a critical area.</P>
    <P>Land bank management by local authorities at present is totally <i>ad hoc</i>. I would like a senior staff officer in every local authority, as part of their plans under this Bill, assigned to the job of having a land bank management policy for the next ten years. In other words, when they sell land, they must make plans to buy land. The critical factor in future local authority housing will be the availability of land banks in the ownership of the local authority. There is a gap in this regard. The provisions of sections 80 and 81 will not work. While I would welcome any measure that will bring about affordable and social housing construction, I do not believe this will achieve that.</P>
    <P>Development plans were referred to Wexford County Council and Enniscorthy Urban District Council are in the middle of preparing a draft development plan. Various extensions of time and so on have been considered. The consultants who were hired came up with a proposal that Enniscorthy would cater for an extra 216 houses over a five year period. I have single applications for 239 houses. It is farcical to have that limited an outlook over a five year period. We are going back to the drawing board, whether with new <Col N="1264" /> consultants or whoever, to radically rezone extra land to ensure there is a scale of development that will bring prices down. We must try to ensure that our development plans meet the changing situation.</P>
    <P>A development plan drawn up in the 1970s or 1980s is different from a current development plan of any east coast town or county. It is different because there has been an explosion in the demand for houses. To deal with this, each local authority should be furnished with the population trend data Dr. Bacon examined and the data examined by the ESRI which indicated that 40% more houses will be needed on the east coast over the next ten years to meet demand. This information is not being made available to councillors. Although we are told it is the unique preserve of councillors to make these decisions, the wider picture is not being made available to councillors in provincial towns in the east coast to assist them in making the proper arrangements.</P>
    <P>The role of councillors is paramount to development plans. Day to day planning decisions are an executive function and management decision of councils. The information being made available is not being localised in a regional context. While regional authorities have been set up, I have not received one letter stating, &ldquo;Dear Councillor, In the context of your development plan for the south east region, we believe you should take the following factors into consideration.&rdquo; From my national political role and experience of understanding the wider picture, I have tried to relay the position. While we have set up structures, they have little or no interaction to population trends and settlement requirements. That is a wider point in relation to the settlement strategy about which I spoke.</P>
    <P>I welcome many provisions in the Bill. There is a need to update planning law. For instance, I would like the excavation licence procedure sorted. I would like the 20% requirement for social housing renegotiated on a pragmatic, commercial basis to ensure it will work. I ask that the housing policy in this area should involve the appointment of a new senior staff officer for land bank management in each local authority. We should make a commitment to build 10,000 local authority houses a year to get to grips with the numbers on the waiting lists.</P>

      <P>Ireland's planning system is based primarily on the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963. That ground-breaking legislation came into effect in October 1964 and introduced for the first time a statutory control system to regulate the granting or otherwise of planning applications. There has been a large body of planning regulations since then, reflecting <Col N="1265" /> the expansion of the statutory development control system to meet the demands from economic growth and rising public concern in the area of environmental control matters. The advent of such legislation has also been brought about by the public who have demanded that a statutory and independent planning appeals system be set up. There is also a growing European dimension to planning issues, particularly in the environmental field, which arises from our membership of the European Union.</P>
      <P>The physical planning system is administered by 88 local planning authorities, 20 county councils, five county borough corporations, five borough corporations and 49 urban district councils. Ireland is unique among European countries in that it has an independent third party planning appeals system, which is operated by An Bord Pleánala. The Bill gives many new powers to the board.</P>
      <P>Primary planning law is contained in nine Acts dating from 1963 to 1999 and five sets of environmental impact assessment regulations. The Bill before us is designed to consolidate the aforementioned Acts and much of the environmental impact assessment regulations into one Bill for the benefit of all users of the planning system. As well as consolidating existing provisions, the Bill contains significant new policy changes and initiatives.</P>
      <P>I will analyse some of the provisions in the Bill. It is large with 245 sections set out in 18 Parts and six Schedules. Part 1 contains provisions of a general nature and amends some of the provisions from the 1963 Act. The introduction of planning controls for initial afforestation and peat extraction operations is an important change from the exemption of agriculture from the planning control system.</P>
      <P>Part II provides for development plans and for putting in place local area plans and regional planning guidelines. It also details the powers of the Minister to issue policy directives and guidelines on planning matters. Under Part II it is provided that a planning authority must make a development plan every six years. An assessment must also be made of the likely effects on the environment of implementing a plan. The preparation of a draft plan must commence not later than four years after the making of the previous plan and must be completed within one year.</P>
      <P>If the members of a local authority decide to make a material alteration to a draft plan, a public notification and consultation procedure must be followed. The plan must be made not later than six years after the making of the previous plan.</P>
      <P>Planning authorities will be entitled to make a local area plan for any particular area. Integrated area plans prepared under the Urban Renewal Act, 1988, are also accorded this status. It must, however, be noted that at all times local area plans remain subordinate to the development plan, which sets out the general planning strategy for the whole area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1266" /> Part II provides for regional guidelines. These guidelines will provide a long-term strategic planning framework for the development of the region, covering such issues as population trends, transport and waste matters. The timeframe for the operation of regional guidelines will be longer than the normal duration of development plans.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with development control systems. Planning decisions must now be based on taking into account the proper planning and sustainable development of an area. Explicit provision is made, for the first time, for third parties to make submissions or observations on a planning application, which must be taken into account by a planning authority on making its decision. Time limits for the consideration of planning applications are being speeded up. The time limit for the consideration of a planning application is now set at eight weeks. Where a planning authority seeks further information, which it deems necessary for consideration of a planning application, it will have a further four weeks for consideration of the application from the receipt of the information instead of the two months under the present system. A four week appeal limit will be set for appeals to any planning decisions.</P>
    <P>Part IV simply re-enacts the provisions of the 1999 Planning and Development Bill on the protection of architectural heritage.</P>
    <P>Part V, the most far-reaching part of the Bill, deals with planning matters governing the need to boost our housing supply. This Part provides for housing strategies to be prepared by planning authorities for inclusion as part of any development plan. This is in order that planning authorities can ensure adequate land is zoned for housing in general and, in particular, for sufficient social and affordable housing.</P>
    <P>Section 79 contains the definition of eligibility to qualify for affordable housing. In the original published Bill, an eligible person was defined as a person who could not obtain a sufficient mortgage to purchase a house on the basis of a loan two and a half times the principal income. This definition has been redefined to include persons whose mortgage repayments would exceed 34% of income tax and PRSI. A mortgage for the purposes of applying the 35% eligibility test is defined as a loan for 90% of the price of a dwelling that meets the accommodation requirements of the person or household concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 80 sets out the general obligation on planning authorities to prepare a housing strategy for insertion in their development plans. Subsection (3) provides that a housing strategy must have regard to the need for social housing, the need to ensure that housing is available for all people on different levels of income, the need to ensure the availability of an adequate mixture of house types to cater for increased demand and the need to counteract social segregation, including assistance for the disabled.</P>
    <P>Section 80 also permits the making of a joint housing strategy between two or more auth<Col N="1267" /> orities. For example, it makes sense for a county council and an urban district council to make a joint housing strategy which could then be reflected as appropriate within the individual development plans.</P>
    <P>Section 82 provides that a planning authority may attach a condition to a planning permission in relation to land to which a social or affordable housing objective applies requiring a developer to enter into an agreement with the planning authority.</P>
    <P>There is now an express provision enabling the authority and the developer to enter an agreement which would result in the developer building the social or affordable houses at an agreed cost and transferring them to the local authority on completion. This type of arrangement would in some circumstances be advantageous to both the local authority and to the developer. The local authority would get the houses more quickly than otherwise and the whole development could be built in a more coherent and integrated manner. The local authority must indicate to the developer its intentions with regard to the type of housing it proposes to build on the transferred land. Financial disputes between landowners and local authorities concerning this provision can be referred to An Bord Pleanála. It is only the local authority or the developer who can bring such disputes to An Bord Pleanála for resolution.</P>
    <P>The provision of adequate housing for all members of society has been a major issue of public policy for this Government since it assumed office. This State has a history of very high home ownership. Ireland has the highest rate of home ownership in Europe. The State has a responsibility to assist those who cannot afford to house themselves in the marketplace and this is the key objective in the provisions of Part V of Bill concerning social housing needs.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise one point in this regard. In the debate on the Bill in the Seanad before Christmas, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, categorically stated that the Government is not shifting its housing responsibilities on to developers. He stated that the Government is trying to bring about a situation whereby the shortage of social and affordable housing for the lower and middle income sections of our community is addressed within the structures of the planning system.</P>
    <P>By any standard the Bill will be one of the most far-reaching and fundamental items of legislation to be enacted by this Government in its two and half years in office. While there has been extensive comment and debate in respect of the social housing provisions included in Part V, it is fair to say that the Bill involves much more than that specific policy change. The Bill will change our planning system for all time and it will modernise our procedures, through the enhanced and specific new powers being given to planning authorities and to An Bord Pleanála. It is a bold item of legislation and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Demp<Col N="1268" /> sey, must be congratulated for his courage in bringing forward such far-reaching and balanced policy changes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to zone in on a number of specific aspects on the Bill. People's housing needs is an issue of major importance with which Members must deal. As previous speakers stated, between 60% and 70% of people who attend our clinics, etc., raise the issue of their housing needs. It is, therefore, timely that the Bill has been introduced and I understand it will be enacted, with the support of all parties, before Easter.</P>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Yates, who has difficulties with Part V, I believe the amendments the Minister made in the Seanad to make 20% of land holdings available for social and affordable housing will succeed. The area I represent, Fingal, is probably one of the fastest growing in the country. Today, seven of the largest development companies in Ireland are approaching agreement with the county management team on the commitment in respect of social and affordable housing. The Bill will introduce an atmosphere of flexibility which will allow the provisions in Part V to work. The industry realises that it has obligations which must be met and its members recognise that the amendments introduced by the Minister in the Seanad will afford them the opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>I do not believe social housing integration can be engineered. I would prefer it if we followed the model used in my area at present. Five or six of the largest companies in the building industry have submitted action plans to Fingal County Council and consulted with the housing, planning and county management teams. I am informed by sources on the council that there is no detectable resistance from members of the industry in respect of this matter.</P>
      <P>Fingal County Council is already dealing with this area on the basis of the provisions being introduced in the Bill. That is the way forward. In my opinion the shared ownership-affordable housing schemes will work. With proper design procedures and with the industry and county management working together, we will see a radical reversal of the difficulties experienced by young people trying to buy houses.</P>
      <P>In my area, because of massive investment in recent years, the council intends to build 1,400 shared ownership units. I am pleased to note that under the terms of the Bill one third of the units built in every council scheme will be designated for sale under the shared ownership scheme. That is a positive way of achieving social integration. It will also give young couples an opportunity to live in the area in which they grew up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish now to raise an issue to which previous speakers referred. Without efforts being made in relation to staffing levels in local authorities, the plans we are putting in place will not be implemented. The level of applications being made to Fingal County Council at present is equivalent to that which obtained before the break-up of the County Dublin area into three <Col N="1269" /> boroughs in 1994. As other Members stated, private sector companies are offering attractive terms of employment which is leading to the most experienced executives leaving planning authorities throughout the country. The Minister and the Government will be obliged to consider this matter, particularly in terms of training and wage structures, because it is frustrating when a person who is dealing with a particular planning matter moves to a new job or is seconded to another post. I accept the Bill contains provisions in respect of appointing additional staff but there is a need to consider the overall issue in terms of wage structures and training.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concept of area action plans. These will give members of the public a say in the final programme of works to be carried out in any area. I hope the days are gone when housing schemes were started without the proper infrastructure being put in place. These integrated action plans, which will form an integral part of development plans, are a positive development.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the concept of strategic development zones. A large number of high-tech industries are being attracted to Ireland and many of the companies involved are situating their operations near Dublin Airport, which is in my constituency.</P>
    <P>It is no good telling people they may get planning permission in two or three years because the product they are trying to develop may be out of date by then. It is vital that proper planning guidelines ensure that national or international investors who are creating jobs know that one application will lead to planning permission. This is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The changes contained in the Bill will assist in the implementation of the national development plan. A large amount of expenditure is involved in that plan and the changes in the Bill dealing with planning applications and An Bord Pleanála will help to speed up some of the important national projects outlined in the plan. I welcome the strengthening of laws and fines concerning unauthorised buildings and their retention.</P>
    <P>The first three development plans for Dublin were over a ten year period and were not reviewed for up to ten years. This led to many problems with which we are still dealing. That is why it is important to implement a structured review of the plan. There should also be flexibility at management and political level to vary development plans to take account of changes in an area.</P>
    <P>The changes announced by the Minister are the right way to proceed in dealing with the supply of houses, the most politically sensitive issue of the moment. I agree with his decision allowing county management teams and the private sector to provide the number of houses required. The next six to eight months will see the beginnings of major schemes which will include integrated social and affordable housing. The Government set out to achieve this objective and it will be successful.</P>
    <Col N="1270" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing a fundamental amendment to the 1963 planning Act, one is encouraged to look at the atmosphere in which that basic Act was passed. It was a time of incredible hostility to the concept of planning and was preceded by other restrictions in democratic accountability, such as the City and County Management Acts, 1940 and 1955. These Acts were passed against a background of alleged political corruption and impropriety on the part of public local representatives. Historical studies of the period have argued that they were required by the circumstances of the time.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that the Minister, who has given much publicity to the case for reducing the number of Dáil Deputies and reform of the electoral system, has been singularly silent on the need for legislation regarding the management Acts, 1940 and 1955. It is as if the case made in the 1940s and 1950s still remains. It is instructive to consider the roles managers will have under this Bill concerning public representatives. For example, when a new plan is being prepared the hundreds of submissions received will not automatically go to elected representatives but will be presented to them in summary form by the manager. One can draw only one conclusion from this provision &ndash; there is no attempt by the Minister to face up to the fact that we need fundamental changes to the City and County Management Acts regarding the roles of managers. This is not a negative view but takes account of the new democratic impulse for participation in local government.</P>
      <P>Since the passing of the 1955 Act there has been no culture of communication in local authorities. This problem is compounded by sad and serious staff shortages in planning departments. These departments, which are under-staffed, under-resourced and required to meet statutory time limits, will find themselves impelled towards thinking that those who want to ask questions and participate are fractious. They will be encouraged in this opinion by more than the odd manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to recount some personal experiences of the atmosphere surrounding the preparation of city and county development plans. I participated in written and oral submissions regarding the last development plan for Galway city. Just under 500 submissions were made concerning the plan which received a two line reply acknowledging the submission but stating that no change to the plan was recommended on the basis of the submission. I am not commenting on the quality of my submission, the groups with which I was associated or any other submission but, as a public representative, I challenge the bona fides of those who claim this is a consultation process. The public, by way of a notice in local newspapers, are invited to be told what has been decided for them. Any consultation process in any planning authority in the civilised world involves people from the beginning and, <i>ab initio</i>, one knows what the choices are. The range of choices is narrowed down and hard decisions are <Col N="1271" /> made. Involvement at that level is the only definition of true consultation.</P>
    <P>In the poisoned atmosphere of an absence of consultation, it is easy for those who make representations on particular issues to be incorrectly portrayed as fractious or difficult people or organisations. It is also easy to draw a line between elected members who ask difficult questions and those who, as it were, roll over for the co-optation techniques of those who have prepared the unrepresentative and non-consultative &ndash; in a genuine sense &ndash; plan. It is easy to say that the former are difficult councillors.</P>
    <P>Let us call a spade a spade. We are discussing changes to planning legislation when the planning process has been seriously damaged. I will not upset the Chair by straying into matters which are before the courts or the tribunals. However, the damage done to the planning process is outrageous. This damage has not been caused by those who make a case for retaining a green area or whatever. It is interesting that such people were among those turned on when we discussed the housing crisis. This Bill is a planning and a housing Bill rolled into one. It was suggested that such people were delaying the availability of land or whatever. The people who have damaged politics and planning are not those interested in issues beyond themselves, such as green areas. Let us speak plainly because it will divide political parties into the next decade. The damage was caused by those who put the right to speculate above the right to a house.</P>
    <P>This is an issue on which not everyone will agree. We spoke last night about the concept of universality in health care, that there is a basic level of health care to which everyone has access. One can refer to the right to a level of education to which everyone has access, or the universal right to a level of information to which every citizen has access and which one should not have to purchase. There is that which one has a right to view as a citizen on free-to-air television for example, as opposed to Rupert Murdoch's pay television. That concept of universality in health, education and information applies, above all else, to housing. It cannot be dodged any more. There are those who will suggest the market will solve the problem. A Government party has lined up with its old friends the builders and particularly the speculative part of the building industry. A major party in this House has a relationship which it is anxious now to vaporise, with the corrupt, speculative component of the building industry. That should be said openly by those of us who despise it, who are in public life, in politics and who refuse to be besmirched by it. There is a choice. Will it say the right to speculate is a lesser right or that it is not a right at all by comparison to the right to shelter? Is the right to shelter a universal right? Let us divide on that one. Let the public line up between all those who want to support a party such as this. Sadly, the public have given a huge <Col N="1272" /> vote to those who were being gurriers for themselves who they imagined might be gurriers sometime in the national interest in a residual way. We have reached the state of politics we are in now, precisely because of that. It needs to be stated openly and again and again. There is no running away from it.</P>
    <P>When one examines the new reformed Fianna Fáil party with its injection of PD virtue, it offers us in the course of three budgets, a reduction in capital gains tax, first for residential building land and then for all development land. In other words, we will tell the speculative hucksters that we will try and entice from them what they are hoarding, not because there is a housing crisis that affects a citizenship right or basic right, but because the housing shortage is now beginning to affect the economy. Economic growth is challenged by the housing shortage. It did not matter that people with two incomes combined rising at half six or seven in the morning, going to work, having to make provision for child care and going home late at night was damaging to society. What mattered was that suddenly the economic growth rate might be affected by the housing shortage. The Government turns to the squad that has supported it and suggests that maybe it might lure out what it has hoarded by way of zonings and permissions. The squad then comes and says &ldquo;That is not enough. When you have done all the rezoning, and I know now you want to build on the space of a postage stamp, we will want change in a densities&rdquo;.  Suddenly people get an intellectual charge to the mind: &ldquo;Ireland has a different density regime to other European countries&rdquo;. They forget to compare honestly, the fact that in one city and town after another across Europe where densities have been changed, people have access to public parks, and to huge public provision which is absent in Dublin, Galway and in many other towns. It is a nonsense. However, what one does get is the sort of carry-on which was accommodated for years where we have tens of thousands of glorified flats, called apartments now, with balconies stuck outside them to make up the alleged open space associated with building and development. There is not enough time to examine the details but I will on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear that the public will have to make choices. To those who want to challenge the 20% that might come in within three years, I say &ldquo;challenge it&rdquo;, but let us go back then to a point before the Kenny report and if there is a constitutional challenge, let us have a referendum on this, that will establish as a basic principal, the right of local authorities to establish land banks as a primordial interest in relation to any other rights that might be there in relation to property. Mr. Justice Kenny went blue in the face giving hints that such a case would be welcome if stated before him. That would be more welcome than this notion that we can change densities, that we can make such zonings as will facilitate speculation and so on. I am not just talking about facts. <Col N="1273" /> I can be as factual as people want. Since 1 January 1998, when inflation was less than 4%, the take, on profit on development land increased by between 30% and 35%. In the old days I sat in Government with the Minister. Then in another Government, I remember answering questions on whether the two people I brought to the Department with me, a programme manager and an adviser &ndash; I had no PR person &ndash; had mobile phones and who was paying the cost of their calls. These converts used to ask these questions, saying this was an example of disgraceful abuse of the public purse by the Labour Party. Giving one's adviser a mobile phone was somehow awful. Last year, they spent £571,238 on spreading the good news from the Custom House. Where are all those who were up on their hind legs on that matter now? That is a great number of telephone calls. Where are all those who worked as permanent civil servants who were worried about the dislodgement of opportunities here, there and everywhere when the money is being forked out right, left and centre for propaganda rather than policy?</P>
    <P>I will make a few other points because there will be an opportunity of going through the different sections of this legislation on Committee Stage. I raise the question of whether we want a genuine planning regime. This has been raised by other Deputies. I will not delay on it. One could probably do it best only in a general spatial plan, that is accepting the responsibility of balances between urban and rural, between regional cities such as Cork and Galway and towns and villages. The biggest pressure in Europe is on village structures for example because towns in different regions are sucking village life into them. There is a collapsing not just of the agricultural industry or of farming but also of a rural way of life. We need to accept planning to the point at which one begins with a spatial vision and let us debate it, differ on it and have consultation on it. Let us differ politically.</P>
    <P>I accept &ndash; I am a democrat  &ndash; that the majority of people in this country have never supported such a radical agenda as would do many of the things in relation to basic rights that I mention. They have had in effect, a relationship with the slieveens and the gombeens who they believe are rising. As R.H. Tawney put it, &ldquo;why do tadpoles put up with their existence in the hope that maybe one of their number will leap to earth one day and become a frog?&rdquo;. Maybe that is the reason they supported such corruption so consistently with such dire consequences. If there was a genuine spatial background dimension to this, one would have then some guidelines on the city and county development consultation process.</P>
    <P>The technical resources that have become monopolised within the city and county management Act through the 1955 and the 1940 Acts should be available to the public. The public should have access to such technical expertise so that they are not at a net disadvantage. It is a disgraceful lie to suggest that consultation is suf<Col N="1274" /> ficient when that which has been decided for you with all the technical resources loaded into one option is just shown to you. This is like saying, &ldquo;Look what I have for you&rdquo;. Then they turn around and say, &ldquo;Mr. Mayor&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mr. Chairman&rdquo;, &ldquo;This is your plan, take ownership of my plan&rdquo;. Then one lives with that for four or six years.</P>
    <P>What do those, as Trollope would put it, hoping for preferment want? They say they have the most wonderful manager in the world and if there is life in outer space, he is also better than any of them. There will then be a round of applause. If someone asks a difficult question, he or she is &ldquo;the crank from the council&rdquo;. That is not good enough and is not what the public want. The public will not put up with it for much longer. They want and are entitled to genuine consultation. They want to be involved at the generation of options and to have access to whatever technical information is necessary.</P>
    <P>Also absent from the Minister's long speech &ndash; one can produce a great deal for £500,000 &ndash; is integration. Many of the new development plans for different cities and counties were prepared without any public consultation and without taking waste management strategies or transportation studies into account. There was consultation &ndash; those with a monopoly of technical expertise knew about the terms of reference and preliminary detail from the consultants involved, but elected members did not. This is crazy.</P>

      <P>I will list the themes I hope to develop on Committee Stage so a sense of anticipation will be created among those who will want to support me. There is an absence of integration and I gave the examples of transportation and waste management. There is also the disgraceful suggestion that those who express an opinion are holding up good planning. The Labour Party is totally opposed to the proposed fee every time one makes an observation on a planning application. The idea that the consideration of An Bord Pleanála should be limited to those filtered out by the £20 fee is a curious contradiction of every nod in the direction of democracy. There are vexatious objections. The Minister of State in my constituency drew attention to this matter, about which he is concerned. I did not hear him commenting on a recent allegation reported in a local newspaper that people were offered inducements to withdraw their objections. Is there a penalty for paying of an objector in the Bill?</P>
      <P>It would be wonderful if the speculative builders ran it all and solved the housing crisis. It is an awful pity that democracy is getting in the way, that elected representatives will have as much power as managers and that consultation will have to be earlier rather than later. That is the current atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1275" /> Another flaw in this Bill is the idea of exempted development which will create another cosy situation. We will oppose that on the basis that instead of extending the requirements of planning, which is a democratic requirement on every citizen, we are now proposing to invite people into partnership with local authorities to dodge responsibility and accountability in planning. I hope we will able to return to these points and others I have not covered on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I would love to live in Deputy Higgins' ideal world. Unfortunately, my views are far more conventional. This is, by any standards, major legislation. The Bill proposes a fundamental reform of planning law and consolidates existing law. The Bill is timely if not a little overdue, having regard to the rapid economic growth in recent years. A central aim of the Bill is to increase the supply of social and affordable housing. Anyone involved in public life realises that this must be our major priority. It is impossible to discuss every measure in the Bill on Second Stage in the short time available to Members. It is obvious that the real work will be done on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The overall context of planning is, for the first time, clearly spelled out in this Bill. At the highest level is the national development plan and the associated national spatial strategy. I welcome the commitment given in the national development plan to balanced regional development through the promotion of urban growth centres, among other measures. This policy will considerably ease the pressures emerging in a rapidly expanding greater Dublin area. At the next level are the regional planning guidelines, drawn up by regional authorities, which will cover issues such as population trends, housing strategy, location of development, transport, waste, protection of the environment, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Central to the Bill is the traditional local authority development plan. I agree with Deputy Higgins that we need greater public participation in this aspect of planning. I welcome the provisions for co-ordination of development plans for adjoining areas, particularly regarding the four local authorities in Dublin. At present, advertisements regarding development plans are placed in the national press, possibly in two newspapers. Often the vast majority of people do not read the newspaper or do not see the notice. It is not enough to put an official notice in newspapers. More public participation is needed in the drawing up of development plans. More communication regarding the issues involved is also needed. Modern communications techniques should be used to ensure involvement. I estimate that when a local authority prepares a development plan, more than 90% of the people of the area involved are oblivious to it. More work needs to be done in this regard. I welcome the provisions in the Bill for consultation and public <Col N="1276" /> participation in the drawing up of development plans.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for co-ordination of development plans for adjoining areas, particularly as regards the four local authorities in Dublin. Often when one local authority, for example, Dublin Corporation, is drawing up plans, it is totally oblivious to what is happening across the road or the river in, for example, Fingal County Council. The provision for co-ordination needs to be developed when the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>A core principle of the Bill is sustainable development. I am delighted this is being put to the forefront, as it is essential in this day and age. I also welcome that statutory recognition is being given to local area plans. There is a desire to develop such plans in many communities in the Dublin area who are willing to become involved. For example, the traditional villages of Dublin such as Raheny, Clontarf, Santry and Drumcondra, have drawn up local area plans and are crying out for them to be implemented. They have received little or no co-operation from their local authorities. I welcome the commitment of Dublin Corporation to develop this concept this year. I hope the Bill will spur them into action. The communities involved have not been encouraged by local authorities and I hope this will change.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with planning permissions. Third parties will have a statutory right to make a submission when this Bill becomes law. It is extraordinary that this right was never previously provided for in legislation. A further provision refers to the payment of a fee when a submission is made. There will be much debate of that measure but it is my belief that it is a good idea. If people feel strongly enough about something they must be prepared to pay for it. We live in an age of charges and fees; we also live in an age of spurious objections.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives planning authorities the right to regulate the naming and numbering in housing estates. There are duplications of names and house numbers in urban estates. Local authorities should play a more active role to rectify this situation.</P>
    <P>The restriction of rights of appeal to those who made a submission to the local authority is controversial. It will, however, streamline the planning process and prevent spurious objections which are often put forward for commercial reasons whereby one commercial operator automatically objects to the development plans of another in the same area.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with enforcement. Local authority enforcement is pathetic. There is widespread abuse of planning law and local authorities seem powerless to do anything about it. This Bill puts more of an onus on local authorities to follow up complaints about breaches of the planning controls. Planning inspectors are reluctant to investigate breaches of planning permission. They adopt a live and let live approach which cannot be tolerated. The planning inspectors should be given more power. Often a row of trees will be <Col N="1277" /> destroyed before the planning inspector has even been notified of the situation. More staff are needed to deal with the situation because much more development is now under way than was the case in the past. There are more possibilities that planning controls are being breached as a result.</P>
    <P>The planning authorities will be able to take enforcement action against a developer for not finishing an estate within seven years. All public representatives know that there is a serious problem with builders and developers refusing to finish estates, causing intolerable problems for residents. Residents' associations find it impossible to get satisfaction from the local authority or from the developer.</P>
    <P>I have long called for licensing for outdoor events. In 1977 Bob Geldof and The Boomtown Rats could not find a suitable venue in their home town for an outdoor concert due to the complex planning system. In 1998 a planned concert by The Rolling Stones in the RDS was cancelled because of uncertainty over planning permission. Until now concerts at Slane Castle, Croke Park, the RDS, Lansdowne Road and other venues were at risk given the complexity of the planning laws. That is why section 208 of this Bill, exempting outdoor events from the planning process, is most welcome. Promoters will now be required only to obtain a licence from the local authority to hold such an event. Such a system will adequately accommodate the legitimate concerns of local residents and other interested parties. This provision is long overdue and puts an end to the crazy situation which existed until now. At last top international artists and bands can plan to perform in this State free from the dangers posed by the complexity of the planning laws.</P>
    <P>In his speech on Second Stage, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The provision of adequate housing for all members of society has been a major issue of public policy for Governments of all shades since this State gained its independence. It has further been a traditional aim of Government to facilitate people in buying their own homes where this is possible. This has had a stabilising effect on Irish society and home ownership is an aspiration which the vast majority of people hold dear. This Government will continue to support that aspiration but the State also has a responsibility to assist those who cannot afford to house themselves in the market. This has been done through the provision of local authority or other social housing. Part V of this Bill is designed to underpin these two planks of our housing policy.</P>
    <P>I could not agree more. Part V of the Bill provides for the preparation of housing strategies by planning authorities as part of their development plans to ensure adequate land is zoned for housing and that sufficient social and affordable housing is provided. Up to 20% of land to be used for <Col N="1278" /> residential purposes must be provided for social or affordable housing. This is a radical proposal. It is also vital. There is a serious housing problem in Dublin. Little land is available for the construction of new social housing and higher house prices make it difficult for local authorities to purchase existing houses. The Dublin city manager believes that the 20% proposal is the only answer to the problem if we are to provide public housing in the traditional manner.</P>
    <P>I welcome the plans for an integrated strategy for the four local authorities in the Dublin area. That is the only way people who live within the Dublin Corporation area will have any hope of getting local authority housing. Such an integrated strategy is essential.</P>
    <P>The constitutionality of the provision has been mentioned. Bunreacht na hÉireann is an evolving document which changes as society changes. People have a right to food on the table, clothes on their backs and a roof over their head. If the common good does not mean the right to housing, it means nothing. Any decision by the Supreme Court will dwell on the concept of the common good and should this Bill end up before the Supreme Court, it will be found constitutional. Such a decision will be a landmark judgment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concept of social integration but I would not under-estimate opposition to such a concept. The experience of my local authority is not good in attempting to buy private houses in private housing estates to give to people on local authority waiting lists. Such purchases are fiercely resisted by local residents and local residents' associations. We should not be oblivious to this issue. This is why we must commit ourselves in this Bill to the concept of social integration. We are giving a lead in that regard. Many difficulties are being experienced by people who live in the Dublin Corporation area in their attempts to obtain housing. There is a limit, for example, of £100,000 on the shared ownership scheme. One cannot purchase a house nowadays in the city for £100,000. There is a provision for an applicant to provide £30,000 extra from his or her resources. Unfortunately, this does not apply to very many people, therefore, shared ownership is no longer an option.</P>
    <P>There has been no progress in the city in relation to the scheme of affordable housing. Land has been looked at in Finglas and possibly in Airfield, Malahide Road, but we are talking about two or three years down the road. Therefore, at present the scheme of affordable housing is useless in the Dublin Corporation area. The Department must be conscious of this fact. What are people living in the Dublin city area to do about obtaining housing, given that all the schemes announced do not apply to them? Local authority housing cannot be built because land is not available. These issues must be highlighted and dealt with.</P>
    <P>The publication of the strategic planning guidelines report and the residential density guidelines <Col N="1279" /> report have a profound effect on planning in suburban Dublin. The very character of neighbourhoods is being changed rapidly. Massive planning applications are being received for town houses, apartments, duplex units and so on. Some of these are four storey blocks. These applications are totally out of character with the existing urban environment and this is causing concern in neighbourhoods. Yet high density must be the answer if we are to prevent an urban sprawl and consequent traffic and other problems. However, we cannot have high density at any cost. The concept of sustainable development in this regard is extremely important. We also need an efficient and comprehensive public transport system. The challenge is to protect our existing amenities and develop quality new living environments. We need good design and to establish the visual relationship between buildings and public space. Such frameworks help to establish the character and quality of streets and urban spaces in a local context. There is a major challenge in this area.</P>
    <P>There is a view that Dublin is developing <i>ad hoc</i>, that builders and the market are setting the agenda. We must plan now because there could be a population of 1.93 million in the greater Dublin area by 2011. The national development plan calls for balanced regional development, which I welcome. Residential density guidelines mean development of the existing urban area and should help stop the relentless sprawl of the capital. Urban renewal schemes have helped in the past and the proposed development of the Dublin Docklands will also help. I support the view for a metro system linking Connolly and Heuston stations. We must get the planning of Dublin right, otherwise it will be <i>ad hoc</i> and out of control, and God knows what we will end up with in a few years' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in general, both in consolidating the existing planning Acts and in attempting to streamline the whole planning process. One of the major criticisms of the planning process, which has often been identified as a bottleneck in progressing many projects, has been the tortuous, uncertain and very lengthy journey through the planning system. These delays applied equally to public and private sector projects and have contributed significantly to the infrastructural deficit and undeveloped nature of the public-private partnerships, a process which is still in its infancy. I am aware some projects are now progressing. The efficacy of the Bill will be critical in ensuring the process can prosper in the future and that we can look to the private sector to provide, in partnership with the State, many infrastructural projects. In the past, the private sector shied away from involvement in public sector projects simply because the whole planning process seemed to be so open-ended and uncertain. These inordinate delays in bringing projects from conception to construction resulted in many projects being lost or aban<Col N="1280" /> doned. By the time planning applications for others are approved, the projects are no longer relevant. Conditions have changed so much in the meantime, they are either the wrong size or are inappropriate to market conditions and demand.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, I wish to speak about the efficacy of the Bill in bringing an end to unsustainable delays, in bringing certainty to public and private sector proposals and bringing the planning process timeframe into line with the rest of Europe, with which we are in competition. I hope to be in a position to speak in detail about other aspects of the Bill on Committee Stage. The urgency with which the Bill is being treated on all sides of the House, and indeed by the industry outside, is because of the common acceptance that there is a housing crisis. This is also critical to the implementation of the national development plan which sets very ambitious targets for the remedying of the infrastructural deficit. Much of the discussion and media attention has centred around the housing issue and the measures in this Bill. However, meeting housing needs on their own is just meeting some of our needs. If the aspiration to sustainable development has any meaning, surely it must mean integrated and the simultaneous provision of other aspects of infrastructure such as transport, water, waste treatment, recreation and other facilities. All these services, not just housing, are needed by populations. The Bill misses a valuable opportunity to remove barriers which have prevented all these things happening together in the past.</P>
      <P>Perhaps too much is expected of the Bill. I fear that when it is passed, the Government will heave a collective sigh of relief that all our planning problems are over and the implementation of the national development plan will flow smoothly on time, on budget and so on. I do not think this will be the case. Some of the barriers to bringing projects to a conclusion, or even commencement, do not fall within the scope of the Bill. Some issues that fall within the scope of the Bill have not been addressed or where they are addressed, at least in theory, there is very little evidence that the resources are available to allow many of these worthy measures to be implemented. In relation to issues that fall outside the scope of the Bill, the EPA gives me cause for concern. As far as I am aware, there is no time limit on decisions by the EPA. It is responsible for the licensing of much of our environmental infrastructure. This should have been included in this Bill or another Bill. I recently read the EPA's 1998 report. The local authority in my area applied to the EPA for a waste management licence 18 months ago. After a year, it was asked for additional information, which it supplied. Two months later it was told the additional information was so significant that it had to go back to square one and start the public consultation process again. A total of 18 months was wasted while that was ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if this is typical of other cases. I accept that such an application is complex and involves technical issues. I am sure the delay is <Col N="1281" /> not due to any badness on the part of the EPA. However, it indicates a lack of resources within the EPA. It has an important role to play and the issue of waste management is contentious enough without adding the uncertainty of these delays. This area needs to be considered as part of the implementation of the overall plan. There are difficulties with regard to Kerbside but the whole Dublin region is lurching from crisis to crisis in terms of waste management. In many cases the disposal of waste is being done to what would be regarded internationally as unacceptable standards and at an escalating cost. There is a need to move speedily to the next generation of waste management.</P>
    <P>Ministers are not entirely free from guilt in relation to holding up projects. The Luas project is a case in point. It had been through most of the tortuous planning procedure from conception to public consultation, etc, but it was turned on its head at the whim of a Minister. Years of consultation, deliberation and planning were thrown out the window. The project is as much in the air as it was 18 months ago when the proposal to put part of it underground was announced. The Dublin Port tunnel is another case involving a lengthy and tortuous planning process. The matter was on the Minister's desk from May to December before a decision was made. It was a critical decision for Dublin and progress needed to be made quickly. It was an inordinately long time for a Minister to take to make a decision but I realise that, in future, this type of decision will be made by An Bord Pleanála. However, unless it has the resources to make such decisions, I am not sure they will be made any more quickly.</P>
    <P>As the Fine Gael spokesperson on transport, one of my concerns is the extent to which the Bill can facilitate and speed up the implementation of the national road network, particularly the aspect of the network included in the national development plan for the next seven years. There are two glaring omissions in the Bill in that regard. The first is the failure to tie down as tightly as possible the conditions under which an applicant can seek a judicial review of a CPO, EIS or motorway scheme which has been through the process. There is a provision that a review would only be granted where the court is satisfied the applicant has a substantial interest in the matter.</P>
    <P>I do not know how 'substantial' can be defined, but an attempt should be made to do it. If that is not done, the courts will interpret it for us. The word 'substantial' could mean anything; it could be as long or wide as a piece of string. It adds uncertainty to projects because no one can predict how the courts will interpret what is a substantial interest. I am sure the Minister is aware that it was generously interpreted recently and resulted in an important road project being delayed.</P>
    <P>The second and related area where the Bill is disappointing is that it has not sought to limit the discretion of the High Court to entertain applications for a judicial review which are made out-<Col N="1282" /> side the two month limit. Under recent legislation, the courts were allowed some discretion outside that period. This discretion was used recently and delayed another road project. I welcome that the courts are now regarding these matters as important and are giving them early and expeditious attention. I hope this will continue, but the legislation should tie it down. We cannot depend only on the goodwill of the courts. The Minister has received representations on these matters from others, including the National Roads Authority, and I ask him to tighten up those loopholes.</P>
    <P>No one would deny that there is ample opportunity in the process, particularly regarding motorway orders, etc, for the public to have an input. This is correct. It is our job to protect the interests of individuals and groups when major public projects are being proposed. However, there must be finality. There must come a point when the common good takes over, a halt is called to the planning process and a project proceeds. In many cases, the balance is wrong. If we do not get it right, now, it will offset many of the potential gains of the Bill in terms of speeding up and streamlining the approval process.</P>
    <P>My greatest concern is about the availability of resources to implement the Bill throughout the planning system. I welcome the time reductions in the various stages of the process involved in planning permissions, approvals and orders, etc. However, without resources, reducing the decision time from two months to eight weeks or from a month to four weeks or putting time restrictions on the making or varying of development plans will not achieve quicker decisions. They will achieve bad decisions and, in some cases, refusals which will clog up the system further because they will result in appeals to the board or fresh applications to local authorities.</P>
    <P>Local authorities must be given resources, primarily in terms of planners &ndash; other speakers referred to this aspect &ndash; but also in relation to the back up services they need. All applications go to every department in the council and the planners need back up in terms of engineering, technical and administrative staff. In all departments which have a planning input, matters will not improve. I am not sure the Minister is aware of how busy planners are at present and the difficulty, particularly in Dublin, involved in getting planners or other professional staff.</P>
    <P>There is a haemorrhage of young professionals from Dublin. They are moving to other local authorities where they can get cheaper housing and if they are not leaving Dublin, they are going to the private sector. What movement there is in Dublin is only poaching from one local authority to another or to An Bord Pleanála. There is little increase in the overall resources available to the public sector. It may appear incredible but in my local authority, no planner has answered a telephone call for three months. They have switched their telephones to voicemail not because they do not want to talk to the public, but because they <Col N="1283" /> have no choice if they are to meet their statutory deadlines in terms of planning permission applications. A shortening of the time involved will not be achieved with a magic wand. Resources must be put in place.</P>
    <P>The problem is not only due to the huge increase in the number of planning applications. The applications have also increased in size and complexity. Today, I became aware of a planning application before my local authority, which is not the biggest application before it, that contains 1,700 drawings. The handling of that application, apart from even reading or assessing the drawings, will absorb enormous resources.</P>
    <P>Planners and engineers also have to deal with the new responsibilities involved in all the regulations, legislation and guidelines thrown at them by the Department. The time available for making development plans has been shortened and they must also prepare action area plans. Local authorities also have responsibility in terms of the increasing output of houses, both public and private, and all that goes with that and other projects in terms of public participation and consultation. This area needs to be resourced. Deputy Higgins said that public consultation is a farce, and he is correct. It involves a notice in a newspaper and a plan stuck up on the wall of the local authority. It does not become consultation until there is a crisis involving a bulldozer on one side and a resident with an injunction on the other. This is not what is meant by consultation. Consultation should take place early on. It needs time and the involvement of technical expertise and information for people. It needs deliberation and planning resources, but that is not available.</P>
    <P>Local authorities cannot do all that is being asked of them within tighter time constraints. It is not possible and the Bill mentions pre-planning consultation to ensure easier passage through the planning system. It is a laudable aspiration but totally fanciful in the current climate in Dublin. Planners do not have time to have chats with people, particularly if they are to meet statutory deadlines, which are to be shortened, in relation to the submission of important planning applications. In so far as members of the public have an opportunity now of getting in touch with planners and having face to face meetings about significant planning applications of interest to their area, they will not have any such opportunity in the future. That under-resourcing goes right through the system. Deputy Haughey spoke about enforcement, which does not exist due to a lack of resources. Local authorities are reluctant to pursue it because they will end up having to commit the time and resources of professional staff to bring small cases to court. However, those small cases are getting bigger every day.</P>
    <P>The provision which gives the rights of a statutory undertaker to the new cable companies and makes them, effectively, exempted development should not be included in the Bill. That was fine in the past when there was a limited number of <Col N="1284" /> public statutory undertakers, little construction activity and no traffic. As well as the traditional statutory undertakers, all of which are providing additional capacity, there is a plethora of telecommunications companies digging up heavily congested streets. I accept they may provide important infrastructure, but it is too easy and cheap for them to dig up the streets. They need road opening licences, but that is only a formality. In theory, while they are meant to co-ordinate their activities, there is war on the streets between cable companies. They are in competition with one another and are vying with each other for road space. Co-operation about road openings is a concept they do not understand. Companies with spare duct capacity employ security to prevent others coming in and stealing their capacity. As a result of all the road openings by statutory undertakers, there is chaos on our streets and local authorities are unable to enforce road reinstatements, tidy up operations etc. We are left with construction material and rubble on the street and poorly reinstated footpaths. In most cases, certainly in Dublin, the local authority does not have a clue who is doing the work, it has no way of following it up and does not have the resources. Some control is needed in that area before it gets out of hand.</P>
    <P>To be successful, many of the proposed changes in the Bill depend on the ability of An Bord Pleanála to deliver decisions on time. That is critical, but without sufficient staff it is not possible. I am concerned that its source of staff will continue to come from the other local authorities in Dublin. If that is the case it is a self-defeating exercise and will produce no increase in output.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision which moves responsibility for confirmation of motorway orders and other projects from the Department to An Bord Pleanála and the imposition of a time limit on these decisions. However, that addresses only one stage of project approval. There are 17 stages of approval which local authorities have to go through to bring a road project from early design to completion. That was all very well when we had no money to spend and we needed to keep projects ticking over, but the position is different now. We need a root and branch assessment of how we should deal with matters if we are to achieve the aspirations of the plan.</P>
    <P>In regard to the road construction programme, under the national development plan, in the next seven years we have to increase our output by one and half times what we achieved on average in each of the seven years of the last plan. That is the equivalent of building the south eastern motorway, the port tunnel, the Kinnegad, Waterford and Limerick by-passes every year. I do not think we are geared up to that. It is worth noting that we failed to meet the targets of the last national development plan when there were no bottlenecks in the economy and little constraints and spare capacity everywhere. All that is changed and there are shortages everywhere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1285" /> My local authority has £66 million to spend on road projects. If we do not gear up to meet the requirements of the Bill and the national development plan in terms of resources &ndash; technical, engineering and planning &ndash; we will not achieve our aspirations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this extensive Bill which is overdue. Planning and planning requirements affect every member of the State. People are not always conscious of this and may think individual applications may not affect them. However, numerous planning applications in any one location affect all of us.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's approach in the Seanad debate and his willingness to take on board amendments, some of which are very practical. One which comes to mind is the decision to extend the time allowed for further information submitted from four weeks to the original eight weeks. He has shown a willingness to be flexible and I have no doubt he will do likewise here. At the same time I am pleased he did not buckle under the pressure from the developers construction federation and individuals &ndash; and the pressure on public representatives to make a case against his plans &ndash; for the inclusion of facilities for social integration and the provision of social and affordable housing. There may be a need to amend some parts of that &ndash; I am happy with the approach &ndash; but the general concept is critical to us all and badly needed. I am pleased he has maintained his stance and that he originally took the initiative on it.</P>
      <P>The team in the Department led by the Minister is doing an excellent job. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, deals with housing and my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, deals with the environment. The friction in previous Administrations is not evident in this one, and it is working well. Following the enactment of this Bill its job should be easier given than much of the representations made to it and the lobbying is about issues relating to planning.</P>
      <P>An individual planning application or development may not affect people, but a multiplicity of development can destroy an area and affect people many miles away. Consideration has to be given to the overall effect of these developments. I represent the villages of Douglas and Grange in Cork. They have become integrated and developers have joined those villages to the extent that they are called Douglas-Grange. Every square yard of green space is used up and the developers are now moving to join them with the village of Rochestown. This is a replica of what happened in Dublin many years ago where village after village was linked together, resulting in the huge sprawl about which people complain. I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss these matters and to take cognisance of what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Developers seem to take the best areas presented and run with them. In that context, I <Col N="1286" /> am concerned that the Bacon report may be used as a developers' charter. In the Rochestown area, a reasonably wealthy area of high quality housing, the housing density is four to five. There is now an application to demolish an existing building and start a new development. That new development would be on an area of approximately 1.8 acres and the application is for 57 units, which will give approximately 31 units to the acre. That is taking place at the core of an existing development and the only justification being put forward for it is the Bacon report. We ought to be careful in implementing these recommendations. We should look at these matters in their totality having regard to how they affect people. I do not wish to oppose any specific planning application here, but I use that as an example.</P>
    <P>In the Grange area of Douglas, to which I referred, no green field was left by either the local authority or the developers. That was the best example of bad planning. If it was not for the Douglas GAA club, which undertook an excellent project, and other sporting and voluntary bodies in the area, where there are now tens of thousands of people, there would be social chaos. It is a frightening thought.</P>
    <P>Recreational facilities are just one environmental aspect of the matter. Another environmental aspect is the sheer congestion on all the approach roads on that side of Cork city as a result of the generation of extra traffic. That development was permitted, with no attempt to provide a proper road infrastructure. I do not want to see that type of approach in the future. There is need for local authorities to co-ordinate their efforts with those of neighbouring authorities in a joint approach to this matter. What happened in the past was irresponsible and was not helpful, but we have had warnings. I hope that as a result of the Bill we will be able to ensure that practice does not continue. I mentioned my own patch obviously, but I am just using that as an example of what has been happening in other areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill is timely because people are now better off. I believe we will make the correct decisions in the future. If we had made such decisions in times of greater poverty when there was high unemployment, we might have been willing to compromise to a greater extent and not made wrong decisions in terms of providing jobs etc. I am glad we are making these decisions in the climate which has been created over the past couple of years. This Bill will be of assistance to us in making the right decisions for future generations.</P>
    <P>There is need for co-ordination of city and county development plans. We hope the public will become more involved in these matters because it owns the local plans, which is laudable. I am concerned about whether the regional body or greater joint authority will be able to overrule the local plan. Will they be able to impose decisions on local people which would not have been included in the local development plan? We <Col N="1287" /> should tease out that matter further. I am a member of the South-west Regional Authority and I welcome the attempts to co-ordinate regional planning development. However, I am concerned about who will win through in the case of conflict &ndash; for example, in Cork Corporation there is conflict between the local plan and the regional authority's recommendation. I ask the Minister to clarify that matter.</P>
    <P>The local authority tenant purchase scheme may not relate directly to the Bill but it has been mentioned already. The new found affluence has created a situation where in the same local authority estate people who bought a house 12 months ago will have paid £12,000, £14,000 or £16,000 less than their neighbours who will avail of the scheme this year. If a person bought a house a year or two years earlier than his neighbour, the difference can be as much as £25,000. I am told that situation has been created by outside forces, but the Government and local authorities are committed to providing housing for people who need them. We should ensure that people are able to purchase their own homes. Home ownership is a much lauded effort in Ireland but it is sneered at in other European countries where people often believe that the housing stock should be rotated among those who need it. Home ownership brings many benefits for the State and local communities. I ask the Minister to look at that issue because I am concerned about it.</P>
    <P>The Bill is greatly concerned with the need to provide houses. There is a greater demand for quality housing and a refusal to accept what was accepted in the past, that is, five or six families sharing a house, with people squashed into rooms. We are aiming for high standards and we must do everything possible to remove any impediments to it. I accept there are problems with house prices.</P>
    <P>We should look at all the schemes of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, many of which are laudable. The &ldquo;in lieu&rdquo; scheme, as it is described, where the local authority builds an extension to a house to address overcrowding, to provide for the accommodation of a lone parent with a child or for other social reasons, is a good scheme which is not used often enough by local authorities. Many local authorities have shied away from it, perhaps because of difficulties in employing an architect or a builder. The Minister has promoted it widely and I would like to see it used more.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the shared ownership scheme and in the context of the development plan it will apply best to new housing schemes provided by the local authority or in partnership with private developers. I ask that the existing scheme would be further examined to see if the six or seven impediments which the applicant faces can be removed. Initiatives have been taken in this regard by local authorities &ndash; Fingal County Council is one of the foremost authorities <Col N="1288" /> in that regard. The Minister has asked all local authorities to look at implementation of the scheme with a view to resolving the difficulties, but they still exist. Some of them include market forces, legal requirements, levels of financing, the need for an inspector's visit and technical matters. Sometimes by the time those matters are taken into consideration, the house is sold to somebody with cash in hand. That matter should be considered because this is a marvellous innovative scheme.</P>
    <P>One point I should have made about the tenant purchase scheme &ndash; it is one of the reasons I raised it &ndash; is that we should not interfere directly in the pricing of houses because local authorities are repurchasing houses which they owned previously. If the tenancy allowance, which is currently 3% for a maximum of ten years, were increased to 4 or 5%, it might deal with the problem. That issue could be examined.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are members of local authorities have encountered many other areas of the planning process over the years. I am glad the Minister is dealing with rogue developers, because anybody who refuses to finish an estate can be called a rogue. They take purchasers' money, yet they refuse to complete the contract. Previously, they could brazenly obtain planning permission from the same local authority for a new development, even next door to the previous unfinished one. The public could not understand it. I have attended meetings in the last 20 years where people asked how such people could obtain permission for a further development. Up to now I have always had to tell them that, because of the legal situation, developers are entitled to apply and cannot be refused because of their previous track records. The Minister has dealt with this and such people can now be refused permission on the basis of new provisions in the Bill. We may have to go to court to achieve that, but I do not mind doing so if it stops these people.</P>
    <P>The role of public representatives in planning matters was mentioned earlier by my colleague, Deputy Fleming. I would like his suggestion to be followed up. If I, as a public representative, am asked to make representations to An Bord Pleanála on a planning matter, without introducing new material, I should be entitled to do so without paying a fee. Public representatives have a built-in right to make representations at all levels, and to charge for making such representations is a contradiction of the democratic powers bestowed on them.</P>
    <P>The next item on the agenda for public representatives is that of lobbying the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, to get money for Cork Corporation or Cork County Council to resurface roads that are in poor condition. When roads are resurfaced, however, they are often dug up within a year by a service provider. We have not managed to change that because such providers have <Col N="1289" /> legal permission to open up roads. It is scandalous, crazy and a waste of public funds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey is the first Minister in my 25 years in local government to have provided much needed funding for non-national estate roads in urban areas, which is very welcome. Prior to this, I met Ministers of all parties, as a member of various deputations, but they refused to provide such funding. We could provide ten times the current funding and we would still not achieve properly surfaced streets and roads if we do not deal with the service providers.</P>
    <P>The street surfaces of Cork city are in a scandalous condition. Some 90% of the damage occurs where reinstatements have taken place and where sections of thoroughfares have collapsed after being tampered with. It is a reflection on us as public representatives, and particularly Members of the Dáil, that we have failed to deal with the problem. While I welcome the finance provided by the Minister, throwing money at the problem will not solve it. It is a waste of taxpayers' money to allow recently resurfaced roads to be dug up indiscriminately by various service providers. We must put manners on these people and co-ordinate their efforts in the same way as we are co-ordinating the planning requirements for the development plans of local authorities. Until we do so, we will fail the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to discuss points arising from some of the amendments proposed in the Seanad. Section 79 deals with affordable housing. It provides for housing strategies to be prepared by planning authorities for inclusion as part of the development plan so that planning authorities can ensure sufficient social and affordable housing is provided in their areas as part of the overall supply of housing. I do not agree with Deputy Haughey's assertion that the scheme is useless. That contradicts what has happened in Galway Borough Council. In advance of any provisions in this Bill, we have already completed 32 affordable houses &ndash; 20 at Rahoon and 12 at Ballybane. The occupants were in the new houses for the new millennium. The buildings are semi-detached and provided with front and back gardens at a cost of £75,000. We were the first local authority in the country to achieve this, and a further 33 affordable houses are under construction. Some 55 units are going through the planning stages and at next Monday's corporation meeting six more will come up for approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 79 also deals with mortgage repayments. The definition of &ldquo;eligible persons&rdquo; is being amended to persons whose mortgage repayments would exceed 35% of their net income. In the case of two income households, one half of the second income would be taken into account for the purpose of determining eligibility. Unfortunately, one of the side effects of the proposal that 20% of land to be transferred from the developer to the local authority may be that the cost of houses on the remaining 80% of the site will rise, thus ensuring the developer makes <Col N="1290" /> a profit. With the 35% income clause, a sizeable proportion of house-seekers could fall between two stools; being unable to afford a house in the 80% sector, and being ineligible for one in the 20% affordable housing sector.</P>
    <P>Section 81 deals with rezoning and was strengthened to make clear that planning authorities are obliged to ensure sufficient land is zoned for residential development to accommodate the housing needs of an area over the planned period. I was involved in two recent development plans while I was a member of the county council and the borough council. Up to the last local elections I dealt with the county plan, and more recently I dealt with the city development plan which was adopted in December 1998 after 18 months of serious deliberation. The greatest need for houses in the region is in Galway city. We zoned large tracts of land to meet the requirements in the next five years, which generally turns out of be six or seven years in the life of a development plan. That may not happen in future but it has always happened in the past. Large areas of land were zoned to encourage that type of land, in this and other areas, to be put on the open market. The Government responded with a plan to reduce capital gains tax from 40% to 20% on zoned land. Everything was being done to encourage people to put this land on to the market. The Department of the Environment and Local Government then sanctioned sewerage service schemes for this land which was put on the market and sold subject to planning, in most cases. We discovered, however, at the end of that process that it is not possible to grant planning permission, despite the land being zoned and serviced, because a design has not yet been done for the roads in the area. There is a great deal of pressure on engineering road design staff in councils who deal with bypasses, distributor roads, relief roads, ring roads and so on. There is insufficient staff to deal with road design for zoned lands which should be ripe for development but are being held up until this work is done. I appeal to the Minister to provide the local authorities with the necessary staff to do this work. I will deal later with the pressure on planning offices and the staff needed to deal with local authority planning problems.</P>
    <P>The planning authority should be automatically required to maintain land transferred in an acceptable condition. We have tabled an amendment to section 82, which should be generally welcomed. Instead of transferring the land to be reserved for social and affordable housing to the local authority, with the authority contracting for the erection of the houses afterwards, there is now an express provision that enables the authority and the developer to enter into an agreement resulting in the developer building the social or affordable houses at an agreed cost and transferring them to the local authority on completion. That is a move in the right direction. If a developer with 100 acres of land developed 80 acres and transferred 20 acres to the local auth<Col N="1291" /> ority, not knowing when that land might be developed or what type of housing might be built, his ability to sell his own houses and to develop them according to an overall plan would be greatly restricted. This amendment, which was proposed in the Seanad, will ensure developers and local authorities can co-operate to complete housing estates. Many Members have complained about the non-completion of housing estates. This will ensure estates will be completed in their entirety, which is very welcome. In Galway borough council there has been such co-operation between developers and the local authority in the past few years.</P>
    <P>Section 84 deals with clawbacks. In the Seanad, the 10% clawback was regarded as over generous. A full clawback to the local authority of the equity in any sale is now required within the first ten years. In other words, if a person sells an affordable house in the first ten years there will be a full clawback. This equity will be reduced at a rate of 10% per year between the tenth and twentieth year and no clawback will apply after 20 years. That is reasonable for people selling on affordable houses.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the Seanad to preplanning discussions. It is vital that developers have pre-planning discussions before they embark on expensive plans, so that the planners and the local authority can plan the estate together. Reference was also made in the Seanad to the change in the number of elected members necessary to vote for a section 4. The county council of which I was a member some years ago practised section 4s. However, in recent times, all section 4s have been ruled out on legal grounds. I do not know whether the Minister proposes to address this or whether it is unique to Galway. No section 4 is now acceptable because the manager automatically finds a reason to refuse it on legal grounds. Will the Minister clarify that?</P>

      <P>Deputy Roche was only trying to help me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The frustration felt by people dealing with planning offices is caused by understaffing. A typical example, particularly in rural areas, is where a young couple, who might be getting married in a year's time, start to build a house. They get their plans drawn up and apply for planning permission in the usual way. They might have purchased a site or have been lucky enough to get one from their parents. In many cases, a day or two before the eight weeks is up further information is sought. This sometimes happens for very flimsy reasons, such as questions about the water supply or getting a letter from the group water scheme confirming they can connect to it. <Col N="1292" /> The application is delayed until the applicant gets the necessary documentation and then for a further eight weeks. It would be as easy for the planning authority to discover in the first week that information was not on the file. It takes the same amount of time to examine a planning application in the first week after it is lodged as it does in the eighth week. That can have serious consequences. The young couple might have engaged a builder to build their house but they must wait for their application to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>When a public representative inquires about this to the planning office, he or she is told that, due to pressure of work, the planning office was unable to look at the file until the last day or &ndash; according to my interpretation &ndash; it was easier to seek further information than to deal with it. Couples building houses should not be penalised in that manner.</P>
    <P>Another matter that causes great delay in processing planning permissions is the amount of lines on maps indicating new ring roads, bypasses, carriageways and so on. There are sometimes two or three options on the map. Due to the lack of staff in the road planning and design section, correct corridors have not been defined for such roads. Consultants must then be engaged, which takes another six months. In the meantime, no planning permissions can be dealt with in those areas.</P>
    <P>Elected members spend a great deal of time &ndash; sometimes 20 or 30 meetings over a year &ndash; dealing with city or county development plans. We are often greatly frustrated to find afterwards that what we put in the plan can be interpreted differently by the officials and planners. For example, we put a clause in the last county plan for Galway concerning ribbon development. In the previous plan, a development of more than three houses was deemed ribbon development; in the current plan, a development of more than five houses is deemed ribbon development. However, that was interpreted differently by the officials. This is very frustrating for members because they are invoking another clause saying one must preserve the rural character and are refusing planning permissions on that ground.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 1 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999, included provision for 33 million ecu, £26 million in European Regional Development Fund grant aid for the construction of a conference centre in Dublin capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates.</P>
      <P>Following the failure of processes in 1995 and 1996 to secure an approved proposal, a new tender procedure, organised by Bord Fáilte, under the direction of the independent management board for product development and conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, was launched in September 1997.</P>
      <P>This process culminated in June 1998 in the selection of the proposal submitted by Spencer Dock International Convention Centre Limited to go forward for grant-aid to develop the conference centre at a site in Dublin's docklands. The proposal was then subjected to an independent cost benefit analysis.</P>
      <P>In September 1998 the Government agreed to the making of a submission to the European Commission recommending formal approval for a 33 million ecu European Regional Development Fund grant towards the cost of developing the project. The Commission's approval, in principle, for the grant was notified in November 1998 with draw-down subject to resolution of an outstanding procedural complaint and the compatibility of any preferential tax regimes for the project with State aids rules.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance still awaits a final decision from the Commission on taxation regimes for the project which are separate from the tender procedure. The Commission closed its file on the procedural complaint in April 1999. This allowed Bord Fáilte and the developers to proceed with negotiations on legally binding commitments in relation to the project, which the developers were required, under the terms of the operational programme and the grant offer, to enter into by end 1999.</P>
      <P>Having received confirmation from the Commission on the permissible time limits for the grant draw-down, final documentation was agreed and subsequently lodged with Bord Fáilte on 30 December 1999. Since then, I understand, there has been ongoing contact between the two parties regarding certain issues relating to the execution of the grant agreement to ensure that all requirements have been full and satisfactorily met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" />
      <i>Additional Information</i>In the meantime, as negotiations moved nearer to the end year deadline for entering legally binding commitments under the operational programme, and in order to facilitate completion of the public procurement process and avoid any possible risk of loss of European Regional Development Fund funds to Ireland, the Government agreed with the Commission that the grant of £26 million for the conference centre project would be financed from an increase in Exchequer non-co-financed funds to the tourism operational programme. This facilitated a decommitment of European Regional Development Fund funds from the programme for recommitment to other operational programmes which was done last December, in advance of completion of negotiations and entering into legally binding commitments by the developers.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, planning permission for the conference centre, which was granted by Dublin Corporation in August last year, is under appeal and an oral hearing is scheduled to begin in February. An Bord Pleanála has indicated that it expects to have a decision before July this year at the latest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Planning permission is the next necessary step and we will get a report on that in July. I have had little or no discussions with the developers. The developers are in discussions with the people from Bord Fáilte and whatever other contacts they may have outside that. As regards the contract they have with us and Bord Fáilte, they have been in discussions with officials from Bord Fáilte on an ongoing basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether the Deputy is aware that the viability of the project is a matter for the developers. We have satisfied ourselves in that they signed the contracts with us before the end of the year. That contract has been signed between Bord Fáilte and the developers and they will go ahead.</P>
      <P>On the £26 million European Regional Development Fund grant, as the Deputy will know, I brought this matter to Government in November. We transferred the £26 million or 33 million ECU grant out of the operational programme and have diverted it to other operational programmes. The grant-aid, the £26 million, became available from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Tax incentives have nothing to do with my Department. It is a matter for the Department of Finance, the developers and the EU Commission. My main hurdle is to get over the planning permission. In football terms, one looks forward to one's next match. The next match for me is to get over the planning permission.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Taoiseach announced on 26 January that the Government is to proceed with plans to build a campus of sporting excellence to be called Sports Campus Ireland, which will have as its centrepiece an 80,000 seat national stadium capable of accommodating all field sports. The Government is committed to providing Irish sport with a facility that will rank with the best worldwide. While Stadium Ireland will be the focal point of the proposed campus, the total campus will provide a much needed facility of international standard for a wide variety of sports.</P>
      <P>The campus and stadium will represent a total investment of £281 million when completed. Included in the overall investment is a gift of £50 million which has been provided by Limerick businessman, Mr. J. P. McManus. Of the Exchequer investment of £231 million, £135 million will be invested in Stadium Ireland, with the balance being used to build the surrounding campus and provide first class infrastructure, including an indoor arena capable of holding up to 15,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the feasibility study and the recommendations of the stadium steering committee were recently laid before both Houses of <Col N="1296" /> the Oireachtas and are, therefore, readily available in the Library.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for informing us in Tuesday's Order of Business that the stadium steering committee report and the feasibility study are available in the Library. I would like to ask the Minister a question based on the steering committee's recommendations. The steering committee recommends that the Government decide that a positive decision on the stadium is conditional on arrangements being made with the national governing bodies of sports as a minimum case for meeting the operational cost. Another aspect of the recommendations which causes me concern is that arrangements, such as sporting and commercial developments, are to be decided by the Government. I am concerned that a casino could appear at some point if running costs prove prohibitive. Will the Minister assure the House that a substantial and thorough costing has been done in terms of the operational costs of the stadium in particular?</P>
      <P>There has not been any indication that the conditions stated have been met or explored in any substantial way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold the opposite view. The steering committee which carried out this feasibility study has the highest international reputation. It engaged in a great deal of consultation. It consulted the IRFU, the GAA, the FAI and the Athletics Association of Ireland. It also engaged in consultation with stadia management companies of similar facilities in the UK, France, Germany, Portugal, Australia and the US. It consulted 28 national sporting organisations. It also consulted the main concert promoters and exhibition management companies in Ireland and the UK. It had consultations with the management of alternative entertainment and exhibition facilities in Ireland the UK and up to 100 companies in Ireland. The feasibility study is of the highest standard. The steering committee indicated the proposal would be viable on the basis of their feasibility study.</P>
      <P>I would like to clear up one point. It was mentioned that the stadium would be viable on the basis that it would host six major events annually. It is perceived that such major events would have to fill 80,000 seats, but that is not the case. The stadium will be viable on the basis of current events and future events. Currently, we host at least three but more likely four international rugby matches. The GAA has indicated it would be prepared to play two of its matches at the new stadium. Given the talent of Brian Kerr's junior soccer team, I expect our soccer team will be successful in the future. I saw thousands of people outside the gates of Lansdowne Road when there was a demand for 50,000 or 60,000 tickets when our team played even second class teams. I have great confidence in the future success of our soccer team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not taken account of concerts and other forms of entertainment that might be held <Col N="1297" /> at the new stadium. Bono and U2 would fill it with one concert alone, as would the Corrs, Westlife and Boyzone. The structure and technology of the new stadium will be such that it will be possible to reduce the seating area to accommodate the demand for particular events  &ndash; such are the advances of modern technology.</P>
    <P>In one weekend alone, the new stadium could host a concert, rugby match and Michael Carruth or Steve Collins in a title fight. Steve Collins's last title fight was held in Millstreet because it has the capacity to cater for more than 10,000 people. For all these reasons I argue the new stadium will be viable. Who are we to judge future developments in sport?</P>
    <P>The Ryder Cup is the most prestigious golf tournament in the world and it is the most prestigious sports tournament in the world. We can host the Ryder Cup in this small country because we have the infrastructure to do so. If we have infrastructure, such as a stadium, it will create its own demand.</P>

      <P>Tourism has been identified as one of six areas suitable for enhanced co-operation through the mechanism of existing bodies as envisaged under strand two of the Good Friday Agreement. It has been agreed that a publicly owned limited company will be established by Bord Fáilte and the Northern Irish Tourist Board to provide the following functions: planning and delivering international tourism marketing programmes, including programmes in partnership with the industry North and South; publication and dissemination in overseas markets, of information of a balanced and comprehensive nature on the island of Ireland as a tourist destination, which must reflect the diverse traditions, forms of cultural expression and identities within the island; market research, provision of information and other appropriate assistance to help the industry develop international marketing expertise; co-operation with, consulting and assisting other bodies or associations in carrying out those activities; and carrying out surveys and collecting relevant statistics and information.</P>
      <P>At its inaugural plenary meeting, which was held in Armagh on 13 December 1999, the North-South Minister Council, agreed, <i>inter alia</i>, an outline programme of work in regard to each of the six areas for co-operation as a basis for follow-up by the relevant Ministers in the appropriate sectoral format.</P>
      <P>A number of practical issues relating to the new tourism company, including its membership, will be considered by the NSMC when it meets in its tourism sectoral format. I very much hope that the necessary decisions can be taken quickly.</P>

With regard to the Deputy's second question, a board has yet to be established and we have yet to meet our Northern counterparts to discuss the composition of the board. As I pointed out earlier, I am hopeful that the tourism industry, North and South, as it did in respect of the OTMI, will play a significant role in that regard. I have yet to discuss this with Mr. Empey but it is my intention that a number of those appointed will be ministerial nominees.</P>

However, I have made provision for the OTMI to continue to operate until such time as the new company is set up. A suspension of the Executive would lead to the postponement of the new company's establishment.</P>

      <P>asked ask the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation if he will meet the FAI to discuss outstanding issues which exist between him and that organisation regarding the construction of a national stadium and compensation arising from the Government's decision to withdraw visas from the Yugoslav football team and development grants. [2860/00]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I would first like to assure the House that, as far as the Government is concerned, there are no issues outstanding between myself and the Football Association of Ireland and that I am available and willing to meet the FAI to discuss any matter relating to sport. Indeed, I was pleased to perform the official opening of the FAI's very successful coaching forum held in UCD on 8 January last.</P>
      <P>In relation to the national stadium, the position is that the FAI, through its chief executive officer, participated fully on the steering committee and co-operated fully with PricewaterhouseCoopers in the preparation of the feasibility study on the project. As the Taoiseach's recent announcement acknowledges, the three main sports bodies, including the FAI, have indicated their support for the new stadium. While the association still has plans to develop its own stadium, its support for Stadium Ireland as a potential venue for games that potentially might attract over 45,000 spectators, is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December last, the FAI sought a subvention in respect of losses which it associated with the postponement of the Republic of Ireland/ Yugoslavia match the previous June. The Deputy will be aware that the postponement arose following the Government's decision to refuse visas to the members of the Yugoslav football team to <Col N="1301" /> enter this country. This decision was taken in view of the failure on the part of UEFA to cancel the match, in light of the unacceptable situation in Kosovo and the indictment of the International Tribunal against the highest authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The decision of the Government was welcomed by the FAI. However, UEFA imposed a £50,000 fine on the FAI and the match was rearranged for and played on 1 September.</P>
    <P>Costs and revenues generated from the Irish team's participation in events like the Euro 2000 championships are generally a matter for the association and dealt with in that context. Therefore, while continuing to provide funds to the FAI under a range of schemes, both capital and current, I did not make any specific allocation in relation to this item. Last year the FAI received some £166,000 in current funding and FAI affiliated clubs were approved for almost £4 million in grants under the sports capital programme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>When the FAI presented its pre-budget submission, <i>Improving the Quality of Life and Social Inclusion Through the Development of Soccer, </i>in November last the Minister for Finance and myself met its representatives separately and it was made clear at the time that while the proposals contained in the submission were progressive the question of future funding of the association can only be considered in the context of overall sports policy in relation to the whole spectrum of sports and of the resources available.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sports Council is the body with statutory responsibility for the funding of individual sports organisations and for working with governing bodies in the development of all sports in the country. Accordingly, I supplied the council with the FAI's submission for consideration in the context of its work in the development of Irish sport.</P>
    <P>The grants to national governing bodies of sport for 2000, which the council announced recently, includes an allocation in excess of £114,000 for the FAI. This is in addition to the funds the council has set aside for the association, along with the GAA and the IRFU, in respect of pilot initiatives in which the three organisations are involved aimed at increasing participation in sport and recreation by young people from selected disadvantaged areas. The aim of the pilot initiative is to produce models of best practice for governing bodies and clubs working in areas of disadvantage generally. Last year the association received an allocation of £58,000 under this scheme. The council will be evaluating the effectiveness of this expenditure before determining the level of this year's allocations under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the magnificent contribution which the Football Association of Ireland makes to the development of sport here and I want to ensure that the close co-operation which exists <Col N="1302" /> between myself, the Irish Sports Council and the FAI continues to flourish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that it was the Government's sole decision to withdraw visas for the members of the Yugoslav team due to play in Dublin last June? Does the onus, therefore, not fall on the Government to compensate the FAI for the £50,000 fine imposed on it? Given that departmental resources will be invested in the development of the national stadium, will the level of funding provided to sporting organisations throughout the country be reduced? In view of the fact that the FAI is not involved in this development, will it lose out to a greater degree than any of the other organisations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely not, nothing could be further from the truth. As the Deputy is aware, the FAI has decided to proceed, as it is entitled, with the development of Eircom Park. The Irish soccer team has done well in the past and its supporters have been great ambassadors for this country.</P>
      <P>In proceeding with the national stadium, it is the Government's intention to remove the burden from national sporting organisations of having to provide their own stadia. This will allow the investment of financial resources in helping the clubs, etc., which constitute those organisations. My Department will continue to fund community, social and football clubs. In 1999, the Government invested more money in improving sporting facilities than was invested in the three years, 1995 to 1997. It is not necessarily the fault of smaller clubs, but at the end of last year I was obliged to return £8 million to the Exchequer because smaller individual grants had not been drawn down as a result of clubs not being able to employ builders or developers to proceed with construction projects.</P>
      <P>As stated previously, money is not necessarily my problem. My problem lies in trying to obtain proposals which are at such an advanced stage that they are suitable for immediate commencement. We will continue to invest money in soccer and other clubs.</P>
      <P>This matter is totally separate from the Government's commitment to build a national stadium. I remind the Deputy that it is £231 million in the context of £40 billion spread across all other areas for which we are catering, including social welfare, health and education. It is a small amount in the entire sporting infrastructure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Sports Council, which is statutorily responsible for the implementation of actions to combat doping in sport, inaugurated the national sports anti-doping programme in November 1999. The programme has been designed with reference to the Council of Europe anti-doping convention, 1989, which seeks a three stranded approach to the reduction of doping in sport &ndash; testing, research and educational programmes and information campaigns.</P>
      <P>While my core objective has been to secure the establishment and implementation by the council of the programme which is predicated on the active participation of autonomous national governing bodies of sport, I also felt that the measures in the programme might be complemented by the application of certain legislative measures. A number of options have been identified, most specifically in the area of possession and supply of certain performance-enhancing drugs, with regard to incorporating certain substances that are used in sport under Ireland's general drugs legislation.</P>
      <P>Consultations between my Department and the Department of Health and Children are at an advanced stage regarding the types of drugs used for the enhancement of sporting performances which may be suitable for inclusion in the Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act. In addition, the Department of Health and Children is engaged in a wider consultative process with other relevant groups. Following completion of this process the Minister for Health and Children will bring into operation the declaration order and the corresponding regulations under that Act.</P>
      <P>Including certain performance-enhancing drugs used in sport under the Misuse of Drugs Act will send a very strong signal that those coaches, trainers, athletes and any other persons found in possession of such specified drugs will, in future, be committing an offence under Irish law and be subject to the full rigours of that law.</P>

He was also reported as making a statement concerning certain international sports mandarins who appeared to be colluding in the use of doping agents in return for money? Has the Minister changed his mind in the interim period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not changed my mind and the explanation is simple. There is white collar fraud and there is track suit fraud. People are using performance-enhancing substances, normally used to treat medical conditions, which, unfortunately, can assist sports people in enhancing their performances. In discussions with the <Col N="1304" /> Minister for Health and Children I nominated a number of these drugs, such as EPO and certain anabolic steroids. We are dealing with this issue with our UK counterparts and I have asked the Minister to include a number of these substances used to enhance sporting performances under the Misuse of Drugs Act. This would make it illegal to possess these drugs other than on prescription.</P>
      <P>There is no law against the possession of these drugs at present. However, if they were included under the Misuse of Drugs Act, it would be an offence to possess or deal in these drugs and those found doing so would be subject to penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a more fundamental issue which the Minister is failing to address. High performance athletes who appear regularly in the media are role models for young people. If they are found to be using performance-enhancing drugs it should be demonstrated that that is a crime and they should be dealt with by stringent laws. If that requires a custodial sentence, so be it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>One can penalise someone for the possession or distribution of drugs, but to date there has been no law against the ingestion of drugs for personal use. There is a constitutional legal problem in this area. I agree with the Deputy, an athlete found using such substances comes under the auspices of the national organisation and is dealt with accordingly within the organisation's rules. One cannot criminalise the athlete but one can criminalise someone for possession of and dealing in drugs.</P>

      <P>One of the commitments made in the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium of November 1999 is to &ldquo;maintain substantial investment in the development of environmentally sustainable tourism products which promote year round tourism.&rdquo;  Under the national development plan I have secured over £350 million for the development of tourism under three headings, marketing, training and product development. The thrust of tourism investment under the plan will be in line with the commitment given in the review of the action programme and will be influenced by environmental considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the marketing side, my focus will be to facilitate the creation of a marketing strategy which can spread visitor numbers over time and <Col N="1305" /> help generate better regional spread, thereby helping to reduce pressures resulting from unnecessary over-concentration in time and place of tourism in individual localities.</P>
    <P>Seasonality has long been a structural weakness of the tourism industry. A key objective of the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, was to target additional growth outside the peak July-August period. As a result, the percentage of annual overseas tourists to Ireland during the peak period has dropped from 30% in 1993 to under 28% in 1998, while the percentage who visited during the off-peak period increased from 40% to 42.6% in the same period.</P>
    <P>A total of £100 million has been provided over the seven year period of the national development plan for the development of tourism product in the two regions under these programmes. The regional assemblies are the managing authorities for the regional operational programmes. The Department of Finance, with the agreement of the regional assemblies, has commenced work on drafting the regional operational programmes on their behalf until the secretariats to the assemblies are fully in place. It is anticipated that the regional operational programmes will be finalised in the first quarter of 2000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>My Department is currently working on proposals in relation to tourism product measures for input into this process. The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that it is not possible at this stage to give details of these measures which will focus on three main areas: developing major tourist attractions and clusters of attractions and facilities in co-operation with local authorities, regional tourism authorities and other agencies; developing special interest products with the aim of increasing the region's share of expanding niche markets such as walking, cycling, riding trails, health, tourism etc; and providing support for tourism and the environment with a particular focus on tackling those problems which threaten the sustainability of tourism.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that investment in tourism marketing, training and product measures under the new national development plan will be focused on developing environmentally sustainable tourism products while also encouraging off-peak and niche tourism.</P>

      <P>The operational programmes are currently being discussed. Those programmes will perhaps be able to be finalised in the coming months. However, when one is planning for six or seven years, it takes a certain period for local authority officials and public representatives to join together with proper plans, particularly in the areas of tourism where there is such a wide variety of sectoral interests. There is an overlap with agri-tourism although, in the past they have mostly operated under individual programmes such as the Leader programme which dealt with agri-tourism. In the national plan there is a movement towards people in agricultural and farming areas beginning to use the potential of tourism. There is great potential for tourism in the future across all sectors. Litter is unquestionably one of our biggest problems and if we look at our major cities and towns, we have to tell ourselves that we have a great deal to learn.</P>

      <P>With regard to the marketing, I agree with the Deputy that we are entering a hugely competitive area not alone competing with our neighbours in Scotland but further afield, with, for instance, people in the Far East. One of our largest competitors will be China, when one considers the number of infrastructural products which some of the major hotels are putting into that part of the world. The sum of £350 million is broken up into three sections, one is for products, one for training and one for marketing. The marketing element, which we will also discuss when the new North-South company is formed, will be a matter for discussion between ourselves and the company. That £150 million is for marketing the country as a whole. I agree with the Deputy that we have to look after the regions. I put the regions at the top of my policies since I came to office. Certain sectors, particularly along the West of Ireland, are not doing well. Nonetheless, all regions have benefited substantially, even the worst region of the north-west which has an average growth of 5%, has even more than many countries in Europe. I agree there is a problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office has responsibility for the compilation of official tourism and travel statistics. Their latest release, published on 17 December 1999, relates to official visitor numbers for the first nine months of the year and revenue figures for the first six months. These figures show the number of overseas visitors grew by 6.5% on the same period in 1998, from more than 4.5 million to more than 4.8 million. Revenue earnings from tourism for the first six months of 1999 grew by more than 12% from £954 million to £1,072 million.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte now forecast that the final figures for 1999 will show that foreign exchange earnings increased by 8% to a record £2.5 billion while overseas visitor numbers increased by 7% to almost 6 million.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte forecast an increase of 6% in numbers and 7% in overseas tourism revenue for 2000. While Bord Fáilte publish annual estimates on the regional breakdown of visitor numbers and revenue, their 1999 estimates are currently pending the availability of the full year estimates from the Central Statistics Office for last year's tourism performance, due in the spring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that efficient access is essential for tourism success and if that is correct what is the Minister doing to correct the current imbalance in the distribution of the tourism growth? Further growth in tourism is underpinned by positive and effective marketing. On the OTMI , while the Minister has indicated clearly the cross-Border institutions, that was very much market-led. I attended a conference in Donegal some weeks ago and I asked the question directly and did not get a clear answer. We need ringfenced promotional funding in the areas most severely affected. We need ringfenced marketing funding, for example in the West of Ireland and in regions with serious problems. The Minister indicated clearly that 4.5 million tourists came here but would he agree that most of them visited the east coast, encouraged by the abolition of duty-free sales and the difficulty of access along the west coast? A further disincentive to visit the west is that the Shannon duty-free facility is to be transferred to Dublin. Also important are the figures for regional airports. Few people use regional airports. I appeal to the Minister to seriously address the promotion of regional airports to bring people into the regions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with the Deputy that regional airports are a vital part of our tourism infrastructure, they are not part of my remit. They are under the Department of Public Enterprise. Funding to regional areas, to try and achieve a regional spread of tourism has been my priority. I understand that the east coast has done exceptionally well, but when I came into office, I was the first Minister to give the regional tourism authorities a budget of their own, of almost £800,000. I was more than pleased with the way they used that because in the Milan, Berlin and London markets and further afield, the different regional authorities at different times, were out there marketing a specific region. It was a very worthwhile exercise and I hope to continue with it. They have done very well.</P>
      <P>On the question of access, there is a large number of people coming to the east coast. There is a trend in Europe now towards short city breaks and Dublin has recently been indicated as the fifth most popular capital in the EU to visit. From that point of view, the access area is important but the matter of pricing is even more important. The low cost of access into this country and the cost of what is available is of the utmost importance.</P>

      <P>Níl mórán Gaeilge agam agus mar sin freagróidh mé an cheist i mBearla. The problem about the whole area of housing schemes with which one is dealing, is probably the self-catering aspect and the small bed and breakfast accommodation areas. First of all, the Gaeltacht is unique in that it has its own grant aid packages. <Col N="1309" /> In the past, there has been an emphasis on marketing the upper end of the market. The small bed and breakfast, the farmhouses and so on, has not been properly assisted. On the question of sustainability, Deputy Perry and a number of other Members would agree there is plenty of room for many of our tours in different parts of the country but the problem is to try to attract them into those specific areas.</P>
      <P>For example, Belgium and Holland have half the land mass of Ireland, yet their population is approximately 12 million. The Deputy is not looking for disagreement. We can comfortably accommodate at least two or three million people more provided we fulfil our individual responsibilities.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation</askee>
      <Quest>the additional funding, if any, he intends to provide for CERT for a comprehensive programme to enhance human resource management skills in the tourism sector in view of the commitment given in the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2751/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Heightened expectations from a rapidly expanding customer base can only be satisfied by a tourism industry which is competitive, adaptable and responsive. Over the next seven years the effectiveness of human resource strategies within the industry will determine the degree to which tourism can sustain recent success and projected future growth.</P>
      <P>The need to enhance human resources in the tourism sector is fully recognised in the National Development Plan 2000-2006, which includes provision for a specific tourism training measure under the employability and adaptability sub-programmes. The aim of these measures will be to enable the tourism industry to continue to attract more new entrants, including from the ranks of the long-term unemployed and disadvantaged, and support human resource development within the sector to maintain quality customer service and competitiveness. These measures will facilitate CERT, the national training agency for the sector, in delivering a comprehensive programme of training and will also provide it with the opportunity to further develop its own role as leader and facilitator for tourism in attaining world class standards of human resource management and service delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CERT will provide programmes to facilitate the transition from second level education to job placement by way of full-time craft courses. This will deliver a stream of highly qualified personnel to the sector and the plan is to increase recruitment and training throughput under this measure in excess of 25% per annum by 2006 to over 2,000 trainees annually. Other CERT programmes will specifically target groups who are socially excluded such as the long-term unemployed, <Col N="1310" /> early school leavers, women wishing to return to paid employment, workers recently made redundant, non-nationals and older age groups.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>A comprehensive range of flexible and accessible initiatives will be provided at local level, leading to recognised qualifications and sustainable employment for these trainees.</P>
    <P>The industry also needs to adapt its approach to human resource management to take account of the potential now on offer to personnel, entering or already within the industry, for career progression and development as a result of a much expanded, competitively driven industry. Future CERT programmes under this measure will facilitate the raising and maintenance of the highest operational standards in tourism and as such will provide training or development intervention for persons already working in industry. The primary areas of focus will be human resource management and operational best practice.</P>
    <P>The overall objective of the tourism and training measure over the period 2000 to 2006 is to provide the industry with the necessary human resource management and operational skills to facilitate businesses becoming self-sustaining in terms of recruiting, retraining and developing staff and in improving competitiveness through continuous learning. Overall it is planned to double the existing pool in trained trainers within the industry from just over 2,000 at present to circa 5,000 by 2006. In addition, it is planned to double the population of human resource professionals employed within the industry over the early years of the plan and to encourage training and development through this network. It is also planned to increase the number of employees pursuing advanced training through colleges. Almost £110 million has been allocated for the purposes of implementing these tourism training measures over the period of the national development plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of last year's CERT study carried out by McIver Consultants and Tansey Webster Stewart which indicated that between 2000 and 2005, 105,000 extra staff will be required in the tourism industry. I compliment the Minister on the measures to employ the disadvantaged and unemployed in the tourism industry. The wage structure also needs to be looked at. What measures are in place to address the deficit which will emerge in the next five years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, the report indicated there would be a huge labour shortage in the next five years. However, it is difficult to attract young people to work in the industry, not necessarily because of the problem with wages. Many employers, particularly in Dublin, are offering exceptionally good wages because there is competition for well-trained staff. The intro<Col N="1311" /> duction of the minimum wage will impact on this sector probably more than any other. We are acutely aware of the problem.</P>
      <P>The industry has to change and focus on human resource management. The report stated that the industry needs to adapt its approach to human resource management to take account of the potential now on offer to personnel entering or already in the industry for career progression and development as a result of a much expanded competitive industry. It went on to state that the labour shortage in the tourism area will become more acute in the next four to five years. CERT is trying to attract more trained personnel to get rid of the image the industry has of being low paid with poor social hours. We are trying to change that image but the industry must come up with ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that labour costs account for 30% of expenditure in the hotel industry? This will have a major impact on the growth of the trade. Does the Minister agree that funding should be targeted at potential areas of growth? CERT does a fantastic job but immigrants will have to be trained to aid the development of the tourism industry. What plans are in place for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>CERT will receive more than £100 million in the national development plan to specifically provide for training. All the areas to which I referred in my reply, including the training of immigrants, will be included. There is a perception that some of us are racist. This could not be further from the truth. There are thousands of people from the EU and other countries working in restaurants and hotels in Dublin and the rest of the country. They are being allowed into the country and are being trained. Dublin will become more cosmopolitan in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, in line with the commitment given in the joint programme, An Action Plan for the Millennium, decided in November 1997 to initiate a tender procedure inviting proposals for the design, financing, construction and management of a national 50 metre swimming pool. This tender procedure, which was conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, culminated in July last year with the selection of a proposal submitted by the University of Limerick to develop a 50 metre swimming pool on their campus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> The university's proposal is based on receiving a capital grant of £5.95 million and an operational subsidy of £190,000 per annum for 20 years. The swimming pool will form part of the university's multi-purpose sports building project which is currently under construction and is located close to the National Coaching and Training Centre. My Department is currently finalising contractual details with the university who anticipate that the pool will be operational by October 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. At the weekend, I was amazed to hear that a 50 metre pool will be part of the national stadium complex. Is it proposed to have two 50 metre swimming pools? Was a 50 metre pool mentioned in the feasibility study for the national stadium? Why was this announcement made so suddenly? Was it an effort to sweeten the pill for the public, many of whom see the national stadium project as a white elephant? What is happening? Are we to have two 50 metre swimming pools? Why is the second one suddenly being located in Dublin?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a dearth of sporting infrastructure in the past because we were not in the same economic position as we are now. If I had my way, I would have four 50 metre pools, one in every province because swimming is a sport which can be enjoyed by many people. I accept that one does not need 50 metre pools. A feasibility study for another 50 metre pool in Dublin will be commissioned this week or next week. As the Deputy knows, our elite athletes need a 50 metre pool to train adequately.</P>
      <P>There has been a demand for such a pool for years. The Limerick pool is a training pool but there is no pool in the State in which international swimming competitions could take place. Ireland is to host the 2003 Special Olympics and provision for swimming was a problem. We had to make provision for the competition elsewhere in a pool capable of hosting the Special Olympics. I see no harm in having two 50 metre pools but one will be a training pool for elite athletes. That was why it was given the go ahead. The national stadium will cater for all national sporting organisations and swimming has a national organisation. Swimming is the second most popular sport in the State. A feasibility study will be carried out for a pool to prepare for the Special Olympics in 2003.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has clarified the position on to the second of the four 50 metre swimming pools he would build if he had the money. It is a disappointment that we could not provide a proper facility in Limerick which would be a competition pool as well as one for training elite athletes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elite athletes of the future will not have access to either of the 50 metre pools. Many of them do not have access to a proper swimming pool. What resources is the Minister making available to ensure we create the athletes of the <Col N="1313" /> future when swimming pools throughout the State are in a dilapidated state, particularly in the midland counties?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>During the last Government's term of office, £3 million per year was put into swimming pools. Our research showed that 450,000 people use swimming facilities and, consequently, I approached the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and received £45 million to put into local authority pools over the next three years. That amounts to £15 million per year. We are responding to the need.</P>
      <P>The Limerick pool would not have been capable of holding the Special Olympics swimming events. The Special Olympics must have venues approximate to each other because of the potential language problems arising from the 160 countries participating. All the individual competition venues had to be close to each other, particularly those for swimming. These athletes have certain medical problems which also must be catered for. From that point of view, the competition pool at Limerick, even if it was of competition size, would have been of no value to the special Olympians. We decided that Dublin would be the base for the Special Olympics in 2003 and would need a pool as well.</P>

The Irish soccer team was in danger of being expelled from Euro 2000 competition. The FAI did not feel that it should have to bear the brunt of the fine but it was happy that only a fine was imposed. We are open to discussions with the FAI on all aspects related to the organisation, the stadium and other matters. No doors have been closed.</P>

      <P>What plans does the Minister have to allocate funding to a national coaching plan in disadvantaged areas? We are only talking about £12 million when the national stadium will cost hundreds of millions of pounds. We must not lose sight of where sport begins. Disadvantaged areas are crying out for sporting and coaching facilities. What plans has the Minister to provide funding for disadvantaged areas for people who will never see the National Stadium and will never come to Dublin?</P>

      <P>I hope everyone in that age group will be able to come to Dublin and not just see the National Stadium but be able to participate in it. That is the intention. I wish I was 16 again because I believe there is a great future for sport in this country.</P>
      <P>On the question of the FAI's submission, I did not receive a submission or request from the FAI until 8 and 11 November, two or three weeks prior to the budget. I did not meet the FAI until one week before the budget. The submission sought 40 development coaches in that specific area and requested £1.94 million per year. This is a very good proposal which the Minister for Finance and I support. There was also the report of the Sports Council which had to be submitted in January. They have a proposal for development officers on a county basis also and this overlap could be considered during discussions with the FAI. The Sports Council and soccer personnel indicate we need development officers so let us set out proposals in relation to this issue which will alleviate overlapping.</P>

        <b>: </b>On the question of funding for areas of disadvantage, which means largely working class communities or their equivalent in rural areas, will the Minister agree that apart from specific projects which need a high level of organisation, there is a need for funding to back up and support the tremendously dedicated people who work with thousands of children in these areas, often without the most basic facilities? Will he also agree there is need for a specific programme to support the efforts of these people? The £280 million allocation is fine but it is not trickling down to people who are hard pressed in poorer areas. These children are often left without the resources they need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Three areas of major disadvantage in Dublin have been identified. The young people's youth and facilities fund was set and last year £25 million was allocated to target these specific areas. It will take a number of years before this comes to fruition but some projects in these disadvantaged areas have been catered for.</P>
      <P>On the £230 million, I regard this as a small drop in the ocean in relation to our sporting infrastructure. I would argue that this is one of the best means of helping socially disadvantaged people. It also plays a major part in people's health and so on. Some £40,000 million is being allocated to other areas of social inclusion such as health, education and the environment. On the question of a specific category for small clubs and volunteers, this was tried in the past and, unfortunately, they do not seem to be able to get the projects up and running. As a result of the policies pursued in the past, £36 million worth of commitments are outstanding. It is very easy for me to make commitments, the problem is to get groups and organisations to begin to build the bricks and mortar. I handed back £8 million last year. This has to be done through the local authorities but, unfortunately, organisations do not involve local authorities enough.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that soccer in particular has a very strong foothold in disadvantaged communities compared to many other sporting organisations &ndash; I am speaking as someone who comes from a Gaelic background &ndash; and that priority should be given to funding for development officers for soccer rather than other sporting bodies in these areas? Does he agree that there is more red tape involved in allocating the sports capital grant, the closing date for which is two weeks' time, this year than in the past and that this discriminates against the more disadvantaged communities which may not have the resources to provide consultants to develop projects?</P>

      <P>Yes, because builders are not appearing on the sites. Such commitments have been made in the past. I did not want to introduce a sunset clause. However, I had to do something where if one club failed to develop a project, a neighbouring club in the Deputy's county might be able to avail of the opportunity. In other words, I wanted to spend the money rather than having to hand it back. There is no easy solution to this. A great deal more care must be taken with applications than was the case in the past if these facilities are to be built. We have been accused of not providing sporting facilities but there is £36 million now waiting to be spent.</P>

      <P>Yes, it is a budget submission, which I supported. I did not have a chance to discuss it until one week prior to the budget. It is a very good proposal. The Sports Council furnished its report which had to be published after six months. The report indicated that they wanted to appoint a development officer in each county. I am not sure whether a specific soccer development officer would be needed or whether one development officer could train more sportsmen. With hindsight, there was an overlap but the proposal was very good. There are 4,400 soccer clubs in the country which must be supported. Last year they submitted 12% of the total applications for national lottery funding and received 17%.</P>

    <Title>Rural Development White Paper: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the Government's main concerns when drafting the White Paper was to diversify economically and to provide additional income and job creation opportunities in rural areas while cherishing the distinct features and culture of the countryside. We must exploit our natural advantages and potential to the full in the creation of more opportunities for enterprise both on and off farm while maintaining viable rural communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rural development policy agenda is defined in the White Paper as all Government policies and interventions which are directed towards improving the physical, economic and social conditions of people living in the open countryside, coastal areas, towns and villages and in smaller urban centres outside the five major urban areas. The agenda will, at the same time, <Col N="1319" /> facilitate balanced and sustainable regional development while tackling issues of poverty and social inclusion.</P>
    <P>The overall strategy decided by Government provides for balanced regional development to ensure that the benefits of economic and social progress are distributed throughout rural areas; investment in services and infrastructure; sustainable economic development; human resources development; and a determined focus on poverty and social exclusion. There are also commitments to the preservation of the culture and heritage of rural areas, including Gaeltacht areas, and to protecting the environment.</P>
    <P>The Government decided that the White Paper would be published in August 1999 so that the general commitments in it could be reflected in the preparation of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. The national development plan is the vehicle for delivering the commitments in the White Paper. There is a specific chapter in it on agriculture and rural development with a commitment to public investment of £6.7 billion over the next seven years in actions which directly impact on rural areas.</P>
    <P>This package involves £3.4 billion on the REP, early retirement, headage and forestry schemes; £2.1 billion on rural infrastructure; £390 million on rural enterprises, including western development; £377 million on capital investment for food and fisheries and for marketing, research and development for agriculture, food and fisheries; £322 million on agriculture and fisheries development; and £120 million on training in agriculture, food, forestry and fisheries. In addition, rural communities will benefit from the investments proposed in other areas of the plan, such as the £11 billion for employment and human resource development, £4.7 billion for national roads, £6 billion for housing; £2 billion for health and £0.6 billion for regional public transport. Some £1.1 billion is provided in the plan to support indigenous industry and small, medium and micro-sized enterprises. While all areas of the country will benefit from this provision, it will be of considerable assistance to rural areas.</P>
    <P>The success of the Government's strategy for rural development significantly depends on the extent to which the institutional arrangements support the process. Rather than creating further structures which might lead to overlap or duplication of effort, the intention is to integrate and better co-ordinate the activities of existing structures and so improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public service to rural communities. A number of the promised institutional arrangements have been put in place.</P>
    <P>The name of the Department has been changed to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to reflect its lead role in rural development. A Cabinet sub-committee, chaired by the Taoiseach, has been established, as well as an interdepartmental policy committee. Procedures for rural proofing of all national policies <Col N="1320" /> have been introduced. In bringing forward proposals for Government approval, Ministers are now obliged to indicate the extent to which those proposals are likely to impact on the physical, economic and social conditions of rural communities. This will ensure that policy implementation responds appropriately to the needs of rural communities. The effect should be that strategy for economic and social development of rural areas works in conjunction with other policy initiatives, such as the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
    <P>The national development plan was prepared on the basis of the requirement for rural proofing. The chapters dealing with the various operational programmes include sections on the rural impact of the proposals they contain. An essential element of our strategy is the commitment to establish a national rural development forum. The forum will debate current issues, review existing programmes to determine their impact and identify suitable policy responses to rural problems. It will have a wide-ranging membership, including Government Departments, State agencies, the regional assemblies and authorities, local authorities, the social partners, local development bodies and the wider voluntary and community sector. Arrangements are in train for the establishment of the forum at an early date. Invitations have been issued to all relevant groups to nominate their representatives to the forum. I expect that the inaugural meeting of the forum will take place in March.</P>
    <P>The rural development fund, also promised in the White Paper, has been provided for in the national development plan with an allocation of £6 million. The fund will finance research, evaluations and pilot actions, where appropriate, to provide information and advice to policy makers. The research should provide critical feedback in relation to such issues as assessing the impact and effectiveness of sectoral policies and institutional arrangements; quantifying and gathering data on trends and issues impacting on the rural community; identifying income and employment opportunities and examining gender and other issues relating to rural inclusion. A provision of £750,000 has been made in this year's Estimates to support projects from the fund.</P>
    <P>The county development boards, now being established following the Government's decision to implement the recommendations of the Task Force on the Integration of Local Government and Local Development Systems, will make a key contribution to the integration of policies at county level. This will be achieved through the preparation of county strategies in consultation with, and the participation of, local authorities, State agencies, Government Departments, local development bodies and the social partners, including the voluntary and community sector.</P>
    <P>The county development boards will be an essential element in articulating and implementing the proposals in the White Paper. These new arrangements will provide the opportunity to identify and prioritise local needs in a partnership <Col N="1321" /> approach between service providers and the local community. The outcome should be that quality, comprehensive State services will be available in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Leader programme has been successful in Ireland. Evaluations of the programme have found that it has attained a considerable degree of success in the achievement of its objectives. Its impact far outweighs the financial outlay. The current Leader programme ends in June 2000. The European Commission guidelines on the new Leader initiative, Leader+, which will operate in the period 2000-6, have been agreed. In the Commission's proposals for Leader+, the underlying principles will remain, that is, a bottom-up process with area-based, local action groups implementing local development programmes. The new programme will contain a major emphasis on innovative or pilot type measures rather than a continuation of current activities. In recognition of the importance of this type of local development, the Government has made a provision of £55 million in the national development plan for funding a mainstream rural development programme.</P>
    <P>The strategy set out in the White Paper endorses and supports the objectives contained in the national anti-poverty strategy &ndash; NAPS &ndash; and will ensure that the overall strategy for rural development is underpinned by a socially inclusive dimension. It acknowledges that Government intervention is required to ensure balanced regional development and to provide a particular focus in addressing social inclusion needs.</P>
    <P>The rural context of social inclusion manifests itself in ways that reflect the distinct features of rural life, particularly in more remote areas. It frequently is the result of multiple disadvantage. Economic factors such as unemployment and inadequate incomes, together with the wider social issues of isolation, unequal opportunity and participation, are often compounded by further problems of distance from services and amenities. In addressing rural poverty the target of the NAPS is to ensure that strategies are developed with regard to the provision of services in rural areas, especially those concerned with educational disadvantage, unemployment and income adequacy.</P>
    <P>The overall target was to reduce the numbers of those who are &ldquo;consistently poor&rdquo; from 9%-15% in the population to less than 5%-10% as measured by the ESRI. The most recent data available in the ESRI's living in Ireland survey show that the numbers experiencing consistent poverty had fallen to 7%-10% of the population by 1997. In the light of this progress, the Government has set a target of reducing consistent poverty to below 5% by 2004.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the White Paper on Rural Development has been so well received. In the recent NESC report, &ldquo;Opportunities, Challenges and Capacities for Choice&rdquo;, the council welcomes the broad approach to rural development adopted in the White Paper. The White Paper <Col N="1322" /> represents a new vision for rural Ireland. The structures for co-ordinating that vision are in place. The funding to implement the vision has been provided. I am confident the next few years will see a regeneration of rural Ireland, thanks to the Government strategy outlined in the White Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the White Paper on Rural Development, A Strategy for Rural Development in Ireland, published by the Department. When taken in the context of the National Development Plan 200-2006 it outlines what is available for investment in rural areas. The White Paper &ndash; I have seen many &ndash; is like most documents on the future of rural Ireland published down through the years in that it is detailed but it contains many woolly conclusions.</P>
      <P>It does not bell the cat. By that I mean it has no spatial policy which identifies areas for actual industrial or service growth outside the existing main centres of population. In broad terms what is involved is simple to explain but difficult to implement. What is needed are rural communities that are vibrant, forward looking and have a community input that will stimulate the inhabitants to progress their own town or village and surrounding areas to a level not seen heretofore. Major changes have taken place in the pattern of population in rural Ireland, some of which are so well documented that people take them for granted. There will be fewer people in rural areas and more in the major centres of population, Dublin, Galway and Cork. It is difficult to know what has to be done to change that pattern. The question has to be asked whether in six years' time Dublin and Galway will be bigger and Mountbellow smaller. That is the bottom line and unless we can change the way people think through the various incentives included in the White Paper it will have been a failure. An all-out effort should be made to change it.</P>
      <P>I had occasion to be in rural America, mid-America, and in Argentina with Deputy Penrose recently and I never want to see European or Irish rural development go down the road they went. Suffice to say, if we have any hope under the European model of rural development that is the way to go. The policies pursued by those other countries were fundamentally flawed. Once people leave an area, for whatever reason, it is difficult to get them back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairly large size rural towns down to the smallest hamlets, there is a huge voluntary capacity which is untapped. These are the thousands of people who, every night of the week, attend development associations, tidy towns meetings etc. because they want to make their area a better place in which to live, but they are beginning to get frustrated. One could win the tidy towns competition, year in year out, but unless something more substantial arises from their efforts people will lose faith. While it is important to have a tidy town there has to be a <Col N="1323" /> next step and unless we get over the first step there will be many problems.</P>
    <P>Despite what many commentators say, Ireland is predominantly a rural country with 42% of the population living in villages of fewer than 1,500 people or in the countryside. Population density in Ireland is among the lowest in Europe, with only 52 persons per square kilometre compared to the EU average of 115. We still have a great rural society.</P>
    <P>I accept the lead Department should be the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. No matter how we look at this issue for many years farmers will be the anchor tenants so far as rural Ireland is concerned. Given the rate at which farmers are leaving the land, if an area is denuded of population the landscape will be so poorly managed that it will revert to a wilderness. Irrespective of what is done in that area from the point of view of tourism or the environment, unless farmers are there full-time or part-time that aspect will be lost. It is only right and proper that farmers would be at the centre but not exclusively involved. In a short time the number of people from outside who will come to live in rural areas will far exceed the locals. There is nothing wrong with that provided it is planned. The greater the number of people in a parish the greater chance there is of creating vitality.</P>
    <P>The number of reports, the national development plan, Enterprise 2010 and all the documentation produced in the past couple of years, amounts to an industry. When a scheme is introduced we spend much time evaluating it afterwards. I do not know if that is necessary.</P>
    <P>The spatial policy should identify certain areas, away from Dublin, and build them up in such a way that people will want to live there and also develop the surrounding areas. We have a long way to go and much further than is suggested in the White Paper. Most villages have a group water scheme but 50% of those who live in the border, midland and western regions are not connected to a local authority sewerage scheme. That is far short of modern infrastructural development and a great deal more funding will be required. We had better not get the idea that this White Paper will solve all problems but I hope it will achieve more than the previous one.</P>
    <P>There is something coming down the tracks I do not like and the Minister mentioned it in his speech. He said the Leader programme was successful. I believe it was very successful. However, it is difficult to understand that funding to the new Leader initiative, Leader+, has been cut in half.</P>
    <P>After all the evaluation I find it difficult to understand. If the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, says it was a great scheme and I say it was a good one, I cannot understand how there is £30 million made available for it from the EU and the <Col N="1324" /> Minister of State is providing an additional £20 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind the Minister of State interrupting. I do not mind if I am wrong, but I am not wrong in this instance. Compared to the last Leader programme, the funding has been halved. However, the Minister has come along with another animal, the national development fund. That £55 million fund is generated by the Exchequer. In my innocence, I thought that those two would be organised under the umbrella of Leader+, but I was wrong. The Department has not yet written the operational programmes for it.</P>
      <P>It will transpire that the existing Leader programmes will tender successfully for Leader+. For the first time there will be open competition for Leader funding and we do not know who will succeed but assuming that the existing Leader programmes get Leader+, I guarantee the schemes will not be up and running until the middle of next year no matter how it is done. To take what happened in the case of the Western Development Commission as an example, the Minister of State told me almost a year and a half ago that it would be up and running and it still has not received approval. There was £25 million available and 200 projects but we could not give a penny to anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under what is being proposed, the partnership which ran in tandem in many rural areas under Leader has gone back to the ADM, to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. I am told that it has nothing to do with the Minister of State's Department now and it will be funded from now on so they will have continuity. However, the multiplicity of current Leader programmes will run out of money over the next couple of months. How will they pay their staff and what will they do with their committees right up to the end of the year and into next year? I acknowledge any money the Government spends on rural development, but why does the Minister not make some of that £55 million of the national development fund available to those programmes? Have we reached the situation, as is often the case, where we set up a new system, it begins to work and before we know where we <Col N="1325" /> are, we cut the legs out from under it? That is what will happen to the Leader programme. This is not an attempt to score a political point. I do not know what would happen if I was sitting on the Government benches, but that is what is happening.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the relationship between Leader+ when it starts and the new national development fund, the £55 million about which we are talking. Surely they will be doing more or less the same thing. Has a new quango been set up? Is it a new partnership business?</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister of State is able to connect the end of Leader as we know it with the beginning of Leader+, there are about 300 professionals who will lose their jobs and countless hundreds of board members around the country will be twiddling their thumbs because they will have nothing to do. It is nothing short of unreasonable. I do not know if it was ever intended to be so, but that is the way it will turn out. When I hear of this sort of integrated approach, what I see happening is no different to what happened over the years; they will overlap. In fact, they will be like a fiddler's elbow.</P>
    <P>I do not see the integration and the so-called inclusiveness to which the Government refers. If one looks down the line they way I see it, there will be an interim period with almost nothing and then there will be two bodies more or less doing the same thing all over again. In addition, there will be the county development teams and that is nothing compared to what is being done by Enterprise Ireland. I do not have time to develop the point but given the amount of money available, why does the Minister of State need to create a new structure all over again? It is bad for continuity. There is a terrible mistake being made if the Leader programmes cannot do what the Minister of State and I said they did in the past, that is, provide continuity. I ask the Minister of State to have a look at it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have the opportunity on behalf of the Labour Party to contribute to the White Paper on rural development. The Minister will be aware that anything which will help to rejuvenate and reinvigorate those areas must be welcomed and the Labour Party welcomes it.</P>
      <P>I will not go into the figures which were given by the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, but I will put a couple of critical questions. Will the White Paper ensure a viable future for those people about whom every party often speaks in this Chamber. Will it guarantee equity in terms of opportunity, as the Minister of State said, both between rural and urban communities and will it deliver the real choice as to whether individuals and farmers can stay in, leave or move to rural Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister would probably accept that the publication of a White Paper does not guarantee anything in its own right; it is simply a strategy document and it must be underpinned by specific, <Col N="1326" /> focused and costed policies. The Minister of State has laid out the framework and he hopes to fill in all the spaces in between.</P>
    <P>We are debating the White Paper on rural development at an opportune time because the recent protests by cattle farmers were about more than the prices paid to them for their cattle. As our most distinguished novelist, John McGahern, who is also a farmer, has written, it is all about the survival of farming as a way of life and about the survival of viable communities in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Constitution as far as I am aware, is the only such document which states that it will be the objective of government policy to settle as many people as possible on the land, and I subscribe to that. That provision can, with the wisdom of hindsight, be seen as misguided because even when it was written in 1937, agriculture was beginning to decline as the major source of employment and output in the developed countries. It was a tough task. It can only be understood in the context of the bitter struggle by farmers to gain possession of the land they farmed and of de Valera's rather idealised view of the moral wholesomeness of rural life. Despite the constitutional commitment, the flight from the land continued and it has now reached crisis proportions with some experts predicting that the number of farmers could decline to one fifth of their present number over the next 20 years. It is encouraging to note that in the White Paper the Government has committed itself to trying to ensure that the maximum number of rural households and especially family farms will be retained and supported.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's recognition of the problems facing rural Ireland which are comprehensively analysed in the White Paper. To start with the positive, it is encouraging to note that the population of rural areas has stabilised. While the population of remote rural areas continues to decline, the population of small urban areas is increasing. These remote areas are characterised by an ageing population living often on marginal land and largely dependent on income support. The isolation of these people is increased due to a lack of transport, and their isolation often results in their suffering loneliness and depression.</P>
    <P>In Cavan-Monaghan, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and his colleagues were involved, through Leader and partnerships, in the creation of Link, a pilot transport system between Cavan-Monaghan and Fermanagh. I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, to look at that pilot scheme. It works extremely well. It is important to have integration at Government level. I know the transport licence was got through the Department of Public Enterprise, but the Government should make sure the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, of which the Minister of State was a former Minister, allows them to use the free passes on this combination of private and public sector transport. I am sure <Col N="1327" /> he is aware of that already. I see this as a prototype which can be adopted in Westmeath and Longford. It is an important scheme which will immediately eliminate one of the problems identified in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>I know the way Departments work, although I was not ever inside them. When one is outside it is hard to understand how they come up with the barriers to prevent sensible solutions from reaching fruition. They must have Ph.D.s in blocking. The role of Government is to minimise bureaucracy and the first thought of civil servants and officials should be how to get the job done as per the proposal as opposed to how to say that it cannot be done. The Minister should think about that.</P>
    <P>There are many voluntary initiatives to improve the lives of people, particularly the elderly, in remote rural areas. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is familiar with one such incidence. They are inadequately funded, however, and should receive greater Government support. In particular, the home help service provided by health boards is inadequately funded and could be greatly expanded so that more elderly people could live in their own homes with a better quality of life.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has already mentioned rural isolation, particularly in farming communities. Sometimes, the planning proposals adopted by various counties inhibit the growth of population in rural areas. The policies of planning officers can often stop farmers selling sites because they want to sterilise the rest of the holding, claiming it is ribbon development and will create an access onto a road. That is nonsense and I support the Minister of State in opposing it. One of the main contributions I have made in public life is to stop planners introducing these sorts of proposals into County Westmeath. A twin-track approach is often adopted by farmers who may have to reluctantly sell a site to remain economically viable but at the same time they may sell a site at a discount to a neighbour's child. There is the huge threat of sterilisation to make sure they will reluctantly have to resile from the commitment they gave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>We hammer that point home in Westmeath and I can tell the Minister of State that it does not get off the ground. I am glad the White Paper commits the Government to providing rural communities with access to education, training and lifelong learning and adequate social and other services and infrastructure. There is a great need to provide opportunities for personal development and training for the significant numbers of middle-aged people, many of them single, who have left school early and who may have few opportunities to enter the labour market. I am aware that the Government intends to publish plans for increasing the availability of adult and <Col N="1328" /> second chance education. It will be difficult to provide such education in rural areas because of the lack of educational infrastructure. Advances in computer technology have, however, reduced the need for face to face contact between teacher and student. A great many worthwhile courses can now be provided through the lnternet which is radically changing conventional third level education.</P>
      <P>There is also the long-established open university, but unfortunately good reception of open university programmes is not always available in remote rural areas. The Government should consider rebroadcasting open university programmes through TG4, as was envisaged when that station was established. The educational possibilities offered by digital television, which will soon be available nationwide, should also be explored.</P>
      <P>Due to increasing prosperity, the gross material poverty of the past has been significantly reduced in rural Ireland, though it must be emphasised that it has not been eliminated. A new poverty is now being recognised, however, by social scientists, information poverty. With more and more areas of economic activity requiring information technology skills and access to the Internet in order to achieve job creation in rural areas, particularly jobs in services, it is essential to equip people, particularly the unemployed, with basic skills in information technology.</P>
      <P>It is sometimes assumed that older unemployed people may find it difficult to train in information technology but it is important to bear in mind that the fastest growing group of lnternet users in the USA is the over 65 age group. I cannot do it myself, but I might get the chance if I become unemployed.</P>
      <P>A programme that has provided advanced technology skills in areas of high unemployment in Dublin has achieved impressive results and similar programmes could be provided in rural areas using the resources of institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>The White Paper asserts that it is the aim of the Government to enable rural communities to participate effectively in the structures and decision-making processes that affect their lives. A great deal has been learned and achieved by EU-funded schemes such as the Leader programme in the area of local economic development, and the experience gained from these programmes must be built on. The new regional assemblies are to be assigned the functions of promoting co-ordination of services in their region and to manage operational programmes under the national development plan. I hope this reaches down to all levels because one of the problems we have is an over-centralised system of Government. The tenacity and assertiveness of local groups over the years has achieved this regional input.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only effective regional assemblies will ensure that the concerns of rural citizens can be effectively articulated and responded to. Over the past 20 years there have been many factors operating <Col N="1329" /> at both national and international level, which have contributed to the problems currently being experienced in rural Ireland. Agriculture is no longer the main activity in many rural areas and many farmers have part time jobs. I am glad the White Paper accepts that rural development involves a great deal more than agricultural development. The development of sustainable off-farm employment is vital for the survival of rural communities. The area partnerships and county development teams have built up valuable expertise in the area of rural job creation and their expertise should be availed of in developing job-creation programmes in rural areas. In order to achieve greater rural job creation, a more focused approach is needed to encourage investors to locate in rural villages. This will require significant investment in rural roads and telecommunications. Most of the EU Structural Fund spending on roads has gone to improving the national primary routes, but many rural roads have been neglected and until recently local authorities have not been given adequate funds for maintenance, much less improvement. Many rural roads are subject to greater wear and tear because of increasing traffic volumes resulting from the increasing numbers of people living in rural areas who commute to towns.</P>
    <P>One of the problems relates to housing, of which we are all aware. People from urban areas often buy up small derelict cottages and houses in rural areas, but the local people cannot afford to compete with outside buyers. This problem has now reached County Westmeath where derelict cottages are being sold for prices which five years ago would have bought a comfortable modern home in a provincial town.</P>
    <P>Greater incentives must be made available to local people to buy and restore derelict houses in rural areas. The scope of the rural renewal scheme must be extended. Indeed, if I might be somewhat parochial, it is inexplicable that the Government could make a decision to exclude Westmeath from the rural renewal scheme, given that it is right in the Shannon catchment area.</P>
    <P>Two other environmental issues in rural Ireland that must be resolved urgently are water quality and waste disposal. While there is vehement opposition to the location of refuse dumps, these issues will have to be faced up to as we are rapidly running out of landfill sites. We dispose of 90% of our refuse in landfill, the highest rate in the EU, and this situation is clearly unsustainable. While the proposed alternatives may provide a partial solution, it is clear that the only long-term solution is the slogan of the environmental movement: &ldquo;Reduce, reuse and recycle&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Income support to farmers should be based on their actual needs rather than on price supports which, as I have always said, inevitably benefit larger producers most. Direct income support can actually be less costly than price supports because it does not lead to the accumulation of surpluses. Smaller farmers must be given strong incentives <Col N="1330" /> to revert to sustainable agriculture in order to protect the rural environment that has suffered some degradation from the intensive production stimulated by CAP price supports.</P>
    <P>The success of the rural environment protection scheme shows that farmers are willing to protect the rural environment when they can afford to do so. The White Paper promises a strategy for the development of tourism in rural areas in the context of the national development plan. There is an urgent need for such a plan because there is evidence that despite record numbers of tourists in recent years, the numbers visiting rural Ireland may be declining. The main areas of attraction in Ireland are frequently overcrowded at peak times and there is a need to promote areas such as the midlands, the home of the lake district, more vigorously. For many years, I have been involved in the restoration of the Royal Canal in order to make it navigable along all its length. The canal will become a tremendous tourist attraction if adequately promoted.</P>
    <P>I am happy to note that there is an explicit commitment in the White Paper to tackle poverty and social exclusion in rural areas in a comprehensive and sustained manner. Research by the Combat Poverty Agency has shown that people living in the open countryside or in villages and towns of less than 3,000 inhabitants are more at risk of living in poverty than those who live in larger urban areas.</P>
    <P>Map No. 8 in the White Paper depicts the distribution of poverty and affluence by district electoral division using a composite deprivation index. This map shows that the greatest deprivation is in the most remote rural areas. It also shows that areas of deprivation are found side by side with areas of relative affluence, as occurs in my constituency. It is essential that rural development policies are clearly focused on reducing social exclusion and preventing the creation of new types of social exclusion.</P>
    <P>There are many young unemployed people in rural areas who have left school without qualifications and their training and education needs must be addressed if we are not to create a new group of marginalised people permanently dependent on social welfare payments. There is a widespread misconception that with rapid growth in employment opportunities the need for social employment schemes has diminished. In many rural areas these schemes are an invaluable means for keeping people with few skills connected to the labour market and for enhancing those skills.</P>
    <P>In considering the future of rural Ireland it is important to bear in mind that the development of rural Ireland cannot be divorced from overall spatial planning and the question of the dominance of our large cities. The White Paper accepts that market forces will favour urban at the expense of rural development, as is clear from recent experience. Difficult decisions must be taken about which urban centres are to be <Col N="1331" /> developed and where economic activity is to be located.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Government's policy on decentralisation, which I support fully. County Westmeath is in the centre of the country. I ask the Minister to emphasise to his Government colleagues the need to decentralise a Department to Mullingar because many people would love to move to that picturesque area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that we have a Minister of State with responsibility for rural development shows a commitment to rural development which has not existed for some time. Members who have spoken in this debate have all come from the same viewpoint and background. I hope many Members will contribute to this debate because we do ourselves a disservice if we do not contribute to debates on our areas. We often complain that we do not get a chance to speak on issues pertaining to us and our constituents think everything starts and ends in Dublin. This debate is a great opportunity to speak about rural development.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said that the Government's main concern in drafting the White Paper was to diversify economically and to provide additional income and job creation opportunities in rural areas, while cherishing the distinct features and culture of the countryside. That is easy to say but the Minister of State has probably one of the most difficult briefs in this regard because it crosses every divide. It can be easy to solve a particular problem if one has the money to do so. However, he is in the difficult situation of having to co-ordinate many Departments, which is not easy.</P>
      <P>In my area we have the three Fs, fishing, farming and Fruit of the Loom &ndash; Fruit of the Gloom as it is known at the moment &ndash; and we must exploit our natural advantages and potential to the full. The Minister of State has indicated his intention to create more opportunities for on-farm and off-farm enterprises while also maintaining viable rural communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fishing has been a very important resource in my locality. The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources was ignored for years until the most recent Minister, Deputy Woods, was appointed. I congratulate him on his tremendous work in that Department. His work on matters which had been left to fester for 20 or 30 years can be seen all over County Donegal. Infrastructure was put in place and the fishery schools were developed. That has been very important to small communities which rely on this resource. Fishing is a very insecure industry and is often as vulnerable to supply and demand factors as agriculture. We must build sustainable development in the fishing industry. I hope the Minister of State will co-operate with the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, on everything pertaining to the marine, including sea fishing and <Col N="1332" /> aquaculture development. Fishing is the lifeblood of most coastal rural communities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the substantial movement on the farming issue. There have been difficulties in sheep, pig and beef farming, particularly the picketing in the beef industry last week. I am glad that matter has been resolved but many long-term issues still need to be addressed. I welcome the examination by the working group of the allegations of price fixing. I am glad it must report within a three month period.</P>
    <P>Farming has been the lifeblood of many communities but the farmers have had a tough time. The pig industry is a good example of what we in the extreme parts of the country are facing. When the Lovell and Christmas plant burned down the farmers had to travel great distances to take their pigs to alternative meat plants because there was no plant in the Border area. They were at the mercy of the producers and processors and had to take whatever money they were given. We should not have to move from the extremities of Donegal. We should not be penalised for living in north Donegal. People on Malin Head and Mizen Head are entitled to have pig farms, access to producers and processors and a decent price.</P>
    <P>We must keep a careful eye on the beef industry. We must decide whether we are going to regard farmers as a social necessity in our communities &ndash; which I think we do &ndash; or as an economic liability, which is what I am sure many people in the city believe. We must ensure that we keep our farmers. Difficult decisions must be taken at times to ensure they are looked after.</P>
    <P>Diversification will be a big issue. Perhaps the Minister of State will work with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation in relation to incentives. Some areas already have incentives, for example farm holidays, but that does not seem to have infiltrated everywhere. In certain areas, such as mine, it is becoming very difficult to get support for bed and breakfast accommodation, guesthouses, hostels and so on. Many people need a little support to get started in that sector. My area is one of the few places that does not already have those facilities. It would be a means for people to earn extra income.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest issues facing rural communities is planning. I am glad the Minister of State has put on record a number of times his support for family members getting planning permission for their farms. County Donegal is working on its county development plan at the moment. We are getting thousands of planning applications in Donegal at present because people want to get their applications in before the change. Many of these applicants are not from the county. I agree with Deputy Connaughton in that we are not against people coming into the county. However, it must be done in a way in which the indigenous rural people are not penalised. They should have access to a reasonably priced site. Some farmers want to make money from selling their land because they are not making money from their ventures. However, we must be very careful in <Col N="1333" /> how we plan our development. Many parts of Donegal have not been spoiled because people have not got that far yet.</P>
    <P>The Leader and partnership boards have been extremely good. It is very hard to put a financial value on their work. They have enhanced communities with the town and village renewal schemes and have brought the voluntary groups together. Suddenly, things have started happening for the first time in years.</P>
    <P>We, in Donegal, have a right to employment. We are one of the only counties facing an emigration problem because people are availing of the Walsh visas and going to America, despite our Objective One status and the national development plan. I ask the Minister of State to do all he can to ensure we continue to develop on a regional basis in the north-west.</P>
    <P>The north-west cross-Border group and ICBAN have worked together, assembled priorities and talked to various Ministers on both sides of the Border. Days like today are extremely important for the peace process because if it falls apart now and we lose the peace and stability we have built over the past 18 months, the situation will be even more difficult. In the recent period we have worked with the Minister, Peter Robinson, and other Ministers with responsibility for regional development, and we have been able to move matters forward.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State well in his work. I hope he can do all the &ldquo;rural proofing&rdquo; and interdepartmental consultation and that it leads to a better lot for rural Ireland.</P>

This has made a great contribution to rural development behind the scenes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember my first job when I went into that office was to go to Europe to convince Commissioner Fischler and his officials that Leader II should be a programme for all the country. The impression created before that was that it would be. Various groups around the country became very animated and they organised themselves. I remember sitting in front of the Commissioner and one of his leading officials. He wanted to target Leader II at the existing pilot areas. That would have been a disaster because Leader II has been a tremendous success. The Comptroller and Auditor General's report was published today and we can see that the reaction to Leader II has been more positive than to Leader I in that we <Col N="1334" /> did not have the same scandals and collapses, such as Tipperary Enterprises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a well structured and well run programme. I would like to take some responsibility for taking a lot of stands, together with the officials, to ensure it be. When the officials were getting a lot of flak around the country, I stood behind them, and rightly so. I think I have been proved right.</P>
      <P>I set up the rural development policy task force after about a year in the Department because I saw the need for a White Paper. If one looks through the records in the Department, one will see that I wrote to Government stating the need for it. I set up the task force in order to produce a vision for the future of rural Ireland. I am delighted that much of what was included in the task force report is contained in the White Paper. The only thing about which I am disappointed is that it was not acknowledged in the acknowledgements and references at the back. There are sections which have been taken from it almost verbatim. I do not mind that but those who sat on the task force, who were representative of a wide spectrum, including education and various groups, would be somewhat disappointed that they did not get recognition for their work.</P>
      <P>A number of proposals which came from that task force or policy report have now been implemented, one of which was the tax designated rural areas. That has now been put in place by the Minister for Finance and I complimented him on doing that. Much of the thinking in this White Paper is almost identical to that in the report. The proposal as regards the institutional arrangements is nearly identical and I would like if it had been recognised. I am disappointed for those people that it was not recognised in the references at the back of the White Paper.</P>
      <P>Looking at the overall philosophy and policy on rural development, as we know, it is very difficult to define what rural development is about. It is certainly multi-dimensional and involves all the Departments. An interdepartmental committee to look at rural development sits permanently. That is very important because all Departments have a role to play. I take some responsibility for coining the phrase &ldquo;rural proofing&rdquo;. Wherever a school or a Garda station is closed or where a service is taken from a rural area, it damages that area.</P>
      <P>Recently I came across a poem by the great Brendan Kenneally about small places and their demise. It reads: </P>
      <P>If life in little places dies, greater places share the loss,</P>
      <P>Life if you wish may just be called one passing game of pitch and toss</P>
      <P>And yet a nation's life is lived in places like the crooked cross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1335" /> It is the same with rural development. If small places go, it affects the totality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first occasion I have raised a matter on the Adjournment to highlight the case of a constituent in the manner I highlight one this afternoon. I raise this matter out of utter frustration with the Department of Health and Children and the hospital authorities.</P>
      <P>As the Minister will know, it involves the case of a 24 year old young woman who has spina bifida. Before Christmas she visited her brother in Navan, County Meath, when, unfortunately, she had to be hospitalised urgently. She was then transferred to Beaumont Hospital. Following an intensive period there, the life threatening problem she had subsided and she is slowly, but surely, on the road to recovery.</P>
      <P>We have been told she can only be transferred back to the hospital which referred her to Beaumont Hospital. This is an absurd policy as it involves transferring her back to the hospital in Navan, although she lives at least 30 to 40 miles away from it. There is already considerable stress on her family, particularly her mother, because she is now looking after her four year old son as well as her father who is quite sick and was in Tallaght Hospital for a two week period and was only released the other day.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister in a most unusual way, through an Adjournment matter, to intercede and to ensure this patient is transferred to Tallaght hospital or St. James's Hospital. It is ludicrous that an official or a Department should allow a situation whereby someone could be transferred back to a referring hospital, although it is 40 miles from where that person lives. Will the Minister also consider the fact that the person in question has been treated on a continuous basis in St. James's Hospital and, prior to that, in Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin? Her entire hospitalisation has been within those hospitals in the south and south-western part of the city. It is absurd and wrong that a Department official or people operating in our hospitals should argue that this person should be transferred back to the referring hospital in Navan because, unfortunately, she happened to be critically injured in Navan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister, who is not in the House &ndash; perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, is replying to the debate &ndash; intercede on her behalf and ensure her quality of life and that of her family can improve? The family fully understands the difficult situation in which Beaumont Hospital finds itself as regards the intensive care unit. There is a need for some intervention to ensure <Col N="1336" /> she is transferred to Tallaght Hospital or St. James's.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The record of Irish aviation with regard to incidents and safety is exemplary. The confidence passengers have built up over the years in the safety, security and ongoing maintenance of the aircraft leaving Irish airports must not be undermined or eroded through legislation or directives from Brussels.</P>
      <P>The recent European Directive No. 96/67/EU on ground handling proposes to open up access to European airports for the purpose of providing competition on all ground handling operations at airports. While I have no objection to this in principle, I am deeply concerned that potential operators might not operate under the same rules and regulations that apply at our airports. I am concerned there will not be social or environmental elements to the directive when it is incorporated into pending legislation covering airport regulation.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that the Minister or her Department has confirmed the regulator will operate solely and exclusively on an economic basis and will not have regard to safety standards or environmental or social issues is unacceptable to me, the people working at Dublin Airport and, I am sure, the travelling public, if they were aware of it.</P>
      <P>Given that ground handling service contracts will be granted on the basis of economic criteria only, it is appalling it is proposed that there will not be independent monitoring of safety standards for operators &ndash; people who carry goods on and off aircraft &ndash; who interact directly with aircraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various statutory bodies responsible for safety and aviation standards will not have responsibility for the safety and technical standards of non-airline companies providing ground handling services directly to the aircraft. This loophole must be plugged. On the basis of the new regulation, a non-airline ground handling cowboy company could tender for services irres<Col N="1337" /> pective of the technical and safety standards of its personnel. Ongoing training carries a cost and it must be brought into the equation.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister's officials acknowledged a gap in the system, but they are unwilling to empower an independent authority to maintain and enforce safety standards in all aspects of air transport, particularly with self-handling and third party ground handling</P>
    <P>It is estimated that airlines suffer around $20 billion per year in damage to aircraft on the ground. Unreported damage to an aircraft's skin or structure caused by ground damage could lead to a major flight disaster. That has not happened here because we know with whom we are dealing. The possibility of this occurring in Ireland would be increased if ongoing safety standards and training are not part of the ground handling tendering equation.</P>
    <P>In the interests of the Irish aviation industry, its employees and passengers, I demand that the acknowledged gap in the proposed legislation is plugged. I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ryan for raising this important issue. One of my Department's objectives for the aviation sector is to ensure that the standards, safety and security of aviation continue to inspire confidence in the use of Irish airspace and technical infrastructure.</P>
      <P>This policy is based on standards which are set internationally, mainly through the International Civil Aviation Organisation Convention to which Ireland is a signatory. Effect is given to this policy through the Air Transport and Navigation Acts and the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993. Government policy and the development of these standards are designed to ensure continuing acceptable passenger and aircraft safety levels.</P>
      <P>The Irish Aviation Authority has responsibility for regulating the technical and safety aspects of civil aviation and for the provision of air traffic standards and the authority monitors the activities of airlines in this regard. In its regulatory capacity the IAA oversees the safety standards in the operation, maintenance and air-worthiness of Irish registered aircraft, the Irish air navigation services, Irish airlines and aircraft maintenance organisations, the competency of Irish pilots and aircraft maintenance engineers and the operation of Irish aerodromes.</P>
      <P>Under its Act the authority regulates matters relating to aircraft safety through competent persons or organisations licensed or certified by it, such as aircraft operators, maintainers and aerodrome licensees. Aircraft operators are responsible for ensuring that the ground services they have contracted for are properly and safely rendered. To the extent that they affect air safety, the IAA monitors the operators' supervision in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Companies providing ground handling services are not and have not ever been regulated by the authority as they are considered to provide ser<Col N="1338" /> vices in support of operators and aerodrome licensees only. The opening of competitive access to ground handling companies through this directive does not change that situation.</P>
    <P>Ground handling broadly comprises all those services required by an aircraft between landing and take off. An airline may chose to provide services for itself, self-handling, or contract with another company, third party handling, be it another airline or a dedicated ground handling company.</P>
    <P>The purpose of EU Directive No. 96/67/EC of 15 October 1996 was to liberalise the ground handling market. Regulations to implement the ground handling directive were signed by the Minister on 16 December 1998. The directive seeks to eliminate a range of restrictive practices, which have generally applied at airports in Europe as regards the provision of ground handling services. At present, only Dublin airport is required to meet all the provisions of the directive. Cork and Shannon must meet the self-handling provisions. The smaller regional airports are bound only by general provisions regarding free access to providers of related services.</P>
    <P>The directive provides that there shall be free access to airports by ground handling service providers subject to certain conditions. It also provides that access may be restricted in respect of the core ground handling services, provided it is restricted to no fewer than at least two providers for each category of service at a given airport and a minimum of two self-handlers.</P>
    <P>With particular regard to the deregulation of self-handling and third party ground handling at Irish airports, I am aware of concerns regarding the need to ensure minimum standards in respect of ground handling services at airports. The Minister has received considerable correspondence on the subject, as have other Ministers and Deputies.</P>
    <P>When airlines use sub-contractors to provide ground handling services, it is the airlines' responsibility, in the first instance, to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the standards, procedures, equipment and training of the service provider.</P>
    <P>Companies providing ground handling services are subject to the health and safety legislation in the normal manner and to the by-laws in force at airports as regards safe working practices. Where the provision of ground handling services does not impinge on aircraft safety, such as catering supplies or aircraft cabin cleaning services, it is the responsibility of the existing agencies such as the regional health board's environmental health service for food safety, the Health and Safety Authority for safe work practices and the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce the legal standards in the same manner as for any other industrial activity or service in Ireland. The general standards which airport authorities require ground handling companies to meet will be in addition to the regulatory requirements set out above.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1339" /> The Health and Safety Authority will continue to carry out regular inspection of airport activities to which the safety and health laws apply, including compliance with the duties imposed on either those who control workplaces or who employ workers. In addition, the authority would provide such information as it may have or other references to good safety and health practice applying to operations at airports.</P>
    <P>It is the view of the Health and Safety Authority that there are no statutory safety standards applying specifically to ground handling at airports, and unless the case is established for such, the industry should agree on current best practice standards.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Irish Aviation Authority, as the independent authority for aviation safety, and the Health and Safety Authority, with its responsibility for safety in the workplace, will continue to monitor the situation regarding ground handling and advise the relevant Ministers regarding any additional safety requirements that may arise in future.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - White Paper on Defence.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is evident that the much delayed, long promised White Paper on Defence is unravelling and threatening to deteriorate into one of the most serious crises ever in the relationship between the Defence Forces and the Government. There is clearly a huge gulf between the Minister, his advisers and the Department, on the one hand, and the professionals of the Defence Forces, whose future the paper is meant to address, on the other. It is abundantly clear that the consultation process has degenerated into a disaster, with potentially serious consequences for the future leadership of the Defence Forces, for morale and for recruitment.</P>
      <P>What began as yet another review of the Army, Navy and Air Corps has been allowed to be transformed into a nightmare scenario which is now threatening the future of all three services. Everyone accepts that some disagreement is inevitable but the scale and sheer volume of the negative response to the leaked White Paper and the Minister's leadership on this issue is disturbing. What has happened to the consultation process? Why has there been a breakdown of this degree and depth with such potentially serious repercussions? Why has the Minister not improved communications with the leadership of the Defence Forces since the leak of the White Paper? Why did he find it necessary to enter the Dáil two days ago and speak about the leadership of the Defence Forces in such a threatening and offensive manner? Is this what we should expect from a Minister for Defence? Is it a reflection of the relationship between the Minister and the most senior members of the Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the circumstances surrounding the forthcoming publication of the long promised White Paper are now so critical that the <Col N="1340" /> Minister could be faced with resignations, thus creating an unprecedented situation and a potential crisis in the relationship between the Executive and the Defence Forces. The exit from the Defence Forces of qualified and experienced personnel could also escalate &ndash; I hope that does not happen &ndash; as a result of this problem.</P>
    <P>This situation is appalling and should not have been allowed to develop. It is worth pointing out that when the White Paper was promised in an election manifesto, the Defence Forces were only then emerging from a massive review and reorganisation. The Defence Forces have already had to face up to huge changes and the effect of delaying the White Paper and allowing rumours to circulate unabated over a long period in respect of cutbacks in personnel numbers and reductions in the roles of the Air Corps and the Navy is hugely damaging.</P>
    <P>While the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs sign up for further commitments to Partnership for Peace and a European led rapid reaction force and while they visit Kosovo to reassure our troops, there is nothing but uncertainty emanating from the Department of Defence at present. It is astonishing that we have arrived at a point in the process of the production of the White Paper where the advice of members of the Defence Forces and their representative associations would appear to have been totally disregarded. Ongoing news reports about the Air Corps and its equipment are also a cause for grave concern and that is an issue which I am raising separately.</P>
    <P>We all accept that the Defence Forces must continue to modernise, be efficient in terms of taxpayers' resources and be fully accountable and ready to respond to future needs in an adaptive and flexible manner. However, this cannot occur in a policy vacuum. Defence Forces staff have made it clear that the retention of three brigades is the bare minimum needed to fulfil our obligations. The Minister is delaying decisions on a series of overdue and critical issues. I ask him to inform the House how he intends to address the serious issues surrounding the White Paper which have emerged in recent weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.</P>
      <P>This afternoon my Department circulated a draft memorandum for the Government and draft White Paper to relevant Departments for their observations. I will submit the draft to the Government for its consideration immediately on receiving these observations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The completion of the draft White Paper is the culmination of a long, careful and very detailed preparative process, an important element of which was the consultative part. I was aware that a topic of such fundamental importance as Defence should be the subject of widespread consultation. However, I was also keenly conscious of the need for balance to be maintained between consultation, on the one hand and my duty as <Col N="1341" /> Minister in relation to the formation of defence policy on the other.</P>
    <P>A total of 46 submissions were received from a wide range of individuals, groups and organisations and following examination of these, invitations were extended to a number of individuals or groups where it was felt that further contact would be useful. As stated from the outset, my concern was to ensure that all those who wished to make an input to the White Paper process should be facilitated in doing so. In that regard, the key stakeholders, including the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs and the military authorities, have had an opportunity to make their input to the White Paper. In addition, throughout the drafting process the military authorities have also been able to make their input in a number of different ways.</P>
    <P>As outlined previously, the overall objectives of the White Paper as published at the commencement of the consultative process are as follows: to provide a medium-term policy framework within which Defence policy can evolve to set out a clear strategy for the next ten years; to provide for the continuation of the reform programme of Defence services, already commenced under the Defence Forces implementation plan, consistent with the national and international security environment and the state of the public finances; to ensure that the management of the Defence services is in accordance with the evolution of the strategic management initiative centrally and to set out the basis for the future development of Civil Defence policy and the follow-up to the current &ldquo;Towards 2000&rdquo; strategy.</P>
    <P>I have always viewed the White Paper as presenting a positive opportunity to map out a strategy for the development of the Defence Forces and Civil Defence during the next ten years. I assure the House that is what it will do. Furthermore, as indicated on previous occasions, real positive changes, which I have overseen, continue to be made in the Defence Forces. I refer to continuous recruitment &ndash; this is the first Government to maintain such a policy &ndash; new equipment, better infrastructure, closure of barracks, improved overseas allowances and better, more streamlined organisation structures.</P>
    <P>In recent years considerable sums have been expended under the Defence Vote for new equipment and in providing new and upgraded living and operational accommodation for the Defence Forces. I intend to continue and expand, where possible, the modernisation programme to ensure the Defence Forces are equipped to the highest standards appropriate to their roles. However, as Members are aware, I am not a man to rest on my laurels. I believe we have a responsibility and the potential exists to do more.</P>
    <P>We live in a dynamic and changing world &ndash; we have seen undreamed of change. The Defence Forces must continue to evolve and change to meet the new challenges arising in the defence and security environment. I am determined that we should have the best Defence Forces possible, <Col N="1342" /> given the resources available, and I have no doubt that this is what individual soldiers also desire.</P>
    <P>As with all Government publications, the White Paper will be widely promulgated. I again assure the House that consultations on it will take place with the Defence Forces representative associations in accordance with the normal system of representation.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Drug Treatment Services.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for choosing this matter to be taken on the Adjournment. I also thank the Minister, who has a busy schedule, for being in attendance. I congratulate him on becoming the new Minister for Health and Children for Cork.</P>
      <P>This matter is different to the previous one raised in that it involves a micro as opposed to a macro problem. However, it is suitable to the Adjournment because it is very specific and can easily be outlined in five minutes. It requires a relatively small investment and, as a result, I hope the Minister will say yes.</P>
      <P>This matter arises from a meeting I attended in a residential addiction treatment centre for adults in Cork called Tabor Lodge, with which the Minister is familiar. To appreciate the need for this request one must first consider the work which takes place in an establishment such as Tabor Lodge. The lodge offers a 28-day residential treatment programme based on a US model and caters for all types of addictions, including eating disorders, but the patients are mainly alcoholics or drug addicts.</P>
      <P>A huge amount of work, expense and expertise goes into trying to achieve positive results &ndash; group therapy, lectures, videos, one-to-one counselling, isolation from the environment which led to the addiction, meditation and so on. As a result there is a high success ratio in institutions such as Tabor Lodge for addicts who enter the programme in a positive frame of mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, everyone involved in the treatment has found that, while the programme may be a success in itself, when the individuals or addicts go back to their home environment they find their lives going off the rails again, very quickly in some cases. To be moved from intensive residential treatment to the home environment which, in many cases, caused the original problem, is for many too big a step taken too quickly and their addiction takes over once more. For this reason, a halfway house for women has been set up and funded in response to the need for a residential supportive environment for women in the early stages of recovery following addiction treatment. The facility is called Renewal and is situated on Blarney Road, Cork. The Minister may have visited it. It has been a great success as shown by the comment of one patient who said that it gave her the ability to let her inner light shine through her journey of recovery. This facility provides an environment where people <Col N="1343" /> can get the best out of themselves while recovering and trying to regain employment, a house and their family and get their lives back in order.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there is no such facility for men in Cork. By not providing such a facility are we suggesting that they are better able to cope with addiction recovery than women? I hope that is not the case because the evidence suggests otherwise. We must provide halfway house residential accommodation where men can get the support they need after treatment so that they can get their lives back in order. Otherwise the original treatment is a complete waste of time and money, and a revolving door syndrome emerges similar to that in the prisons system where many addicts return to addiction and have to repeat treatment.</P>
    <P>Like many other urban centres, Cork has a huge drug and alcohol addiction problem, particularly among young males. One method of combating this scourge is through the provision of proper treatment and rehabilitation so that addicts have a chance to recover. I ask the Minister to give men in Cork a chance when they are trying to recover from drug addiction by providing a similar facility to that available to women. This will not cost a large amount of money but people treated at such a facility will recover far more effectively than at present.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin): I thank Deputy Coveney for raising this matter. As he will be aware the Southern Health Board has statutory responsibility for the provision of alcohol and drug treatment services in its area. The board provides a range of services, mainly through its out-patient facility at Arbour House, Cork and its outreach and counselling services throughout Cork and Kerry. The board received additional funding of £260,000 in 2000 for the <Col N="1344" /> further development of drug treatment services in its area. This provides for maintaining and further developing the assessment, treatment, advisory research and training services provided at Arbour House, including the further development of outreach facilities.</P>
    <P>In its service plan the board also stated that it will continue to work with the relevant voluntary organisations to provide residential places for people with drug and alcohol problems who are in need of such services. In addition, the north Cork local drugs task force is involved in developing a strategic, locally-based response to the drug problem. The task force, which comprises members from statutory, voluntary and community sectors, supports and funds 21 projects in Cork city.</P>
    <P>The board has made provision in its 2000 service plan to support a women's halfway house facility, provided through Tabor Lodge. This will provide rehabilitation, counselling and assistance to women who have completed a primary treatment programme, but who need additional support to remain drug free. The board was not aware of a proposal for an addiction treatment halfway house facility for men and would, therefore, have made no provision for such a service when preparing its 2000 service plan.</P>
    <P>However, preliminary discussions have taken place about the feasibility of developing a similar service for men to the one which is being supported for women at Tabor Lodge. When the board receives this proposal it will consider it in the context of providing a continuum of care and a comprehensive treatment and aftercare service for men recovering from substance misuse. I assure the Deputy that this proposal will receive a sympathetic hearing and I will raise the issue with the health board.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 8 February 2000.</P>

    </Qst>
    <P>(Dr. McDaid): As part of the Government's ongoing commitment to the development of sport, an additional £1 million was made available in this year's budget to the Irish Sports Council to further assist with the preparation and participation of the Irish teams at this year's Sydney games.</P>
    <P>This special additional funding is over and above that already in place for support programmes through the ongoing funding of national governing bodies; the provision of training and competition facilities; the support services provided by the National Coaching and Training Centre and the benefits accruing to our top competitors through the international carding scheme.</P>
    <P>This substantial injection of funds, which has been warmly welcomed by the Olympic Council of Ireland and the national governing bodies of sport, represents a major boost to our olympic and paralympic effort.</P>
    <P>Last month, the Irish Sports Council announced this year's grants for national governing bodies of sport including olympic preparation, amounting to £5.45 million, an increase of 30% over the previous year's allocation.</P>
    <P>The sports council will later this month allocate £1.3 million to support our top competitors under the international carding scheme. The council will also be announcing their funding in support of the work of the Olympic Council of Ireland and the Paralympic Council of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The increased funding to olympic sports organisations and the support for individual competitors will provide our olympic athletes with a complete and integrated preparation in the run up to Sydney, including training camps, elite coaching, medical and sport science and top quality international competition.</P>
    <P>The support being provided this year and last, to our top sportspersons, in terms of direct finance and the accompanying package of services in the area of medical and sport science, coaching, training and counselling and access to the quality facilities provided under our ambitious sports capital programme represents the largest investment to date in the preparation of Irish teams for the Olympic Games.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>I have already outlined earlier today the Government's decision to proceed with plans to build a campus of sporting excellence, including an 80,000 all seated national stadium, at Abbotstown in west Dublin, to be known as Sports Campus Ireland. Ireland, despite being a nation of sports enthusiasts does not have a stadium suitable for hosting all its field sports. The stadium now proposed will be capable of accommodating a wide range of sport and entertainment events. Crucially, a stadium of the size and quality proposed is essential if we are to attract major international sport events. The vision is a stadium of which Irish people can be proud and one which can compete with any stadium worldwide for such events.</P>
      <P>I have not had a meeting with the chairperson of the stadium steering committee which included an official from my Department. The Deputies may be aware that the chairperson, Mr. Keogh will now chair a board of trustees that will hold the campus and stadium as assets for the Irish people. In addition, Paddy Teahon who is shortly to leave his position as Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach will chair the development company for the campus and stadium. While preliminary plans have been drawn up for the stadium, the development company will be responsible for finalising the plans and seeking planning permission. This will include devising a marketing strategy, including targetting appropriate sporting events for the stadium. The target is to have Sports Campus Ireland operational by 2005.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the issue raised by Deputy O'Shea in relation to establishments which come within the terms of the Gamings and Lottery Act being associated with the proposed stadium, I am not aware of any proposals in this regard and I <Col N="1347" /> understand that no such proposals were ever considered by the PricewaterhouseCoopers in the feasibility study or by the national steering committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 9 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1957, Bord Fáilte is empowered to publish or cause to be published lists of tourism accommodation premises, including bed and breakfast operations, which are not registered, and therefore are not protected, titles under the Tourist Traffic Acts. Consequently the system by which bed and breakfast accommodation is listed is a voluntary one and operators who do not wish to be listed by Bord Fáilte are not prohibited from carrying on their business. However, statutory requirements in areas such as taxation, planning, fire and safety and hygiene, apply to providers of tourist accommodation, whether listed or unlisted.</P>
      <P>At present, there are some 4,300 operations which are listed in accordance with the criteria set by Bord Fáilte. Bord Fáilte has no comparable figures of similar accuracy for unlisted accommodation.</P>
      <P>Operators, who are listed, experience a number of advantages such as access to official marketing through Bord Fáilte, the Gulliver reservations service and the tourist information office network.</P>
      <P>They may also participate at trade and consumer fairs, in advertising, in off-season promotions with tour operators, in trade education programmes, direct mail campaigns and publicity etc.</P>
      <P>The issue of mandatory licensing or registration of all tourist accommodation, including bed and breakfasts, has been examined by successive administrations over the years and they have all come to the same conclusion &ndash; that any mandatory system, in order to be effective, would require a significant diversion of resources currently devoted to the development of tourism towards administration and policing. This would be particularly burdensome as many accommodation providers only operate for short periods of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in the volume and range of tourist <Col N="1349" /> accommodation which has enhanced the choice available to tourists. This will allow market forces to weed out accommodation which is not of a sufficiently high standard to meet tourist requirements. In light of developments in the supply of accommodation, I share the view of my predecessors that the introduction of a compulsory licensing system would be an inappropriate use of resources. There is no evidence to support the view that such a system would have any appreciable impact on accommodation standards over and above that brought about by market forces.</P>
    <P>I launched a new initiative during 1999 which was targeted primarily at the small listed accommodation provider under which Bord Fáilte is reviewing the branding and overseas marketing of the various groups in this category. I am confident that this initiative will considerably expand the range of assistance and advice offered to the sector, thereby making listing a more attractive proposition.</P>

      <P>One of <Col N="1350" /> the Government's key social inclusion priorities continues to be the need to ensure a more focused and better co-ordinated response by the statutory authorities in addressing the needs of severely disadvantaged urban communities.</P>
      <P>In this context, the interdepartmental policy committee on local development, which was chaired by my colleague and former Minister of State, Deputy Flood, was given a mandate to oversee a pilot integrated services process, with the ultimate aim of improving the quality of life in our most deprived urban areas, as a basis for a model of best practice. A national steering committee oversees the ISP on behalf of the interdepartmental policy committee.</P>
      <P>In July 1999 the national steering committee brought the first interim progress report to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. The recommendations in the report were fully endorsed by the Cabinet committee.</P>
      <P>The report sets out the priorities that have been identified in agreement with local communities in the four pilot areas, of which early school leaving emerged as the most important. Participating Departments and agencies have been asked by the Taoiseach to address the issues contained in the interim report as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>PricewaterhouseCoopers has been appointed as external evaluators for the process. It produced a historical review of the ISP in November 1999 and are currently preparing its first interim report on the ISP which should be completed by March 2000.</P>

    <P>As I have stated on previous occasions, any decision relating to the deletion of rule 21 from the GAA rule book is a matter for the GAA and <Col N="1351" /> its members, as an independent, autonomous national governing body of sport.

    <P>Recently, at a public function and in discussions with senior officers of the GAA, I raised the question of the GAA deleting Rule 21. A recent press release issued by the GAA confirms that the association is keeping the matter under review in the light of recent developments in relation to the police service in Northern Ireland, and in accordance with the motion adopted by the GAA's Special Congress in 1998, which pledged its intention to delete Rule 21 when, and I quote from the motion, &ldquo;effective steps are taken to implement the amended structures and policing arrangements envisaged in British/Irish Agreement.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Overseas tourism to Ireland has consistently out-performed world and European averages over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>Growth in world travel slowed from 6.1% in 1994 to 2.4% in 1998, while growth in travel to and within Europe slowed from 6.4% to 3% over the same period. In contrast, Ireland has achieved an annual average growth rate of more than 7.5% over the same period.</P>
      <P>Visitor growth to Ireland from Europe has been overshadowed by exceptionally strong growth from the US and Britain in recent years. Preliminary estimates indicate growth in visitors from the US and British markets of 12% and 9% respectively in 1999, while overseas visitor numbers from Europe grew by 3% in line with estimated growth in travel generally to and within Europe.</P>
      <P>Within Europe, Bord Fáilte considers that Italy and the Nordic markets are emerging as the strongest growth prospects for the future. Germany and to a lesser extent, France have exhibited sluggish growth over the past few years. These more disappointing performances from our two largest continental European markets can in part be explained by prevailing economic conditions in those countries. Added to this, recent consumer research indicates that Ireland's image among German and, to a lesser extent, French consumers may be beginning to lose some of its fashionability. Consequently, Bord Fáilte has begun work, through a comprehensive review of Tourism Brand Ireland, to enhance Ireland's image in all our key overseas markets, including France and Germany.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>Under the new national development plan, more than £400 million has been provided under the regional operational programmes in a special sub-programme for social inclusion. These moneys will be directed at activities to be carried out by the area-based partnership companies and ADM supported community groups, the local drug task forces, and the development groups of the young peoples facilities and services fund.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that in accordance with the recommendations of the interdepartmental task force on the integration of local government and local development systems &ldquo;one single agency, partnership company, Leader group, or, in Gaeltacht areas, Údarás na Gaeltachta, as the case may be, will be responsible for special nationally promoted integrated local development programmes in each designated disadvantaged area, be they urban or rural&rdquo;.

It is hoped that the revised structures will be in place by the mid-term review of the programme.</P>
      <P>On this basis, partnerships in consultation with ADM have already commenced work on the planning process for the next programme, allowing for harmonisation with city-county development board strategies, when they come on stream.</P>

The increased provision for 2000, the largest since such provision was first made, includes a trebling in funding for the sports capital programme from the National Lottery from £5 mill<Col N="1354" /> ion in 1997 to £15.2 million in 2000; a fourfold increase in the provision for swimming pools from £3.5 million in 1997 to over £15 million in 2000; almost £6 million towards the development of Ireland's first ever 50 metre swimming pool and the final £6 million of £20 million support towards the development of Croke Park.</P>

      <P>One of my key priorities is to ensure that the benefits of our growing tourism industry are shared throughout the regions.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, I launched a new initiative last March, with a £300,000 budget for 1999, specifically to assist the marketing efforts of smaller accommodation providers. Bord Fáilte has responsibility for implementing the initiative and has engaged in extensive consultations with the smaller accommodation sector in developing a three tiered approach which involves assisting individual bed and breakfast operators to promote themselves; helping the representative associations to market their sector more effectively, and raising awareness of smaller accommodation among consumers and the travel trade.</P>
      <P>With increased marketing efforts from other accommodation sectors, it is generally agreed that individual bed and breakfast owners need to play a more active role in promoting their own premises and their sector. In order to provide a forum to discuss this, and to assist providers in developing some simple methods of promotion, Bord Fáilte began a series of workshops in November 1999 that are expected to continue until May 2000.</P>
      <P>A sum of £500,000 has been allocated to the initiative for 2000, the second year of the initiative. Among the new activities planned by Bord Fáilte for the coming year is the formation of a forum to develop suitable initiatives to support the marketing of one-star and two-star hotels. This will build on work already under way in this sector. Other sectors which will also receive attention include the caravan and camping, guesthouse, hostel and rented sectors.</P>

      <P>Ministerial responsibility for issues relating to litter lies with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and he and I are acutely aware of the impact litter can have on tourist perceptions of Ireland and holidaying in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly welcome the priority which he and the local authorities are now giving to tackling this problem. Local authorities are now taking a more pro-active role in eradicating litter. There were 859 prosecutions for littering during the first six months of 1999 as compared to 507 in the same period in 1998. The number of full and part-time litter wardens has also increased in <Col N="1356" /> the same period, from 191 to 298, and last month the on-the-spot fine for littering was increased from £25 to £50.</P>
    <P>A National Anti-Litter Forum was established by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, in July 1999. The forum is expected to issue a report over the next few months outlining strategies to combat litter. It will outline a programme to tackle the problem over a four to five year period. Bord Fáilte and the Irish Hotels Federation have representatives on the forum.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the tourism and the environment pilot initiative, which I launched under the 1994-99 operational programme for tourism, has, as one of its objectives, the encouragement of innovative thinking on litter control systems. Two pilot projects, one in Waterford and one in Tipperary, are aimed specifically at developing models for towns and cities on how to effectively tackle the litter problem. These projects will be completed over the next few months and hopefully will bring fresh thinking to bear on this issue.</P>
    <P>In a highly competitive international environment, value for money is a critical determinant in holiday choices, and we cannot afford a price drift upwards in a fashion that endangers the impact of the huge investment in Irish tourism over the past decade. I have consistently highlighted this issue in addresses to the industry, and will continue to do so as value for money remains an ongoing requirement for any successful tourism industry.</P>

      <P>The local drugs task forces were set up in disadvantaged areas experiencing the highest levels of illicit drug use, particularly heroin abuse. While the use of illicit drugs is a nation-wide phenomenon, heroin abuse presents particular problems because of its public health implications and close association with crime. In determining the designation of the task force areas, therefore, the focus has been on those areas which have a high incidence of heroin abuse.</P>
      <P>The criteria used for determining such areas are drug treatment data from the health services; Garda crime statistics; data relating to school attendance-drop-out; and other relevant data on the levels of social and economic disadvantage in the area. Based on these criteria, the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Inclusion decided last year that a further task force area be designated in Bray. This brings to 14 the number of task forces which have been set up to date.</P>

      <Col N="1357" /> A review of the overall national drugs strategy is now under way. This review will take account of the measures currently being undertaken to tackle drug misuse and the adequacy of these responses in the light of emerging trends in drug misuse nationally, with a view to making recommendations to Government on future drugs policy.</P>

      <P>The attraction of industry to particular counties is a day to day matter for the industrial development agencies, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, and not one in which I have a direct function.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities. The development agencies are now strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed to reflect this new focus. In this regard, the Border region, including the Cavan and Monaghan areas, is a particular priority location for promotional purposes by the agencies.</P>
      <P>The agencies' focus on regionalisation ensures that an attractive financial package will be made available to any appropriate project which may choose to locate or expand in the area.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland as part of its new focus on the regions is seeking to deliver over 50% of all newly approved greenfield jobs to the objective one region, which includes Cavan and Monaghan. This compares with c.25% of projects which were being brought to this region in the past.</P>
      <P>As a direct result of this increased marketing focus, there is a strong flow of potential clients visiting the advance factory available in Cavan. IDA Ireland's objective is to secure a client for this facility at the earliest possible stage. Planning permission is also being sought for the construction of an advance factory in Monaghan and, pending satisfactory approval, negotiations will commence with developers in the near future. The availability of such facilities is essential to the attraction of industry to the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA Ireland strategy includes the establishment of its new Border headquarters in Cavan town where the agency's area director is based, together with newly appointed staff for this office. Internally, IDA Ireland has been restructured to support this strategy. Staff resources in the agency's offices for the border region have been <Col N="1358" /> increased by one third, giving greater focus on the entire area.</P>
    <P>However, it is not merely a question of jobs dispersal as IDA Ireland is seeking to bring a better mix of industry sectors and higher value industries to locations around the country, in particular, to locations that have not seen the emergence of the more modern industries. The agency's new strategy also addresses the need to increase the value and sustainability of overseas companies already established or about to establish in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is also committed to assisting industrial development in the region. In addition to working with its core client base, the agency, because of its involvement in all aspects of business development &ndash; finance, technology, human resources, etc. &ndash; works closely with all development organisations in the region as well as the third level educational institutions, local development bodies and other industry to pro actively facilitate an integrated approach to development in the region.</P>
    <P>The national development plan, recently announced, will also help to underpin IDA Ireland's regional strategy since it will provide the infrastructure necessary for the attraction of overseas investment currently lacking outside the major urban areas. The plan envisages spending a higher amount per head of population in the largely rural Border, midland and west regions.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the co-ordinated efforts being made by the development agencies will advance the further economic developments of the area.</P>

      <P>The submission to which the Deputy refers comprised a survey of 1998 game angling catches in the southern fisheries region and a motion passed in February 1999 by the Southern Regional Fisheries Board, on foot of that survey proposing that the board introduce a moratorium as commercial salmon fishing during 1999 in the region, with compensation for the netsmen concerned, as well as limits on the take of salmon by anglers.</P>
      <P>The necessity for very detailed consultations with all the stakeholders including private fishery owners, angling clubs and the commercial salmon sector on the detail and implications of such a scheme precluded its introduction for the 1999 season.

The commission which will be up and running shortly will be statutorily responsible for advising me on salmon conservation protection and development policies and strategies. In the meantime the Department will consult further with the Southern Regional Fisheries Board on the proposed scheme for the region.</P>

Regulations governing the standards applicable to wheelchair accessible taxis have been made by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of VRT on wheelchair accessible taxis was considered in the context of the 1999 Finance Bill and again in the context of the recent budget but I decided to take no action. There is no evidence of lack of interest in taxi licences in Dublin, for example, where wheelchair accessibility has been a requirement for new licence holders and applications greatly exceed the number available. In addition, there is a substantive problem in that any VRT concession for taxis and hackneys would itself be costly and could lead to further revenue losses with private cars, as vehicles could be passed through the taxi-hackney fleet to avail of any tax concession. VRT is paid on initial registration and does not require the retention of a vehicle for any time period. <Col N="1363" /> Accordingly, I have no plans to abolish or to reduce the VRT on wheelchair accessible taxis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Rollover relief under the capital gains tax code provides for a deferral of tax if the proceeds from the disposal of certain trading assets are reinvested in new trading assets within three years of the disposal. The tax position on the gain from the old asset is looked at when the new asset acquired is disposed of and there is not a subsequent reinvestment. The purpose of the rollover relief is primarily to ensure that business people are not faced with a capital gains tax charge when they dispose of trade assets in order to reinvest in new trade assets.</P>
      <P>In general, the reinvestment must be in specified assets which must be in use for the purposes of the same trade as were the assets which were disposed of. This rule does not apply on cessation of a trade where a person has carried on the old trade for ten years prior to its cessation and he/she commences a new trade within two years of the date of the cessation of the old trade. For the relief to apply both the assets disposed of and the assets acquired must fall within one of the following categories: land and buildings used for the purposes of the trade, plant and machinery used for trade purposes, goodwill of a trade. A taxi plate would not fall within any of the categories of qualifying assets for the purposes of rollover relief. I have no proposals to alter the current tax position.</P>

      <P>It is important that the programme for delivering the vaccine is effective and well-organised and at my Department's request, the chief executive officers of the health boards have established a multi-disciplinary group to take the lead role in this regard. The vaccine will be incorporated into the primary childhood immunisation programme and will also be given to older children and young people in a &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; programme. Each health board has in turn established a regional implementation group, to include a project manager, to undertake detailed local planning for the vaccine's introduction. It is also anticipated that there will be discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation, under the auspices of the Health Service Employers' Agency, about the involvement of general practitioners in the delivery of the vaccine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest indications are that new vaccine should be licensed and available for use in Ireland in the early summer. It can be introduced in this country only when the statutory licensing authority, the Irish Medicines Board, has granted the necessary authorisation. The Irish Medicines Board must of course satisfy itself that the product meets the requirements in relation to such <Col N="1365" /> issues as safety and efficacy, before a product authorisation is granted.</P>
    <P>My Department is in contact with the health boards about the planning being undertaken and it is also monitoring the situation in relation to the licensing of the vaccine, with a view to having it introduced at the earliest possible date.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1366" /> The administration of the registration system is a matter for An tÁrd-Chláraitheoir, the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
    <P>The Registration of Births and Deaths Acts 1863 to 1996 and the Marriages Acts of 1844 and 1863 provide that an t-Árd Chláraitheoir shall retain certified copies of the records of births, deaths and marriages returned to him on a quarterly basis by local registrars and that he shall compile and make available an index to such records in his office. Persons are entitled to search these indexes on the payment of the approved fees and to obtain certified copies of entries identified from the index. However, this is only one aspect of the services provided at the General Register Office, Joyce House and other services are provided include the issue of authorisations for the late registration of events and the reregistration of births. In addition, an tÁrd Chláraitheoir is concerned with the appointment of registrars and the administration of marriage law.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies may be aware, steps are being taken to maintain and improve indexes to the records of births, deaths and marriages including the special project for the capture of the records of births, deaths and marriages and associated indexes in an electronic format which has been ongoing in Roscommon for some time. When this archival records project is completed, it will improve the efficiency, flexibility, access and management of the records and the associated indexes and will provide potential for the development of a range of services, which would not be possible in a system reliant on printed indexes. This project will benefit all customers of the registration service throughout the country including persons who currently avail of the services of the reading room in the General Register Office. Other measures taken to improve service in the General Register Office include the relocation of the public counter on the first floor in Joyce House in July 1999 to provide additional space in the public reading room. Tenders have been sought for the further refurbishment of the General Register Office which will include additional improvements to the environment of the reading room and the improvement of customer services on the second floor of the office. Other issues raised in the council's report are being considered in the context of the review of the service to identify changes necessary to provide a modern and effective service based on the electronic recording of vital events.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Statutory responsibility for water management and protection, including responsibility for monitoring water quality, rests primarily with local authorities. The Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of databases of information related to the environment for the preparation and implementation of environmental monitoring programmes. The functions of the agency in this regard include supervision of the performance of statutory environmental functions by local authorities.</P>
      <P>The results of the first ever detailed survey to establish the pattern of occurrence of cyanobacteria in Irish lakes were published in the EPA report Investigation of Toxins Produced by Cyanobacteria in October, 1999. The report found that most algal blooms investigated in Ireland were non-toxic at the time of sampling, and that fully dispersed populations of cyanobacteria do not present a serious threat of acute toxicity. While the investigation could not exclude the possibility of subtle or chronic effects from ingesting water with low toxin doses, the report stated that the most serious danger to humans is to swallow water from a surface scum. It also pointed out that the rate of entry of toxins to drinking water supplies is minimised by the removal of cyanobacteria in water treatment plants. A copy of the report is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The EPA has no plans to initiate a national monitoring programme specifically to identify cyanobacteria, which occur naturally in the vast majority of lakes throughout the world. However, it is proposed that in the current lake monitoring programme algal and cyanobacterial species identification will be performed in cases where lakes are enriched. In addition estimates will continue to be made of the abundance of algae and cyanobacteria populations in all lake samples analysed. Such identifications will be required routinely in the monitoring of lakes over 50 hectares in surface area under the terms of the proposed EU water framework Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department issued advice to local authorities, by way of circular letter in November 1993, in relation to the possible causes and effects of algal blooms and the action to be taken in the event of such blooms. Particular attention was drawn to the protection of drinking water sources; this had been the subject of earlier guide<Col N="1371" /> lines issued by my Department to local authorities in December 1992. Public information requirements were also emphasised in my Department's advice and guidelines to local authorities.</P>

      <Quest>the number of small farmers receiving payment under the new farm assist scheme on 31 December 1999; the average payment; the number of these who were new applicants compared to 1998; and if he will make a statement on whether the new farm assist scheme has benefited as many farm families as he had hoped.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 64 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>The farm assist scheme, which introduced the special arrangements for farmers on low incomes, was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1999 and came into operation with effect from 7 April 1999. The number of claimants in receipt of small-holders unemployment assistance on 31 December 1998 was 6,559, with an average payment during the year of £74.60 per week. On 31 December 1999 7,117 farm assist claims were in payment, of which 1,688 were new applications, 4,990 were former smallholders and 439 comprise claimants transferring from widower's non-contributory pensions, pre-retirement and disability allowances.  A further 303 claims were under investigation.</P>
      <P>Under the small-holders scheme, 753 claims were still in payment at the end of 1999. The average payment to the 4,990 former small-holders who transferred to farm assist on 31 December was £83.06 per week. This represents an average increase of £8.46 per week on payments made under the small-holders unemployment assistance scheme. New applicants to farm assist are receiving an average payment of £56.63.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that farm assist represents a worthwhile improvement in the financial provision for low income farmers. It is of particular benefit to farm families with children, because of the special disregard in respect of children but also provides increased payments to couples with<Col N="1373" /> out children and to single farmers on low income. While the numbers who applied were less than expected, significant gains have been made by new applicants who are receiving on average in excess of £2,500 per annum under the scheme. Farmers on low incomes may still apply. Application forms and information leaflets are available in all local social welfare offices.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 685 last Wednesday from Deputy Gormley, the visa application in question was refused because it had not been established, on the basis of the docu<Col N="1376" /> mentation supplied to my Department, that the applicant would observe the conditions of a visit visa.</P>

My Department has no record of an appeal from the applicant.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that the applicant was advised that her reference in Ireland was considered to be unsuitable, nor is this the Department's view.

      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers in primary and secondary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost <Col N="1379" /> of salary. This scheme is, however, being phased out, as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>Arising from the programme for economic and social progress, PESP, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional per capita grants for primary and secondary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard per capita grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional per capita grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme of additional per capita grants to schools in respect of secretarial and caretaking services has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the PESP. With effect from January of this year, all primary schools with 100 or more pupils have become eligible for a grant towards secretarial and caretaking services under this scheme. Costing £2.7 million, this improvement of the scheme will benefit approximately 650 schools serving <Col N="1380" /> 90,000 pupils. My Department is currently making arrangements for the issue of these grants to schools.</P>
    <P>An additional £9 million has recently been secured which will enable me to extend and improve the supports available to all primary schools over the next two years. Details of the implementation of this will be worked out in the near future following consultations and will, when taken together with the earlier move, make a major contribution to assisting schools.</P>
    <P>At second level, schools with 200 or more pupils receive a per capita grant of £30 subject to a maximum of £10,500 per annum towards the provision of secretarial services and a grant of £25 per pupil to a maximum of £8,750 in respect of caretaking assistance. Financial allocations for 2000 are currently being finalised and existing provision for secretarial and caretaking services is being reviewed in this context. The Deputy will be aware that the standard per capita grant payable to voluntary secondary schools was increased from £177 per pupil to £184 last year and a further increase of £8 is planned for this year.</P>
    <P>My Department is aware of the needs of schools in relation to secretarial and caretaking services and I am committed to improving existing provision this year and in future years in the budgetary context and in light of available resources.</P>
