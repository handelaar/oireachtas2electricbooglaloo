    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I met the family of Pat Finucane in Government Buildings on Thursday, 24 February. I was accompanied by my colleagues, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very pleased to welcome Geraldine Finucane and other members of the Finucane family to Government Buildings together with representatives of a number of human rights organisations, both domestic and international. The <Col N="1288" /> meeting enabled us to have a comprehensive review of developments in the case. The case has been, and remains, a cause of the deepest concern to the Government. Pat Finucane's murder was not only abhorrent in itself &ndash; it also represents a fundamental attack on the legal profession and the system of justice.</P>
    <P>At the meeting, a copy of British-Irish Rights Watch's latest report on the case was handed over, as well as a legal opinion from Amnesty International which argues that there is no legal barrier to the holding of a public inquiry while a policy investigation is under way.</P>
    <P>For my part, I restated our clear view that the case for a public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane is compelling. This view has already been conveyed to the British Government. After the lapse of more than a decade since Pat Finucane's murder, and the serious allegations in relation to it, the Government strongly shares the view that a public inquiry needs to be established into all the circumstances surrounding this appalling murder.</P>
    <P>I will follow up on all of the matters raised at my meeting with the Finucane family and I will use every suitable opportunity to raise the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach ask the British Prime Minister at his last meeting with him if he would agree to a public inquiry into the Finucane case and, if so, what was his response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Government has been considering the case for the past year. The former Secretary of State, Dr. Mo Mowlam, stated it would examine it. That is still the position. I raised the matter with the British Prime Minister on this and on numerous other occasions. The British Government is not yet convinced. Its stated position of last week, which has not changed, is that the Stevens investigation is ongoing. The British Government's position is that the report should be completed before it makes up its mind. The Irish Government, the human rights groups and the Finucane family do not share that view. That is where the matter rests as of now. The Finucane family asked me to arrange a meeting with the British Prime Minister and we are seeking to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Taoiseach said he would use every suitable opportunity to raise the issue. Will he outline what might be suitable opportunities from his point of view? If there are opportunities that would be unsuitable, can he give an example? Will the Rosemary Nelson case also be raised during those suitable opportunities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Wherever possible either myself, the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, who has taken a particular interest in this case and presented the original reports to the British Government in the spring of last year, <Col N="1289" /> have tried to move the British Government away from the position it holds. I understand the arguments about the case. That is why we gave the British Government a year to consider the reports. Originally the reports of British-Irish Rights Watch and Amnesty International were preliminary but detailed. Those in the public domain are detailed but the British Government has even more comprehensive reports which are not in the public domain. In our view the cases of Rosemary Nelson, Robert Hamill and Pat Finucane fall into the same category. I am not saying they are the only ones but for the last year or so we have taken those three cases as deserving compelling examination. We have not sought a full public inquiry in the Rosemary Nelson case yet because of the examinations taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the significance of the three cases to which he has referred is that they cannot be viewed in isolation but form part of the issue of the lack of confidence building measures in Northern Ireland? Has the Taoiseach conveyed to the British Prime Minister the necessity to expedite the British decision making process so that a clear, explicit and transparent inquiry can be undertaken to deal with the very serious allegations which have been made about the murder of Pat Finucane? Has he conveyed that the positive outcome of such an inquiry could lead to a change in attitude across the spectrum in Northern Ireland which would break the current logjam with regard to the main issue, which is the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. We have stressed the importance of these cases. The Prime Minister is aware of them, as is the Secretary of State. The British-Irish Rights Watch report and the Amnesty International report both argue that these are the most compelling reports they have ever written. This is particularly so with regard to the Pat Finucane case which they have spent seven or eight years researching. The people who have been involved in this work are international experts and none of them is Irish. There is a very strong case to be made. Much of the information regarding the cases is in the public domain and much is not. Time will show that the cases are even stronger than can be seen from the information which is in the public domain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Why will they not agree to a public inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Government position is that no inquiry will take place while its investigations are ongoing. I think the Deputy shares my view that, while I accept the British Government's view on the Rosemary Nelson case which happened little more than a year ago, I do not accept its view on the other two cases, partic<Col N="1290" /> ularly the Pat Finucane case. The British Government has had the latest reports for four or five weeks and they are being examined. I have been urging the British Prime Minister to come to a conclusion on these latest and final reports. They are as conclusive as anyone in this House would need, that a public inquiry is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach seen a copy of the British security forces investigation reports on the Pat Finucane murder? Is he satisfied that there is<i> prima facie</i> evidence of security forces collusion in this murder and does he agree, as a general proposition, that if there is<i> prima facie</i> evidence of security forces collusion in murders of any kind there should be, as a matter of principle, a public sworn inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not seen the British security reports on any of these cases. I have seen the Amnesty International reports and the British-Irish Rights Watch reports. It is not for me to say whether there is a <i>prima facie </i>case. However, in the view of all of us who have looked at the more detailed reports and of the people from Amnesty International and British-Irish Rights Watch, there is a compelling case to answer, and the only way this case can be answered and the data regarding allegations against the security forces compiled is by a public inquiry. Over the years, it has not been alleged that the security forces were directly involved but rather that there were elements of collusion in one form or other. The three cases are different but there are marked similarities. This is what the international human rights people have brought to the fore.</P>
      <P>In reply to the last part of the Deputy's question, I have come to the conclusion that the only way this matter will ever be resolved in by a public inquiry. I have come to this conclusion having read the data and listened to the Finucane family. I have been convinced, not so much by the emotion which the family brings to the matter as by the data surrounding it. The question will never be answered by a committee. In the United States where congressional hearings have been held on these matters, even those who would not normally take up the Irish cause are unanimously of the view that a public inquiry is necessary. From the British Government's perspective therefore and from what Deputy Quinn said the only way to dispel the mistrust is to hold a public inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not entirely understand the reason the Taoiseach is unable to say that he is of the opinion that there is <i>prima facie </i>evidence of security forces collusion. I assume there would have to be a grave matter of that nature for him to have made the call for a sworn public inquiry. Does he agree that while one accepts that he might not be qualified as a lawyer to say whether there is <i>prima facie </i>evidence, his legal services are fully qualified to decide? Is the Attorney General, who I assume has been asked by the Taoiseach to read all the papers, satisfied that there is <Col N="1291" /><i>prima facie </i>evidence of security forces collusion on the evidence already produced in the case of the murder of Pat Finucane?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the information gathered in the report of British-Irish Rights Watch, presented to the Secretary of State and the accuracy of which I cannot stand over. The Attorney General has been involved in some of the meetings I have attended about some of these cases. We believe there is a case to answer. The British Government has had the first report for more than a year and the other for five or six weeks. I can only take the facts as presented; I cannot prove what has been said by those who it seems were agents during certain periods. The only body which can do so is British intelligence. All the groups involved and the previous Secretary of State believe that what is stated in the reports seems to be relatively factual. It is under investigation, but not by a sworn tribunal. That is the only way we will get to the end of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts produced in these reports are either factual or they are not; they are not relatively factual. Has the British Secretary of State admitted or contested any of the facts in these reports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Government has neither contested nor replied to them. It has said that until its investigations are complete it is not prepared to hold a full sworn public inquiry. There is no certainty; we do not have the facts as to what happened on the day. For example, it is still disputed that there were helicopters overhead on the day Rosemary Nelson was killed by a car bomb. I hope something will come from the latest arrests but the facts are disputed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the disputation of the veracity of facts either in relation to Rosemary Nelson or Pat Finucane, has the British Government during the numerous discussions it has had with the Irish Government on this issue and, specifically, the necessity for a public inquiry, recognised the link between these two incidents and, specifically, Pat Finucane's murder and the overall confidence climate within which progress can be made in Northern Ireland? Has it indicated at any stage, whatever the process of inquiry might be, that it recognises that this is not an isolated incident independent of the general political process, that it is a constituent part of confidence building in Northern Ireland and, if so, what precisely did it say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Government acknowledges the importance of these cases in terms of confidence in the RUC and the security forces. They would like to progress them to a stage where they would satisfy the people concerned. Our view, the view of the human rights groups, the Government and most of the parties <Col N="1292" /> in the North is that the only way that will be done is by a public inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When will that inquiry be completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will realise that one of those has gone on for the better part of ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's reply with particular reference to the case of Mr. Pat Finucane and the acceptance by the Government that, to quote the Taoiseach, the case for a public inquiry is compelling, will the Taoiseach agree that two important facets of any inquiry, particularly this one given the timescale involved in the investigation of the Finucane case, are independence and an international element? Does the Taoiseach agree that an inquiry of whatever hue will only bring about the transparent result which is sought if it contains an international and an independent element?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly independence is important. As we will be aware from the Bloody Sunday tribunal, perhaps some local people may be acceptable but certainly it must be independent.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> When the Taoiseach met the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and discussed the need for an inquiry into the murder of Mr. Pat Finucane, did he ask him whether he was in possession of information from the British security forces, as opposed to civil rights or other groups, that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case that there was involvement by some arm of the security forces or some rogue elements of the security forces? Did he ask the Prime Minister whether he had that information and, if so, what was the response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer from British Prime Ministers and Ministers to that question is always that they do not discuss their security reports.</P>

      <P>On Wednesday, 15 March, on arrival in Los Angeles from Australia, I met Mr. Michael Flores, the Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the State of California. We discussed issues relating to the development of a memorandum of understanding with California, as a follow on from the very successful meeting I had with the Governor of California, Mr. Gray Davis, in Dublin last October. At my meeting with Mr. Flores, we discussed the idea of setting up a small high level group to formulate a strategy for the development of stronger links in specific areas, including education and research in leading edge areas between Ireland and California.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In Washington on Thursday, 16 March I attended the Speaker's lunch on Capitol Hill before attending a meeting with the House International Relations Committee, chaired by Congressman Ben Gilman. That evening, at the Ireland Fund Dinner, I had the opportunity of acknowledging the tremendous contribution which over the past two decades the American Ireland Fund has made to this island. I also took the opportunity to pay tribute to Senator Mitchell and President Clinton, for their outstanding contributions to the peace process.</P>
      <P>On St. Patrick's Day, I attended a breakfast at the State Department, hosted by the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright. I was accompanied by my colleagues, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs. <i>Inter alia</i>, I raised the question of renewed military attacks in East Timor and by militias, as I did also at the European Council meeting in Lisbon. Later on St. Patrick's Day at the White House I presented President Clinton with the now traditional gift of shamrock.</P>
      <P>I had lunch that day with the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board where we had a detailed discussion on developments in the Irish economy, particularly with reference to e-commerce developments in Ireland and the European MediaLab initiative.</P>
      <P>As is now customary, President Clinton hosted a major reception at the White House that evening. Similar to previous years, the events in Washington hosted by President Clinton and his administration facilitated various meetings and discussions both formal and informal including with leaders and representatives of the Northern Ireland parties.</P>
      <P>In my telephone conversation with the British Prime Minister on 1 March last we agreed that there should be an intensive process of consultation in the run up to the St. Patrick's Day period. In this regard, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland had a number of useful meetings over that period with the main parties in Northern Ireland, including a round table meeting with all the pro-Agreement parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear there is no easy solution to the current difficulties. The only way forward is through dialogue and agreement. The second anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement is not far away, a fact we were all conscious of in our discussions in Washington. The consultations leading up to and over the St. Patrick's Day period provided a good opportunity for all of us to step back and consider all that is at stake in this process, to look again at all the progress we have made and reflect on the most productive options for moving forward to the early restoration of the suspended institutions in the context of implementation of all aspects of the Agreement. This was also what I had in mind in my speech at the University of New South Wales. After those meetings, and after the events in Washington, it is clear that all the parties are committed to the Agreement and want its full <Col N="1297" /> implementation. All of the parties want to see the earliest possible restoration of the institutions with their inclusive cross-community mode of operation. What remains to be dealt with is the issue of trust which has been at the heart of all the difficulties in this process that we have been through over the years. We must continue to work on this, to get all of the parties to provide the necessary reassurances, including that violence is not an option and that democratic inclusivity is the only way forward. This was very much the message of President Clinton in Washington.</P>
    <P>I met the British Prime Minister on the margins of the EU Summit in Lisbon last week where we focused on the need to intensify our efforts to move the process forward.</P>
    <P>Clearly, there are challenges still for everyone. What we must do is set these issues in the wider context of an overall agenda of trust and confidence building. People on all sides have come a long way. This must be acknowledged, as the courage they have shown, including by David Trimble last Saturday, must be acknowledged. We are in a very different situation now than we were before the process began. However, work has still to be done to address people's fears and insecurities on all sides. The value of being able to do this in a peaceful environment is inestimable. Further intensive efforts are now needed in the period up to Easter, with the full and active engagement of the two Governments and all the pro-Agreement parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said dialogue and agreement are necessary. In that context will he agree that the outcome of the UUP council meeting last Saturday will make it far more difficult to restore the institutions? With this in mind is it acceptable for the Irish and British Governments to consult various persons in the Nationalist or republican family? Would the Taoiseach recommend further consultation with aspects of the Unionist family who feel, as they stated at last Saturday's meeting, outside the events and developments and who would feel better if they were included to a greater degree? Would the Taoiseach see this as a possibility in consultation with the leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that last Saturday's result was disappointing in so far as it was not what Mr. Trimble or his leadership group required from the meeting. The vote was more or less the same as it was in November for and against the Agreement and if people reflect on it a few days on, that is what is thought more by Mr. Trimble and others. Perhaps to expect a higher vote was not that realistic but there is no doubt that it makes the position more difficult and that is everybody's assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two Governments began this morning in Belfast with the Northern Ireland officials and this involved Mr. Blair's officials going through <Col N="1298" /> what we agreed last week, examining all the aspects of the Good Friday Agreement which have not yet been completed and drawing up a programme to deal with those issues. Some of them are easy, some difficult and some have proved impossible so far. However, over the next ten days or so, we hope to take each one, and try to reach an understanding on how they can be implemented, a realistic timetable and the obstacles envisaged.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, we can clear up most of these issues, although there will be some debate around all of them. We will still come back to the issues of decommissioning, the Patten report and a few more issues which are difficult. We made progress on the criminal justice Bill and equality issues in the past few weeks in meetings which the Minister for Foreign Affairs had with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I had with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair. We must do that in the first phase.</P>
    <P>The second phase will be to see what support we can win from all the parties. That will come down to the inevitable few difficulties still there. The view of the two Governments and the pro-Agreements parties which have spoken to me is that for the third year in a row we should set Easter as a period in which to try to make progress. It is difficult to see how we can square the circles around the few aspects that have defeated our efforts since last year but there is an impetus to keep on trying and that is what I am committed to doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should get all the parties around the table very quickly. Parties are retreating from previous concessions as long as time remains and they are apart from one another. The only way to get them back into a mode of compromise is to have them around the table with the two Governments having the same policy on all key questions. What is the policy of the Government in regard to decommissioning and when should it occur? What is its view on the conditions that should be fulfilled for the suspension of the institutions to be lifted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said to Deputy Sargent, the two Governments are trying to come to a joint agreement on all the issues. The position of the Government on decommissioning and related matters has not changed. We would like to see progress today and certainly by 22 May. That is also the view of the British Government. We <Col N="1299" /> have no problem agreeing those issues on the same front but we are realistic and we know that there is not a hope of us achieving that objective. That is the view of all the pro-Agreement parties and the two Governments. We are not getting any support for that position. All the efforts we made in Castle Buildings this week last year, when we almost had agreement on an act of reconciliation and some other matters, failed because republicans could not deliver. Again in Castle Buildings nine months ago this week when republicans appeared to be moving the Unionists could not handle that, and then there was the Mitchell Review, which started in September, and lasted 11 weeks. At the end of the review, George Mitchell stated that he believed the conditions for disarmament now existed. That position has not held. All of these positions, which we strongly support, have not succeeded. The two Governments can state our positions but we also have to be realistic and state positions on which we believe we can get agreement. Mr. Trimble was brave enough in Washington &ndash; I want to praise him for that &ndash; to state that his party and his leadership were prepared to move to try to find a way on which it is possible to seek agreement. I would love to be able to tell Deputy Bruton and the rest of the House that I see a way of achieving that but I do not at the moment. We have to try to find a way of dealing with this issue.</P>
      <P>On the suspension of the institutions, in the context of trying to get agreement on the matters over which there is disagreement, we still believe we should try to get the suspension of the institutions lifted. Equally, we are realistic enough to know that the only way that will happen is if we can get agreement by the parties. We will not be able to do that unless we get agreement on the outstanding issues which now include the Patten report as well as decommissioning.</P>
      <P>In summary, we have to reach a position where the two Governments can agree on all the issues and then see if we can build a consensus among all the pro-Agreement parties, big and small, around those issues. If that involves round table meetings, I have no difficulty with that but I would just say to Deputy Bruton that in terms of what has been indicated to me in the past 72 hours, and last week, I will meet the loyalist parties shortly. I will meet the Women's Coalition. The Alliance Party has had a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I will meet David Trimble in Dublin by the weekend, and I believe the SDLP is here today. We will seek to try to build support around what the two Governments put together over the next ten days or so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Specifically on Question No. 20, the Taoiseach made a comprehensive speech in the University of New South Wales in which he indicated that it was his intention to try to establish an agreement across all of the parties in Northern Ireland that a return to armed conflict was no longer an acceptable option. If the Taoiseach was accurately quoted, and I believe he was, has he <Col N="1300" /> had any response from either the republican movement or any of the loyalist groups to that invitation to a declaration of progress? If not, and I suspect that is the case, will the Taoiseach, on this platform alone, attempt to establish, with the British Government, that a return to armed conflict is not a political or an operational option? Can that limited degree of progress be established and, if so, does the Taoiseach believe, in support of what Deputy Bruton has said, that a round table of all of the parties including, if necessary, the parties in this House, would be helpful in bringing parties back to the centre of compromise, from which they seem to be retreating, in order to establish, as a minimum, that a return to armed conflict is not an option for any of the political parties, particularly political parties that have paramilitary wings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make one general point first in reply to Deputy Quinn. We have always said that the Good Friday Agreement is a balanced accommodation and that it is not possible for each party to be entirely happy with every position of the Agreement but everyone has to live together in peace on the island. We cannot allow a situation to develop where parties on one side or another return to the zones of the most intransigent elements of their constituencies. It was in that spirit that I said we should at least try to agree on certain points, and the Deputy has correctly taken the point I was making in that speech. It is not possible in the short-term to do something unless people respond in a voluntary way to the dynamics or lack of dynamics &ndash; as is the case this week &ndash; of the situation. Other than that, there is not anything either Government or any party can do to get movement on the arms issue on either the loyalist or republican side. On that basis, we should, at least, construct the safety ground and establish the certainty, if not that decommissioning will happen, then that guns will remain truly silent, and that people are moving on the democratic path, although slowly. I raised these issues in Washington with the parties. As the Deputy correctly anticipated, I have not had a response. However, it can be taken with certainty that we will develop these points in what we are now trying to do with the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will be quite a number of bilateral talks first. I would like to cut that circuit and get straight to the all-party talks. However, unfortunately, I am very much in the hands of what the pro-Agreement parties will settle for in this regard. Until we have some basis on which to build something, it will probably not be very productive.</P>

        <b>:</b> I want to diverge slightly from the issue of the discussions the Taoiseach had in the United States on Northern <Col N="1301" /> Ireland.

      <P>I do not know &ndash; and I do not know if Deputy Bruton knows &ndash; whose guns they are. I have seen the statements by the various people who have condemned them. I can only answer the question the Deputy asked me about whether the IRA ceasefire holds, which I believe it does. Some of the attacks we have seen in recent weeks, were certainly by dissident groups &ndash; some of the arrests were of dissident group members, and&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has also been a number of loyalist killings, which seem to be more criminally related than to do with the so-called Troubles. However, I condemn all those killings. I was critical here of the Sinn Féin leadership a few weeks ago on this matter, but it has been trying hard on the ground to stop these punishment <Col N="1302" /> beatings and to persuade people to stop them. It was very successful in doing that six or nine months ago. I hope its influence holds. I am sure Deputy Bruton is aware that these matters are not as certain in parts of Nationalist areas as they were even a year ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is everybody's admission. I condemn all punishment beatings. On the other question &ndash; I will have a better assessment of that. The parties believe some initiatives should be developed first. We can have a round table meeting at any time as we had just a few weeks ago with the Secretary of State and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Cowen. As for a meeting involving both the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair and me, or a meeting at a more substantial level, we would need more than we have currently, to warrant such a meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister of the UK should become involved but that we need dynamics in the process. If people are apart they will listen only to their own constituents who will urge them to greater intransigence. We need to rekindle a spirit of compromise. That can best be achieved where people are in the same building together for reasonably long periods of time and are required to listen to one another and to the concerns of their antagonist constituents rather than just to the concerns of their own people. A focus for dynamic in the process is currently lacking. While I fully accept that the Taoiseach should not necessarily become involved in an expectation-raising exercise with the British Prime Minister, does he agree that the Secretary of State and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, both of whom are well able to handle these matters, should be given a week together as soon as possible with all of the parties to see how much they can achieve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought Deputy Bruton was talking about me and the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair having a meeting. There is no difficulty. The Secretary of Stage and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have had two meetings in recent weeks and there is no difficulty whatsoever with that. However, even when we get them all there, it does not necessarily create the dynamic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that the impression has been created, inadvertently or otherwise, since the suspension of the institutions in Northern Ireland that the firm purpose of resolve and unity that characterised the relation<Col N="1303" /> ship between the British and Irish Governments had somehow been relaxed, divided or reduced? Would he accept that there is an imperative for the two Governments to be clearly seen to be<i> ad idem</i> in their resolve to relaunch these talks and in that context the question of decommissioning remains an integral part of the Good Friday Agreement? Would he accept that while impressions may have been inadvertently given by representatives of the Irish Government that we were no longer as committed as we were in the past to decommissioning, this House regards decommissioning, along with all the other elements of the Good Friday Agreement, as an integral part of a complex and balanced set of arrangements? Can he confirm that the British and Irish Governments are working together at all levels to present a united front to relaunch these talks from the impasse in which they are currently locked?</P>

      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is definitely so, and has been all along. There were some difficulties about the 11 February position but recriminations on that are long past. We are now engaged in looking at all aspects and in coming up with what we believe will be a fair and balanced settlement, a fair accommodation, as the Good Friday Agreement is, and we can then try to win support for it from the other parties. I do not want to make it seem an enormous exercise. There are probably only ten issues outstanding, six of which require much work. We can complete our review within about ten days and then consider the position. We will come back to the same two issues. However, since we have not done an audit on the Agreement for a long time, the two Governments can complete such a document and then we can try to win support from the other parties.</P>
      <P>Even though last Saturday might have given rise to pessimism, the view of all the parties is that the will of the people is the main issue. The will of the people is for implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. It is not like any other document or any other effort over the past 30 years involved in trying to achieve peace. This time the people voted, and as I continually quote to the parties in the North, they also told me at the time that no other document in Northern Ireland had been read or questioned so closely, nor was any other so clearly understood. On the basis that over 70% of the people in the North voted for it and 96% voted for it in the South, the will of the people has to be implemented. That is what people voted for, so I cannot cherry-pick the document. It refers to all aspects and people have to implement all aspects even if some imagination and some dynamic has to be put into trying to interpret how some of those things should be done. That is what we are engaged in now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that he has provided a significant elaboration of the Government's position this afternoon in indicating that, in his view, the outstanding issues <Col N="1304" /> include the Patten report as well as decommissioning, and that that is a matter to be discussed between the parties? Will the Taoiseach assure the House that while these issues of policing should be discussed, it would be very difficult if the details of the Patten report were to become the subject of political negotiation, in the sense that this would create such a large number of obstacles, arising from the detail of Patten, as to make the process virtually interminable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to be clear on all these matters. The section of the Good Friday Agreement dealing with policing says that an international commission should be set up. That was done and the commission has reported. We will be having discussions on that. The Irish Government's position &ndash; the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland made it clear the other day &ndash; is for the implementation of the Patten Commission's report. The legislative programme has to take into account all aspects, including staffing, pensions and other issues. We want to see all of them implemented as we do all the other aspects. We are talking about the implementation of the Patten report because that is part of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86, 87, 89 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to deal with a number of matters relating to the White Paper on Defence and to inform the House of the further positive developments in the Defence Forces arising from the White Paper. I regret, however, that some of the questions continue to focus on matters relating to the White Paper process rather than on the content. Many newspaper articles concerning the White Paper on Defence have appeared in the recent past and among these I was quoted as saying that I regard these matters as closed.</P>
      <P>The question, however, gives me a further opportunity to inform the Deputies concerned that no such departmental memorandum as that mentioned in the question exists. When I launched the first ever White Paper on Defence I made three very important points, namely, that the White Paper on Defence provided for the most significant development of the Defence Forces ever undertaken &ndash; it set out a framework for an unprecedented additional investment initiative totalling £250 million over the next decade, which will transform the Defence Forces into a world-class military organisation; that the White Paper proposed a very modest reduction in PDF strength which is necessary to develop an affordable, sustainable, world-class military organisation; and that any suggestion that the Defence Forces were not adequately consulted was completely without foundation. On the contrary, the entire thrust of the White Paper is based on the Government's acceptance of the requirement for a major programme of capital investment put forward by the military authorities as their number one priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated when I published the White Paper on Defence, my main objective is to ensure that <Col N="1306" /> the State has available at all times flexible, well equipped and well trained Defence Forces, including an appropriate reserve to meet the roles laid down by Government. I am totally committed to developing the Defence Forces into a world-class military organisation, and this White Paper sets out a comprehensive programme for such development for the next decade.</P>
    <P>Under the White Paper, the capacity of the Defence Forces will be greatly enhanced. Although the White Paper has just been launched, I have already announced the most substantial programme of investment in new equipment for the Defence Forces that has ever occurred.</P>
    <P>The day after the White Paper was published I announced a major investment programme for the Air Corps, with £55 million being provided over three years for new aircraft. The following week I announced that agreement in principle had been reached for the purchase of a second offshore patrol vessel similar to the LE <i>Róisín, </i>which will cost in excess of £20 million.</P>
    <P>During my recent visit to our UNIFIL troops in south Lebanon, I announced a multi-million pound investment programme for the Army, estimated at £25 million. I have also instructed that arrangements to recruit an additional 750 personnel to the Defence Forces be commenced immediately. A recruitment campaign will commence early next month.</P>
    <P>In the past four weeks I have announced investment in new equipment totalling at least £100 million. This investment is in addition to the £40 million that I already set aside for the purchase of 40 armoured personnel carriers. All that represents a morale-boosting £140 million for re-equipping the Defence Forces, announced in less than six months. Can the Opposition really be serious when they criticise my performance and assert that morale in the Defence Forces is low?</P>
    <P>Investment of this scale merely confirms what I have indicated to the House in the past few months, namely, that the White Paper represents a serious response by the Government to a sustained case advanced by the military authorities to the Taoiseach, myself and officials of my Department. The case for re-equipment was overwhelming and it has been accepted.</P>
    <P>The Government was serious when it said it was going to develop the Defence Forces into a world-class military organisation. We have allocated the funding that this ambitious project will require. I put particular emphasis on communications and consultation, and I regard it as very important that the representative associations, RACO, PDFORRA and RDFRA, will continue to have the opportunity to make their input to the development of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I met with the representative associations immediately prior to the launch of the White Paper. As Deputies are aware, a dedicated conciliation and arbitration unit is in place in my Department and at any time consultations with the representative associations are ongoing on a <Col N="1307" /> whole range of issues. Meetings will take place as necessary to deal with relevant White Paper implementation matters. The representative associations can of course raise any matter of concern falling within the scope of representation at any time, and I would always encourage them to do so.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also recognises the important role of the Naval Service in maintaining sovereignty at sea. A primary activity of the Naval Service is the implementation of European Union fishery policies. Substantial funding was provided by the EU towards the acquisition of five of the eight Naval Service vessels. The White Paper sets out proposals for the better utilisation of these assets.</P>
    <P>For the future, the White Paper commits the Government to the maintenance of an eight ship flotilla, which is a very significant commitment within overall defence provisions. As already stated, I recently announced the decision to acquire a second offshore patrol vessel similar to the recently commissioned LE <i>Róisín.</i>The final text of the White Paper will be published in the very near future. As I have informed the House already, the text, agreed with the military authorities, will reflect the fully up-to-date position based on the final inputs which I obtained from the Chief of Staff, together with any necessary typographical or presentational editing. The final phase of the proof-reading and layout processes will be concluded shortly and the text will then be immediately sent to the printers.</P>
    <P>However, due to the widespread public interest in the White Paper, I have arranged for the final text version to be placed on my Department's website where interested parties may consult it as they require.</P>
    <P>It would be less than honest of me not to acknowledge that the final stages of preparation of the White Paper did not run as smoothly as I would have wished. Unfortunately, some commentary was less than well balanced. The resulting commotion distracted from and devalued the impact and developmental nature of the White Paper. At the time I criticised those irresponsible people who could not see the dangers of trying to drive a wedge between a Minister and a group of public servants. Undoubtedly the White Paper will present many challenges to the Defence Forces. However, substantial change and reorganisation has been successfully carried out by the Defence Forces in recent years and the Government has every confidence the Defence Forces will rise to meet the challenge of completing the necessary reform process.</P>
    <P>The White Paper provides a unique opportunity for the Defence Forces and the future of the Army, Naval Service, Air Corps and the reserve will be fully secured. There are many challenges in the White Paper for the Defence Forces, but I have every confidence they will rise to meet the challenge of completing the reform process outlined in the White Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It was unfortunate that what should have been a golden opportunity for the future development of the Defence Forces deteriorated into a lack of trust on both sides. Today is the first day the Minister has acknowledged there were problems and perhaps that offers some hope for the future in that he is being realistic about the difficulties involved. I asked about a memorandum which was described as an internal Department document. Katie Hannon wrote in <i>The Examiner</i> that this document was written in the Department of Defence and that it was very disparaging about the changes the Chief of Staff negotiated. The Minister has just said no such memo exists. Does any such document exist in the Minister's Department? Does it in any way reflect the Minister's view on the matter? Where did this story originate?</P>
      <P>When exactly will the White Paper be published? Will it incorporate all the changes negotiated between the Minister and the Chief of Staff? Also, what action is the Minister taking to address the issues which arose in the final stages of the White Paper in particular, but also throughout the process, which showed such distrust and other problems between the civil and military sides? What action has the Minister taken to address these issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper will be sent to the printers in the next few days and will be published in its final form in a little over two weeks. It will contain all the elements agreed with the Chief of Staff, as I have outlined on many occasions.</P>
      <P>Immediately after the Government decision was taken I had a series of meetings with senior military personnel. I have described the circumstances on a number of occasions since &ndash; they were extremely workmanlike, calm and dedicated. I have no hesitation in saying we are back on track and working to put into effect the many measures contained in the White Paper. As I indicated in my reply, the recent announcement of funding for a new aircraft and patrol vessel and for military equipment &ndash; as requested by the military &ndash; has obviously been a telling factor in demonstrating the essence of what was contained in the White Paper and the Government's determination to meet the priorities set out by the Defence Forces but which had been impossible to put in place.</P>
      <P>No memorandum or document of that kind exists. It does not represent any comprehensive view in my Department about the military. I said at the time there were aspects which reflected my views about the way certain things happened at that time, but I have consigned that to the past. I am happy that the relationship between me, the Chief of Staff and the officials of my Department is excellent. I look forward to seeing the many proposals of the White Paper come to fruition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that he met the representative bodies prior to publication of the <Col N="1309" /> White Paper. I understand those meetings took place the day of publication or the previous day and there were more briefing meetings than consultations. The Minister should clear up this point.</P>
      <P>During an Adjournment debate the Minister said he had an excellent and positive meeting with the two assistant chiefs of staff. Was that view reflected in his visit to the Lebanon with the Chief of Staff and is the Chief of Staff now on-side regarding the future of the Defence Forces?</P>
      <P>Also, if my memory is correct, at one stage I read a newspaper report that the Minister was going to hold an investigation regarding the memorandum Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned. I find it difficult to accept now that there was no such memorandum, given my recollection that the Minister was going to hold an investigation to determine who processed the memorandum or where it originated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wall is correct. Following media reports I said there would be an investigation. The following day the Chief of Staff was away and I met the deputy chiefs of staff and had further meetings with Department officials. There were three or four investigations at that time into various leaks and one was being conducted by the Defence Forces. The meeting itself was a transformation; it was businesslike and wanted to consign the matter to the past and I felt it eminently judicious to indicate that the Defence Forces investigation of various leaks should end and the other would not begin so that matters could start absolutely anew. That was the position.</P>
      <P>Regarding the work with the Chief of Staff in the Lebanon, let the media and those who were there speak for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">

      <P>The Chief of Staff was present at one of the interviews I gave and in regard to the announcement I made he said it was a day they had been waiting for for years. The Deputy should have no doubt about that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultative process enabled the representative bodies to make their own detailed submissions. They then asked for further time to make oral submissions, which I granted but which delayed the publication of the White Paper. I had two meetings with PDFORRA and one with RACO before publication of the White Paper. The representative associations are resourceful and hard nosed. They know when they go over the time. At times Opposition Members may be attracted to meeting their every whimper and try<Col N="1310" /> ing to pamper them, but they know themselves when they are over the top.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister plan a two-tier Naval Service in future? The White Paper states that some vessels will be manned and equipped primarily for fishery protection duties. Does this mean that the manning levels on those ships will be reduced? Does it mean the ships may not have a main armament or gun? Does the Minister agree that the lack of a main gun effectively reduces the authority of the Naval Service and the sovereignty of the State at sea? Is it true that almost half of the engineering officer establishment has resigned, that only 16 engineering officers remain and that further resignations are pending? If so, what are the Minister's plans in this regard and how soon will the vacancies be filled? When was the most recent engineering inspection of naval ships carried out? Are those ships now at risk due to a lack of inspection and because a high number of trained personnel has resigned and has not been replaced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In a sense, inexplicable fears have been expressed within the Naval Service about the contents of the White Paper. I deeply regret that as I would not have devised a White Paper which, in the first instance, expressed the Government's wishes and determination to purchase new ships, something which had not happened for 14 years&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister planning a two-tier system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government wanted to ensure that the Naval Service had the best possible equipment. The White Paper refers to the Naval Service's &ldquo;primary function&rdquo;, but all its other functions such as drug interdiction will be carried out as usual. The White Paper does not propose the slightest change to the Naval Service's current functions, in spite of the rumours which have been circulated and the unfounded allegations which have been made.</P>
      <P>I state categorically that we will not have a two-tier Naval Service, and senior Naval Service personnel are well aware of that. There may be some changes in the new circumstances, due to modern technology and changing systems, in the number of people who will serve on any particular ship. However, all these matters will be negotiated with the Naval Service and its functions will be carried out within its manpower requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people want to pretend that the resignation of some officers is occurring due to a level of uncertainty about the Naval Service's future. <Col N="1311" /> That is an unrealistic view given that, for the first time in 14 years, the Government is ploughing money into the purchase of new ships. Engineering officers and other officers with particular skills are either reaching retirement age or are being drawn into other positions in the economy for which they can obtain a higher level of remuneration than we can provide. That loss of expertise is regrettable. I have instructed the Naval Service to use every device at its disposal, even to go abroad if necessary, to recruit, commission, upgrade and up-skill staff to ensure we have a fully fledged, eight ship flotilla which will perform all the functions it has performed heretofore without diminution. The White Paper outlines the Naval Service's primary task, a task which is not denied by anyone.</P>

      <P>I want to clarify the Minister's comments in regard to the internal document referred to earlier. The newspaper report in question contains detailed quotes, apparently about the Minister's attitude or that of his departmental officials to the White Paper process and particularly in regard to the manner in which members of the Defence Forces conducted themselves. The Minister stated that this document does not exist. Am I to understand that a freedom of information request, for example, would not result in the production of any document containing the quotes which appeared in <i>The Examiner</i> report with which I am sure the Minister is familiar? Has the Minister taken action in regard to this report? Is he satisfied it does not reflect a prevailing attitude within the Department? I am not returning to this issue merely to trawl over issues unnecessarily but to clarify whether the content of this newspaper report is in any way indicative of a departmental attitude. The Minister stated that it is not and I welcome that. From where did the story and these detailed quotes come? The article refers to an &ldquo;internal document seen by <i>The Examiner</i>.&rdquo;. What document? Where is the document or is it, as the Minister stated, a complete fabrication?</P>

      <P>The fundamental point stressed over and over again by the military authorities and the representative associations related to equipment. No parallel can be found in any past Government to the manner in which this Administration has approached this issue, as confirmed by recent announcements. The primary aim of the <Col N="1312" /> representative associations was met 100% and I am sure even they may have been surprised by the rapidity with which that was achieved. All representative associations approach matters from their own perspectives but, in the final analysis, it is the Government that must make decisions.</P>
      <P>I already answered the question put to me by Deputy Fitzgerald. Some of the content of the article in question does not in any way represent the views of my departmental officials on the military authorities. My Department is unique in that it deals with both civil and military issues and, for the most part, it works very well with the military authorities. It is true that some tensions and differences of opinion existed in regard to the White Paper, but those have been ironed out and consigned to the past and we are now moving forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Who is responsible for the Civil Defence? It is normal for the Minister for Defence to delegate this responsibility to the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach. Has the Minister done that or does he retain responsibility for the Civil Defence? Who made the decision to relocate to Roscrea and on what grounds was Roscrea chosen? Some 46 submissions were received during the compilation of the White Paper, 13 of which related directly to the Civil Defence. Did any of those submissions indicate that it would be desirable for the Civil Defence headquarters to be moved from Dublin to Roscrea? I understand that up to 30 people work in the headquarters and that this dedicated group of people has built up a certain rapport with voluntary organisations throughout the country. Does the Minister agree it is unlikely that any of these people will seek relocation to Roscrea and that, in effect, the organisation will have to be disbanded and reconstituted? How, on <Col N="1313" /> a Friday evening, will volunteers who traditionally take the train to the headquarters in Dublin for weekend courses get to Roscrea? Perhaps the Minister will address these questions in the context of the national development plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not profess to lecture Deputy Timmins on geography. However, he will be aware that Roscrea is far more central to most areas of the country than Dublin. There are train and bus services to Roscrea, just as there are to Dublin. My Department has been inundated with applications from civil servants to transfer to the country. Substantially more civil servants than necessary, of all grades, have applied for transfer to Roscrea. I will not allow Deputy Timmins to denigrate my home town in this House.</P>
      <P>The previous Government clearly spelled out that there would be no further decentralisation. This Government is taking a different approach. Deputy Timmins has to worry not only about the transfer of the Civil Defence to Roscrea but about later announcements of decentralisation which will be considerably more substantial.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91, 136, 147, 161, 211 and 219 together.</P>
      <P>On 20 March 2000 I, with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, attended the meeting of the General Affairs Council in Brussels. On 28 February 2000 I attended an informal meeting of EU Defence Ministers at Sintra in Portugal.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the Helsinki European Council in December 1999 agreed on a voluntary target for establishing capabilities for the Petersberg Tasks. This target, known as a headline goal which member states aim to meet by the year 2003, involves the ability to deploy 50,000 to 60,000 personnel within 60 days and to sustain that deployment for one year. This would roughly equate to a mission of a scale comparable to that of KFOR in Kosovo. As there were no pre-existing structures within the EU which deal with military capabilities, the General Affairs Council, with participation as appropriate by Defence Ministers of the 15 member states of the EU, was tasked to progress the elaboration of this target and to develop a method of consultation through which the target could be met and maintained and progress reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council, at the meeting on 20 March, considered the issue of capabilities for the Petersberg <Col N="1315" /> Tasks. The Council also discussed progress in follow-up to Helsinki, addressing both the military and civilian tracks of the issue. In addition to considering a draft Presidency progress report to the Lisbon European Council, the General Affairs Council considered the way forward for elaborating the headline and capability goals set at Helsinki. The Council also considered the establishment of a committee for civilian crisis management, with a view to reaching a decision on the establishment of such a committee by the European Council in June.</P>
    <P>What Helsinki agreed on was a capabilities target. As the Helsinki European Council Conclusions make clear, this does not imply the creation of a European army. Nor does it alter the fact that participation in the Petersberg Tasks under the Treaty of Amsterdam is on a voluntary basis and is a matter for sovereign decision in each and every case. The General Affairs Council will take forward work on developing methods of consultation through which the headline goal can be met and through which national contributions reflecting political will and commitment can be defined by each member state. Deputy Higgins asked whether there are any proposals for the establishment of a rapid reaction unit in the Defence Forces. The answer is no. Participation by any member state will be entirely voluntary as individual missions may arise. The informal meeting in Sintra, Portugal also discussed the issue of the Petersberg Tasks. Since the meeting was informal in nature no decisions were taken.</P>
    <P>The White Paper sets out a comprehensive examination of the roles of the Defence Forces. One of these roles is to participate in multinational peace support, crisis management and humanitarian relief operations in support of the United Nations and under UN mandate, including regional security missions authorised by the UN. The overall approach to the participation by the Defence Forces in overseas peace support operations, including those that may arise in the context of developments in the EU, is contained in chapter six of the White Paper. The White Paper recognises that Ireland is a significant contributor to such overseas operations and Ireland will continue to participate at a significant level.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the White Paper for the restructuring of the Defence Forces will ensure that Ireland is in a position to meet the challenges and opportunities of the emerging defence and security environment. The White Paper provides for a rebalancing of the pay to non-pay expenditure ratio and the reinvestment of these funds, some £20 million a year over the next ten years for new equipment and infrastructure, in addition to the £40 million armoured personnel carrier investment programme. These essential measures will ensure the Defence Forces are equipped to meet the requirements associated with participating in any emerging peace support missions.</P>

      <P>Were documents submitted to the Brussels meeting which outlined a scenario <Col N="1316" /> where Irish troops would form part of a European defence force which would be forced to fight countries with access to nuclear weapons? What  is the Minister's opinion on the establishment of a European military committee which was also discussed at that meeting? Has the Minister discussed with his counterparts the establishment of a rapid deployment force of 60,000 troops? How many troops could Ireland contribute to this force? Has the French Government suggested that 0.7% of GDP should be contributed to military expenditure? Does the Minister agree this is an enormous amount of money and has he given a formal response to the French Government?</P>

My task is to ensure Defence Force equipment is upgraded to enable the Chief of Staff to perform the tasks required of him.

      <P>Is it the case that the capacity for training in the Defence Forces, even with the equipment available to them, has been seriously eroded? Is it not the case that there are very few qualified instructors available to give instruction at the level required, even to train NCOs in the use of the existing equipment? Does the Minister agree he should be very sceptical if the Chief of Staff is saying there will be no difficulty in providing contingents for further tasks when the Defence Forces are already over-stretched in coping with what they are doing?</P>

      <P>As far as our international commitments are concerned, we are over-stretched. If I had not introduced constant recruitment, we would be in significant trouble in terms of meeting our current UN commitments. I hope there will be significant changes in our commitment to UNIFIL in the near future. I received a report from the Chief of Staff three months ago giving a detailed outline of his training arrangements and the upgrading of training in the past three or four years. This did not begin under my Administration; it began under the Deputy's Administration and has improved consistently in the past three or four years. The purchase of equipment, training arrangements and better centralisation of troops has enabled this to take place. However, it must move a grade further. I am happy with the information I received in this regard. There has been a phenomenal reorganisational change in relation to fitness and so on to the benefit of the Defence Forces. This is readily admitted by troops on the ground.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have just returned from a trip to the Middle East where considerable planning is taking place at UN and UNIFIL level on the hopeful prospects of a comprehensive peace settlement in that area. Obviously this will have significant repercussions for us in terms of the numbers of troops required. The hope is that this will happen and if and when it does, it will relieve some of the pressure in maintaining our overall commitments abroad. We are involved in East Timor, Kosova and SFOR. However, we must await developments. My expectation and hope is that in the next couple of years opportunities will arise for significant <Col N="1319" /> deployment from UNIFIL. I can only hope the peace will be comprehensive and will afford me, or the Minister for Defence at the time, the opportunity to make that deployment.</P>

The Irish Navy has not being pursuing perpetrators of serious crime, particularly French and Spanish boats, which have been ramming Irish fishing boats and getting away without any strictures. Can the Minister name one skipper of a French or Spanish boat who has been arrested or charged with ramming? What about the <i>Danny Boy</i> off Castletownbere approximately a year ago? What about the <i>Orchidee</i> which was rammed in international waters with the loss of two lives? No person was brought to trial for those criminal acts, and there were many other such acts. It has been put forward by legal people recently that the Naval Service is entitled to go into the 200 mile zone and pursue these marauders? Why is this not being done?</P>

Is he satisfied in the long-term and medium term that with eight ships the Naval Service can fulfil its national and international responsibilities with regard to fishing issues, escorting ships with nuclear cargo, monitoring drug trafficking and monitoring immigration at sea, which is becoming a problem? Eight ships for the square mileage for which we have responsibility is a miserable fleet by European standards. Has the Minister any long-term plans to increase the fleet size?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who tabled the questions. On my own behalf and on behalf of the Government, I convey our sincere regrets to public transport users, the general public and business for the inconvenience and disruption caused by the Dublin Bus strike.</P>
      <P>The Government made a very clear statement on the dispute last Thursday when it called for the suspension of the strike and the resumption of negotiations. I repeat that call today with renewed emphasis. The Government continues to believe that agreement is possible, based on genuine productivity and restructuring measures. I welcome the proposals which the NBRU made in the earlier negotiations. If agreed and fully implemented, they would generate savings of about £2 million, out of the total of over £9 million required to meet their 20% pay claim.</P>
      <P>At the earlier talks, Dublin Bus tabled productivity measures which would generate cost savings in excess of the required £9 million, without the need for job losses or impact on earnings. The proposals tabled by both the NBRU and Dublin Bus can provide a basis for the resumption of negotiations. The State's industrial relations machinery remains available to assist where a basis exists for resumed negotiations.</P>
      <P>In a separate development yesterday and today, permanent way staff in Iarnród Éireann have commenced unofficial industrial action. They are responsible for the maintenance, inspection and patrolling of railway tracks. The immediate effect of that unofficial dispute was that Iarnród Éireann had to introduce speed restrictions for safety reasons where safety patrols of the track were not being undertaken. Speed restrictions of 30 mph are already being applied to uninspected jointed track to ensure continued safe operation.</P>
      <P>Since then, however, the dispute has escalated with pickets being placed on depots around the country. This is already leading to the cancellation and disruption of rail services. This unofficial dispute arises from the rejection, without a ballot, of a restructuring package for permanent way staff which was the subject of a recent Labour Court recommendation. In return for changes in working practices, the package would have given a 12.5% increase now, with a later 7.5% increase.</P>
      <P>There have been high level informal contacts between management and union representatives to find a way to bring this unofficial dispute to a speedy end. The way forward is for an immediate end to the unofficial industrial action, followed by intensive negotiations to resolve the issues in dispute.</P>

Does she agree that the proposal by the unions for a £2 million saving <Col N="1323" /> is a basis for negotiation? Does she accept that, with pickets being placed on DART and mainline rail installations, we are on the verge of a disastrous national public transport strike which will be the first such strike for 30 years? Does she agree it is unacceptable for the Government, particularly herself as Minister with overall responsibility for public transport, to wash its hands of this dispute and suggest, as she did in a very insulting manner on Thursday, that people should get on their bikes? Does she accept that her early ineffective meddling in the affairs of the company should be replaced by a policy which the company management could adopt to prevent this disastrous situation for commuters and business people in Dublin?</P>

      <P>Over the past two and a half years, the Minister led the unions and Dublin Bus to believe that with the advent of competition, she would give them the comfort of two to three years of public service contracts whereby competition would be phased in. In the past few weeks she unilaterally said that on the Attorney General's advice, she would grant no public service contracts. Does the Minister accept that one of the key reasons for this dispute is the failure of Government to implement public service contracts which the unions wanted?</P>

        <b>:</b> The Minister stated in the House last week that bus drivers do a very difficult job. In view of the difficult, arduous and responsible job which bus drivers do, does she agree that a demand for basic pay of £330 per week is just and that the Government should ask Bus Átha Cliath to accede to it? Last week the Minister was not fully aware of some of the demand being made by the company because they had just been published. Does the Minister think that Dublin Bus workers should agree to having 200 buses contracted out to private contractors when this is their work? Does she believe that bus drivers should accept the abolition of spread-over payments which are compensation for the fact that they can be on call for 12 hours while the time they are on call is extended to 13 hours? Does the Minister agree that the solution to the crisis is for the Government to make a proper subsidy to Bus Átha Cliath to enable the necessary capital input to be made and a just recompense paid to bus workers for the very difficult job they do? It is in the hands of the Government to resolve this dispute immediately.</P>

Unlike others, I have always accepted that I have political responsibility, and that is the reason I am not in Brussels today.

      <P>Outside the House the Government has promised to introduce legislation to provide for a reception and integration agency to deal with asylum seekers and has also decided to provide 1,000 places in what will be known as flotels. Will we have a debate shortly on this legislation? In particular, will the idea of flotels be debated in the House and approved by it before being put into effect? Will the view of the House be taken on this issue?</P>

      <P>I understand that in the past hour the Tánaiste gave a press conference saying she will issue 28,500 visas per year to bring people to the country and that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform issued a press statement announcing he has already signed 300 deportations orders. When will we have a statement of complementary Government policy? In replies I have received in the House over the past three weeks I was informed that the immigration legislation and the work permits legislation would be introduced at the end of the year. Is there any change in that timeframe or are the promises of the Tánaiste to be implemented in advance of the passing of such legislation? Will there be a debate on immigration before the specific measures outlined in the statement of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are implemented?</P>

    <P>On Committee Stage, Members argued that the definition of pay was all embracing in respect of benefits-in-kind and should be narrowed by reference to the reckonable pay components listed in Part 1 of the Schedule, which only permits board and lodgings, board only and lodgings only to be reckonable. This amendment addresses the issue raised by Opposition Deputies. In view of this change to the definition of pay, it is considered necessary to make consequential amendments to sections 19 and 23 of the Bill, and amendments Nos. 22 and 28, respectively, do that.</P>

        <b>: </b>My amendment No. 4 was to delete lines 20 to 22. I suppose the Minister has realised this measure was so broad as to be open to enormous abuse by unscrupulous employers where &ldquo;pay&rdquo; could have included the value of any benefit not in the form of money. That would have been <i>carte blanche</i> for the unscrupulous employer to include anything in the form of payment and have that reckoned as forming the minimum wage. The Minister has realised that and has asked for the deletion of those lines in favour of a tighter proposal. That is welcome in so far as it goes but, unfortunately, under &ldquo;pay&rdquo; the Minister is introducing the sections in Part 1 of the Schedule, which I and other Opposition Deputies found to be quite objectionable. She is reinforcing the fact that the shift premia and the service charge distributed to the employee through the payroll is to be part of the reckoning for the national minimum wage. I therefore oppose the Minister's proposal.</P>

      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 29 to 33.</P>
      <P>I wish to have deleted from the Bill the fact that the Act would not apply to the remuneration of a person who is the spouse, father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, stepfather, stepmother and other relatives of the employer. After the discussion on Committee Stage I am sorry the Government is continuing with this provision which is unjust with regard to many categories of people included in the Bill. The implication of the Government's position is that everybody in the family is intimately involved in every way with an enterprise, that they benefit to the same extent from that enterprise and are happy to be tied up in that enterprise as partners. That can be far from the case in regard to brothers or sisters, half brothers or half sisters or other relatives of an employer. The Government is saying we have to turn a blind eye to exploitation within the wider family. If everybody in the family is happy working in a partnership &ndash; understanding &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; in a wide context &ndash; the question does not arise as to the rate of pay. However, in many cases people who come under the designation of relatives of various kinds could find themselves being exploited by an employer, and they should have the protection of the minimum wage Act. As I said on Committee Stage, one almost felt that this was all encompassing, the next door neighbour and the person with blue eyes should be included as well. At this late stage the Government should agree to withdraw that proposal.</P>

      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, the principle of excluding an employee who is a close relative of an employer from employment rights legislation or modifying the entitlements of such employees is well established in legislation, including the redundancy payments legislation, the Unfair Dismissals Acts, the protection of <Col N="1342" /> young persons and the organisation of working time legislation. It was further recommended by the interdepartmental committee that we would maintain this exclusion. In terms of close relatives who assist at critical times and the idea of making that a criminal offence, first, it would be difficult to police and, second, it would be an undesirable intervention in what is essentially a family relationship. The person is an employee but an employee in a family situation and it would be extremely difficult to implement and police this legislation in that area. That is the reason employment rights legislation generally does not apply to relatives of this kind. I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

While it might not apply to current wage levels, it could apply at some future time, when this or a future Government is compelled to set a far more realistic minimum rate which would allow working people a more reasonable standard of living. It would have been a national scandal, unsustainable and highly discriminatory if we ever had a minimum wage that was greater than that earned by any section of <Col N="1343" /> the rank and file of the Army.

    <P>
      <Col N="1345" /> This section deals with employees providing a record of their working hours. The amendment seeks to change the position in the Bill where it is mandatory to require the employee to keep a record, to one where the employee &ldquo;may&rdquo; keep such a record.</P>
    <P>Whatever my political differences with the Minister, I regard her as a rational person and politician. I cannot understand why she took such a trenchant position on this on Committee Stage. I was not seeking to excise the section concerned but merely to provide for a situation where the employee has the right to keep a record if he or she wants to or is able to. Deputy Stanton made the point that in a number of situations an employee might be unable to keep a record. I am puzzled that the Minister has chosen to stick in her heels on this, of all areas. It does not make much sense. If anyone were to lose by this, although I do not see why anybody would, it would be the worker concerned. However, since the amendment states the employee may keep a written record, he or she is free to do so and to furnish it to the employer in the manner prescribed.</P>
    <P>Why should we put this imposition on employees that irrespective of the myriad situations in the work environment that one could contemplate, there is this mandatory obligation on the employee to keep that record and it has certain implications later in the legislation if the record is not kept? Subsection (3) is quite punitive in terms of the employee maintaining a false record or furnishing information to the employer that is false or misleading. I suggested on Committee Stage that the Tánaiste would at least take on board the requirement that the employee should know the information to be false and she has later provided for that situation in the amendments which I welcome.</P>
    <P>On this narrow point, I cannot see how it is a matter of principle or ideological dispute or anything else, that instead of the employer mandatorily being required to keep this record that the employer would be free to keep that record.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this on Committee Stage and Deputy Rabbitte makes an important point. We all know people who are unable to read and quite often they are on or are on less than the minimum wage. I ask the Tánaiste to examine this again. I came across a gentleman recently who has been married for 30 years and his wife is not aware that he is unable to read. These are kinds of people whom this legislation is designed to protect and help. We are considering the terms &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;may&rdquo; and splitting hairs. Perhaps the Tánaiste would, maybe in the Seanad, take on board other wordings such as &ldquo;shall if possible&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall where possible&rdquo; to allow for people with major difficulty who are personally embarrassed because in the past the State let them down and they are now unable to read or write. We should not put them into a straitjacket by writing a <Col N="1346" />&ldquo;shall&rdquo; into the legislation where &ldquo;they shall keep a written record&rdquo;. How can they keep a written record when they are unable to read or write? It is an important and practical point and one on which the Tánaiste should be a little flexible. Perhaps the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; might be a little too lenient, but there should be ways of doing this. The Tánaiste agreed to look at this on Committee Stage and I am disappointed that she did not come back to us on this. Perhaps if she puts in &ldquo;shall where possible keep a written record&rdquo; it would suffice. I ask the Tánaiste to seriously consider this again before it goes to the Seanad and maybe try to come up with some wording to have a little flexibility and allow these people a small measure of freedom.</P>

      <P>On this section, I am concerned that most of the sections that have any kind of controlling elements to them are controlling the employee. I would have liked this section to put the onus on the employer. I realise the Tánaiste is concerned to have some way in which the employee keeps a note of the work done if he is sent off to work without supervision. Surely it was possible to put the onus on the employer to say to the employee that a certain job should take two or three hours? Keeping this note could be a problem for someone who is not good at reading and writing but it also might be a problem for someone who gets caught up in the work and forgets to look at the clock when starting work in a place which is not normally controlled by his employer. The whole emphasis of the legislation puts these onuses on the employee. There is some onus on the employer but not as much as I would like.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">

      <P>Since Committee Stage I have considered these matters. Deputy Owen suggested it should not be specific to 72 hours, it should be &ldquo;as far as is practical&rdquo;, which I have taken on board. Deputy Rabbitte, Deputy Owen, Deputy Stanton and others referred to the case where an employee knowingly made a false declaration and the same leeway was not given to the employee as to an employer. I saw that difficulty and changed that. If we were to remove &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and replace it with &ldquo;may&rdquo; we would remove the mandatory nature of it and we put it into the voluntary category. To a large extent then we would make the whole section meaningless. The section is to cover that category of employees who do not work in a controlled environment, such as teleworkers or workers of that kind. Even in the public service, those below a certain grade either sign in or clock in, or verify their attendance, when they come in, leave for lunch and come back and go again in the evening. This is the only mechanism we can think of whereby an employee can verify the hours they work and where the employer has some way of knowing what hours were worked within a reasonable period. If we make it a voluntary declaration, we would make the whole section meaningless.</P>

      <P>For example, if it is voluntary and it may be done and it is not done, somebody might claim he has worked 40 hours subsequent to the period, one, two or six months on.

This is not practical. Has the Tánaiste any way of helping those people and would she not agree that these are the very people who in many instances will find themselves at this wage level? I accept the Tanaiste's point about the problem with keeping records and taking someone's word maybe a week, ten days or a month later. However, I make the case for the considerable number of people who cannot read and have problems with written records and who may not be able to take up employment and will shy away from it for this very reason. Can the Tánaiste be flexible and give the House some assurance that these people will not be frightened off employment because of this requirement?</P>

      <P>I put down the amendment for the reasons argued by Deputy Stanton but unfortunately the Tánaiste would appear to have set her face against conceding it and I am somewhat puzzled as to why it is that important to change it from a mandatory position to leaving it as a framework to be complied with if the employee is in a position to do so. I greatly doubt whether there are many employers who will find themselves confronted with a claim some six months after the work in question was performed. That does not happen in the real world. In the real world, the problems to which Deputy Stanton alluded are real problems which are likely to cause further problems for workers in this situation.</P>

      <P>I accept that unfortunately there are too many people who cannot read or write. There are different mechanisms and tools we need to use to address that issue, and I hope something is being done. However, one could argue that someone in that position might not even know if he received a cheque, whether he had received the minimum hourly rate. That is an argument one could bring to a stage where the situation becomes meaningless. This provision is being introduced as a simple way for an employee who is not under the direct control of his employer, or in a supervised workplace, to be able to verify the hours he has worked as soon as <Col N="1348" /> is practicable &ndash; and that may mean different things to different people. It is not too onerous a task and it is a mechanism necessary to make the legislation meaningful.</P>

        <b>:</b> I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 10, to delete lines 6 to 10 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) The Minister shall, by order, declare a national minimum hourly rate of pay in the Private Sector for the purposes of this Act in accordance with the rates laid down in <i>Part 3</i> of the <i>Schedule</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In many ways this amendment is at the heart of the Bill because it comes down to how much better off low paid workers will be when the legislation is enacted. The minimum wage of £4.40 per hour which the Government says it will introduce in April is totally inadequate from the point of view of providing some kind of reasonable living standard for low paid workers. That figure was first mooted a full two years ago and in the interim the cost of living has increased in many respects. This is particularly so in the case of housing. Low paid workers are highly dependent on private rented accommodation, yet they are expected to survive on £4.40 per hour which, at a little over £170 per week, is utterly inadequate. My proposal is that the rate should be £5 per hour with immediate effect and that a provision should be built into the Bill that the rate would rise to £6 per hour next year, £7 the year after, and £8 the year after that. That would give a reasonable base pay to low paid workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question but that established employers, many of whom are profitable companies, can afford to pay that level of remuneration. It would not mean that they would go out of business. That is alarmist. All it would mean is that they would take a hit on their levels of profit. On Committee Stage I cited the example of the Jurys-Doyle hotel group which last year made retail profits of just over £14 million. I do not know the specific level of wages in that group, but low wages are endemic in the hotel and catering <Col N="1350" /> industry generally. If a company such as that, which has almost 2,000 employees, granted wage increases of £2,000 per year per employee, it would simply mean that its profits would drop to about £10 million. That is still a handsome profit for any company and the workers would have their standard of living increased by a reasonably substantial amount.</P>
    <P>The £5 per hour national minimum wage I am seeking should be tax free. It is quite ludicrous that workers at the very lowest level on the scale should come under the income tax regime. The Government should have used the occasion of introducing this legislation to declare that any worker on the minimum wage would not be taxed. Deputy Stanton elicited the information that £77 million extra would be collected by the State from low paid workers as a result of their being brought up to £4.40 per hour.</P>

        <b>:</b> That is based on the figure of 163,000 workers who, the Minister says, will be affected by this Bill. That is shameful. Even at this late hour I am sorry the Irish Congress of Trade Unions agreed to the £4.40 level for a national minimum wage. It should have insisted on a minimum of £5 per hour with a provision that it would increase annually to give people hope that in future they would not have to struggle to make ends meet.</P>
      <P>Young low paid workers are often dependent on private landlords for accommodation. What is happening in the rental sector in Dublin and around the country is a disgrace. Rents are being put up with no control whatsoever. Many workers on the minimum wage will need a substantially higher rate in order to meet extra accommodation costs and provide a reasonable living standard for themselves.</P>

      <P>The National Minimum Wage Commission recommended that the minimum wage should be two thirds of the median industrial wage, which would now be £4.70. I am not in favour of this amendment, not necessarily because of the figure but because the principle of putting figures in legislation is not a good idea. What would happen if the hands of the Minister in April 2003 were tied at £8 per hour when he <Col N="1351" /> or she felt the wage should be £8.30 or £9 per hour because the economy had continued to grow? The principle of putting the figure in legislation is not a good one and for that reason I feel this amendment is unwise.</P>
      <P>Also, Deputy Higgins alluded to the fact that in the PPF talks the social partners &ndash; rather surprisingly &ndash; agreed to £4.40 and worked out that they would want to see it going to £4.70 and £5 by the end of the life of the partnership. I was surprised they did so as I felt they would go for the recommendation of two thirds of the median wage and for a starting figure of £4.70 which would be added to twice more before the end of the partnership. However, they did not do so. Other sections of the legislation allow for more flexibility in deciding the rate if a change was needed. I hope the rate will always move upwards and that a future Minister would not use the Bill to lower the rate, but that is highly unlikely. For that reason Deputy Higgins should not try to build figures such as £6, £7 or £8 per hour into the legislation. Given that the social partners have agreed a figure, it would be unwise of us to second guess what they have agreed. For those reasons we will not vote for this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party supports amendment No. 17. If our hard pressed media colleagues had followed the many hours of Committee Stage debate on this Bill and relayed the discussions to the public, many of those who anticipate benefiting from the minimum wage would be extremely disappointed that the Tánaiste has not managed to introduce the rate at £5 per hour.</P>
      <P>The arguments have been well advanced, but one that has not been advanced is that the marketplace has overtaken £5 per hour, certainly in greater Dublin. It is now not possible to get labour for less than £5 per hour and schoolchildren are being induced out of school for pay that exceeds that rate per hour; £5 per hour is a reasonable minimum rate. When Deputy Owen says the social partners have agreed, that is technically true, but a trade union like MANDATE, which has a large number of low paid members, is very disappointed with the rate. It is noticeable that its members voted against the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and this was a substantial factor in their doing so. If one looks at the Tánaiste's guidelines, she agreed with and took on board the National Minimum Wage Commission. The commission, as has been said, took up the concept of median earnings of all employees and stated in its report that it did so to better reflect the real level of earnings in the economy and not just the earnings in one sector. That report is two years old and its conclusion specifically recommended a start date of 1 April 2000 should be set to implement the national minimum wage, which should be set at around two thirds of median earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My union, SIPTU, sought a rate of £5 per hour and its economic unit calculated that in the <Col N="1352" /> intervening two years, the April 2000 equivalent of the commission's £4.40 per hour would be £4.90 per hour. I suspect that in the real economy it has progressed faster than that. Some members of MANDATE told me of certain retail outlets closing down over the weekend while prices were adjusted 10% upwards because of alleged movements in sterling. I have not followed the movement in sterling that closely over the weekend, but I suspect that was just a line to the employees. No wonder we are seeing inflation in the economy if that is going on.</P>
    <P>In the real world £5 per hour has been overtaken in the marketplace and to use that rate as our starting point from 1 April would be reasonable. I will therefore support this amendment, as £5 per hour reflects circumstances in the real world. It is what I intended with amendment No. 2, which sought to ensure the national minimum wage as being the equivalent of two thirds of median earnings. Today that is £4.90, which is as close to £5 as makes very little difference. I hope the Tánaiste accepts this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of Deputy Rabbitte, the point of £4.40 being calculated as net or gross wage is another issue. The fact that it is being calculated as gross is very much the problem, as it is far from a £4.40 per hour net rate. Deputy Rabbitte mentioned a rate of £5 per hour. One would be far better off with £4.40 net per hour than £5 gross per hour. It is regrettable that so many people on low incomes are paying tax. The Revenue Commissioners will collect £77 million, not alone from employees, but from employers also. A balance must be struck between employers and employees. People are paying a considerable amount of tax on wages of £176 per week. The minimum wage will not be a minimum to those receiving it; it is a gross amount. That figure will be considerably less than £4.40 per hour. That point should be made clearly. Many employees are expecting £4.40 per hour after tax. From my own experience in the services sector, I am aware that the majority of employees do not worry unduly about what is paid in tax, once it is paid by the employer, but they are concerned with what is in their envelopes at the end of the week. There is a danger that many people will assume they will receive £4.40 net per hour. The Minister must ensure people are aware that we are talking about a gross rather than a net minimum wage as there is a big difference between the two.</P>

      <P>The Government's decision to tax the minimum wage is inexplicable. The problem would be solved if the minimum wage were not taxed. In reply to a recent parliamentary question, the Minister for Finance estimated that the Revenue Commissioners would take in at least £70 million in direct taxation, not to mention indirect taxation, as a result of the introduction of the minimum wage. I am aware of the Minister's view <Col N="1353" /> that the minimum wage should not be taxed but I urge her to impress that view on her colleague, the Minister for Finance. People are being hoodwinked and employers will end up indirectly subventing the Government to the tune of more than £70 million, according to the figures outlined by the Minister for Finance. The minimum wage should not be taxed even if that necessitates the introduction of an amendment to the Finance Bill at this stage.</P>

      <P>When this Government took office two and a half years ago, single people began to pay tax on income over £70 per week; that figure has been increased to £110 but we must go further. If £4.40 per hour is the minimum hourly figure we believe people should earn, it does not make sense to tax it.</P>
      <P>There are two issues here, namely, whether the rate should be written into legislation and what the rate is. I agree with Deputy Owen that the rate should not be written into legislation. It would be undesirable to amend primary legislation each time the rate is increased following a national pay agreement, a Labour Court recommendation or a Government decision. I do not envisage any reduction in the rate. In my view, any changes in the rate can most appropriately be dealt with by way of regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minimum Wage Commission recommended that the rate should be set at approximately two thirds but that the effect on employment and competitiveness should also be taken into account. Some Deputies made the point, with which I agree to a large extent, that it would be very difficult to find people who would be prepared to work for less than the minimum wage &ndash; with the exception perhaps of home helps &ndash; in <Col N="1354" /> the greater Dublin area. The market is buoyant and the position in Dublin is not typical. Some people suggested that the minimum wage should be introduced on a sectoral or regional basis but we resisted that because it is desirable to have a single national hourly rate.</P>
    <P>The ESRI forecast that 163,000 workers will benefit from the introduction of the national minimum wage from Saturday next. It also forecast that the introduction of the minimum wage would have adverse effects on employment. The interdepartmental report, which takes on board the ESRI recommendations, shows the location of those workers. In all, 13.6% of the workforce across a number of sectors will be affected by the introduction of the minimum wage.</P>
    <P>Through the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the social partners have agreed that an hourly rate of £4.40 should be paid from 1 April this year, that the figure should be increased to £4.70 next year and £5 in two years' time. The Government is a party to that agreement which has been endorsed by employers, the voluntary sector and the trade union movement. I am not in a position, for the reasons I outlined on Committee Stage, to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be widespread dissatisfaction about this issue. A rate of £5 per hour has been overtaken by the marketplace and the payment of a rate of £4.40 per hour is less than most moderate-minded people would expect. I do not believe 163,000 people will benefit from the introduction of the minimum wage. That calculation was made an aeon ago in economic terms and events have been overtaken by the marketplace. Neither do I believe the new agreement for prosperity and happiness would be rent asunder were the Minister to set the rate at £5 per hour. The trade unions were disappointed that the £5 per hour target did not prove feasible and I regret the Minister cannot set the rate at £5 per hour.</P>

      <P>As a consequence of amendment No. 3, which relates to the definition of pay, and the need to clarify the existing subsections (1) and (2), it is considered appropriate to amend these subsections to improve their clarity.</P>
      <P>The primary difference in the new subsection (1) is the wording &ldquo;all the pay of an employee&rdquo;, which must be read in conjunction with the new definition of pay in section 2 which reads &ldquo;all amounts of payment and any benefit-in-kind specified in Part 1 of the Schedule&rdquo;. In effect, subsection (1) refers only to the payments in Part 1 of the Schedule in calculating an employee's average hourly rate of pay in a pay reference period, which must be not less than the employee's minimum hourly rate of pay entitlement under this Bill. The existing subsection (2) was broader in scope. The effect of the new subsection is that the payments listed in Part 2 of the Schedule are non-reckonable when calculating an employee's average hourly rate of pay.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 23, which is related, goes to the heart of the Bill in that it deals with the elements that are reckonable in terms of calculating the minimum rate of pay. Considerable progress was made on Committee Stage when the Minister agreed to excise certain matters included prior to that in Part 1 of the Schedule and which are now allocated to Part 2. The net point has now been reduced to two matters that give offence in terms of calculating a minimum wage. No. 3 of the Schedule relates to shift premium and No. 9 relates to service charge. In other words, what is proposed here is that in terms of the employer calculating the minimum rate of pay, he or she may take into account shift <Col N="1357" /> premium as a reckonable component. I submit on behalf of the Labour Party that shift premium cannot be used for the purposes of calculating a basic rate of pay because it has nothing to do with it. Shift premium is by definition something in excess of a basic rate of pay. Shift premium is like any other premium, such as unsocial hours premium. Why has the Minister agreed to excise &ndash; I welcome the fact that she has so agreed &ndash; unsocial hours premium when she is not prepared to excise shift premium?</P>
      <P>Shift premium is an add on, an additional payment, compensation for working unsocial hours and for being involved in shift cycle working, whether night time working or odd hours. It is a payment above and beyond the basic pay and I contend that what we are agreeing here is a national basic minimum wage, admittedly calculated on an hourly basis. It is basic pay and it ought not include shift premium. It is wrong that the Minister is still including shift premium in the Bill and I ask her, even at this late stage, to remove it. As was established on Committee Stage, an employer could pay £3.30 per hour and because of the requirement to pay shift premium at a continued cycle shift, he or she would be able to comply with the terms of the Bill, that is payment of £4.40 per hour. Thirty three per cent of £3.30 is £1.10, giving a rate of £4.40 per hour. This means that with a basic rate of £3.30 per hour, the employer would comply with the terms of the Bill. I appeal to the Minister to remove the provision that relates to shift premium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister has removed five components from the Schedule. I now understand why they found their way into it. The Minister seemed to be able to remove the components without much pain to herself and the people who drafted the legislation. If the Opposition did not have to table the amendments to remove the components from the Schedule, we could have short circuited Committee Stage. Nonetheless, I will not look a gift horse in the mouth and I am pleased the five reckonable components have been removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Rabbitte, I am surprised the Minister has included the shift premium. My understanding is that she wanted to include as reckonable components elements that were consolidated into pay rates and and for that reason I have done a little more research on the issue of the service charge. It appears that service charge, No. 9, is consolidated into the pay rate as PRSI and tax is paid on it and it is built into an employee's earnings. I do not profess to understand it fully, but a points system is also built into the hotel industry where the service charge collected on every bill is distributed among the employees and they all know what they will get. While in receipt of less than the minimum wage, none go home with less than the minimum wage when they get their part of the service charge. It is clear from the ICTU submission that service pay, shift premium, <Col N="1358" /> unsocial hours premium, public holiday premium, Saturday premium and Sunday premium are normally not consolidated into pay rates for the purposes of calculating overtime rates and other pay-related matters. Therefore, the case is being made that they should not be taken into account when calculating the minimum hourly pay.</P>
    <P>The Minister has removed service pay, unsocial hours and the public holiday premium, Saturday premium and Sunday premium to non-reckonable components, but for some reason is leaving shift premium in reckonable components. I would like to hear the argument for retaining it in reckonable components when she so easily gave way to the Opposition's request to remove the other elements. If, as ICTU said, shift premium is not consolidated into pay rates I would like to hear the Minister's response.</P>
    <P>Given that we will not have the regulations before 1 April will the Tánaiste give us the values for board and lodgings and board only. I want to be absolutely sure of the rates because I have a letter from a person working in a hostel whose employer says he does not have to pay her the full minimum wage because he is giving her accommodation. Will au pairs and nannies be covered by the minimum wage? Often they get more than board and accommodation, they become part of the family. A case is being made that it will be penal. Where people have a good working arrangement already in place they may have to let them go. Given that child carers and child care places are already in short supply I would like to hear the Minister's response or, perhaps, she would send me a note on it.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been improved dramatically since publication and major changes have been made to the Schedules. There is one element, the shift premium, about which we have reservations and we ask the Minister to consider moving it into the non-reckonable components. I compliment the parliamentary draftsman who has made the language more user friendly. This is happening in many Bills. The language used in the past was so convoluted that it was difficult for ordinary people to understand it. I ask that it become the norm to use language that is easier to understand and to avoid any unnecessary verbiage. Given that we shall shortly be dealing with the Copyright and Related Rights Bill this is something the Minister of State could look at.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I could respond to Deputy Owens's queries first. Board and lodgings is £6.09 per day or £42.63 per week &ndash; seven day week; £25.31 for board only per week or £3.62 per day and £17.32 per week for lodgings only or £2.47 per day. The hostel worker qualifies for £4.40 per hour for every hour worked. These rates can be deducted if she gets board and lodgings or board only. The same applies in relation to domestic services. As I understand it au pairs are not gen<Col N="1359" /> erally classified as employees. This applies only where somebody is an employee. Sometimes au pairs come to study and do some part-time work in return for board and lodgings. That is a different situation. My Department has refused work permits in a host of areas where we believe somebody was being exploited and would not get what we regard as reasonable pay. From now on we will look at the minimum rate per hour as the rate we expect to be paid and we will subtract if board and lodgings or board only is being given.</P>
      <P>Some of the changes made were agreed with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the social partners before the legislation was published. I still consider it was important for the Oireachtas members that the Dáil debate would be meaningful. The Bill could have been amended before publication. We agreed a number of amendments that were not agreed prior to publication. While I believe in the power of parliamentary democracy I do not believe this House should be a rubber stamp.</P>

The purpose of the amendment is to allow a longer period to an employer to supply the written statement containing details of the employee's reckonable pay earnings in a pay reference period to that employee. The subsection already provides that the employer must do so within four weeks. This time limit is considered a reasonable period for the employer to supply such information. If <Col N="1362" /> the amendment were accepted employees could be put under undue influence to allow the employer to postpone giving the information. This would be unacceptable in relation to the operation of the later sections of the Bill, that is, referral of a dispute to a rights commissioner by the employee after obtaining the written statement from the employer or waiting for the four weeks to elapse should the employer fail to supply the written statement.

A similar provision is included in section 30 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, and section 12 of the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act, 1993. Legal advice has been sought and confirms that the provision is constitutional. The Supreme Court judgment on the Employment Equality Bill, 1996, does not reflect on this type of evidence which is of a factual nature, that is, that a person was required to attend a Labour Court hearing on a certain date, that a Labour Court hearing was held on that date and the person did not attend or, having attended, refused to give evidence.</P>

I understand from the Minister that, having taken advice on the matter, that is not the case.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 22, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Labour Inspectorate in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment shall establish a register of names, open to the public, of those employers found guilty of an offence under this section and such names shall be maintained for 3 years after the offence, after which time they shall be removed unless an employer has been found guilty of a further offence.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister of State taken advice since this amendment was discussed on Committee Stage? Where an employer is renegade in implementing the Bill and found guilty of an offence, it should be possible for someone to find out if they are walking into a hornet's nest, that the employer concerned will try to exploit them and seek to use the small print to calculate the minimum wage in an unfair way. On Committee Stage the Minister mentioned that this was a bit like the register of sexual offenders but the request I am making which relates to labour law is reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment and maintenance of a register of employers found guilty of an offence under this section would not be appropriate to the labour inspectorate, the resources of which should be focused on its primary task, enforcing employment law. If such a register were to be kept it would require the diversion of resources to ensure its contents were completely accurate. This would involve not only tracking initial cases but, more importantly, ensuring appeals were tracked and recorded accurately given that any error would leave the State open to litigation. The costs to the inspectorate, therefore, of operating such a register would outweigh any perceived benefits.</P>

He is agreeing, therefore, that the concept is not a bad one. I will discuss the matter with Fine Gael Senators to ascertain if there is somebody else who could maintain such a register.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>&ndash;condemns the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands on her handling of the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, and deplores the total uncertainty she has created among the media and communications sectors, with particular reference to management and workers at RTE and TG4, who were not informed of any intention on her part to alter the proposed and accepted format of transmission management and control through the Company Digico;</P>
      <P>&ndash;further deplores:</P>
      <P>&ndash;the lack of clarity in regard to income streams for RTE and TG4;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the omission of digital radio from the Broadcasting Bill, 1999;</P>
      <P>&ndash;her consistent avoidance of the issue of authorising the indexation of licence fees approved by the previous Government and non-action in the matter of considering a licence fee increase;</P>
      <P>&ndash;her refusal to clarify her position to Dáil Éireann since her announcement of her intention to alter the Digico concept;</P>
      <P>&ndash;her unwillingness to clarify her position to the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis on the same subject, and</P>
      <P>&ndash;her inability to provide an alternative model at her meeting with RTE;</P>
      <P>&ndash;resolves that a substantial public shareholding be retained in the transmission system with appropriate guarantees;</P>
      <P>&ndash;approves indexation of the licence fee authorised by the previous government; and</P>
      <P>&ndash;in relation to the Broadcasting Bill, 1999,</P>
      <P>rescinds the Order of Dáil Éireann referring the Bill to the Select Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language and hereby resolves that the Bill be withdrawn.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is born out of a sense of deep frustration and uncertainty created by the inept handling of the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, by the Minister to date. I regret that the Government is now characterised by a lack of vision, imagination and leadership. There is a deep mistrust within the broadcasting and communications network at the ability of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, to deal effectively with this Bill. I hope she will use the <Col N="1370" /> opportunity presented to her here this evening to state her views clearly, to tell the truth about her changes of view and to indicate what exactly she has in mind regarding Digico, RTE, its workers and the future of boardcasting as far as the Bill is concerned, and that she does not seek to hide behind some smokescreen. While the House, the workers in the industry and the country at large wait to hear her latest thoughts on the future of what used to be called broadcasting, it is regrettably the case that the broadcasting and communications agenda marches on without her and without us.</P>
    <P>There is a peculiar and little known fact about the business before the Dáil this evening which I want to relate because it has a direct bearing on the motion. The present dilemma started on 23 February 2000, with the following headline in the <i>Irish Independent: </i>RTE Transmission Will Be Sold To Highest Bidder. The story stated that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands had decided to eliminate RTE's share in the privatised transmission company with the name of Digico and subsequent reports stated that the Minister intended to table appropriate amendments to the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, on Committee Stage. The peculiar and ironic twist to these stories is that the Bill is so vague and imprecise about what property is to be sold that it would be unnecessary to amend the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, to eliminate RTE's minority share. The Bill is so loose about what is to be conveyed that if passed into law as published the Government could privatise &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;, the film archives or the RTE car park; it does not discriminate.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not specify a percentage ownership for RTE or any formula or means to arrive at a figure. The RTE shareholding could be reduced to a cipher without altering a single character of type. The Bill does not prescribe any process by which a private company is to come into ownership of all or a part of RTE transmission.</P>
    <P>When I first read that headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, whose parent company has a vested interest in Princes Holdings, it came as somewhat of a relief because up until that headline it was unclear by what criteria the Government intended to choose between different prospective owners. There was some mention of negotiating with suitable prospective strategic partners, a concept which is difficult to reconcile with the legal niceties of a complete or partial privatisation. The Bill refers to privatisation in one place only, where it states that RTE should:</P>
    <P>transfer such parts of its real and personal property as the Authority, with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, determines ought to be the subject of such a transfer.</P>
    <P>When one reads that, the words &ldquo;blank cheque&rdquo; come to mind. Until now, we have been asked to endorse the sale of whatever components of RTE <Col N="1371" /> the Minister, Deputy de Valera, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, think fit. The two Ministers will forgive us on this side of the House if we, who are not in the habit of handing over wallets to strangers, are sceptical of these arrangements. We, who are not inclined to pre-sign cheque books, are in need of a great deal of precision when it comes to the sale of £30 million to £60 million of State property. We, who are not inclined to sign contracts before we read them, prefer that the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, should enumerate the assets to be included in the sale. The Bill, which authorises a transfer of assets, should also regulate that transfer. It appears that the Bill is now unravelling on this very point.</P>
    <P>I will state a brief history of the Bill, in particular, as it relates to the Digico proposal and the RTE shareholding. In late 1997, RTE proposed to the Government that it should enter into a strategic partnership to provide the necessary funding for the introduction of digital terrestrial television. On 22 July 1998, the Government announced its decision to draft broadcasting legislation. The press release issued by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht stated:</P>
    <P>I and the Government have accepted that the proposals &ndash; which would involve RTE entering into a partnership for the provision of technical facilities to broadcasters in Ireland &ndash; provide the best opportunity for the early roll-out of the infrastructure that will guarantee universal service.</P>
    <P>A project management group was formed in February 1999 to advise on the sale of the existing RTE transmission network. The press release on the establishment of the project group referred to &ldquo;the new entity to be created in which RTE will be a minority partner&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Bill was introduced to the Dáil on 27 May 1999. In November 1999, the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation opened a consultation paper on digital terrestrial television licensing, which still remains open, awaiting the passage of the Broadcasting Bill into law. The Bill was debated by the Dáil in November and in her opening speech the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>[The Broadcasting Bill] enables me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, to designate a company which will be licensed by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to construct and operate the DTT infrastructure which shall comprise six transmission systems known as multiplexes. RTE will be a minority partner with a shareholding of up to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Later, on the subject of Digico, she stated:</P>
    <P>The approach taken is in line with RTE's suggestion for the development of digital television in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Then the Dáil sent the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, to the Committee on Heritage and the Irish Langu<Col N="1372" /> age. A series of four hearings were held by the committee between December 1999 and February 2000. The committee heard presentations from a range of groups, including RTE, the RTE workers' trades union, TV3, TG4, UTV, Cablelink, Irish Multichannel, the ODTR, the Independent Radio and Television Commission, the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, Crown Castle, which is a prospective bidder, and others too numerous to mention here.</P>
    <P>Then on 23 February 2000, without reference to that committee or its hearings, the <i>Irish Independent</i> carried the headline, This Time There Was No Press Release. This time, after saying that 70% of the story was true, the Minister was <i>incommunicado</i> in Los Angeles. She could not be contacted despite all the technology which exists including the worldwide web, GSM and all sorts of mobile telephones. Subsequently the Minister said in her speech at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis: &ldquo;I have not finalised my proposals to amend the Broadcasting Bill, but I hope to do so in the next few weeks and then bring them to Government for approval&rdquo;. The Bill, is currently before the Select Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language which has not yet attempted to splice in the numerous amendments already tabled.</P>
    <P>The Labour and Fine Gael parties have attempted to extract an explanation from the Minister during Question Time why the sudden shift in direction occurred. The answers to our questions do not depend on her proposed solutions, so we do not agree with the need for a delay. All we got for our troubles was a robotic recitation of rubbish from Mespil Road. For example, &ldquo;the development of a transaction process which satisfies all the requirements of the project management group and the Government objectives to introduce digital terrestrial television has proved difficult and complex&rdquo;. This much we already knew but, as public representatives and Members of the Oireachtas, we have a right and need to know what his going on.</P>
    <P>The project management group has been in business for over a year. If they have suddenly discovered that under EU rulings they cannot just put a price tag on State assets and then find some nice people to buy them, we have a problem. This news has created havoc in RTE whose employees were looking forward to a new career in the private sector with the prospect of an employee stock option plan which their representatives were in the process of negotiating. Now, for all they know, they are facing a P45 instead of an ESOP. It must be a bit of a roller coaster for employees, particularly for those who may have purchased new homes in the past few years or are repaying hefty mortgages. The Minister has launched a wave of uncertainty upon RTE which is still washing around its corridors and will not subside until she does something about it. She owes these people an explanation now and not at some vague time in the future.</P>
    <P>Item 1 in the 1999 framework agreement on partnership in RTE refers to the scope of the <Col N="1373" /> agreement saying: &ldquo;This agreement covers RTE and all subsidiaries under the control of the RTE Authority. It is subject to the obligations and duties, whether direct or delegated, of the authority contained in the Broadcasting Acts&rdquo;. The document defines the framework, which the Minister's action have seriously interfered with, as follows:</P>
    <P>It is a relationship whereby each side recognises that the other has legitimate interests and rights as well as obligations. Partnership implies that both parties have common interests in the success of the organisation, its competitiveness, viability and prosperity. The parties are committed to creating a shared understanding of the future of RTE and to sharing the responsibilities and gains that flow from that understanding.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister's sudden change of heart and view not seriously interrupted the delicate and meaningful negotiations which were being conducted between management, the trade union group and the people involved in the transmission network? I am not sure if her announcement last night on the &ldquo;Nine O'Clock News&rdquo; regarding a facilitator was the result of discussions at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis.</P>
    <P>All this could have been avoided if the three-fold structure of the Broadcasting Bill, the privatisation of transmission assets and the licensing regime had been planned and organised more carefully in advance. In the absence of any definitive statement from the Minister we must speculate.</P>
    <P>There are several possible reasons for a decision to eliminate RTE from a minority shareholding in the designated company in the Broadcasting Bill. It is well known that TV3 and the independent radio broadcasters are unhappy with the prospect of their major competitor sitting on the board of Digico, which would be their sole distributor. Second, one or more of the prospective bidders may have balked at the strategic partnership with RTE and preferred a total buy-out &ndash; this was made clear to us at the committee. We could accept what the newspapers say, namely, that it had to do with the valuation of RTE's transmission assets. If that is the case then it is only half the story, as I will explain. It could well be that the Minister has finally conceded that certain provisions in the Bill are not compatible with the EU Treaty, as we warned throughout the Second Stage debate. Finally, it may be that the plans had become unravelled due to a shift in EU regulatory policy published in the November 1999 communications review entitled &ldquo;Towards a new Framework for Electronic Communications Infrastructure and Associated Services&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Let us consider what the papers say, namely, that it had to do with the valuation placed on the RTE assets by the project management group consultants. What was the purpose of the evaluation? Anything is worth what it can be sold at <Col N="1374" /> on the open market and a transaction is not additionally complicated by a sale of part ownership. For example, if 60% of a company was being offered for sale and the highest bid was £60 million, then one could say the company was worth £100 million and that the part not being sold was worth £40 million. There is no particular problem in evaluating this. However, a dilemma arises if one is selling two things together, for example, a company and a large tract of land which are not owned by the same person. One cash figure will attach to both assets and there is a predicament in dividing the money between both owners. It has not been stated, but we may surmise that the evaluation was necessary primarily because the sale of RTE assets was tied to a frequency option in the same bidding process. The highest bidder for the existing transmission assets was also going to get a majority share of the DTT which represent a certain cash value of their own. The assessment was necessary to distinguish between these two holdings because they belonged to two different owners, namely, RTE and the State.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Bill is very clever in this regard. It appears to separate these two by giving the Minister power to designate a transmission company, but we all know the designated company is identical with the owner of the privatised RTE network. The Broadcasting Bill does not authorise a frequency option. It permits an outright grant of valuable frequencies to a private company. However, the reality of the frequency option was not lost on the advisers to the project management group. They ordered an evaluation so it could be subtracted from the highest bid with the remainder to go directly to the Department of Finance in order to avoid an unauthorised State aid to RTE. According to the newspapers RTE did not agree with the valuation as it was too low and amounted to a bargain basement sale. So the Minister announced she had decided to sell the entire RTE network instead.</P>
    <P>However, there is still a missing link in this story. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands on behalf of the Government appoints the authority of RTE and the members of the board at her pleasure. The current board is coming to the end of its tenure and within the next few weeks an announcement will be made about new members of the new authority. I hope the announcement is made either to the committee or the Dáil and not on the steps of an aircraft on the way to New Zealand, Shanghai or Alaska, as happened in terms of the comment following the leaked story in the <i>Irish Independent</i>. These are very important positions and, given the complexity and importance of broadcasting and communications for the future, the Minister should inform the House of the qualities of the persons she intends appointing in terms of their future remit on the authority. I am not sure whether my eyes deceive me, but it appears at least as if some likely looking characters have been seen escorted across the bridge of sighs towards the opulence of the ministerial quarters <Col N="1375" /> ready to serve when they get the call in the national interest.</P>

      <P>The £30 million to £60 million question is, how would eliminating RTE's shareholding resolve the problem? The Broadcasting Bill ties together two items under the same price and the money still has to be split between the two owners. While the media reports would imply that an impasse on the valuation of the RTE network was to be resolved through market forces, the only way to do this would be to eliminate the frequency option and hold an open licence round for DTT licences.</P>
      <P>I tabled 11 parliamentary questions on 23 November 1999. Question No. 307 in that list requested specific assets and a list of what was to be sold. The Minister replied that consultants had been engaged to advise on all aspects of the transaction process, legal, regulatory and financial, and to manage the process to a conclusion under the direction of the project management group established by Government to oversee the introduction of DTT. Has it been managed to a conclusion? Has the project management group reported finally to the Minister? Will its members be paid for their work? I would like the Minister to clarify the legal and technical difficulties and what they mean.</P>
      <P>Events have overtaken the proposed legislation and the convergence Green Paper has finally closed in on television broadcasting networks. The European Commission has decided to regulate them in keeping with the principle of technological neutrality in a new legislative framework. The 1999 &ldquo;Communications Review&rdquo;, which was published in November, stated that in practice technological neutrality means that the new framework would apply to telecommunications networks, fixed or mobile; satellite networks; cable television networks; terrestrial broadcast networks; and facilities, such as application programme interfaces which control access to services.</P>
      <P>This is in marked contrast to the Minister's remarks last November during Second Stage of the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, when she stated:</P>
      <P>There is an argument that in a world where the technologies are converging, all services should be treated and regulated in the same way as commercial telecommunications services. I do not accept this position. Following extensive debate in Europe the EU has come to the same conclusion for the time being, at least.</P>
      <P>To which world does the Minister refer? In this world the EU has decided to liberalise television broadcasting infrastructure and to regulate it in the same way as commercial telecommunications services. It may well be that in some parallel universe the EU has decided otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Until now television delivery has been exempted from telecommunications liberalisation, but with the convergence of broadcasting and liberalised communications services such as the Internet in the same facility, it has become necessary to do away with this exemption. The principal tenet of telecommunications liberalisation is to eliminate special or exclusive rights granted by the state to a particular company to provide telecommunications services.</P>
      <P>The Broadcasting Bill, 1999, empowers the Minister to designate a company to provide DTT services and to grant such licences without an open licence round, which is a special right. If that framework were in place the legislation would contravene EU law and would risk being overthrown by the European Commission. The Bill is a lame duck measure, a last ditch attempt to provide some special rights before the door closes forever on monopoly operators. It contradicts the Government's position in this important area, which has warmly welcomed telecommunications liberalisation. The Minister for Public Enterprise brought forward the deadline for voice telephony liberalisation by two years, despite the objections of Eircom, yet the Government is resisting the logical extension of liberalisation to all forms of electronic communication. How does that relate to consistent Government policy?</P>
      <P>To what did all this relate? We were led to understand that an injection of outside capital was necessary for RTE to undertake the digitalisation of its network but this notion was expanded to include the provision of cross-Border television, pay television and the Internet in one monolithic entity. A monopoly was to be established for all digital television services in Ireland in order to attract investment. A hefty allotment of the television broadcast spectrum was to be handed over to the new entity in order to exploit as a private plantation.</P>
      <P>RTE management wanted to keep its hand in this business, despite the fact that it has not shown great flair for telecommunications regulation. The digital automaton created by RTE and produced by the Department of the Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has suddenly transformed itself into a walking machine and has escaped from the laboratory, yet nobody seems to know where it has taken up new lodgings. However, there are some dark thoughts that it is no longer working in the national interest. The Minister should tell the public, RTE employees and the enthusiastic staff at TG4 why this is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should she decide to sell the transmission system to persons of her own choosing? Is it a whim or is it policy? Why must the system be sold <Col N="1377" /> and our broadcasters levied with force of law to sustain and maintain it thereafter? If it is her policy, will she explain it and indicate who formulated it? There is apprehension abroad that it was not formulated by a Minister, Department or the Cabinet but by a financial institution which hardly distinguished itself in its bewildering corporate parts before the Committee of Public Accounts last year and which allegedly has an interest in one of the declared bidders for the transmission system. Is the digital automaton in the service of unnamed private investors? Will it be used to fleece the public? The Minister should do something about it now before it is too late.</P>
    <P>There are approximately one million television households in the State. The television network is valued at between £30 million and £60 million, or £30 to £60 per household. Television viewers have paid for this network through the licence fee over the years and are entitled to the benefit of it. The Government could liquidate that amount per household and give it to RTE for programmes. However, how much will the transmission service cost after it is sold off? The value of the network per household could save a great deal of household expense. The private company which buys the transmitters and sites will have to recover the cost from us sooner or later at a profit. If one were to ask each household whether it would like to sell its small holding in the network, it would vote to hold onto a good portion of it in order to ensure that it is not duped out of hundreds of pounds annually for a generation to come.</P>
    <P>Nothing in the new EU framework requires the divestment of the television network. Such decisions are based on competition rules, which are applied on a case by case basis. The new directives will call for separate accounting and regulations to ensure fair play by the network operator in dealing with different broadcasters. This is why the motion calls for a substantial shareholding to remain in public hands. There is no need for total buyout and there are some good reasons for keeping the network.</P>
    <P>Does the Broadcasting Bill only relate to television? It has caused some considerable consternation in the independent radio sector because radio network services are provided by RTE and many stations have contracted out the operation of transmitters to the State broadcaster. On the other hand, many local radio operators own sites which are not part of the RTE network. They need assurances regarding facilities which will be transferred to a new company. Local radio operators already deal with the RTE network in their role as telecommunications operators and wish to be regulated as such. In particular, they would prefer that the fees they are charged would be approved by the telecommunications regulator rather than by negotiation with a monopoly oper<Col N="1378" /> ator of prime transmission sites in Ireland. Such an arrangement will result from a new EU framework but is not yet in place.</P>
    <P>The definition of a &ldquo;broadcasting service&rdquo; in the legislation does not exclude the provision of sound services on digital terrestrial television. DTT is capable of such transmission just as sound services are already provided on digital satellite television. Band width has been made available for the independent television broadcaster to simulcast on digital television but no such provision has been made for independent radio, and broadcasters are understandably concerned. They do not want to be phased out following the introduction of new technology. Digital terrestrial radio is also a consideration. Ireland has been assigned two digital multiplexes under international agreements, which are capable of providing 12 channels of high fidelity sound directly to home and car receivers over the airwaves. However, there is no policy for the development of these channels and they are not mentioned in the Broadcasting Bill, 1999.</P>
    <P>The independent television sector has been damaged by the Minister's paralysis in decision making. In early summer 1999 she announced that she intended in the Bill to cap the amount of money RTE would be legally obliged to spend in the independent sector at £16 million. RTE then decided, on foot of this oral announcement, to go ahead and implement this change. Later last year, the Minister announced that she was trying to find another formula which was fairer to the independent television sector. Twelve months later, with the Bill still not passed into law, the independent sector finds itself in the invidious position of suffering from an RTE cap on spending which is either at the discretion of the Minister or is illegal. The 1993 Broadcasting Act still applies to an extent and if it does not apply, then RTE should be spending £20 million on independent production.</P>
    <P>Events have moved on since last summer. In December 1999, the Minister announced she had accepted the findings of the Ossie Kilkenny report in full.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>A much favoured son from the north county. This report identified independent television production as the greatest growth sector over the next five years, even greater than film, but if the Minister is unwilling to revisit her earlier statements, amend her proposal in the Bill and scrap the unworkable cap, the entire industry is in the dark about what RTE must do in 2000 and 2001. This creates a legal vacuum, it is impossible for companies to plan and it is a total and utter shambles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in the clarification of the Minister's views on RTE and her vision for the future. <Col N="1379" /> Those views do not appear to present any coherent vision of the multi-media future and RTE's and Ireland's place in it. As a consequence, if the Minister continues to do nothing, it is quite likely that neither Ireland nor RTE will have any place in that multi-media future. There will be no Irish voices to be heard, no Irish angle, no súil eile.</P>
    <P>Were the Minister to ask me what will be the importance of RTE in the future, I would tell her that RTE was formed to bring the first wave of electronic media to Ireland. It stood, and tries today to stand, as a guarantor to every citizen, however affluent or impoverished, that they will have access to a sustainable diet of information and entertainment from Ireland and the world at large. That is the concept I invite the Minister to embrace. That concept, more than the generalities of the Minister's Bill, justifies the funds we as a nation have given to RTE year after year. That is its job. That is the proper right and entitlement of every citizen of this State. That role is more important today than it ever was before.</P>
    <P>We are braced for a huge proliferation in media and the content available. RTE must be central to that. RTE must, in that hostile and challenging environment, do two things. It must ensure that there are articulate and culturally significant Irish voices to be heard in the avalanche of electronically delivered data and it must ensure that no citizen of this State becomes disadvantaged for want of that data. That guarantee has been honoured up to this point. The Minister has an obligation &ndash; ta brú agus dualgais ort &ndash; geassa, as it is called, and she cannot avoid it. She should not humiliate herself by trying to do so.</P>
    <P>These are big jobs. The good news is that RTE and TG4 are equal to the task. The bad news is that the Minister will not allow or empower them to address that challenge. The Minister tolerates, aids and abets a situation where RTE's strategic management is not free to manage. Her powers in this Bill are excessive and need to be addressed by her. RTE, operating in two channel land, faces a deficit of £9 million this year. Under the new regulation, with five channels to operate and relying more on commercial advertising, the station faces an increasing diet of globalisation. The children in the country are talking about movies, cookies, etc. Is the real Irish personality being protected by the Minister's actions?</P>
    <P>The Minister has done absolutely nothing for TG4. She would have it wholly dependent on her generosity in proposing an annual grant. She must explain to the country the reason she wants this station so dependent upon her good will. She should understand TG4 for what it is and for what it can be. The language has not fared well in recent years. The Minister's predecessor, the former Minister, Deputy Michael Higgins, realised this and piloted through the House, with some care, the concept of TG4 and its innovation. He followed that with a full rapporteur's report <Col N="1380" /> for the Joint Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language which this Minister seems to have ignored completely. The House at that time endorsed an enlightened policy. It decided that making a television service available in Irish was an appropriate cultural objective. That was the will of the Legislature. TG4 has been a remarkable success. Its staff and management deserve both our congratulations and gratitude but instead, with RTE, it is being starved economically.</P>
    <P>What the Minister has allowed to happen in terms of the Broadcasting Bill is unconscionable. There has clearly been a national imperative that the Bill should be instituted and working by now. Every day competitors source from abroad in a digital context and move ever nearer the roll-out of their own digital facilities. Once the east coast becomes comfortable with that, it will be more and more difficult for the RTE concept to achieve its objectives and meet its targets.</P>
    <P>A glaring anomaly that the Minister has not addressed is the position, in clusters, of our indigenous television services. The Minister should have addressed that issue by now. She will have received combined letters from TG4 and TV3 setting out their serious concerns in this area. I invite the Minister to deal with that issue in her reply.</P>
    <P>The announcement last night of the appointment of a facilitator to act in the digital terrestrial television discussions is carried in today's <i>Irish Independent.</i> The Minister said she was committed to consulting widely with those who were involved in the process of advancing DTT and that she has met representatives of all those likely to transfer to DTT within the past number of weeks. Did the Minister meet those people in Los Angeles? Was it in Mespil Road? Did she meet the people who came before the committee chaired by Deputy Carey or was it only the representatives of the persons involved in the transmission end of the RTE network?</P>

    <P>The Joint Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language is not the vehicle to deal with the amendments that are as broad and as fundamental as those now required. The committee would be able to pleat together a few strands here and there but it is unable to reweave the fabric of this Broadcasting Bill as is required.

      <P>Fine Gael's new found interest in digital broadcasting is, I suppose, a welcome development, but I find it a little hard to take from a party that was in Government for two and a half years but did not put forward one proposal in relation to this important development. Now, when pressed to have a view, it appears to be running with the hare and hunting with the hounds. Perhaps its policy, if one can call it that, owes less to logic than to the seasonal influence of the March hare. In this Alice in Wonderland approach adopted by Fine Gael to formulating policy on this issue, is it possible that the architect was the dormouse who spent most of his time dozing by the teapot?</P>
      <P>What an about turn Fine Gael has undergone from November to March. During the Second Stage debate on the Broadcasting Bill in November, Fine Gael transmitted the &ldquo;TV3 line&rdquo;. Now, in March, it is transmitting the &ldquo;RTE line&rdquo;&ndash; if a unified RTE line exists. One must ask Fine Gael whether the Mad Hatter has got at the zapper again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make a number of issues quite clear. Neither the Government nor I have changed our basic policy in relation to the introduction of digital terrestrial television. I have been forced to consider changes to the structure for developing this digital platform, following concerns expressed by the RTE Authority on the manner of the sale of the transmission network. I hope that by the end of my contribution this evening, the public will have a clearer idea why the debate on the Broadcasting Bill in this House has been delayed and who is mainly responsible. I assure the House that both the Government and I wish to proceed as quickly as possible with this Bill. The delays are not down to us. My primary con<Col N="1382" /> cern is the early roll-out of digital terrestrial television in Ireland. The Government wants Ireland to be at the forefront of these developments and that is my priority.</P>
    <P>Recent comments on the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, and on the policy context in which its provisions were framed vary, at best, from plain wrong to, at worst, deliberately misleading. Such unfortunate commentary reached a scandalous new low in a report in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> on 12 March last, in which Deputy Kenny was quoted as saying that 400 people could be made redundant from RTE as part of the process of establishing a digital terrestrial television platform.</P>

      <P>&mdash;inside and outside this House.</P>
      <P>Let us get a few things crystal clear. For the avoidance of further confusion, RTE itself is on record as saying that it must reduce its workforce by in excess of 300. This has nothing to do with the establishment of the digital platform under any scenario. The Government's proposals for the introduction of DTT and any changes that might have to be made to the stated policy in this regard will not result in a process which will make 400 people redundant.</P>
      <P>The Government supports and affirms the importance of public service broadcasting. I want to emphasise, once again, that no part of RTE's television service is being privatised. The Government believes that the public service broadcasting service should be guaranteed by a strong RTE as the national broadcaster and Teilifís na Gaeilge, which is commonly known as TG4, as a national Irish language television service. I am not contemplating any proposals that would change this position. Indeed, Part IV of the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, emphasises the public service character of the broadcasting service that RTE is expected to maintain.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to sell off the RTE transmission network at a &ldquo;knock down price&rdquo;, as reported in some newspapers. Indeed, the reason I am contemplating bringing forward procedural changes to the Government decision on the introduction of DTT is to ensure that RTE is facilitated in its own desire to achieve full market value as a going concern for its existing analogue transmission network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another spin in the commentary that has been appearing in the media recently that suggests I am plotting behind closed doors to change not only Government policy but also existing legislation. Again, nothing could be further from the truth. RTE has been part of the project management group all along. I have met members of the RTE Authority on this matter and will do so again shortly. My officials have met senior management on a number of occasions. RTE is fully aware that any change being contemplated to Government policy is being contemplated in order to allow RTE to achieve its objec<Col N="1384" /> tive of securing a market value for the transmission network. It also understands, I believe, that any change would be in the context of ensuring RTE's position as the public service broadcaster in the digital era.</P>
    <P>I have recently met representatives of the RTE network staff and the RTE trade union group. No changes have, as yet, been put to Government. Any changes I will bring forward will be informed by these discussions and discussion with Cabinet colleagues. Should these proposals necessitate changes in the stated policy or to the Bill, any such changes will be presented for full and open debate to this House in the appropriate way at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>I should say that at my meetings with the RTE trade union group and the RTE network employees, I was deeply concerned that rumour and misinformation, as well as the more outrageous media reports, had gained a certain currency among RTE staff. This, in turn, has made it difficult for the employee groups to develop an informed position on the issues that have arisen during the process of establishing a DTT platform. This is clearly creating difficulties in driving forward the project and I have acted at once to resolve this particular problem. I have engaged the services of a facilitator in order to promote a common understanding among RTE, the RTE trade union group and the RTE network employees of the public policy objective of Government and the factors that must be taken into account in the achievement of this objective, the difficulties that have arisen in the development of a transaction structure and the parameters within which the process can move forward.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that all the parties involved have welcomed this initiative. I hope this appointment will help bring greater clarity than appears to be the case at present, and facilitate the presentation of information to me of the positions of these parties. Deputies will agree that I have been extremely fortunate to secure the services of Mr. Philip Flynn to act as facilitator. Mr. Flynn is widely respected for his integrity and competence in difficult and complex situations, such as that which we are dealing with at present. I have asked Mr. Flynn to carry out his task with all possible speed and to report back to me in three weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The report in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> on this matter is inaccurate. Mr. Flynn has not been engaged, as was reported in the article, to resolve differences with RTE or to promote a common understanding between RTE and my Department. His task is as I described and he is not there to negotiate my <Col N="1385" /> position with any of the parties in RTE. The Government's policy on the introduction of DTT and the practical arrangements for realising that policy have been discussed in this House on a number of occasions. In order to set a context for the debate on this motion, it is necessary to run through them again. Deputies will also be aware that there may be a limited window of opportunity if DTT is to be able to compete successfully with other digital platforms such as satellite or cable television.</P>
      <P>The Government decided on 22 July 1998 that the existing analogue transmission function should be separated from RTE. Under the terms of the decision, a new entity would be created in which RTE would retain an equity stake that would be mandated to build and operate the DTT transmission infrastructure and to promote the development of multimedia services and the information society. The decision also provided that the manner of the sale, the selection of the purchaser and the criteria for such selection were to be decided by a group headed by me as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and including the Ministers for Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Public Enterprise and RTE. A project management group made up of representatives of the Ministers concerned and RTE was established on foot of the Government decision. Given the importance and complexity of the task, the project management group selected a consortium of advisers led by Allied Irish Banks Corporate Finance to advise on and manage the project to a conclusion under the direction of the group.</P>

      <P>As envisaged in the Government decision, the business of the DTT entity, which became known as Digico, would have consisted of two basic activities, transmission and multiplexing. The transmission activity would require Digico to invest in the upgrading of RTE's existing analogue transmission network in order for the network to be rendered capable of transmitting digital services. The capital cost of this upgrade was estimated at £40 million. In addition to the digital transmission business, Digico would continue to provide analogue transmission for RTE, Teilifís na Gaeilge and TV3. It would also provide transmission services for Today FM and a number of other independent sound broadcasters who have chosen to contract with RTE for transmission facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The multiplexing activity would consist of retailing a package of programming to subscribers in much the same way as cable television operators do at present. Digico would offer various tiers of programming drawn from existing indigenous free to air services, British television <Col N="1386" /> services and some premium sports and film services. There would be scope for new indigenous services to be developed and carried. The availability of set top boxes to convert the digital signal for analogue sets will be crucial to this activity. Digico would have been licensed to operate six multiplexes. RTE would be guaranteed access to one multiplex while TG4 and TV3 would each be guaranteed access to half of one multiplex. At the current state of technological development, each multiplex would have the capacity of up to five television channels. It is intended that some capacity on the multiplexes will be devoted to information services. This aspect will be regulated by the ODTR.</P>
    <P>The multiplexing activity will be competing with other digital platforms such as cable, MMDS and satellite for customers. The conventional wisdom is that in order to compete successfully the multiplex operator will have to heavily subsidise the set top boxes. For example, in Britain, satellite operator BSkyB and the DTT multiplex operator ONDIGITAL are giving the boxes away free.</P>
    <P>As envisaged in the Government decision, whoever was selected to invest in the transmission business would automatically be guaranteed the multiplex business. RTE does not have and does not operate a multiplex business. The advice given to me is that a bidder in this scenario, in making a bid for the existing analogue transmission business, could be expected to place a value on the multiplexing business additional to the value that the bidder might place on the transmission business alone. In order to achieve the Government's objective, and if the risk of challenge to the process on the grounds that the process effectively conferred a State aid on either RTE or the proposed digital entity is to be avoided, the transaction should be progressed on the basis of a predetermined value of the existing transmission business so that RTE's fair share of the combined transmission and multiplexing business can be determined.</P>
    <P>The RTE Authority has objected strongly to this approach and has indicated that its strong view is that the marketplace should determine the value of the RTE transmission business rather than a predetermined value based on an estimate of the value a prudent investor would place on the transmission business. The concerns of the RTE Authority cannot be lightly overridden. In addition, in the light of recent outcomes in the disposal of assets owned by State companies, Cablelink and the ESB stake in Ocean, for example, there is a strong argument in favour of allowing RTE to expose the existing analogue transmission business to the marketplace. There is a view that the only proper way of determining the true market value for the transmission business is to separate it from the multiplexing busi<Col N="1387" /> ness in order to avoid RTE possibly becoming the recipient of an unjustified windfall.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the transmission infrastructure and its relationship to RTE and to public service broadcasting. Since 1960, transmission has been an integral part of RTE. That was also true of the BBC in Britain up until 1996 when the British Government instructed the BBC to sell off its transmission network through a private treaty sale. However transmission and broadcasting were not necessarily synonymous in other European countries. In Britain, independent broadcasters never provided their own transmission. Furthermore, some transmission entities in the member states of the European Union formerly in State ownership are no longer in such ownership. Such States are, like ourselves, committed to the concept of public service broadcasting as evidenced by the inclusion of the Protocol on Public Service Broadcasting as an annex to the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the main argument as to why one would wish to see the transmission function as an integral part of the national broadcaster is to ensure the achievement of the concept of universal availability, a concept that is a basic characteristic of public service broadcasting. However, ownership of the transmission function by a broadcaster is not the only way to achieve universal availability. Effective licensing and regulation can achieve the same objective. It can be argued that in our case, RTE's position as transmitter operator as well as broadcaster is as much an accident of history as it is an element of broadcasting policy.</P>
    <P>The House should note it was not I or this Government that first mooted the idea of separating the transmission function from RTE and the disposal of part of its ownership by way of sale. RTE itself made the first move to change the concept of the transmission function from being an integral part of RTE. RTE had come to see the transmission function as an asset, the disposal of which, in part at least, could be exploited in order to generate funds for the organisation. It should also be remembered that the current proposals for the establishment of a DTT platform owe much to proposals circulated widely by RTE, which proposed the sale of the transmission network.</P>
    <P>RTE began to have second thoughts when it became clear that the advice to the project management group was that the proper way to proceed was through a process in which the value of the network business was predetermined. In order to deal with these concerns and to facilitate RTE in ensuring that a market price can be achieved, I have indicated to them that I am considering allowing them to expose their transmission business to the market. Surprisingly, however, RTE still seems reluctant to proceed. <Col N="1388" /> I do not have to ask who is the digital ditherer here.</P>
    <P>The original RTE proposal advocated that the retention by RTE of a substantial minority stake in the DTT entity would help to secure a public policy objective in that it would help ensure early and comprehensive roll-out of the infrastructure. The regulatory regime envisaged by the ODTR addressed this public policy obligation, regardless of who owns the transmission infrastructure. The question of whether RTE should maintain a minority stake in the transmission business as a stand-alone business is clearly not a matter of policy or, indeed, high politics. As I said earlier, RTE was the first to suggest partial disposal of these assets. It is simply a question of practically determining whether it is better for RTE to cash in the full value of its asset now at a time when it would be open to full competition and at a time of high interest in the market, or hold back a minority share now in the hope that it will increase in value in the future. I have to admit that there are arguments for and against both positions. It is, however, a simple practical choice as to which option is best for RTE and which will best deliver the Government's objectives in rolling out access to digital offerings as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>If a stake in transmission is a commercial investment on RTE's part, does this not beg the question as to when RTE itself may consider it commercially advantageous for it to divest itself entirely of any shareholding it may have? Clearly, to contemplate a scenario where RTE would not have an involvement in transmission is certainly not treason. If it were, I would be in good company &ndash; including perhaps the company of a number of other Members, from all sides &ndash; as I awaited the hangman's summons. I must also assume that it is a scenario somewhere in the back of RTE's mind for the future.</P>
    <P>As a result of these issues, I might well find it necessary to propose some changes of approach to Government. Of the 56 sections in the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, only four deal with the establishment and regulation of the DTT platform. Of course, the Bill provides for more than the establishment of a DTT entity. It also provides that RTE, TG4 and TV3 will be guaranteed access to a certain multiplex capacity. This situation will not change. In other words, the legislation will, if enacted, guarantee that our existing indigenous broadcasters will be in the driving seat when it comes to ensuring that their existing services are carried in digital form and that they have an opportunity of developing new digital services.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the regulation of the digital broadcasting sector from a broadcasting perspective through the expansion of the powers of the Independent Radio and Television Commission. This will not change.</P>
    <P>RTE's position as the national broadcaster, providing a public broadcasting service on radio <Col N="1389" /> and television will be clarified and, indeed, strengthened. I have made clear on many occasions since my appointment as Minister that I believe there is now a stronger argument than ever for public service broadcasting, providing programme schedules of quality and diversity, and catering for minority as well as mainstream tastes. I have not changed these beliefs.</P>
    <P>There are no proposals that would deprive viewers and listeners in this country of their access to RTE services. The Bill provides and will continue to provide for guaranteed availability of these services and of the services of our other indigenous broadcasters in digital form. The availability of these services in analogue form is also assured. That assurance will remain in place for as long as there is a significant demand for analogue services. In addition, RTE, TG4 and TV3 will have access to a share of the additional capacity created by the introduction of digital terrestrial television.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides enabling powers for the establishment of TG4 in its own right. This will not change. Apart from the statutory basis for the station provided in the Bill, the separation of TG4 from RTE will require a significant amount of careful planning and discussion. My Department and TG4 have commenced discussions on the resources needed to maintain a national Irish language television service, with a strong and comprehensive Irish language schedule at its heart, as a separate statutory entity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny has criticised me for not including provisions relating to digital audio broadcasting in the Bill. As I have indicated in responses to parliamentary questions in the House, before consideration can be given to establishing digital audio broadcasting, otherwise known as DAB, in Ireland it will be necessary to develop a national policy for its introduction. This will require extensive consultation with all relevant organisations in the sound broadcasting sector, including RTE, the Independent Radio and Television Commission, the ODTR, the independent local and national radio operators and community stations.</P>
    <P>My current priority in the broadcasting area is the enactment of the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, and the introduction of DTT. As I have said already, we may have a limited window of opportunity for DTT so it is important to progress the matter quickly. When this has been achieved I will pursue the consultation process referred to. I am aware that the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland had expressed considerable misgivings about the Bill and the effect its provisions might have on the availability of frequencies for DAB. I have met representatives of the IBI and my Department has had detailed discussions on this issue. It is my intention to meet the group again. In their latest letter to me, the IBI have suggested <Col N="1390" /> an amendment which would clarify that the Bill does not deal with DAB.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, if it should prove necessary to propose amendments to the Broadcasting Bill in relation to the introduction of the digital terrestrial broadcasting platform, any such amendments will not fundamentally change the overall objective of the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, as passed on Second Stage, or the policy context in which it was drafted.</P>
    <P>As a result of the difficulties in developing a transaction structure for the selection of a suitable investor in the DTT entity, it is necessary now to give some consideration to following the example of Britain and Sweden in the establishment of a DTT platform through the creation of two designated companies instead of one. If this option were to be taken, an RTE shareholding, as a right, in the multiplexing or retailing business does not arise. The question of an RTE shareholding in the transmission business, as I have already said, is nothing more perhaps than a question of timing for RTE itself.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the policy context in which the Broadcasting Bill, 1999 was drafted, envisaged an RTE stake of up to 40% in the combined Digico business. However, I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that section 5(5) of the Bill, as currently before the Oireachtas, clearly envisages that RTE could decide to sell any holding it might have retained in the business. Accordingly, the high dudgeon that we have seen displayed on this issue in the media smacks of empty posturing rather than any serious policy considerations.</P>
    <P>It is time to stop generating hot air on this issue. It is time also to realise that what is happening is simply the development of a policy on a complex issue that will deal with the practical difficulties encountered. The empty posturing that has been a feature of this debate over the past few weeks does nothing to progress developments in this important and urgent area. I hope that following this debate we can get back to the real work of providing a framework for the introduction of digital broadcasting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Michael D. Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom mo chomhchairdeas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Ó Cionnaith as ucht an rún seo a thógaint os comhair na Dála. Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh an t-eolas go léir os comhair an Tigh seo agus gan muidne a bheith ag braith ar rudaí a thagann amach sna nuachtáin anois is arís. I compliment Deputy Kenny for bringing this motion before the Dáil. This House has been shamefully treated in relation to this Bill. Much time, as Deputy Kenny pointed out, went into the consultations that took place and the submissions that were made to the Select Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language. <Col N="1391" /> The Department or the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands then decided to leak to the media and the situation changed and chaos ensued in terms of what happened in RTÉ. The Minister has admitted that this was the case.</P>
    <P>As a democrat I believe that when fundamental changes are envisaged &ndash; and whatever the Minister may say what she proposes here is fundamental change &ndash; they should be communicated to the Houses of the Oireachtas before they are leaked to media sources and various spins are put on them. The Minister has no one to blame but herself for the mess in which she now finds herself. The broadcasting Bill which was published by the Government last May bears no relation whatever to the proposals which have been outlined by the Minister tonight. This change in approach is something which brings about a fundamental change in the Bill. I base that remark on this point: when we strip away other aspects of the Bill the remaining, fundamental part of the Bill relates to what will happen to the transmission network.</P>
    <P>Originally the Minister had agreed to give RTÉ a 40% stake in Digico but, for reasons known only to the Minister and the Government, in spite of what she said to us, it is not clear where the motivation came from for the changes. The Labour Party believes the national television transmission network should remain in public ownership. We should transform the transmission network into a commercial semi-State company which would sell its service to television companies at market prices. It does not make any sense to sell such a valuable public asset given the revenue it could earn in years to come.</P>
    <P>The Government's obsession with privatisation seems to have no limit. My party has no difficulty with the introduction of competition in the public interest in many sectors. Competition has transformed performance in many areas of the economy. However, turning public monopolies into private monopolies is anti-competitive and contrary to the public interest. Natural monopolies, such as the transmission network or the electricity grid, should remain in some form of public control and the Minister would be well advised to examine the recent course followed by her colleague the Minister for Public Enterprise, Depupty O'Rourke, in relation to the electricity distribution network.</P>
    <P>In the past, lack of capital has determined the State's role as a shareholder in public enterprises. However, that problem should no longer apply. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, should withdraw her present proposals and fundamentally rethink her position on the issue. As the Minister with responsibility for RTÉ, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, has a duty to protect the public interest but has gone out of her way to do the opposite. <Col N="1392" /> In the process she has undermined RTE and its ability to map out a future for national broadcasting as we enter the digital age.</P>
    <P>It is now almost a year since the broadcasting Bill was published. During that time the Select Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language conducted lengthy and in-depth consultations on the basis that RTE would have a 40% share of Digico. Many interest groups made submissions and presentations to the committee on the basis of the original Bill but since the Minister has moved the goalposts there is a case for recalling these groups on the grounds that the broadcasting Bill has been fundamentally altered. There are many good reasons the broadcasting Bill should be withdrawn and replaced with a new Bill.</P>
    <P>The decision by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, on Monday night, to appoint Mr. Phil Flynn as mediator between RTE and her Department has been clarified by her speech and I accept that. I do not in any way underestimate Mr. Flynn's well noted skills, but he is to report to the Minister in three weeks and I must ask with what will he return which will alter the current position? I see this appointment as a reaction to the Fine Gael motion. The amendment proposed by the Fianna Fáil Party, which states that &ldquo;Dáil Éireann welcomes the Government's decision to arrange for the establishment of a digital-terrestrial platform&rdquo; is akin to saying that the Dáil favours motherhood. It is a meaningless sentence to include.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>We understood from the media reports, and the Minister has corrected us, that he had some kind of mediating role. He is seeking to get the Minister's point of view across to RTÉ and its unions. That does not advance the situation one iota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an amendment to the motion put down by Fine Gael and we are seeking to have the transmission asset transferred to a commercial semi-State body. There are many important reasons for this. One of them is that technology in this area keeps galloping forward. None of us in this Chamber knows what will happen over the next six months, the next year and so on. It could well be that the network will have a significant <Col N="1393" /> added value in quite a short time. The State should benefit from that. The ownership of the asset should remain with the State because an established semi-State body can make the requisite or necessary contractual, franchising or other arrangements with broadcasters. Its ultimate role would be to maximise the return to the State from this particular asset.</P>
    <P>The question arises as to what happens in relation to RTÉ and then there is the matter of the valuation. I am not sure what the Minister has in mind in terms of letting the market decide the price. Suppose the market decides there is only one contender? This could be in the form, say, of a strategic partner, as the Minister put it or as is apparently proposed by her now, though she has not clearly stated her position. If, however, the agenda is to privatise the asset, how do we operate this market mechanism to establish the value of the asset? As Deputy Higgins would say, the concept of the notional value into the future is part of arriving at a valuation of an asset such as this.</P>
    <P>The amendment compliments the Minister on her efforts to date to devise an appropriate structure. That is bland nonsense, as a Bill published last May and which was the result of a great deal of work is now in chaos and there is a filler of sorts for three weeks until the Minister gets a report from Mr. Flynn. None of us knows what that report will achieve, but obviously the Minister will not address the possibility of amendments until that three week period has passed. There are approximately 1.25 million households in the State and of that figure, 510,000 households are receiving either cable or MMDS systems. There are indications that cable companies are to move into providing digital services. I despair completely of seeing the revised Bill or amendments before the summer recess, so are we in danger of not having dealt with the legislation in the Dáil by the end of this year? This is in the context of having a Second Stage debate with the expectation that the move towards digital television would happen towards the end of this year. There are other technologies, such as satellite television, and the market may be gone by the time we put digital terrestrial television in place.</P>
    <P>Companies with MMDS franchises are not interested in going to isolated areas where there are few houses or where there may be a technical difficulty in providing a signal. Digital television is the superior technology in this regard, which means that digital terrestrial television should be received in areas where a signal is not being provided. It is not a question of a bad signal being available but rather that none is available. There is also the deflector system sector, which is filling a gap at present. These operators have short-term licences and the Minister should address the question of what will happen to deflector operators when digital television comes on stream. There are undoubtedly areas where a system will not be provided unless an analog deflector system is available. Will there be a future for these local <Col N="1394" /> companies in relation to digital terrestrial television?</P>
    <P>I am appalled by the mess this area is in and I blame the Minister. As an elected Member I am appalled and offended that the Department &ndash; and the Minister, who has the final responsibility &ndash; chooses to conduct its business through media leaks rather than respecting the primacy of the Legislature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Shea for sharing his time. I too congratulate Deputy Kenny on drawing attention to the issues now before us in the matter of digital broadcasting and RTE's position in particular.</P>
      <P>It would have helped if the Minister, while supporting the self-congratulatory amendment, had told us how she had arrived at her policy decision. For example, on what basis is the transmission system held? How was it funded and built, in whose name is it held and in what national and international legal regime is it held? The Minister did not do that. Late in her speech she made a gesture towards public service broadcasting when saying she believes there is now a stronger argument than ever for public service broadcasting, providing programmes and schedules of quality and diversity in catering for minority as well as mainstream taste.</P>
      <P>That statement is correct and we would all like to think it is true. However, what a nonsense it is to suggest one can take public service broadcasting and put it in a ghetto and then imagine that all other broadcasting activities and multimedia services that will surround it in what was previously a nationally accountable asset will have no effect on it. It is extraordinary.</P>
      <P>It is also interesting that RTE, uniquely, is expected to sell the transmission asset at a price which is an existing use value. In stock exchanges all over the world not a single technology company in the known world is selling or valuing its assets in terms of current earnings. Every one, including those involved in mad speculation, is based on potential value. Why is RTE to be treated differently? I suspect it is because RTE was originally a company accountable to the State. It is an extraordinary ideological position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea finished by saying these matters should be debated in the Oireachtas rather than in the shadows of aeroplanes and airports. However, I am not surprised because when I was a Minister and the present Minister was in Opposition she had the appalling Fianna Fáil habit of saying: &ldquo;I am not sure if it is true or not but I have heard&rdquo; or &ldquo;There is an impression abroad.&rdquo;  There is an impression abroad that there is absolute chaos in broadcasting. People also remember the extraordinary atmosphere of vindictiveness which Fianna Fáil has always brought to broadcasting. Before we resume tomorrow people should reflect on the Burke era in broadcasting. People should think about whether he, when Minister, was always motivated by the highest principles of Lord Reith or public service broad<Col N="1395" /> casting or how we would meet the highest international broadcasting standards and whether there was always an element of being able to tell RTE how to behave and, if it did not, how discomfiture could be quickly imposed. I will leave that aside now, but I would be less than honest if I did not say it was background factor.</P>
    <P>When the Minister discusses digital terrestrial television she will recall that I and others welcomed the decision &ndash; I still do &ndash; that DTT was the way to roll out the digital transition. She had my support on that. However, she should remember the argument we all put forward for doing so: universality of access and the nearest one could get to the television set commonly held. How can she say she accepts that principle while at the same time splitting the multiplex operation from the transmission system in such a way that those who will have a dominant position in the multiplex operation will be able to grind the public service broadcasting product into the ground? That simply does not make sense.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Owen, Stanton, Rabbitte and Higgins and the other Deputies who contributed to the debate on the Bill. Both the Minister and I agree that we had a fair, open and lengthy debate on the Bill which we believe has been improved as a result of the amendments made to it. The manner is which the House dealt with the Bill is a credit to the democratic process. I also thank the National Minimum Wage Commission and the many other organisations who participated in the intensive consultative process which resulted in publication of this Bill. The process could be described as representing partnership in action. I thank the departmental officials, Maurice Cashell, Ciarán Ó Cuinnegán and Maurice Nagle.</P>
      <P>The Bill adopts a balanced approach which achieves its objectives of protecting vulnerable workers from exploitation and which also ensures that the price for that protection will not result in job losses. The Bill will result in tens of thousands of workers, particularly vulnerable groups such as women and young people, receiving a pay rise which will reflect our concern that they should share in the economic benefits achieved in recent years. The Government is fully honouring its commitment to introduce a national minimum wage, the introduction of which marks an important step in recognising the contribution made by the low paid to our economic development. Together with the tax changes which will come into effect next week, the introduction of the minimum wage represents the Government's determination to have a caring as well as a modern economy.</P>

Reference was made on a number of occasions to the Government's decision to tax the minimum wage, thereby taking a lot of the good out of it. I again urge the Minister and the Minister of State to do all they can to ensure that this will cease as soon as possible because, as it stands, the Government will be the winners to the tune of £70 million or more in additional rev<Col N="1398" /> enue. That represents a sleight of hand on the Government's part and I urge the Minister of State to do all he can to reverse the decision to tax the minimum wage.

The Bill received a reasonable level of scrutiny on Committee Stage, at the end of which it was evident that the Opposition had gone as far as it could. The Bill is a better Bill now than it was when it was first published. I am not entirely persuaded that the Bill will have the predicted dramatic effect on the thousands of workers who will be affected by it and I regret that the element in respect of shift premium remains allowable for calculable purposes.

      <P>I welcome the fact that the concept of a minimum wage is now enshrined in legislation. I have campaigned for it for many years. What has been achieved is merely the beginning. It is clear that low paid workers are on the march. The Government should learn from the absolute frustration of the bus workers who are saying they cannot carry the burden of low pay any longer.

        <b>:</b> A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise the closure of Wenaas clothing company in Enniscorthy. Enniscorthy and County Wexford have <Col N="1399" /> one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. The national average is between 4% and 5% while the average in Wexford is between 12% and 15%. The loss of over 40 jobs with the closure of the Wenaas clothing company has been a devastating blow to Enniscorthy and County Wexford. The company was involved in Enniscorthy for many years &ndash; it was known as the Janelle factory before it was taken over by Wenaas. The management of Wenaas has decided the company will close its operations in Enniscorthy, with the loss of up to 40 jobs, mainly those of skilled women.</P>
      <P>This is a serious blow to the town which has caused a great deal of resentment. In the past three years, despite the Celtic tiger economy and the creation of thousands of jobs around the country, no new jobs have been announced for Enniscorthy and County Wexford. It is totally unacceptable that when the country is booming, there is not an even spread of new jobs around the country. The company has decided to close the factory and operate it as a distribution depot. The clothing will be manufactured in another country, brought back to Enniscorthy and redistributed throughout Ireland. This is unacceptable and I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, to ask the State agencies what can be done to save the jobs at this late stage. I appreciate it will be difficult because the company management seems adamant that the closure will go ahead.</P>
      <P>It is a shame that such highly skilled staff will now be thrown on the dole queues with no hope of finding jobs in other factories because they are particularly skilled in manufacturing clothing. It is imperative that the State agencies create a replacement industry for Enniscorthy as quickly as possible. We need an industry to replace the Wenaas clothing company but we also need an advance factory. Some time ago, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, promised Enniscorthy an advance factory in 2000. Little has been said about this in the first three months of the year. I ask the Minister of State to comment on the progress of this advance factory. Is it expected to be built this year? If it is not, there will be political uproar in Enniscorthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment established a task force in County Wexford, headed by the county manager. Its report has been finalised and is in the Minister's Department for consideration. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will be in Wexford this Friday to meet with the task force and local politicians. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to request that the Minister meets a delegation from Enniscorthy Urban Council and the local public representatives, Deputy Yates and I, regarding the closure of Wenaas and the proposed advance factory. It is <Col N="1400" /> imperative that this meeting takes place when the Minister is in the county next Friday.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that Enniscorthy continues to lose jobs while in the past three years, thousands of jobs have been created around the country. We are not sharing in the increased employment resulting from economic growth. Wexford has the required infrastructure &ndash; Rosslare Port is the gateway to Europe. We have been unfairly treated by the State agencies, including the IDA and Forbairt. Direct intervention from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is necessary to ensure Enniscorthy and County Wexford receive their share of jobs in the future. I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment that we are no longer prepared to accept the delay in providing much needed jobs for the people of County Wexford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I share fully his disappointment at the announcement of the job losses in the Wenaas plant, Enniscorthy, County Wexford. Wenaas Ireland was established in Enniscorthy in 1986 to produce high performance workwear for the European and Scandinavian markets. In recent years, the company also developed a significant customer base for tendered contracts for public bodies such as Eircom and the ESB. The parent company, Sigmunel Wenaas, is a Norwegian family-owned business and it also has operations in low-cost eastern European locations such as Poland and Lithuania. The Irish operation has been experiencing difficulties for some time due to the fact that the parent company could source its production from these plants in Poland and Lithuania more cost effectively.</P>
      <P>Wenaas Ireland, which employed 51 people at 31 December 1999, has decided to restructure its plant at Enniscorthy. Manufacturing will, unfortunately, cease at the plant within days with eight people remaining in sales and distribution. FÁS has been in contact with Wenaas and has offered to put at their immediate disposal the following FÁS placement services. Interviews will be conducted with all those being made redundant. Access to FÁS job vacancies will be provided. Information and guidance will be provided on all FÁS interventions, for example, training programmes, schemes, courses, etc. In consultation with the company, and having identified the needs of the individuals, FÁS will consider the provision of special training programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overseas clothing and textile industry in Ireland has been in decline with employment declining from 6,700 people in 1998 to 4,170 people currently. The underlying factor in this continuing employment decline is a lack of competitiveness, particularly in the clothing sector <Col N="1401" /> where labour costs are high compared with alternative locations in north Africa and eastern Europe. It is anticipated that the industry will continue to decline over the next three to five years as companies continue to relocate to lower labour cost locations to remain competitive.</P>
    <P>Recent closures in the sector highlight that, notwithstanding the recent success of the economy, retaining competitiveness in an international context remains a continuing challenge. Ireland needs to focus its efforts on attracting industry in sectors where we can effectively compete in a global economy. The emphasis for Ireland must be to concentrate on upskilling and retraining the workforce to meet the demands of this changing environment. The recent budget decision to establish a major new national training fund amounting to £120 million in 2000 is an indication of the Government's commitment.</P>
    <P>In September last, my Government colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, established the Wexford enterprise initiative to assist local interests to identify means of promoting a greater level of industrial investment, including attracting mobile international investment, into the Wexford region. This initiative is chaired by the county manager and includes representatives from IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, FÁS, representatives from commercial and business interests in Wexford, the education sector, social partners and the local authority.</P>
    <P>The group has recently completed its report which will be formally presented to the Tánaiste when she visits Wexford later this week. This report, which is the result of the dedicated commitment and efforts of members of the enterprise initiative, sets out recommendations for the economic development of Wexford. I assure Deputy Browne that these recommendations will receive close consideration and attention from the Tánaiste, the Department and the relevant State agencies. I also assure Deputy Browne that I will convey his sentiments to the Tánaiste who meet the various interests in Wexford on Friday when she officially and formally receives the report. I will convey the Deputy's desires to the Tánaiste that he wishes her to meet Enniscorthy Urban District Council representatives, together with local Deputies. I am sure the Tánaiste will be pleased to outline to the group the current situation pertaining to the proposed advance factory in Enniscorthy.</P>
    <P>The development agencies continue to emphasise County Wexford for new employment opportunities and will do everything possible to try to secure alternative employment opportunities for the Wenaas workers in the greater Enniscorthy area.</P>

      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise the need for an urgent review of Garda numbers and, therefore, Garda visibility in the Inishowen peninsula, a region which is now a suburb of Derry city with the associated social difficulties of a major city.</P>
      <P>Over the past ten days we have had two extremely disturbing and totally unrelated incidents in Inishowen. One was an unprecedented take-over of Moville by more than 600 drunken youths on St. Patrick's Day, for which no one was charged. The second and most recent event was the disturbances in Buncrana over the weekend which led to gardaí being hospitalised and those who carried out the attack being released.  The influx, unchallenged, of 15 busloads from Derry on St. Patrick's Day led to unrivalled scenes of under age drinking and unparallelled and appalling scenes that, suffice to say, it is miraculous no one died. Should there be further occasions such as this, we may not be so fortunate. Moville, a town that once had 28 gardaí, now has a Garda strength of nine gardaí and a sergeant. Given the shift nature of the work, we expect three people to deal with this situation. Is that realistic or fair?</P>
      <P>The town of Buncrana is astounded at what happened there last weekend. As in Moville, for months, locals implored the Garda hierarchy for more support for the town, particularly at the weekends, before someone would be killed. Yet, even after someone was killed in the town, we had local gardaí on Saturday night put in a position where, having been called to the scene of a fight, they were set upon by a number of men from outside the jurisdiction. The adequacy of our personnel was reflected in the fact that gardaí from Burnfoot, Clonmany and Carndonagh had to come to Buncrana to assist the small number of personnel who were on duty in this large town, leaving their own busy disco areas vulnerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sergeant Brian O'Sullivan was hospitalised with a broken bone in his neck and very severe bruising &ndash; the second time he has been hospitalised recently in the course of duty. Gardaí Tom McDonagh, James Canning and Brendan Joyce were also injured. While I wish them a speedy recovery, I praise the efforts of the gardaí in the course of their work and commend the fact that eight people were arrested. It has astonished the entire population of the peninsula that despite the fact that this was a violent assault and not a small breach of the peace, these eight people have been released almost as soon as they were caught. I am not privy to what takes place <Col N="1403" /> between the DPP and the Garda, but it is vital that this case is pursued, those charged brought to justice and made pay for what has been a very serious crime against not just our police force, but our town and peninsula. The releases are a very demoralising blow to those who were injured in the course of doing their jobs and it is a poor example for the local people who see that violence on the streets and serious assaults on the gardaí are, it appears, offences that one can expect to get away with. I call on the Minister to gain answers for all those who at this time are quite speechless.</P>
    <P>I have spoken often to Ministers and senior and junior figures within the Garda at both local and national level about our mainly alcohol related difficulties that are intensifying in their repetition and seriousness. The situation is spiralling out of control. I call tonight, Minister, for a change in attitude and a review by the authorities. I call for answers. If we have enough gardaí in Inishowen per head of population, why, when a difficulty arises in one part of the peninsula, have gardaí to leave equally vulnerable areas to support their colleagues? Why am I often told there are not enough personnel to deal with the situation? </P>
    <P>When minor issues cannot be resolved, the message being sent to the larger hinterland is quite clear. Look at our geographical position and our role as the social focus for 100,000 plus people in a time when the spending power of sterling is extremely strong. We need an increase in personnel throughout the peninsula. We need a minimum fine brought in for public order offences that will act as a serious deterrent. We need a prison van, a paddy wagon, for the peninsula and improved facilities for the gardaí who operate in Inishowen. We need a concerted review of the cases brought to attention here tonight and action taken as a result to ensure that examples are made and repetition is not allowed. Our gardaí deserve proper resources and the people of Inishowen deserve a well resourced and visible police force. Not to react now would be to condone what is a progressively deteriorating situation. I cannot be party to inaction. I wish well, all those who were injured at the weekend and those people who send their loved ones out every day in the course of their duty and who are set upon in such a violent and unprovoked manner. This is unacceptable. We need help and I ask that the situation be reviewed as a matter of urgency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a long tradition of Northern Ireland people coming across the Border to Buncrana and to other parts of County Donegal. <Col N="1404" /> This has been to the mutual advantage of both sides. The citizens of Buncrana and of Border counties in Northern Ireland such as Derry have benefited economically and socially from this relationship. This mutually beneficial relationship is certainly much valued by both groups. However, it became obvious last weekend that a certain group of individuals do not value or respect this traditional relationship and friendship which has developed down through the years.</P>
    <P>Last weekend 40 young men travelled from Northern Ireland to Buncrana to attend a stag party. After being thrown out of a disco for their unruly behaviour, they viciously attacked several members of the gardaí who had been called in to try to control their behaviour. As a result of these violent and vicious attacks, three members of the gardaí had to receive medical attention. One had to have several stitches to his face. Furthermore, a garda sergeant had to be detained in Letterkenny hospital suffering from facial injuries, a broken bone in his neck and a suspected broken jaw, all sustained in the incident. Reinforcements arrived from surrounding towns. Eventually order was restored and eight men who were the ringleaders were arrested and taken to Buncrana and Burnfoot Garda stations. At 11.30 a.m. the same morning, the DPP's office was contacted by the gardaí and at 1.45 p.m. the call was returned. Having been briefed on the circumstances, the official directed that all eight men be released and a file be forwarded when ready so that a decision could be given. The official pointed out that while the gardaí involved may have regarded this as a serious incident, his office regarded it as a relatively minor affair. All eight men were released and returned to Northern Ireland. Despite the appalling injuries and the viciousness of the attack, the DPP allowed these dangerous individuals to flee across the Border and escape any repercussions for their reprehensible actions. It is unlikely they will face repercussions in the future as they are now safely outside the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I cannot begin to comprehend the actions of the DPP in this instance. How could his office possibly classify such a violent action as a relatively minor incident? If it was such a minor incident why was it necessary to send for reinforcements from surrounding towns? Were it not for these reinforcements and several brave members of the Buncrana public who aided the Garda, this relatively minor incident could have resulted in even more serious injuries to the individuals involved.</P>
    <P>Does the DPP's office really think the friends and families of the injured gardaí classify this as a relatively minor incident? It is not a minor incident and to classify it as such is a slap in the face to the Garda and the citizens of Buncrana. The brave men in the Garda did their job and risked their own well-being to quell the incident of the past weekend. <Col N="1405" /> Why was it so difficult for the DPP's office to do his job and detain the eight individuals arrested in the attack so that they could be charged with the crimes they committed? The DPP has clearly undermined the authority of the Garda as a result of his actions. His office has sent a clear message that it is acceptable to attack members of the Garda. It is not acceptable and the DPP owes them and the citizens of Buncrana an answer for his actions.</P>

        <b>: </b>The decision by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to order the release of the eight people from Northern Ireland arrested for disturbances in Buncrana on Saturday night as alluded to by Deputies Keaveney and McGinley has been irresponsible, misguided and an absolute disgrace. The five gardaí on duty in Buncrana on Saturday night who were called to break up the fight between the 40 young people who travelled across the Border in two buses from Dungiven, County Derry, deserve to be commended, but they have been badly thanked for their toil and efforts. As has been said, when they intervened they were mercilessly attacked and set upon. The garda sergeant is in hospital with fractures to the neck and serious facial injuries. Three other gardaí were kicked and punched and required stitches to the face. Eight people were arrested. At 11.30 a.m. on Sunday the Garda sought the permission of the DPP's office to press charges, but they were ordered to release the men immediately.</P>
      <P>I was contacted by a very angry garda sergeant, Chris Lavan, who speaks for himself and his force. They are extremely angry that the reason advanced, as Deputy McGinley has said, for the DPP's attitude in releasing the men was that it was a relatively minor incident. One garda has a broken neck, facial injuries and stitches while others are badly bruised. The attitude of the DPP's office is grossly irresponsible and is a disgrace. How can gardaí who are brutally attacked while trying to uphold law and order be expected to perform their duty when their position is not underpinned by the other office of the State, the prosecution system, that of the DPP? The people involved should have been detained, charged and remanded in custody or let out on bail. We want to ascertain from the DPP the reason the authority of the Garda has been so undermined by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in this episode. We must never have a repeat of this incident or attitude from the DPP's office.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Keaveney, McGinley and Jim Higgins for raising this important matter. I am sure the entire House will join with me in wishing the injured gardaí a speedy recovery. It is completely unacceptable <Col N="1406" /> that gardaí should be subject to assaults while in the course of their duties.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that last Saturday night, two groups of men travelled from Derry to Buncrana to attend a stag party in a local night club. During the course of the night a serious disturbance occurred on the premises. One group, consisting of about 15 persons, was ejected from the premises. The disorder continued outside the premises and the Garda in Buncrana was called to restore order.</P>
      <P>One sergeant and four gardaí responded immediately to the call for assistance. On arrival the gardaí were attacked by the group. They were beaten with fists and two of them were repeatedly kicked and beaten. Reinforcements were called from adjoining stations. As a result of this incident four members of the Garda Síochána stationed in Buncrana required medical attention. Eight men were arrested and subsequently released without charge. A file on the matter is being forwarded to the DPP.</P>
      <P>The prosecution of offences and the preparation and presentation of prosecution cases are functions which are prescribed in law on the Director of Public Prosecutions. The director is independent in the discharge of his statutory duties. The House will, therefore, understand that it would be inappropriate for the Minister to comment on any decision to be made by the DPP.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's comments on Garda strength, anyone who has studied the Government's achievements in office will need no convincing of its determination to provide the Garda with all the resources it needs to combat anti-social behaviour. Garda strength has been consistently increased. From a base line of 10,800, Garda numbers have increased by 600. The Minister is on target to achieve a strength of 12,000 by 2002.</P>
      <P>The detailed deployment of Garda personnel to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities. As of 21 March 2000, the number of gardaí of all ranks in the division of Donegal is 435. Of these, 34 are stationed in Buncrana. Garda strength in the division is kept under constant review by the Garda authorities in the light of the resources available and the policing needs of other locations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is assured by the Garda authorities that the laws on anti-social behaviour are being fully enforced by the Garda. The Garda has extensive powers under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, and the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, to deal with late night drinking and disturbances. For instance, it is an offence under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act for a person to engage in unreasonable behaviour likely to cause serious offence or annoyance between the hours of midnight and 7 a.m. or at any other time, having been requested by a member of the Garda Síochána to desist. Under the <Col N="1407" /> Act, the Garda also has the power to seize intoxicating liquor or other substance from persons they suspect are committing an offence under the Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that under section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, which deals with the offence of intoxication in a public place, proceedings were commenced in 9,334 cases and 7,176 convictions were obtained in the year 1998 alone, the last year for which statistics are published. He is assured by the Garda authorities that the legislation is enforced countrywide by the Garda in a uniform manner. The Minister is also informed by the Garda authorities that the current manpower strength in the division is adequate to meet the demands placed on it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the concerns expressed by Deputies this evening and I know the Garda have the support of all sides of the House in their strenuous efforts to deal with the reprehensive behaviour witnessed in Buncrana last weekend.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Schools Refurbishment.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important matter, that financial assistance be made available to Kilmactranny national school which is in urgent need of funding for structural improvements and also that extensive works be carried out on the school grounds which are in a deplorable condition. To verify this case I had photographs taken, which clearly illustrate the position, which I shall give to the Minister following this debate.</P>
      <P>The following list outlines a number of shortcomings to Kilmactranny school building and its surrounding play area. The prefabricated building used by the senior classes does not comply with fire regulations as it has only one entrance-exit; the building is limited in space for even a small group of children at any one time; one window is in need of replacement, as the photograph will illustrate, while others need maintenance; the junior classroom in the main school building is cramped and needs to be extended further into the adjacent room. This room is also used by the visiting remedial teacher and serves as a cramped lunch room on wet days. The wainscoting on the walls is decayed and needs to be removed and a plastered wall put in place. The application for funding for this school has been with the Department for the past 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of windows leak and all the windows need maintenance to protect them from weathering. The outside play area is inadequate. It is very cramped and limited in area and the children are deprived of a chance to play games properly. The tarmac surface to the front of the school building has subsided in some areas and is very rough and uneven. Another small section has a concrete finish with numerous cracks which can cause chil<Col N="1408" /> dren to fall. The grassy area to the rear is waterlogged most of the year. This means that children must play in one overcrowded area.</P>
    <P>The school is located at a crossroads and due to the limited play area available to children balls are constantly rolling into the road, posing a considerable threat to the children's safety and making supervision very difficult. The wire fencing surrounding the yard is in need of repair. Ideally, the school grounds should be extended to provide a play area. This is a two teacher school with up to 40 children. I appeal to the Minister to act on the proposals which have been submitted to his Department.</P>
    <P>The lunch room area which is also used by the remedial teacher is infested with mice and rats. It is difficult to believe that such conditions can exist in the new millennium. I may not show photographs in the House but I will give the Minister photographs for his inspection. When he sees these photographs it will be unnecessary for me to say any more. I was shocked by my visit to the school. The concern of the parents is immense and the teachers are thoroughly dedicated. However, the school is totally inadequate. The children can hardly use the playground which has a 30 degree slope. These conditions would have been more appropriate to a school of the early 19th century.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Minister will react favourably to this case. In view of the Minister's commitment to education and the Government's investment in it, I am sure the Minister will respond positively to the Kilmactranny school application. This issue is of major concern to parents, teachers and everyone in the Kilmactranny area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Perry for raising this important matter as it affords me an opportunity to clarify the position regarding the provision of funding towards improvement works at Kilmactranny national school.</P>
      <P>The school's current accommodation consists of two permanent classrooms and one prefabricated unit. At present Kilmactranny school has a staffing level of principal plus one assistant. The school authorities applied to the Department of Education and Science for various improvement works at the school. In accordance with normal procedures, the planning and building unit of the Department is assessing the future accommodation requirements of the school. On completion of this examination the matter will be progressed further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there is a very large number of school building projects on hand in the Department of Education and Science. Due to the priority which the Government has given to reversing the previous neglect of our primary schools, the spending estimates show primary school building and renovation funding <Col N="1409" /> increasing by an unprecedented 186% from the 1997 budget allocation. In addition, we have significantly reduced the burden of fundraising faced by schools and communities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the application by Kilmactranny national school will be dealt with as <Col N="1410" /> quickly as possible having regard to the large number of school building projects on hand in the Department of Education and Science. I will undertake to relay as explicitly as I can to the Minister for Education and Science the case he articulated so effectively to the House.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 29 March 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93, 104, 113, 125, 149 and 150 together.</P>
      <P>The final text of the White Paper on Defence will be published in the very near future. As I informed the House earlier, this text, agreed with the military authorities, will reflect the up to date position based on the final inputs which I obtained from the chief of staff, together with any necessary typographical or presentational editing. The final phase of the proof reading and layout processes will be concluded shortly and the text will then be sent immediately to the printers. However, due to the widespread public interest in the White Paper, I have arranged for the final text version of the White Paper to be placed on my Department's website where interested parties may consult it as they require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper was drafted following an extensive process of consultation with a range of public bodies and interested individuals and organisations. It is important to bear in mind that the White Paper is a formulation of the Govern<Col N="1412" /> ment's overall policy on defence based on the Government's analysis of the security environment.</P>
    <P>To turn to the other aspects of consultation, the Department of Defence is unique in having civil and military branches. Despite the claims made in the media, the civil and military elements of the Department of Defence work extremely closely together on all aspects of the business of defence. Day in, day out, civil and military managers are working to ensure that the Irish people have the defence services and capabilities that the State requires. This work covers what must be among the broadest range of duties of any Department. Aside from policy issues, the Department's programmes cover general defence and security, aid to the civil power, overseas peace support and humanitarian tasks all over the globe, fishery protection, ministerial air transport, the management of 21,000 acres and 28 barracks, a civil defence organisation with 6,000 members in training, and the eighth largest departmental budget. Effective and extremely positive working relationships exist throughout all levels of the Department.  The day to day work of Defence, as I have described it already, would not be carried out so successfully were it otherwise.</P>
    <P>When I launched the first ever White Paper on Defence, I made three very important points. The White Paper on Defence provided for the most significant development of the Defence Forces ever undertaken. It set out a framework for an unprecedented additional investment initiative totalling £250 million over the next decade which will transform the Defence Forces into a world class military organisation. The White Paper proposed a very modest reduction in PDF strength which is necessary to develop an affordable, sustainable, world-class military organisation and any suggestion that the Defence Forces were not adequately consulted was completely without foundation. On the contrary, the entire thrust of the White Paper is based on the Government's acceptance of the requirement for a major programme of capital investment put forward by the military authorities as their number one priority.</P>
    <P>As I said when I launched the White Paper, my main objective was to ensure that the State has available at all times flexible, well equipped and well trained Defence Forces, including an appropriate reserve, to meet the roles laid down by Government.  I am totally committed to developing the Defence Forces into a world class military organisation and this White Paper sets out a comprehensive programme for such development for the next decade. Under the White Paper the capacity of the Defence Forces will be greatly enhanced.</P>
    <P>The major points in the White Paper are: the reorganised Defence Forces will be a flexible light infantry force on the lines recommended by Pricewaterhouse, a commitment to a policy of continuous recruitment to the Defence Forces along with the development of a new comprehensive personnel management strategy covering <Col N="1413" /> recruitment and promotion &ndash; an immediate step will be the planned recruitment of 750 personnel; the allocation of 100% of an estimated £20 million annual saving arising from Defence Forces restructuring and of all of the proceeds from the sale of property surplus to military requirements to equipment and infrastructure; the development of the Air Corps with a commitment to major equipment investment in new aircraft &ndash; the allocation of a special fund of £5 million per year for the next five years to meet urgent Air Corps equipment requirements; a continued investment in the Naval Service based on an eight ship flotilla including a commitment to order a second new ship and provision for new effectiveness and efficiency measures to enhance fishery protection; payroll savings for reinvestment in the Defence Forces will be obtained from a reduction in the approved strength from 11,500 to 10,500 plus the option of 250 recruits in training &ndash; the current strength is 10,900 and the reduction will not involve any redundancies or closure of barracks; a continued commitment to overseas participation in accordance with Government policy &ndash; a key element of the development programme will be to ensure that the Defence Forces are geared to meet the new challenges in the overseas domain; the development of the Reserve Defence Force involving a new organisational structure and a commitment to improved training and equipment &ndash; I intend to bring a more detailed proposal to Government, following a consultative process; the establishment of a new statutory authority to manage the Curragh, particularly having regard to environmental matters, and the decentralisation of the civil defence branch of the Department of Defence, involving some 30 staff, to Roscrea.</P>
    <P>Although the White Paper has just recently been launched, implementation has already begun. I have already announced the most substantial programme of investment in new equipment for the Defence Forces that has ever occurred.</P>
    <P>The day after the White Paper was published, I announced a major investment programme for the Air Corps, with £55 million being provided over three years for new aircraft. The following week I announced that agreement in principle had been reached for the purchase of a second offshore patrol vessel similar to the LE <i>Róisín</i> which will cost in excess of £20 million.</P>
    <P>During my recent visit to our UNIFIL troops in South Lebanon, I announced a multi-million pound investment programme for the Army estimated at £25 million.</P>
    <P>I have also instructed that arrangements to recruit an additional 750 personnel to the Defence Forces be commenced immediately. A recruitment campaign will commence early next month. This is immediate evidence of my commitment to maintaining the policy of continuous recruitment to the Defence Forces which I introduced in the last few years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> In the past four weeks I have announced investment in new equipment totalling at least £100 million. This investment is in addition to the £40 million which I had already set aside for the purchase of 40 armoured personnel carriers. Investment on this scale merely confirms what I have indicated to this House for the past few months, namely that the White Paper represents a serious response by this Government to the sustained case advanced by the military authorities to me, the Taoiseach and officials of my Department. The case for re-equipment was overwhelming and it has been accepted. This Government was serious when it said it was going to develop the Defence Forces into a world class military organisation and we have allocated the funding that this ambitious project will require.  </P>
    <P>The White Paper also considered the role of the Naval Service. The White Paper describes comprehensively the contribution made by the Naval Service in this regard. The unique characteristics which Naval Service vessels carry with them as an expression of State sovereignty and political will at sea and in furthering objectives in the international maritime domain are fully recognised.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also recognises that a primary activity of the Naval Service is the implementation of European Union fishery policies. Substantial funding was provided by the EU towards the acquisition of five of the eight Naval Service vessels and the White Paper sets out proposals for the better utilisation of these assets. For the future, the White Paper commits the Government to the maintenance of an eight ship flotilla which is a very significant commitment within overall defence provision. As already stated, I recently announced the decision to acquire a second offshore patrol vessel similar to the recently commissioned LE <i>Róisín.</i></P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>It would be less than honest of me not to acknowledge that the final stages of preparation of the White Paper did not run as smoothly as I would have wished. Unfortunately, some commentary was less than well balanced. The resulting commotion distracted from, and devalued the impact and genuinely developmental nature of, the White Paper on Defence. At the time I criticised those irresponsible people who could not see the dangers of trying to drive a wedge between a Minister and any group of public servants.</P>
    <P>I repeat that the so called departmental memorandum referred to in Deputy Yates's question does not exist.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the White Paper will present many challenges to the Defence Forces. However, substantial change and reorganisation has been successfully carried out by the Defence Forces in the last three years. The Government has every confidence that the Defence Forces will rise to meet the challenge of completing the necessary reform process.</P>
    <P>The White Paper provides a unique opportunity for the Defence Forces. The future of the <Col N="1415" /> Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and the reserve will be fully secured for the future. There are many challenges in the White Paper for the Defence Forces but the organisation has successfully carried out substantial change and reorganisation in the past three years. I have every confidence that the Defence Forces will rise to meet the challenges of completing the necessary reform process outlined in the White Paper.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated to the House on previous occasions, the question of the appointment of an ombudsman for the Defence Forces has been raised by PDFORRA under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the permanent Defence Force. The terms of the scheme, which have been agreed with the association, provide that discussions at conciliation and arbitration are confidential to the parties involved. Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I can say that, in the course of the ongoing discussions between my Department and PDFORRA on the agreement on the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the association identified the question of the appointment of an ombudsman for the Defence Forces as an issue which they wished to have addressed. I have given an undertaking to explore this issue with them in the context of these negotiations which are ongoing. I have no doubt the Deputy will be <Col N="1416" /> aware that, pursuant to the provisions of the Ombudsman Act, 1980, military personnel may make complaints against my Department to the ombudsman appointed under that Act.</P>
    <P>Revised complaints procedures for the Defence Forces were agreed with PDFORRA and RACO and implemented with effect from May 1996. The revised procedures provide for the appointment of an independent complaints inquiry officer to investigate grievances on behalf of the Minister. All complaints, other than the most trivial or vexatious, are referred to him by the Minister. The agreement also provided that the revised complaints procedures should operate on a trial basis for two years, after which a review of the procedures should take place. This review is now being undertaken by sub-committees of the conciliation council established for that purpose. I have no wish to interfere in their deliberations but I will say that it is vital that all members of the Defence Forces have confidence in the outcome of that review. It should not be beyond us to create a procedural formula for dealing with grievances that satisfies all concerned and at the same time maintains the ethos of the military way of life.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 194 together.</P>
      <P>Agreement in principle has been reached between my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Mater Misericordiae Hospital on a proposal to use St. Bricin's Military Hospital as a step down medical facility into which certain categories of civilian patients could be transferred from the Mater Misericordiae Hospital. It was agreed that, initially, a pilot scheme would be set up under which up to eight civilian patients would be accommodated in St. Bricin's for periods ranging from seven to ten days. If this pilot scheme proved successful, the intention would be to enter into a long-term arrangement for accommodating up to 20 civilian patients at a time at St. Bricin's Military Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children has overall responsibility for the health and well-being of civilian patients. Accordingly, before any pilot scheme can commence, it is essential that the Department of Health and Children has fully satisfied itself with regard to all the arrangements surrounding the transfer, accommodation and treatment of civilian patients in St. Bricin's Military Hospital. Proposals made by the Mater Misericordiae Hospital to the Department of Health and Children with regard to the use of St. Bricin's Military Hospital for civilian patients are under examination by that Department's chief medical officer and, while it is accepted that the proposals have merit, a number of important issues still require clarification to ensure that patients are best served at all times. The Department of Health and Children is in communication with the Mater Misericordiae Hospital regarding these issues and, once the Department of Health and Children has received the required clarifica<Col N="1418" /> tion, it will be in a position to make a decision on the matter. A number of complex legal and insurance issues will also need to be resolved prior to the commencement of the pilot scheme.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 March 2000, the new Eastern Regional Health Authority is the statutory body with responsibility for health and personal social services for people who live in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. The ERHA is currently examining the accident and emergency services in the region with a view to bringing forward recommendations to improve services and address existing deficiencies. The proposals for St. Bricin's Military Hospital will be considered in the context of this review.</P>
    <P>When the Department of Health and Children has satisfied itself fully with regard to the proposed arrangements, it will formally approach my Department to request that St. Bricin's Military Hospital provide the facilities described above. In the meantime, I remain committed to the successful implementation of the pilot scheme and the matter will be progressed as quickly as possible. There is, however, no further action which can be taken by my Department on this proposal at present until the Department of Health and Children has satisfied itself fully with regard to the proposed arrangements.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101, 138, 158 and 202 together.</P>
      <P>Discussions have recently taken place between officials of my Department and of the Chief State Solicitor's office with solicitors representing plaintiffs in Army hearing loss litigation. The discussions have been facilitated by the Law Society of Ireland, to which I express my appreciation for its co-operation. Following these talks, it is now proposed that an application, with the consent of both sides, will be made to the High Court for an adjournment of hearing loss cases for the Easter term. This will allow the parties concerned to engage in direct out of court settlement negotiations on the basis of the Supreme Court Hanley judgment. In the meantime, progress on the establishment of a statutory out-of-court compensation scheme will await the outcome of these negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legal costs to date in this hearing loss litigation amount to £28.98 million. The number of cases <Col N="1420" /> with out of court settlements is 4,538. There have been 246 court awards, 56 cases dismissed and 240 withdrawn cases.</P>
    <P>The number of cases settled out of court this year is 394. There have been 24 court awards, nine cases dismissed and 24 withdrawn cases.</P>
    <P>In December 1999, there were 58 new hearing loss cases. In January 2000 there were 31 new cases and 70 new cases in February 2000. For the first three weeks in March 2000 there were 69 new cases.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to a similar question in the House on 17 February, the Garda air support unit was inaugurated in September 1997 and operates from Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. Two aircraft are operated by the Air Corps on behalf of the Garda Síochána, one helicopter and one fixed-wing aircraft.  As one would expect in the case of such an operation there are regular and ongoing discussions at operational level between the Air Corps and the Garda Síochána. These discussions are supplemented by discussions between officials from my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as and when required. Issues arising in relation to the operation of the service are dealt with in these fora.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may recall that I announced on 25 February that a squirrel helicopter is to be acquired as soon as possible for the Air Corps. This helicopter will facilitate training of pilots for the Garda air support unit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 215 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin. Five of the barracks have been vacated while the sixth &ndash; Clancy Barracks &ndash; will be evacuated this year.</P>
      <P>I have decided to dispose of Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, to Cork County Council for economic development of the site in conjunction with IDA Ireland. The agreed price is £767,000. The lands will be developed and marketed as a strategic industrial site to attract inward investment. This development will greatly assist in the continuing revitalisation of Fermoy and will greatly enhance its potential for future industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Ballincollig, the independent <Col N="1425" /> consultants appointed to draw up an integrated action area plan for the former barracks undertook a rigorous process of public consultation as part of their commission. The integrated plan for the property is now complete and was presented by the consultants in the past week. The plan provides for a wide range of community, amenity, residential and commercial uses in the future development of this substantial property. My Department will shortly submit the integrated plan to Cork County Council for consideration in the context of a variation to the existing Cork County development plan. The property will be put on the market following its adoption into the Cork County development plan.</P>
    <P>As regards Devoy Barracks, agreement has been reached between my Department and Naas Urban District Council on the transfer of part of the property to the council for local purposes. The balance of the property has been re-zoned for housing in line with the development plan for Naas UDC which was adopted on 29 May 1999. A tender competition was held in October 1999 for the appointment of selling agents to undertake the sale of the property. The Department, having considered the offers received, decided to re-invite tenders for selling agents and a decision will be made in this matter shortly.</P>
    <P>Arising from a request from the Department of Foreign Affairs for accommodation to house Kosovar refugees, I offered that Department the opportunity to inspect the five vacated barracks to check out their feasibility or otherwise for the accommodation of the refugees. Currently Magee Barracks, Kildare, is being used for this purpose on a temporary basis. In the interim, a tender competition was arranged for the appointment of independent consultants to prepare an area action plan in respect of the former barrack lands. A number of the proposals received were shortlisted and those consultants placed on the shortlist made presentations before a selection committee on 16 February 2000. It is expected that the consultants will be appointed shortly. The consultants selected will submit a report within three months of appointment. The sale of the barracks will proceed as soon as is practicable following evaluation of that report.</P>
    <P>In relation to Castleblayney, I decided to sell the site to the North Eastern Health Board for £600,000. Pending completion of the legal and financial formalities, a caretaker's agreement has been completed between the North Eastern Health Board and my Department and the former barracks was handed over to the board on 9 February 2000 on foot of this agreement.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the child care project proposed by the health board for the site will provide for 45 permanent appointments and a sum in excess of £1 million will be invested on the provision of the necessary facilities. In addition, the annual revenue to the town is estimated to be in the region of £12 million. The proposal from the NEHB includes a gymnasium, an all-weather <Col N="1426" /> pitch and a swimming pool. I understand that these facilities would be made available to the local community when not in use for child care purposes. As indicated, the disposal of each location is proceeding and, while no funds have as yet been generated, it is expected that up to £50 million will be realised from the sale of the barracks. The moneys raised will be used primarily for re-equipment and refurbishment within the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106, 109, 120 and 159 together.</P>
      <P>I visited Irish troops and military observers serving with the United Nations in Lebanon and Syria during the period 14 to 19 March 2000. I was accompanied by the chief of staff and the secretary general of the Department. I briefed my Cabinet colleagues on my return on Tuesday, 21 March 2000. The main purpose of my visit was to observe at first hand the work of Irish military personnel serving in the region and to assure them, on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland, how proud we are of the outstanding manner in which they have consistently performed their duties on United Nations service. I also wanted to express my sympathy and that of the Government following the recent tragic deaths of Privates Lawlor, Fitzpatrick, Murphy and Deere in a traffic accident on 14 February 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of my visit to Lebanon, I met with the Lebanese Prime Minister, Dr. Selim Hoss, the Lebanese Chief of Staff and Commander in Chief of the Lebanese Army, General Michel Suleyman, the UNIFIL Force Commander Major General Obeng and Deputy Force Commander Brigadier General, James Sreenan, who is a member of the Defence Forces, as well as other local representatives and dignitaries. During the course of these meetings I reiterated my concern for the safety of Irish troops in the event of a unilateral withdrawal of Israeli forces <Col N="1427" /> from the Israeli occupied area in South Lebanon. It will be recalled that the level of their casualties in Lebanon led the Israeli Government to declare its intention to withdraw unilaterally from Lebanon by July 2000. A disorderly Israeli withdrawal without the agreement of the Lebanese and Syrian Governments could create difficulties for the UNIFIL contingent in Lebanon. This scenario could call for a revision of the role of UNIFIL in a post withdrawal situation.</P>
    <P>I also indicated that while Ireland would wish to maintain a commitment to UNIFIL until such time as its mandate was discharged, I nevertheless stressed the fact that the safety of Irish troops was of paramount concern to me and to the Government. Should the situation prevail where the safety of Defence Force personnel was seriously compromised, there may be no option but to withdraw them. The emerging situation is being followed closely by the United Nations. Ireland and other UNIFIL troop contributing states are considering, in consultation with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations of the UN in New York, the implications of the various scenarios attendant on Israeli withdrawal. I will continue to keep the matter under close review in consultation with the military authorities and the Department of Foreign Affairs with particular regard to likely developments in the post-July 2000 situation. While I was in Lebanon, it was reported that Prime Minister Barak favoured a full withdrawal south of the international border between Israel and Lebanon, thus complying with UN Resolution 425 of March 1978. I was heartened to hear of this development.</P>
    <P>While in Lebanon, I again raised the issue of the disappearance of Pte. Joyce in 1981, both in conversation with local representatives of the Muktars, and with the Lebanese media, and I appealed for any information which might bring this sad chapter to a close.</P>
    <P>In all of the discussions that I had, there was consistent praise for Irish troops and a desire that they should continue in service in South Lebanon. I was greatly impressed, as always, by the commitment of all our troops in the Middle East to the important work they are undertaking in the cause of international peace.</P>
    <P>I also visited Damascus, Syria, where I met with the Syrian Defence Minister, Lieutenant General Mustafa Tlass who briefed me on recent developments on the Israeli-Syrian track of the Middle East peace process. While there, I met with Irish personnel serving with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation. There are currently ten personnel serving with UNTSO in the Middle East.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107, 145 and 207 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Coast Guard of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has overall responsibility for the provision of a marine search and rescue service. The Air Corps provides a search and rescue service from Finner, County Donegal, and Waterford Regional Airport as part of the overall search and rescue arrangements.</P>
      <P>Bond Helicopters provide a search and rescue service, using medium lift helicopters, from Shannon and Dublin Airports under contract to the Irish Coast Guard. The service operating from Dublin Airport commenced on 1 July 1998, prior to which the Air Corps provided search and rescue coverage on the east coast. It had been intended that the new service would be crewed by Air Corps personnel and would operate from Casement Aerodrome once certain legal difficulties concerning the question of the basing of a civil operation at a military airbase had been resolved. This latter element is being pursued with the Department of Public Enterprise and the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>
      <P>The high incidence of retirement of Air Corps flying officers in recent years meant that the Air Corps was not in a position to provide pilots for the new service. Provision was, however, made in the contract with the operator for the introduction of Air Corps crew at a future date. The new service is currently operating from Dublin Airport with the option of re-locating to Baldonnel at a future date.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Defence, which was approved by Government on Tuesday, 29 February 2000, provides for significant new investment in the Air Corps. The White Paper accepts the Price Waterhouse review of the Air Corps as the basis for the development of that service. The Government's policy is that the Air Corps will be heavily involved in providing services to agencies outside the Defence Forces, the most important of which is the Irish Coast Guard. The extent and nature of these services will, of necessity, be a determinant of the type of aircraft to be provided for the Air Corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the publication of the White Paper and in recognition of the urgent equipment modernisation requirements of the Air Corps, I was <Col N="1429" /> pleased to announce on 1 March, 2000 the allocation of a total of up to £55 million over the next three years for this purpose. These funds will initiate vital investment in new aircraft for the Air Corps under the direction of the High Level Civil-Military Planning and Procurement Group which, as indicated in the White Paper, will be tasked with the development of a new plan to address Defence Forces' equipment needs over a five-year timeframe.</P>
    <P>The General Officer Commanding the Air Corps warmly welcomed the news of this new investment. He has been asked to draw up the full technical specification documents which will be necessary for commencement of the procurement process in relation to two new medium range helicopters and a further helicopter mainly for the training of pilots for the Garda air support unit. This work is under way in the Air Corps and a joint civil-military project team will be set up in due course to organise and oversee the procurement process. Acquisition of appropriate fixed-wing aircraft will be considered by the planning and procurement group. In the meantime the recommendations of the General Officer Commanding the Air Corps as regards essential training needs in order to meet current operational requirements have been requested for consideration in my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 204 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bilateral meetings between myself, the Chief of Staff and other senior officers are a frequent and commonplace feature of the normal business of the Department of Defence. No particular formalities are associated with such meetings which take place as and when required on a regular basis. It has been decided, in the context of the White Paper on Defence, that the Defence Forces Strategic Management Committee, whose membership comprises the Chief of Staff, the two <Col N="1430" /> deputy chiefs of staff and the two assistant secretaries in my Department, and is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, will have its role enhanced through a greater emphasis on strategic planning and on policy formulation and review. It is envisaged that the SMC will meet on a monthly basis. To enhance the many formal and informal processes already in place to provide me with advice from civil and military sources, I will chair quarterly meetings of the SMC. There is scope to develop sub-SMC level civil-military structures. A more proactive role for the SMC will help to maintain a shared understanding of the policy objectives facing the Defence organisation with a view to ensuring that I will have the best possible advice available to me. It has also been decided in the context of the White Paper to create, in the civil side of my Department, a new corporate services division which will bring together all of the Department's management support activities. The objective will be to achieve a more integrated approach to the organisation and development of the Department and to achieve a more holistic approach to policy development, performance management, procurement and value for money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110, 139, 205 and 210 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's proposed participation in Partnership for Peace is set out in the Presentation Document which was presented to the NATO Secretariat upon signature by Ireland of the PfP Framework Document on 1 December 1999. In consultation <Col N="1431" /> with the NATO Secretariat, an individual partnership programme will shortly be developed which will cover a two year period initially and which will set out the level and extent of proposed participation in such areas as co-operation in peacekeeping principles, doctrine, training and exercises and inter-operability in peacekeeping operations. No decisions, however, have as yet been made in relation to specific activities to be included within the individual partnership programme.</P>
    <P>Participation in PfP is entirely voluntary and is based on the principle of self-differentiation, that is a state selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation in PfP activities.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of the Government to ensure that the Defence Forces are adequately trained, equipped and resourced to undertake whatever operations with which they are tasked from time to time. In this regard in recent years considerable sums have been expended under the Defence Vote for new weapons, transport and communications equipment and in providing new and up-graded living and operational accommodation for the Defence Forces. Some of the more important developments in relation to the improvement of Defence Forces' equipment are: a contract was placed at the end of last year for the purchase of 40 armoured personnel carriers, initial spares, special tools and training courses &ndash; the total cost of which is in the region of £40 million: the supply of 16 new turrets and 16 fire directing systems for fitting to existing Panhard armoured cars; the purchase of two batteries of refurbished 105 millimetre light artillery guns to replace 25 pounder guns which are now obsolete; delivery, in December 1998, of the final instalment of equipment to complete a major programme to provide new tactical VHF radios for the Defence Forces at a total cost of approximately £10.5 million; and expenditure this year of approximately £6.5 million on specialist transport cargo vehicles and on new troop carrying vehicles such as 4 x 4's, ton trucks, buses, motorcycles and an ambulance.</P>
    <P>The £25 million investment package which I announced recently for the purchase of light infantry tactical vehicles, modern effective anti-armour weapons, night vision equipment, engineer equipment and medical field equipment, forms an integral part of the overall investment programme.</P>
    <P>In the case of participation by the Defence Forces in PfP activities, it is envisaged that any costs arising within the Defence Vote in a specific year will be proportionate to the level of participation selected in advance and reflected in the individual partnership programme and will be balanced, taking account of overall budgetary constraints as well as existing operational commitments, by the Defence Forces both at home and overseas.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not obliged to take part in military exercises in the context of European security as suggested by Deputy Durkan.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111, 146 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>As I have previously stated in this House, the society is an autonomous body with full powers to manage and administer its affairs through its governing body, the central council. I am also mindful that a fundamental principle of the International Committee of the Red Cross is that all Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies enjoy freedom from political involvement worldwide. My Department, as in the past, is available to provide help and assistance to the society as and when requested. As I have previously indicated, I have no function in the administration of the Red Cross Society. I do not get involved in the day to day running of its affairs. All matters relating to the staff of the society are a matter for the society itself.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the new Secretary General on his appointment undertook a strategic review of the operation of the society. This review involves all staff members and volunteers with a view to ensuring the strengthening and development of the society. It is intended that the review of the operations of the society will be completed by mid-2000.</P>
      <P>My Department administers a grant-in-aid to the Irish Red Cross Society, which this year amounts to £575,000. The grant-in-aid covers salaries of the 14 permanent staff in the headquarters of the society, based in Merrion Square, Dublin 2, and the annual grant for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva.</P>
      <P>No additional funding was sought by the society in relation to any financial settlement or other costs in respect of any former employee of the society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112, 141, 142 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>The overall strategy for the development of the Reserve Defence Force is based on the report of a special steering group established by me in January 1998. The group produced its report in September 1999, and the recommendations contained in the report have been accepted as a general basis on which the development of the Reserve Defence Force can proceed. As I have indicated previously I plan to publish the steering group report in due course.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that an in-depth study of the Reserve has now been undertaken involving a considerable amount of work by both the military board and the steering group. The military board as part of its task sought the views of the membership on the future organisation and structure of the Reserve. From the outset there was ongoing liaison between the steering group and the military board and meetings of the steering group were attended in part by either the chairman or the secretary of the military board who kept the group well briefed on the board's progress. The steering group also advised the military board regarding aspects of the Reserve that should be examined or that should be looked at in greater depth by the military board.</P>
      <P>The steering group met with each of the Permanent Defence Force representative associations, who made presentations to the group regarding their areas of concern, and it met on three occasions with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association which also made presentations to the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in the White Paper on Defence, which was approved by Government on 20 February, An Slua Muirí will be developed to <Col N="1434" /> improve the capacity of members to provide a genuine naval reserve capacity based on a revised overall strength of up to 400 personnel and as a rationalisation measure it has been decided to amalgamate the two Dublin based companies of An Slua Muirí. It is not proposed to relocate a unit of An Slua Muirí to Drogheda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 201 together.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to clarify the role and purpose of the Council of Defence which is provided for in section 11 of the Defence Act, 1954. It has been decided to retain the Council of Defence, pending the enactment of legislation which is not currently contemplated. The council consists of the Minister of State, the Secretary General of the Department, the Chief of Staff and the two deputy chiefs of staff.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the council under the Act is to aid and counsel the Minister on all matters in relation to the Department of Defence on which the Minister may consult the council. It is evident from recent media comments that considerable confusion exists regarding the role of the council and there seems to be a profoundly mistaken view that the council has an active role in Defence management. The council's origins lie in a requirement in the early years of the State to enshrine the civil-military management process in a formalised way. However, in modern times, senior civil and military staff meet on a regular basis, individually and jointly, as part of normal business.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the Minister to decide if he needs to utilise the Council of Defence to obtain advice. Ministers for Defence have decided to arrange meetings of the council in this way only twice in the past 25 years, with the last meeting being arranged some 13 years ago in 1987. Ministers have instead sought advice from departmental staff, civil and military, on a daily basis without the formality of the Council of Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Interaction at the strategic level has been augmented in recent years by the introduction of the Defence Forces Strategic Management Committee (SMC). The SMC provides an important forum for the discussion of major policy issues. The committee is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department and the membership comprises the Chief of Staff, the two Deputy Chiefs of Staff and the two Assistant Secretaries of the Department. The General Officer Commanding <Col N="1435" /> the Air Corps and the flag officer commanding the Naval Service attend in respect of items affecting their services.</P>
    <P>To further develop this strategic process, the White Paper on Defence indicates my intention to chair quarterly meetings of the SMC. A more proactive role for the SMC will help to maintain a shared understanding of the policy objectives facing the Defence organisation with a view to ensuring that I and future Ministers for Defence have the best possible advice available.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Defence which was approved by Government on 29 February 2000 provides for significant new investment in the Air Corps. In recognition of the urgent equipment modernis<Col N="1436" /> ation requirements of the Air Corps I was pleased to announce immediately the allocation of a total of up to £55 million over the next three years for this purpose. These funds will initiate vital investment in new aircraft for the Air Corps. The General Officer Commanding the Air Corps has welcomed the news of this new investment. He has been asked to draw up the full technical specification documents which will be necessary for commencement of the procurement process in relation to two new medium range helicopters and a further helicopter mainly for the training of pilots for the Garda air support unit. This work is under way in the Air Corps and a joint civil-military project team will be set up in due course to organise and oversee the procurement process.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Defence accepts the Price-waterhouseCoopers review of the Air Corps as the basis for the development of that service. The Government's policy is that the Air Corps will be heavily involved in providing services to agencies outside the Defence Forces. The extent and nature of these services will of necessity be a determinant of the type of aircraft to be provided for the Air Corps.</P>
      <P>The Dauphin helicopters undergo regular maintenance and scheduled overhauls to ensure they are fully air worthy and meet the certification standards laid down for the aviation industry. In the context of maintenance, overhauls and certification requirements, the active Dauphin fleet has been at a minimum on occasions. I have been advised by the military authorities that the Dauphin has made three precautionary landings in the last 12 months.</P>
      <P>No Air Corps personnel have been taken off search and rescue duties and those missions continue to be undertaken by Air Corps flying officers using Dauphin helicopters.</P>

      <P>Plans for the disposal of the remaining barracks at Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare and Clancy Barracks, Dublin, are at an advanced stage and it is hoped to have these sales completed during 2000. It is expected that up to £50 million will be realised from the sale of the six barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the submission of the White Paper <Col N="1437" /> on Defence to Government on 29 February 2000, the Government conveyed approval for the allocation of 100% of pay savings arising from the reduction in the approved strength level of the Permanent Defence Force, together with 100% of the revenue arising from the sale of property surplus to military requirements, for investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The savings arising from the restructuring of the Defence Forces are estimated at £20 million per year &ndash; a total of £200 million over the ten year period covered by the White Paper. Together with the revenue of £50 million expected from the sale of the six barracks, this will result in an ambitious and unprecedented level of investment in the Defence Forces and will ensure that the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service will be fully equipped with the most modern of equipment to carry out their roles at home and overseas.</P>
    <P>The £25 million investment package which was announced recently following discussions with the chief of staff, for the purchase of light infantry tactical vehicles, modern effective anti-armour weapons, night vision equipment, engineer equipment and medical field equipment, forms an integral part of the overall investment programme.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the House in response to a similar question on 17 February, following the accident at Tramore, County Waterford, on 2 July 1999 in which four members of the Air Corps were tragically killed, my colleague the Minister for Public Enterprise and I jointly directed that the accident be investigated under Statutory Instrument No. 205 of 1997, Air Navigation (Notification and Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Regulations 1997. Pursuant to this direction the investigation is being conducted by the air accident investigation unit, AAIU, of the Department of Public Enterprise. A senior Air Corps officer with appropriate training is acting as investigator-in-charge. He is being assisted by inspectors from the AAIU, by Air Corps personnel and two experts from overseas, viz, a principal inspector from the UK air accidents investigation branch and the head of military psychology of the swedish armed forces.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this investigation, which is wide-ranging and complex, is to determine the circumstances and cause or causes of the accident in order to prevent future such accidents. All issues, including those raised by relatives concerning safety, are being encompassed by the investigation. The final report of this investigation will be made public. The regulations provide that the final report should be published, where possible, within 12 months of the date of the accident. In this connection it is estimated that a draft final report will be ready for circulation to interested parties by 14 April. Any safety measures proposed by the investigating team will, of course, be implemented as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>In addition to the aforementioned investigation, a military court of inquiry has been convened to inquire into the circumstances of the accident. Its main thrust will be an examination of both the final report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise and the coroner's report. Therefore, the work of the military court of inquiry will proceed following publication of the final report of the air accident investigation unit. The court of inquiry must also await the Coroner's Court findings. I am informed that the Coroner's Court is adjourned until mid July next.</P>

      <P>In 1999, I had formal meetings with RACO and PDFORRA on 19 August and 25 May, respectively. In addition, I attended the delegate conferences of both associations late last year. This year I met with both associations on 22 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1439" /> The conciliation and arbitration scheme provides the mechanism for addressing issues which come within the associations' remit. While I am happy to meet with PDFORRA and RACO I am anxious that the day to day business of the associations is processed through the system of conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <P>Legislation establishing the Defence Forces representative associations which was passed by the House in 1990 takes cognisance of the special nature of the military organisation with its own ethos and responsibilities. Accordingly, the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, specifically excludes from the scope of representation &ldquo;any operation and the raising, maintenance, command, constitution, organisation and discipline of the Defence Forces...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the ten years since the enactment of this legislation and the establishment of representative associations I have not become aware of any compelling reason in either the use of the representative process by the associations or in terms of its effectiveness to propose an amendment to the legislation, nor have any proposals to do so been made to me. It is incumbent on all parties to the representative process to use the machinery which is at their disposal in an efficient, effective and responsible manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>The 1998 Pricewaterhouse report on the Air Corps and the Naval Service set out a range of recommendations for more effective and efficient air and sea services. Some of these recommendations could be proceeded with fairly quickly while others would take longer to implement. It is important that the recommendations be implemented in a structured and coherent way that contributes to the overall development of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always emphasised the importance of involving all of the relevant stakeholders in the process. Accordingly, I have established a special consultation group to provide a forum for the input of the key stakeholders in relation to the <Col N="1440" /> State air and sea services. This consultation group, which I chair, comprises representatives from the civil and military branches of my Department, from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. To date, the group has held an initial meeting at which I invited stakeholders to make their inputs to the process and appropriate contacts have been made at official level to facilitate this.</P>
    <P>In October 1998, I directed the chief of staff to arrange for the general officer commanding the Air Corps and the flag officer commanding the Naval Service to submit implementation plans that would give effect to the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations in the Pricewaterhouse report. Draft implementation plans for both services were submitted to me late last year. After careful consideration of both plans, I decided that additional work needed to be done to augment the draft implementation plan for the Naval Service. I am currently awaiting a revised draft plan from the Chief of Staff before I can advance the process. Once this plan has been received, the consultative group's principal work will begin. Further meetings of the group will occur as the planning and implementation process develops.</P>
    <P>As with the reorganisation of the Defence Forces, the changes in the Air Corps and the Naval Service will be of a positive nature aimed at ensuring the ongoing development of these services consistent with the needs of the State and the taxpayer. The main features of the Air Corps plan to implement the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations made by Price-waterhouse are: a new organisational structure based on a division between operational and support, elements with a total manpower of around 930; service level agreements with principal clients such as the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and new measures to address personnel training and retention.</P>
    <P>The principal elements of a plan for the Naval Service to implement the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations made by Price-waterhouse are: a new organisational structure based on operations and support divisions with an overall manpower level of around 1,144; a planned approach to sea/shore rotation of personnel based on a two year period of commitment to sea-going duties followed by a two year period away from such duties; service level agreements with principal clients such as the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources; regular recruitment and other measures such as schemes for the commissioning of enlisted personnel to address personnel shortfalls; enhancement of the Naval College and development of proposals for a joint initiative with Cork Institute of Technology in order to meet changing needs and keep pace with the increased demand for maritime education and training responses and continu<Col N="1441" /> ation of a programme of investment at the naval base to improve thebuildings and other infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The broader development of both services has been dealt with in the context of the White Paper on Defence which presented a positive opportunity to develop the Defence Forces for the long term.  Investment in both services continued during the White Paper process and I have very recently announced significant investment programmes that will enable the purchase of new aircraft by the Air Corps and an offshore patrol vessel similar to the LE<i> Róisín</i> as a replacement for the LE<i> Deirdre </i>which has been in service for nearly 30 years and is approaching the end of its economic service life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Defence Forces have been deployed for service with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, since 1978. Six hundred Defence Forces personnel approximately are currently serving with the Irish contingent UNIFIL.</P>
      <P>The UNIFIL mandate is reviewed by the United Nations Security Council every six months following a report by the Secretary General of the United Nations. UN Security Council Resolution 1288 of 31 January 2000 has extended the mandate of UNIFIL for a further period of six months, i.e., until 31 July 2000.</P>
      <P>On 12 October 1999 the Government approved the provision of a replacement contingent to UNIFIL comprising 620 personnel approximately, all ranks, for a six month period beginning 20 October 1999. The Government decision also allowed for preparations to be made for the selection, training and equipping of a further contingent of approximately 620 personnel, all ranks, to provide for the possibility of Ireland's continued participation in the UNIFIL peacekeeping force beyond January 2000 in the event of the further extension of the UNIFIL mandate. I will shortly seek the approval of Government in relation to the continuation of participation by the Irish Contingent in UNIFIL from April 2000 when the current contingent will be due to return home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Israeli Government declared its intention to withdraw its forces from Lebanon not later than July 2000. The legal situation is that UN Security Council Resolution 425 of 1978 requires Israel to end its presence in South Lebanon. If this is to be implemented the attitude adopted by armed elements within Lebanon to the Israeli backed South Lebanese Army, SLA and to Israel <Col N="1442" /> will be crucial. A disorderly withdrawal without the agreement of the Lebanese and Syrian Governments could create difficulties for UNIFIL. This scenario could call for the possibility of a revision of the role of UNIFIL in a post withdrawal situation. The emerging developments are being followed closely by the United Nations. Ireland and other UNIFIL troop contributing countries are considering, in consultation with the department of peacekeeping operations in New York, the implications of a number of scenarios attendant on Israeli withdrawal.</P>
    <P>Developments in the coming weeks may give a clearer indication as to what the future role for UNIFIL would be in the re-establishment of Lebanese sovereignty over its territory. One possibility is that the Lebanese authorities would seek a reinforcement of UNIFIL until such time as its function could be undertaken by the Lebanese army, but there is no certainty as yet as to what the final outcome will be. It is my view that should the situation prevail where the safety of Defence Force personnel was seriously compromised there may be no option but to withdraw them.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence, approved by the Government on 29 February 2000, considered the participation by the Defence Forces in Lebanon in the context of overseas peace support operations overall. The White Paper drew attention to the changing political situation in the region and identified the need to establish Ireland's options in relation to continued participation and the scope for scaling down on our commitment in South Lebanon. The White Paper recognised the significant draw on overall PDF resources and the associated implications for undertaking other peace support operations. For the present I am satisfied that it is desirable to continue the UNIFIL commitment. As I stated, I will shortly be seeking Government approval for continuation of participation by the Irish contingent from next month. I will keep the matter under close review in consultation with the military authorities and the Department of Foreign Affairs with particular regard to developments in the post-July 2000 situation.</P>
    <P>I visited the Irish troops serving with UNIFIL during the period 14 to 19 March 2000. During the course of my visit I indicated that while Ireland would wish to maintain a commitment to UNIFIL until such time as the mandate was discharged, I nevertheless stressed the fact that the safety of Irish troops was of paramount concern.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the White Paper on Defence which I published recently. As I indicated when I published this first ever White Paper on Defence, my main objective was to ensure that the State has available at all times flexible, well equipped and well trained Defence Forces, including an appropriate reserve, to meet the roles laid down by Government.  I am totally committed to developing the Defence Forces into a world class military organisation and this White Paper sets out a comprehensive programme for such development for the next decade.</P>
      <P>The total strength of the Permanent Defence Forces following the implementation of the White Paper will be 10,500, with up to an additional 250 personnel in training at any time. A detailed implementation plan to give effect to the White Paper will be drawn up by the Chief of Staff. I am quite satisfied that the Permanent Defence Forces will be fully capable of meeting their commitments and duties with this overall strength.</P>
      <P>All the savings realised from the modest reduction in the strength of the PDF will be applied to the procurement of essential new equipment for the Force. Since launching the White Paper less than a month ago I have already announced a number of major investment initiatives, totalling over £100 million, that will provide for new aircraft, a new offshore patrol vessel and equipment for the Army. I have also instructed that arrangements be initiated immediately for the recruitment of 750 personnel into the Defence Forces.  A recruitment campaign is due to commence early next month.</P>

    <P>It should be noted that a portion of Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, is occupied by a battalion of the FCA.</P>
    <P>The costs for security at Magee Barracks have been borne by the Eastern Health Board since that property was handed over to accommodate Kosovan refugees on 12 May 1999. Castleblayney Military Barracks was transferred to the North Eastern Health Board on a caretaker basis on 9 February 2000 and no further security costs will fall to be met by my Department in relation to that property.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 157 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of approaches have been made in recent times by private concerns regarding the possible commercial use of facilities at Baldonnel Aerodrome. My main concern in examining these proposals would be to protect the military aviation interests at the aerodrome. The question of extending usage of these facilities for hire or reward requires careful consideration as it may have implications regarding licensing of the facility for such use. However, the greater utilis<Col N="1445" /> ation of this underused resource could have benefits for both military and civil aviation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The use of Baldonnel for civil aviation purposes is a matter for consideration by the Minister for Public Enterprise in consultation with myself in the context of overall airports policy generally. In that regard the recent report to the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for Finance on the future of Aer Rianta did consider the possibility of a second airport in the Dublin area and this was considered in the context of Baldonnel Aerodrome.</P>
    <P>This report was carried out by Warburg Dillon Read/AIB on Aer Rianta's future strategic direction and which assessed the merits of a second airport in Dublin particularly in the context of the possible development by commercial interests of Baldonnel Aerodrome.</P>
    <P>Their recommendations will help in assessing the position of Baldonnel against that wider policy backdrop. Following consideration of the report it is intended that the Minister for Public Enterprise and myself will report to Government with specific recommendations in regard to the future of Baldonnel. It would not be appropriate for me to speculate on what these recommendations will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention was first drawn to this matter by an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 20 March 2000 as the work management system report in question was not given to my Department. It was prepared in February 1999 by the Department of Finance's centre for management and organisation development for, and in the context of the introduction of information technology into, the Chief State Solicitor's Office. The report, which is about 80 pages long, contains one page in relation to the CSSO's interaction with the Department of Defence which is the office's largest single litigation client. The recommendations contained therein are in turn based on confidential conversations held by CMOD with individual staff members of the CSSO with no input whatsoever from my Department. I am of the view, therefore, that no special significance should attach to such a one-sided report. I would, however, wish to reject specific criticisms as follows. First, the Department's policy for dealing with Army hear<Col N="1446" /> ing loss litigation and any occasional changes necessary has been approved by Government following extensive consultation with, and input from, the Office of the Attorney General and the CSSO. Second, departmental officials have been in daily attendance at the courts to provide instructions in individual cases since at least October 1996. Third, direct communication with Army pay section is a non-issue and has not been the subject of any recent complaint by the CSSO. Officials of that section have attended court as required. In any event claims branch, responsible for operational control in the courts, as well as policy in relation to hearing loss cases, must retain full co-ordination of the State's defence. This is best achieved under the current arrangements.</P>
      <P>My Department is appreciative of the co-operation afforded by the CSSO in this litigation. However, it must be understood that, given the huge fiscal threat which was at one stage posed to the taxpayer, and which has now been greatly diminished by my Department's actions, the conventional approach of acquiescing in the payment of large settlements for relatively small levels of hearing disability was and remains unacceptable.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners. While the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations <Col N="1447" /> as a member of the European Union, Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment, in 1993, of a joint task force involving the Garda, the customs service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.</P>
      <P>During the course of routine patrols Naval Service vessels may be deployed to anti-drug smuggling operations. Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities. While Naval Service personnel are designated as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, in practice the Naval Service operates under the direction of the joint task force where measures to combat the importation of illegal drugs are concerned. In this regard the White Paper on Defence does not envisage any change in the role of the Naval Service.</P>

The inquiry encompassed the findings of a Military Police investigation and a technical board of inquiry. Weapons handling training on the 60 mm mortar continued but live firing for training purposes ceased pending completion of the aforementioned investigations. The report submitted to higher military authority gave rise to additional queries which could only be addressed by the reconvening of the court of inquiry and this was done. The report of the reconvened court of inquiry was submitted to me on 10 August last. I am assured by the military authorities that all drills and procedures as well as all other aspects of firing exercises are kept constantly under review.</P>

      <P>Enhancement of Ireland's fishery protection capability is being supported by a five year EU financial aid package for fisheries surveillance, running from 1996 to 2000. Under the package, Ireland has been receiving financial support for a significant programme of investment in fisheries surveillance equipment. The new Naval Service fishery protection vessel, the LE<i> Róisín</i>, has been the principal project to receive funding under the programme. This vessel was commissioned on 15 December 1999 and became operational immediately afterwards. To date a total of £7.6 million has been received in EU funding towards the cost of the LE<i> Róisín</i> and it is anticipated that a further £1.9 million will be received.</P>
      <P>Active consideration is being given to exercising the option, contained in the original contract, for the purchase of another Naval Service fishery protection vessel similar to the LE<i> Róisín</i> as a replacement for the LE<i> Deirdre</i>, which has completed almost 28 years in service. The position regarding EU contribution towards the cost of this vessel remains to be clarified.</P>
      <P>To date, there has been no notification from the EU regarding a successor to the current financial aid package for fisheries surveillance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 156 and 196 together.</P>
      <P>The precise crewing level for the new vessel LE <i>Roisín</i> has not yet been decided. In order to assess the crewing level required for the new vessel, full regard will be paid to and full advantage extracted from the new technology incorporated in the vessel, given what it offers in terms of automation and labour savings. This process of assessment is being undertaken now that the vessel has been delivered and the Naval Service has an opportunity to train personnel in its operation. However, the crew for the new vessel will be met from the overall authorised strength of the Naval Service of 1,144. The process of formulating the crewing level is ongoing and agreement on the matter is expected in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Naval Service authorities advise that their current operational commitments are being met. Seven of the eight Naval Service vessels are oper<Col N="1452" /> ational and the eighth is currently undergoing a scheduled refit.</P>
    <P>There are currently 12 cadets and eight officers undergoing training for watchkeeping certificates. In addition, nine non-commissioned personnel have recently started a course with a view to being commissioned as watchkeeping officers. A direct entry competition for watchkeeping officers is also under way and assessment of applications is nearing conclusion.</P>
    <P>Additionally, to address the general officer shortages in the Naval Service, proposals are being prepared by the Naval Service for a scheme to promote senior non-commissioned personnel to commissioned rank. The cadet competition for this year is also under way and it is anticipated that 16 Naval Service cadetships will be offered.</P>
    <P>Two non-commissioned personnel were commissioned as Naval Service electrical engineer officers in November last. Proposals for a direct entry competition for marine engineer officers later this year are under consideration. Vacancies which have arisen at non-commissioned rank are being filled internally by promotion and vacancies created in the lower ranks consequent on these promotions are being filled by the ongoing recruitment process.</P>
    <P>The present policy of ongoing recruitment for enlistment in the Defence Forces, which I have approved, is designed to address the question of any shortfalls in personnel numbers in the Defence Forces, including the Naval Service. In 1999, a total of 97 general service recruits were enlisted in the Naval Service under the general recruitment campaign. A further general service recruitment campaign for the Defence Forces in respect of the year 2000 will be launched and advertised shortly.</P>

      <P>At the invitation of the Portugese Minister for Defence I attended an informal meeting of Defence Ministers of the member states of the European Union in Sintra, Portugal, on 28 February 2000. The meeting, an informal event, was non-decision making in character and was held outside the institutional framework of the EU.</P>
      <P>The discussion at the meeting focused on the issue of capabilities for the Petersberg Tasks, particularly the steps necessary to implement the Headline Goal agreed at Helsinki. The meeting also noted the proposed establishment, as of 1 March 2000, of interim bodies and structures within the council to improve decision making for the Petersberg Tasks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will recall, the Helsinki Euro<Col N="1453" /> pean Council in December 1999 agreed on a voluntary target for establishing capabilities for Petersberg Tasks . This target, known as a Headline Goal, which member states aim to meet by the year 2003, involves the ability to deploy 50,000 to 60,000 personnel within 60 days and to sustain that deployment for one year. This would roughly equate to a mission of a scale comparable to that of KFOR in Kosovo.</P>

      <P>An inspection of the hull of the LE <i>Róisín</i> undertaken during the course of a routine patrol earlier this year revealed that a section of the bilge keel was missing from the forward port side of the hull. There are three other similar sections on the hull and these were found to be intact.</P>
      <P>The missing section was a narrow steel plate, measuring approximately five metres long by 750 millimetres deep, which was welded perpendicularly to the hull to reduce the roll of the vessel.</P>
      <P>The LE <i>Róisín</i> was dry-docked in Cork dockyard and four new bilge keels of improved design were fitted; all costs involved were borne by the shipbuilder under warranty. The vessel is currently operational and on patrol.</P>

The programme which has target average participation of 35,520 participants this year, will continue to be a very substantial active labour <Col N="1456" /> market programme and will continue to support the community and voluntary sectors, if at a reduced level over time.</P>
      <P>Consultations on the ongoing funding of essential services currently provided through CE, such as the services provided by caring organisations, will take place in a special working group to be established under the PPF, comprising the social partners and representatives of Government Departments. The work of this group will include: identifying the key essential services currently provided through CE and accessing the implications of those services for CE in terms of budget; number of places, having regard to the planned reduction of 4,500 places, as per the Government decision in July 1999 to restructure CE; and the objectives of CE, including the provision of community services.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Partnership 2000 report on the social economy, the Government decided in July 1999 to approve the introduction of a social economy programme.</P>
      <P>The programme is overseen by a national monitoring committee chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and representatives of relevant Departments and the social partners. The monitoring committee has recently adopted the operating framework for the new programme.</P>
      <P>The programme will be operated by FÁS. The next steps are the establishment of local working groups to oversee the programme at local level and the promotion of the programme. Applications for funding will be made through FÁS offices locally.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the social economy programme are to promote the emergence and consolidation of the social economy; to maximise the potential of the social economy to generate employment that is sustainable and of high quality, subject to labour market constraints; to regenerate both urban and rural communities by providing urgently needed local services, employment opportunities and experience for people who have been distanced from the labour market; and to promote equal opportunities between men and women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three categories of project that will be funded under the social economy programme are community businesses, which are ultimately <Col N="1457" /> expected to be financed from trading income alone; deficient-demand social enterprises, where the demand for particular goods and services within a community is not matched by resources to pay for these due to disadvantage or low density of population; and enterprises based on public service contracts, where public services in disadvantaged areas and communities are subcontracted to local social economy enterprises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Donegal employment initiative task force was established in response to the job losses announced at Fruit of the Loom. As the Deputy will know, as a direct result of these job losses, a participative conference was arranged on the investment and employment opportunities in the marine sector in the county.</P>
      <P>A target for the identification of 1,000 new jobs was set and I am pleased to say that on foot of the conference, potential for the immediate creation of some 650 new jobs was identified, along with the creation of a further 1,000 jobs in the longer term. The summary and recommendations resulting from the conference were forwarded to the task force and formed the basis of the marine section of the task force's report.</P>
      <P>A number of steps to build on the potential of Donegal's marine sector have been taken, including investment of more than £5 million in harbour developments in 2000 and progressing the development of new landing facilities, costing £20 million, at Killybegs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made in relation to the extension of the National Fisheries Training Centre at Greencastle. Work on this extension commenced early this year and is on schedule to be completed by August 2000. There has been initiation of a cross-Border aquaculture development programme which will work with <Col N="1460" /> the sector to provide technical and managerial support.</P>
    <P>Work is proceeding in both Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Marine Institute towards the development of new fisheries in deepwater species and inshore fisheries aimed at increasing the sustainable exploitation of these new stocks. I am confident that this work will provide benefits to the marine sector in Donegal.</P>
    <P>There is accelerated aquaculture licensing procedures and an independent board for appeals. New operators, with the prospect of creating 30 jobs over three to five years, have been licenced since March 1999. Applications from existing licensees and intending operators, with the prospect of creating 30 jobs over a five year period, are under active consideration and will be decided upon as soon as the statutory consultation process is completed.</P>
    <P>As part of my strategy for the marine tourism sector, a new division, headed by a principal officer, has been set up in my Department. A study was initiated by the Marine Institute to prepare an outline strategy for the development of tourism and leisure in the marine and inland waters of County Donegal. Work on this study was undertaken in close co-operation with Donegal County Council, the North-West Regional Fisheries Board and North West Tourism. I hope to launch this study shortly. However, in the meantime, I understand that the issues raised in the course of the study are being viewed in the context of a new sectoral forum on tourism which the county development board is considering establishing. I believe that the marine tourism and leisure area will have an important role to play in this overall tourism initiative by creating sustainable jobs, while protecting the marine and inland water environment.</P>

      <P>On 17 February 2000, I announced the agreement of a tripartite process comprising representatives from my Department, ESB management and the ESB group of unions which set out a new framework for the electricity industry.

      <P>The agreement on peat stations is that two new state of the art peat stations, to be owned by the ESB, will be built over the next few years in addition to the state of the art peat-fired plant currently under construction in the east midlands by Edenderry Power Limited. In the meantime, those existing peat stations, including Bellacorrick, currently producing electricity will operate under an interim public service obligation arrangement for up to five years to be dovetailed with the coming on stream of the new stations and to facilitate orderly closure.</P>

      <P>Proposals for investment in public transport for the period 2000-06 are set out in detail in the national development plan. A provision of £185 million is being made for a short-term suburban rail development programme which includes provision for the phased purchase of an additional 46 DART cars and 58 diesel railcars. The estimated cost of these carriages is £134 million. The combination of infrastructural improvements and the additional rolling stock will increase DART capacity by almost 7,400 places and suburban rail capacity by 7,800 seats.</P>
      <P>The plan also provides for an investment of £220 million in the development of the bus network by both Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann through the purchase of additional buses, ongoing fleet replacement and equipment renewal. This investment programme includes the purchase of 275 additional buses which will increase the capacity by 22,000 extra seats.</P>
      <P>In addition, a number of options for the future development of the suburban rail network are being evaluated from a feasibility and cost perspective. A contingency provision of £500 million has been included in the plan for the implementation of this programme and the underground element of Luas.</P>
      <P>The principal funding sources for the investment programme, as set out in the national development plan, are the Exchequer, EU, PPPs and CIE internal resources. The level of Exchequer funding will be determined annually as part of the Estimates process. The Estimates provision for 2000 is £236 million, comprising £100 million for railway safety, £90 million for Luas and £46 million for other public transport investment.</P>
      <P>The capital investment outlined above is additional to the annual Exchequer subvention to CIE, which in 2000 amounted to £115 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to a recent increase in the maximum return fare on the three public service obligation routes operating between Dublin and Kerry, Galway and Sligo airports.</P>
      <P>The terms under which these PSOs operate stipulate, <i>inter alia</i>, that the maximum fare may be increased in the event of an abnormal or unforeseen increase in cost factors for which the air carrier is not responsible. In this case, Aer Lingus sought the fare increase as a result of increased costs including airport charges and a rapid rise in the price of aviation fuel over the past year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy, however, is incorrect in suggesting that the maximum return fare has been increased in excess of 20%. The return fare of IR£89 was originally agreed with Aer Lingus in 1998. This has now been increased by IR£8, representing an increase of 9%. The EU Commission was advised of this increase, notice of which was published in the EU Official Journal.</P>
      <P>In line with increasing costs, Aer Lingus has, in fact, also increased all through fares to and from continental Europe by £10 return, with effect from 1 March this year, and a similar increase will shortly be applied to through fares to/from the UK.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the problem referred to by the Deputy is the unreasonable risk identified by IRMS in the safety audit report published earlier this month. The risk was reported as a class one rail defect, requiring mandatory removal within <Col N="1465" /> 24 hours, which was still running without any additional controls six days after discovery.</P>
      <P>The problem identified by IRMS was an ultrasonic defect in a rail in Athenry railway station. I have been assured by Iarnród Éireann that the rail in question has been replaced. It appears that, due to the unique nature of the particular rail, a replacement rail was not immediately available. However, pending its replacement, the rail was monitored on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>IRMS has advised that, since this was a low speed area, the rail was unlikely to fail catastrophically and hence was not a high safety risk to passengers. However, as it was not rectified within 24 hours in accordance with Iarnród Éireann's own procedures, it was classified by IRMS as an unreasonable risk, that is, it fell far short of best practice.</P>

      <P>The implementation review was published on 7 March last. On the same day, but prior to the publication, I met the managing director of Iarnród Éireann and his senior management team to express my serious concerns about elements of the report's findings. I made it clear during the course of the meeting that I found it unacceptable <Col N="1466" /> that the unreasonable risks identified in the original 1998 report had not yet been fully resolved.</P>
      <P>Follow up meetings between my Department, Iarnród Éireann and IRMS have already taken place to identify the actions that are required to address these and other issues raised in the IRMS report. Arising from these meetings, Iarnród Éireann is now in the process of preparing a paper outlining its response to the unreasonable risks which remain to be fully resolved, including those on the Maynooth suburban line. This paper, which I expect to receive shortly, will be considered by my Department and IRMS with a view to agreeing a process for dealing with them in a manner that is acceptable to IRMS.</P>

      <Quest>the considerations, if any, given to the optimum or ultimate capacity for growth which remains at Dublin Airport in view of the proposals for a further runway; and the concerns about noise and air pollution raised by adjacent residential communities.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of development capacity at Dublin Airport was considered by Warburg Dillon Read-AIB in their recent report on Aer Rianta's future strategic direction. The advisers considered this issue in the context of appraising the need, if any, for a second airport in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>I note the advisers formed the view that Dublin Airport is not constrained from a capacity point of view and indeed, that it has sufficient capacity to expand and accommodate up to 40 million passengers per annum. This figure of about 40 million is, therefore, the most recent estimate of the optimum or ultimate capacity of Dublin Airport and compares to a figure of 12.8 million passengers using the airport in 1999. The advisers also considered various forecasts for passenger growth at Dublin Airport and, depending on the assumptions used, Dublin would reach its estimated capacity potential in 20 to 30 years time. In due course, obviously, there will be a need to plan in a timely fashion for further airport capacity in the Dublin area. The advisers also believe that plans currently under consideration to improve surface transport links to the airport will ease current access difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the provision of further runway capacity at Dublin Airport, the position is that in discussions with my Department, Aer Rianta has outlined its indications that an additional runway is estimated to be required towards the end of the current decade. I understand from the company that there is a technical committee, comprising Aer Rianta, the airlines, the Irish Airline Pilots Association and the Irish Aviation Authority, which is currently considering and evaluating runway capacity issues at Dublin Airport and the options for ensuring that the needs of future <Col N="1467" /> traffic growth can be facilitated in a timely fashion.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns of some residents in north Dublin in relation to aircraft noise. I assure the Deputy that the regulations which apply in Ireland to aircraft noise levels are those which have been promulgated at European Union level.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am advised by Aer Rianta that it has commissioned a consultancy study which will propose a noise management strategy, including provision of noise monitoring, at Dublin Airport. I understand that this study is expected to be completed by the middle of this year. I welcome this initiative by Aer Rianta, which informs me that it will continue to encourage all measures to minimise noise impact where practicable.</P>

      <P>My Department has not prepared legislation to privatise bus transport. Following a Government decision last November, my officials are currently undertaking an urgent review of the Road Transport Act, 1932, with a view to the introduction of competition in Dublin bus services. Wide consultation has taken place as part of this review and my officials are at present considering written submissions and meeting key stakeholders to explore their views.</P>
      <P>Following completion of the review, I expect to be in a position on 11 April next to present my report to the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructural development and public private partnerships for its consideration. The report will set out broad parameters for a new regulatory framework for the bus market in Dublin. Further consultation will be necessary regarding the detail of any specific proposals for new legislation which may arise. In any case, any new legislative measure would require approval by Cabinet and full debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas in the normal way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 213 together.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service is the State's principal sea going agency and is tasked with a variety of defence and other roles. It is equipped with a total of eight vessels comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, five offshore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels. The new patrol vessel, the LE <i>Róisín</i>, was commissioned on 15 December 1999 and became operational immediately afterwards. I recently announced the decision to acquire a second new ship similar to the LE <i>Róisín</i>.</P>
      <P>The present policy of ongoing recruitment for enlistment in the Defence Forces, which I have approved, is designed to address the question of any shortfalls in personnel numbers in the Defence Forces, including the Naval Service. I have already provided the House with specific details on this in a reply to a question this afternoon.</P>
      <P>The main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. The service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. Fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by the two Casa maritime patrol aircraft.</P>
      <P>Fishery protection activity accounts for over 90% of all Naval Service patrol time. However, as the need arises, Naval Service vessels may be deployed to other duties such as search and rescue, aid to the civil power, drug interdiction operations and assistance with pollution control.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners. While the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union, Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment, in 1993, of a joint task force involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of routine patrols Naval Service vessels may be deployed to drug interdiction operations. Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities. While Naval Service personnel are <Col N="1469" /> designated as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, in practice the Naval Service operates under the direction of the joint task force where measures to combat the importation of illegal drugs are concerned. Existing resources enable the Naval Service to respond effectively to taskings involving fisheries protection and the prevention of illegal drug importation.</P>
    <P>It would not be meaningful to draw comparisons between the full range of duties performed by the Naval Service with duties performed by the naval services-fishery protection agencies of other European Union member states.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence considered the role of the Naval Service. It describes in a comprehensive way the contribution which the Naval Service makes in this regard. The White Paper also recognises the significant and primary activity of the Naval Service in implementing European Union fishery policies.</P>

    <P>The Naval Service is the State's principal sea going agency and is tasked with a variety of defence and other roles. It is equipped with a total of eight vessels comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, five offshore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.

    <P>The Government has decided, in the context of the White Paper on Defence, that the revised roles of the Defence Forces are to defend the State against armed aggression; this being a contingency, preparations for its implementation will depend on an ongoing Government assessment of the security and defence environment; to aid the civil power &ndash; meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána, who have primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State &ndash; to participate in multinational peace support, crisis management and humanitarian relief operations in support of the United Nations and under UN mandate, including regional security missions authorised by the UN; to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the EU and to carry out such other duties as may be assigned to them from time to time, e.g. search and rescue, air ambulance service, ministerial air transport service, assistance on the occasion of natural or other disasters, assistance in connection with the maintenance of essential services and assistance in combating oil pollution at sea.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence considered the role of the Naval Service. It describes in a comprehensive way the contribution which the Naval Service makes in this regard and gives specific recognition to the unique characteristics which Naval Service vessels carry with them as an expression of State sovereignty and political will at sea and in furthering objectives in the international maritime domain. The White Paper also recognises the significant and primary activity of the Naval Service in implementing European Union fishery policies. Substantial funding was provided by the European Union towards the acquisition of five of the eight Naval Service vessels and for the future the White Paper commits the Government to the maintenance of the number of vessels at this level. The White Paper also sets out proposals for the better utilisation of these assets.</P>

The provision for expenditure on Naval Service equipment in 2000 is £16.48 million.</P>
      <P>The most important development for the Naval Service in recent years has been the delivery and commissioning of LE <i>Róisín</i>, the first new ship in the Naval fleet since LE <i>Eithne</i> in 1984. The new ship, which was part funded by the EU, cost in the region of £22.5 million. Reports from the Naval Service in relation to the ship's performance are very satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I was very pleased to announce recently that the Government had approved the purchase of a second new fishery protection vessel of the same type as LE <i>Róisín</i> as a replacement for LE <i>Deirdre</i> which is approaching the end of its economic service life. I expect to be in a position to sign the contract for the new ship next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Major works have been carried out in the naval base over recent years, again with substantial assistance from the EU, in the refitting of Naval <Col N="1474" /> Service ships. Refits involve replacing and/or refurbishing obsolete or deteriorated equipment and are necessary to extend the operational life of a vessel. In 1999, a half-life refit of LE <i>Eithne </i>was completed in the Naval Dockyard, Haulbowline, at an estimated cost of £2.06 million. In previous years, four other vessels &ndash; LE <i>Deirdre</i>, LE <i>Emer</i>, LE <i>Aoife</i> and LE<i> Aisling</i>&ndash; have been similarly refitted. The LE <i>Orla</i> is being refitted at present and the remaining Naval ship, LE <i>Ciara</i> is due to undergo similar refurbishment later this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The future organisation and equipping of the Defence Forces, having regard to their new roles, will be determined within the parameters of the White Paper on Defence which was recently approved by Government and the investment programme announced in conjunction with that paper.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the White Paper, the revised roles were proposed in response to a detailed assessment of the defence and security environment which specifically pertains to Ireland. There is no basis for a meaningful comparison in the foregoing respects between the Defence Forces and the armed forces of other European Union member states.</P>
      <P>The Air Corps has traditionally discharged a mix of functions based on the need to supply a range of different services such as search and rescue, fishery protection and ministerial air transport. The generally favourable security climate resulted in the need for a very limited military air capability. In considering the White Paper on Defence, the Government decided that the current broad profile of Air Corps roles will be maintained. The future development of the Air Corps will be determined within the following policy parameters: maintenance/generation of a 24 hour general helicopter capability for a variety of military and non-military tasks, including Garda support; the provision of search and rescue capabilities on the basis of agreed arrangements with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources; the provision of a ministerial air transport service; the provision of fishery protection patrol services to standards agreed with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources; the provision of an air ambulance service on the basis of agreed arrangements with the Department of Health and Children; and other transport services of a military or non-military kind and provision of an appropriate capability to meet training requirements.</P>
      <P>Any aspirations to broaden the range of available air based capabilities of the Air Corps, have to be balanced against real world constraints. Given the enormous costs involved, few small countries possess the ability to provide a comprehensive air based defence capability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the publication of the White Paper and in recognition of the urgent equipment modernisation requirements of the Air Corps, I was pleased to announce on 1 March 2000 the allocation of a total of up to £55 million over the next three years for this purpose. These funds will initiate vital investment in new aircraft for the Air Corps under the direction of the high level civil-<Col N="1476" /> military planning and procurement group which, as indicated in the White Paper, will be tasked with the development of a new plan to address Defence Forces' equipment needs over a five year time frame.</P>
    <P>The General Officer commanding the Air Corps, Brigadier General Pat Cranfield, warmly welcomed the news of this new investment. He has been asked to draw up the full technical specification documents which will be necessary for commencement of the procurement process in relation to two new medium range helicopters and a further helicopter mainly for the training of pilots for the Garda air support unit. This work is under way in the Air Corps and a joint civil-military project team will be set up in due course to organise and oversee the procurement process.</P>

      <P>Under the national development plan, funding of the order of £110 million will be available to support Leader-type activity in the period 2000-2006. Some £35.4 million of this is to be provided by the EU in respect of the Leader+ programme. The balance will come from the national Exchequer and will comprise national co-funding of £20 million for Leader+ as well as support for a mainstream Leader-type measure. As with other measures provided for in the national development plan, approval by the European Commission is necessary to enable commencement of arrangements for the establishment of Leader mainstream activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the importance of continuity in the delivery of the Leader rural development programmes in the period 2000-06 and I acknowledge that the work effected under Leader I and <Col N="1479" /> Leader II has very significantly benefited local communities. Accordingly, every effort is being made to ensure the earliest implementation of the two new Leader measures. The timing of this will depend in large measure on the date of securing the necessary approval of the European Commission in respect of the draft operational programmes governing the Leader+ programme and the national Leader programme. Drafting of the operational programmes will commence when the Leader+ guidelines document is published by the Commission and this is expected shortly.</P>
    <P>Groups have been funded to the 30 June 2000 Leader II completion date and I am conscious that a further period will elapse before the coming on-stream of the new Leader measures. Accordingly, I have secured interim funding in respect of the period from 30 June 2000 to 31 December 2000 to assist with the administrative costs of existing groups. Such funding will be made available to groups who submit a plan document demonstrating a realistic requirement. Any funding of existing groups will be without prejudice to the selection of groups for the delivery of the new Leader activity.</P>

      <P>An application under the national scheme of investment aid for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards from the person named was received in my Department in August 1999. It is a strict condition of this scheme that the prior written approval of my Department must be obtained before commencement of any development work. As the works on which aid was sought under the application in this case had commenced at the time of initial inspection and prior to the completion of processing and issue of any approval, the applicant is ineligible for grant aid under this scheme.</P>
      <P>I presume that the milk quota aspect refers to the allocation of the additional quantities secured under Agenda 2000. The eligibility criteria for the allocation to producers of the additional 20.5 million gallons of milk quota were announced by me at the end of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of this additional quota available from 1 April 2000, 15 million gallons will be allocated to active milk producers with quotas of less than 55,000 gallons who have demonstrated a commitment to dairying by filling their existing quota and acquir<Col N="1482" /> ing additional quota. A further five million gallons will be allocated to younger dairy farmers with quotas of less than 35,000 gallons who have shown similar commitment. It was necessary to set strict eligibility criteria for the allocation of the extra quota in order to maximise its effect. On the basis of the information available to my Department, the person named does not meet the eligibility criteria for these schemes and, therefore, is not entitled to an allocation.</P>
    <P>I will, however, in due course, announce details for the allocation of the remaining 500,000 gallons that has been set aside for special cases arising out of the operation of the general distribution and if the person named qualifies under that scheme he may apply at that stage.</P>

      <P>The person named is not the registered herdowner of the herd number quoted. The registered herdowner applied on 43 animals under the 1999 cattle headage scheme. At an inspection carried out on 12 July 1999 one of the animals applied on was absent, one animal did not have a passport and 13 animals were not recorded in the herd register. The registered herdowner was advised in writing on the day of the inspection that she had not complied with clauses 13 and 32 (b) and (d) of the terms and conditions governing the 1999 cattle headage scheme. The registered herdowner was invited to submit any additional information on the inspection to my Department within seven days. My Department received a reply from the registered herdowner on 15 September 1999 and while this information was taken into account when considering the appropriate penalty to apply to her application, my Department wrote to her on 15 November 1999 advising that no grants were payable under the 1999 cattle headage scheme. She was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed by writing to my Department within 21 days setting out any facts which she wished to put forward to support her case but no reply was received. I am now arranging to have the case reviewed again and my Department will be in contact with the herdowner as soon as the review is completed.</P>

      <P>The EU regulations governing the operation of the cattle headage-beef cow headage scheme and those regulations governing the integrated administration and control system lay down specific penalties to be imposed where farmers fail to comply with the terms and conditions of the schemes. Farmers are not penalised for obvious errors in completing application forms. Where obvious errors occur on applications my Department endeavours to have the errors corrected without penalty by contacting the farmers concerned. In fact staff at local offices spend much time on this issue during the processing of applications each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The applications which have not been paid under the 1999 cattle headage-beef cow scheme are unpaid for various reasons. For example, 904 applications have not been processed for payment at local office level due to ongoing queries with the farmers concerned. Over 790 farmers did not submit an area aid application or submitted it or their cattle headage-beef cow scheme application outside the period for lodging applications and cannot be paid their grants as a result. Some 230 farmers who applied for grants under the 1999 cattle headage-beef cow scheme had insufficient area to qualify for any payment. Forty farmers incurred a 100% shortfall penalty, i.e., no payment as a result of not presenting a sufficient number of animals at inspections even though the animals were declared on their application forms. In addition, 88 farmers were excluded from the scheme for one year due to false declarations on their applications through serious negligence. Nine farmers were excluded for two years. They were deemed to have made intentional false declarations on their applications. The remaining cases unpaid at present have problems with their area aid applications and it is not possible to say at this stage how many will receive payment as <Col N="1486" /> this will depend on the resolution of the queries concerned.</P>

      <P>The carcase classification results for all categories of cattle slaughtered in licensed meat export premises in Ireland during the period 1990-98 are as outlined in my reply to Question No. 167 of 15 June 1999. The results for 1999 are given in the annex.</P>
      <P>The grades of Irish cattle as measured on the EU classification system deteriorated in the period 1990 to 1998 but showed an improvement in 1999. A number of factors have contributed to the deterioration in grades. The main factors involved were the flat pricing system operated by meat processors and changes in the genetic composition of the cattle herd, brought about mainly by the increasing use of the Holstein breed in the dairy herd. In addition, the low level of live trade to third countries in recent years has also been a factor as these markets traditionally took the poorer quality finished cattle.</P>
      <P>However, the final figures for 1999 showed a welcome improvement in classification grades generally. There was a 5% increase in the number of steers classified as U grades in 1999 and a 6% increase in the number of R grade steers. There was no great change in the number of O grades but P grades fell by 36% from 9.9% to 7.3%. This is a movement in the right direction and I have asked the industry to work together to ensure that the pricing system continue to move towards providing adequate incentives to farmers to produce quality cattle.</P>
      <P>My Department, Teagasc and the ICBF are seeking to implement a cattle breeding policy aimed at the production of high quality cattle demanded by the market. This should result in a further improvement in grades in the near future.</P>

      <P>In accordance with EU and national regulations, herdowners are required to tag calves within 20 days of birth with two plastic eartags each bearing the same identity numbers. Eurotags Ltd (Mullinahone Co-op) was appointed as the sole supplier of approved cattle tags in respect of 1999 on foot of an open tendering competition conducted under national and EU procurement rules. The contract has since been extended for a further period of one year to <Col N="1489" /> 31 December 2000 and I have no plans to change the current arrangements in the interim.</P>
      <P>A survey of tag loss rates carried out by Department staff in 1999 revealed that 0.6% of animals were missing both tags while 3.5% had one plastic tag missing. These loss rates compare more than favourably to the loss rates experienced with the brass eartags formerly used to identify cattle.</P>

      <P>Under EU legislation, which applies in all member states, my Department implements a comprehensive national residue plan covering all food-producing species, including poultry. Under this plan, samples of poultry taken over the year at farm and slaughter plant levels are tested for residues of illegal hormones, of veterinary medicines and of environmental contaminants. No hormones have been detected in almost 600 samples tested specifically for these substances over the past two years.</P>
      <P>I have provided for enhanced consumer protection in this area by bringing into force legislation under which all primary processors of animal food products are required to monitor raw material for the presence of residues and where positives are detected, to subject the suppliers concerned to a progressively increased level of surveillance. Under these arrangements, processors are required to submit their detailed plans for the approval of my Department, as well as the results of such monitoring.</P>
      <P>Third countries, wishing to export poultry products to the EU, are required to provide equivalent guarantees of consumer protection to those applying within the Union by submitting for the approval of the European Commission relevant details of their legislation and of their detailed plans for detection of residues.</P>

The disposal of a site may be permitted subject to the prior written approval of the Department. If a larger area of land is disposed of the participant is obliged to replace it. Disposals are generally subject to the clawback of the pension paid and a reduction in the future pension payable. These are guidelines only and each case would have to be judged on its own merits.</P>

      <P>The qualifying medical criteria for relief from tax under the Disabled Drivers' and Disabled Passengers' (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, are set out in Regulation 3 of those regulations, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. Where a person does not meet one or more of the medical criteria, issue of a primary certificate will normally be refused by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the local health board. The Revenue Commissioners cannot consider an application for relief under the scheme where a certificate has been refused. In cases where issue of the primary medical certificate is refused, it is open to the applicant to appeal this refusal to the Disabled Drivers' Medical Board of Appeal, an independent board whose decision is final.</P>
      <P>The board of appeal has advised the Revenue Commissioners that they have no record of an appeal by the person named at the address stated by the Deputy. However, a person of the same name, but living at a different Kilkenny address, was examined by the board on 27 July 1996. It was found that the person did not meet the medical criteria at that time and the issue of the certificate was refused. It is open to the person concerned to reapply for the certificate if there has been a material change in his or her medical condition to the extent that the medical criteria may now be met.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy as to the number of appeals to the board is as follows:</P>

    <P>As I have informed the House on a number of occasions, the scheme is currently being reviewed by an interdepartmental working group under the chair of an official of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The group is examining all aspects of the scheme and I hope to receive its report later in the year.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a decision was taken by the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas in consultation with the Government Supplies Agency to increase the sale price of the Official Reports of the Dáil and Seanad, Parliamentary Debates, from £2 to £5 from 1 January last. The decision was taken as part of an ongoing review by the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas into printing costs and the increase will go some way towards recovering some of the increased costs. In practice, few members of the general public purchase printed copies. Since the Official Reports are now available free on the Internet, I consider that, overall, there is easier public access than before.</P>

This work is being dealt with as a matter of the highest priority and additional resources have been applied to this work from within the existing staffing resources.

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the level of co-operation being received from the financial institutions in progressing the audit of their DIRT liabilities has varied from one institution to another.

Difficulties which Revenue auditors have encountered in the course of their work in some cases have been brought to the attention of the managements concerned and the programme of DIRT auditing is being advanced as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the company in this case is a community based, non-profit making concern, established to promote Irish music and culture. In 1998 and early 1999 the company built a centre comprising a museum, classrooms and a concert hall together with a souvenir shop/snack bar. The income from the shop/snack bar is liable to VAT while the provision of the other facilities would not give rise to any taxable supplies. The company incurred VAT on the development of its premises.</P>
      <P>Section 12(1) of the VAT Act, 1972, as amended, states that &ldquo;in computing the amount of tax payable by him in respect of a taxable period, a taxable person may, in so far as the goods and services are used by him for the purpose of his taxable supplies, deduct VAT properly charged to him ..&rdquo;. In accordance with section 12 of the VAT Act, the VAT suffered on the building development is required to be apportioned with only the proportion relating to taxable supplies qualifying for allowance as input credit. On this basis 20% of the VAT suffered on the building development could be allowed as a deduction. I understand that the company is aware of the position. There is, therefore, no statutory basis on which the treatment sought by the Deputy could be based in this case.</P>

      <P>A stamp duty charge of 0.1% is payable on mortgages over £20,000. However, there is a ceiling of £500 on the amount which can be charged on any mortgage. Stamp duty is effectively a charge on documents in order for the document to have legal standing. There is no provision for a stamp duty exemption for mortgage change cover for the same property. This modest charge yielded £7.86 million in 1999 and permits the easement of taxation in other areas most notably income tax. Consequently, I have no plans to remove or reduce this charge at present.</P>

In relation to such relief, it is a requirement that pension contributions be made prior to cessation of service. In this case, it is noted that the individual, who retired on 31 July 1999, had initiated inquiries in the matter with her tax office shortly before retirement and that her inquiries had not been finalised before her retirement. In those special circumstances the Revenue will be prepared to consider an appropriate application for relief and the individual's inspector of taxes will be in touch with her accordingly in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 266 and 267 together.</P>
      <P>I do not consider it necessary to make any further changes at present to the rate of betting tax which I reduced from 10% to 5% with effect from 1 July 1999. The provisional figures for receipts for betting duty for January 2000 and February 2000 are £3 million and £3.2 million. The figures for the corresponding months for January 1999 and February 1999 are £5.3 million and £4.4 million. The figures cannot be compared directly, due to the different rates of duty applicable. However, the overall receipts for 1999, at £53.4 million, were up on the 1998 receipts of £52.1 million, despite the halving of the rate of duty from 1 July 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to betting on the Internet, it is illegal for a person within the State to place a bet with a person outside the State. However, any <Col N="1500" /> Irish bookmaker accepting bets <i>via</i> the Internet, whether from within or outside of the State, is liable to remit the relevant 5% duty to the Revenue Commissioners. The overall betting receipts do not distinguish between Internet bets and other bets. Therefore, it is not possible to say what effect the Internet is having on betting. Indeed, one could say that it is having a positive effect.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the UK Customs and Excise Office has issued a consultation document inviting views in which their existing duty system &ldquo;might be modernised in light of future Government and industry needs&rdquo;. No decisions have as yet been taken on any change there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report, Gender Equality in the Civil Service, is the outcome of research commissioned as part of the ongoing development of human resources management policies under the strategic management initiative, SMI, in the Civil Service. Delivering Better Government, DBG, noted that <Col N="1501" /> while the Civil Service had been to the forefront in developing and implementing policies to achieve greater equality of opportunity, nevertheless women employees remained concentrated at lower levels. In view of the need to redress the imbalance, DBG recommended that appropriate strategies be put in place. It was in this context that research was commissioned on the under representation of women in the grades at and above HEO level.</P>
      <P>Among the conclusions from this research are that, compared to men, women can expect to enter at a lower level and progress more slowly through the grading structure and, as a result, can often expect to be paid less over the course of their careers. In addition, women are far more likely to have to balance family and work responsibilities, often choosing job-sharing or ruling out promotion as a result. The research also concluded that women are less likely than men to be placed in high profile, core activities within the service, tending instead to be concentrated in operational areas of work and consequently, women are less likely to benefit from opportunities for accelerated career progression.</P>
      <P>The main research findings, together with a package of measures based on the recommendations in the report, were endorsed by the Government and were presented by the Taoiseach and me at the launch of the current phase of the strategic management initiative for the Civil Service in July 1999.</P>
      <P>The key elements of these measures are the development and adoption of a new equality policy; a programme of affirmative action in the main human resource policy areas of recruitment, placement and mobility, training and development, promotion, work and family responsibilities, language and sexual harassment and policy delivery; the adoption of strategic objective setting at individual Department/office level, including the setting of increasingly specific equality goals, to be achieved over a stated period of time; new equality structures to be put in place, both locally and centrally, to support implementation of the policy and the adoption of a communications strategy for implementation. Work on the development and implementation of these measures is currently under way. A high level gender equality management group, chaired by Ms Josephine Feehily, Revenue Commissioner, has been established. The group has responsibility for the development of a new gender equality policy and a framework programme of affirmative action for equality, in accordance with best standards of equal opportunities practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key element of the approach which the group is developing is the concept of strategic objective setting, whereby Departments and offices will be required to set for themselves increasingly specific goals for greater representation of women, particularly at middle and senior management grades. These goals will be realistic but challenging, will be based on <Col N="1502" /> increased female participation, will operate within the law and will not involve any deviation from the merit principle for selection.</P>
    <P>An essential part of the process will be discussions with the staff and unions on the implementation of the new policy and framework programme, in accordance with the approach adopted to SMI proposals generally.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means, and there are two categories of eligibility. Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and they are entitled to a full range of public health services free of charge. Persons in category 2, non-medical card holders, have limited eligibility for health services, including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges.</P>
      <P>Persons in category 1, medical card holders, are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants' services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>Persons in category 2, non-medical card holders, are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services and out-patient public hospital services including consultants' services. The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is £26 per night, up to a maximum of £260 in any twelve consecutive months. Attendance at accident and emergency departments is subject to a charge of £25 where the patient does not have a referral note from his or her doctor. This charge applies only to the first visit in any episode of care. A maternity and infant care service is provided during pregnancy and up to six weeks after birth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those who do not qualify for a medical card there are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication. Under the long-term illness scheme persons suffering from a number of conditions can obtain without charge the drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition. Under the drug payment scheme, a person and his/her dependants will not <Col N="1504" /> have to pay more than £42 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to health services is such that persons choose to avail of private health insurance cover in Ireland on a voluntary basis. The Health Insurance Act, 1994, and the 1996 Health Insurance Regulations provide for open enrolment which obliges insurers to make cover available to persons under the age of 65 regardless of whether or not they were previously covered. Cover is subject to underwriting provisions, normally associated with private health insurance contracts. Such provisions involve waiting periods for benefit payments both in respect of the period immediately after taking out cover and in respect of pre-existing medical conditions. The law also provides for lifetime cover which means that once a person is covered by a registered insurer, he or she cannot be deprived of cover except in limited exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>The citing of the age of 65 years, under which insurers are obliged to provide first time cover in the State to persons requesting it, reflects the practice prevailing in the market prior to the introduction of the 1994 Act. It is a matter for registered insurers to decide whether or not to provide cover for a person of or over the age of 65 years who is seeking access to the community rated health insurance system for the first time. However, if an insurer decides to make such cover available, it must do so on the basis of community rating and lifetime cover.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Private Health Insurance, published in September 1999, addresses the question of enabling those aged 65 and over to avail of private health insurance based on lifetime community rating. Legislation to give effect to this entitlement is being drafted at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 273, 285, 298 and 299 together.</P>
      <P>The licensing of traditional use or herbal medicinal products is an issue which is being addressed by a working group set up by the EU Pharmaceutical Committee last year. As an early resolution to the difficulties of harmonisation in this area is not anticipated, I have asked my officials and the Irish Medicines Board to investigate the possibility of establishing a simplified interim national licensing system for traditional use medicinal products which would allow such products to be lawfully marketed here. I understand that an initial meeting to discuss this matter will take place later this week.</P>
      <P>Under the Medical Preparations (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1996, the IMB is the competent authority in this country for the assessment and licensing of all medicinal products including herbal medicinal products. In 1999, following an assessment of an application for a product authorisation, the IMB recommended to my Department that products containing St John's Wort should be subject to prescription-only control in view of safety concerns which it had identified. Further evidence has subsequently emerged confirming the IMB's concerns in this matter, and a number of other national regulatory authorities have also recently issued warnings in regard to these products, including the Food and Drugs Administration in the United States, the European Medicines Evaluation Agency of the European Union and the Medicines Control Agency in the United Kingdom which recently published its concerns regarding the potential of St John's Wort to interact with other commonly prescribed medicines. As the expert authority in this country, the IMB advises my Department in these matters and it has not recommended any change in the current regulatory status of St John's Wort arising from the actions of the aforementioned regulatory bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter for the IMB to advise the companies concerned if specific product labelling requirements are deemed necessary. This would form part of the assessment during the course of an application for a marketing authorisation. In the absence of appropriate applications for licensing, such as is the case with some products containing St John's Wort, it would be impractical <Col N="1506" /> for the IMB to address its public health concerns by way of labelling.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 274 and 275 together.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2001 million was made available by the Government to the health sector under the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
      <P>The indicative funding figures for health boards are based on a number of factors including meeting capital commitments already planned or under way, addressing the regional objectives of the NDP so that priority is given to the disadvantaged areas, and providing for key service initiatives. The latter relates, for example, to capital projects that will underpin better integration of services, the waiting list initiative, disability services, etc.</P>
      <P>A further consideration was to achieve more equal funding between the hospital and non-hospital sectors to address the situation that has emerged over the years whereby the majority of capital funding available was utilised by acute hospital services. The national objective is to move towards a 50/50 basis over the life span of the NDP.</P>
      <P>My Department issued last month indicative funding figures for the NDP to health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA. These related to the years 2001-2006 only, as the most appropriate approach for this year is to manage the capital programme to ensure that carry-over commitments into 2000 are met and that extensive equipping and refurbishment programmes in various health board areas are commenced. Also, given the rapid pace of technical change associated with information and communications technology, ICT, systems generally, indicative funding figures for the years 2000 &ndash; 2002 only issued to boards in respect of this particular area. The total indicative figure issued to the Midland Health Board for the years 2001-2006, excluding the ICT area, was £124.06 million. The indicative figure for the board in respect of ICT for the years 2000-2002 was £2.09 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department will have discussions with health boards and the ERHA to draw up capital development plans in line with the figures indi<Col N="1507" /> cated to each agency. The figures are indicative only and will be subject to continuous review to ensure that the funding allocated to the health sector is spent by the agencies in a planned and co-ordinated manner and within the time frames indicated by the plan.</P>

An additional five consultant posts have been approved by Comhairle for the board since the beginning of 1998. Further consultant appointments are planned this year in haematology and oncology.</P>
      <P>The approval of additional consultant posts for the board has been facilitated by my Department's policy of achieving self sufficiency in the provision of regional specialities at health board level. This policy has informed the approach being taken in the implementation of the national cancer strategy, the planned implementation of the national cardiovascular strategy and the development of renal services, for example. In addition, the major capital developments being planned for Tullamore General Hospital and Portlaoise General Hospital will, as the Deputy will appreciate, involve the further development of services in the commissioning phases.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for An t-Ard Chláraitheoir, the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The registration system seeks to ensure that all births are registered as accurately as possible in a timely and legally adequate manner. The Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1863 to 1996, <Col N="1508" /> impose a duty on the parent(s) of a child and in the default of the parent(s) on other specified informants to give to the registrar, within 42 days of the birth, the information required for the registration of a birth, and to sign the entry in the register of births. As the Deputy may be aware, the right of a person to have his or her birth registered has recently been acknowledged by the review group on the Constitution.</P>
    <P>An t-Árd Chláraitheoir maintains an index of births, deaths and marriages at the General Register Office, Joyce House, 8-11 Lombard Street East, Dublin 2, which may be searched on payment of the statutory fee and a search in the birth records, on the basis of the information furnished, has failed to disclose a birth registration in respect of the person referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Where it is established that a birth has not previously been registered, it is possible to effect registration provided the information, required by law to be registered, is available. The authority of An t-Árd Chláraitheoir is required for the registration of a birth, where more than 12 months has elapsed since the date of birth. A statutory declaration setting out the particulars to be registered is required. An application for authority for the late registration of the birth in question was received by An t-Árd Chláraitheoir on 20 March 2000. However, as the accompanying statutory declaration was not in order, the applicant was immediately issued with a new statutory declaration with instructions on its proper completion. An t-Árd Chláraitheoir will be in a position to finalise this application as soon as a properly completed statutory declaration is received. There has been no undue delay in processing the application.</P>

Sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permits health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. This is to facilitate health boards which do not have sufficient accommodation in their hospitals and homes to meet the needs of those requiring nursing care and which have traditionally relied on the nursing home sector to meet this need.</P>

      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. The illnesses covered by this scheme are mental handicap, mental illness, for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to extend the scheme, having regard to the other schemes available to help people with the cost of drugs and medicines. For example, people who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Non-medical card holders can avail of the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 with a threshold of £42 per individual or family unit. The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about improvements over previous schemes and it is designed to be user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow for families and <Col N="1510" /> individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>

      <P>Due to the high cost of fixed appliance orthodontic therapy, health boards can only provide this treatment where a child has a handicapping orthodontic condition.

The classification of cases awaiting treatment, according to these guidelines is as follows; category A, the most severe cases, for example, cleft lip and palate; category B, cases with a functional handicap for example, marked disproportion between the upper and lower jaws; and category C, non-handicapping cases but having a need for treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1984, the Government published Planning for the Future, the report of a study group set up to examine our psychiatric services. The report recommended that psychiatric care should be primarily community based and that there should be a shift away from the psychiatric hospital being the focal point of the service. Successive Governments have adopted this policy and the shift in mental health care from an institutional to a community-based setting has resulted in many improvements. As a result, a considerable number of people with mental illness can now live normal and fulfilling lives in their own communities.</P>
      <P>The aim is to provide each individual patient with the best possible care in the most appropriate setting. Community care is not always the most suitable method of care and in a number of cases in-patient treatment is required. Medical practitioners are responsible for decisions on whether to admit or discharge patients from in-patient care and patients are only discharged from in-patient care when their clinical condition warrants it.</P>
      <P>In view of the positive benefits that have resulted for so many patients there are no plans to revise the Government's policy in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The strategy being pursued in relation to breastfeeding by the health promotion unit of my Department is in accordance with the recommendations of the national breastfeeding policy. In prioritising the recommendations, it was recognised that as health professionals are the first <Col N="1516" /> point of contact for the mother during pregnancy and after birth, their support would be critical. The advice of qualified health care professionals allows the mother to make an informed choice on breastfeeding. The National University of Ireland Galway, with funding from the health promotion unit of my Department has produced a training pack for health professionals which includes a breastfeeding video and information booklets. The pack was developed in conjunction with an Bord Altranais and has been widely disseminated. It is designed to equip health professionals with the necessary knowledge and skills to help mothers with breastfeeding their children.</P>
      <P>One of the main recommendations of the national breastfeeding policy was that Ireland participate in the &ldquo;Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative&rdquo;. This global campaign led by the WHO and UNICEF encourages hospitals and health workers to support mothers to breastfeed. This initiative has recently been established in Ireland and the number of hospitals, maternity and paediatric units involved in the initiative continues to grow.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit continues to be involved in ensuring the implementation of other recommendations of the national breastfeeding policy. Support is provided to voluntary organisations such as La Léche League, Cuidiu (Irish Childbirth Trust) and the Association of Lactation Consultants to produce a range of material to promote the incidence of breastfeeding.</P>
      <P>Although the incidence of breastfeeding in Ireland remains low, the health promotion unit is committed to increase the rates of breastfeeding. A new health promotion strategy currently being developed will place continued emphasis on the implementation of the recommendations set out in the national breastfeeding policy. I am confident that the implementation of these recommendations will result in an increase in the incidence of breastfeeding in this country.</P>

      <Quest>the research, if any, brought to the attention of his Department which links mastalgia with consumption of poultry containing residues of exogenous oestrogens; if any link has been established between mastalgia and breast cancer; if he is sponsoring any research in this field; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Mastalgia &ndash; a non-specific term which means pain or tenderness in the breasts &ndash; is a very common symptom affecting most of the female population at some time in their lives. Some research studies have suggested that women with the specific condition, proliferative benign breast disease, which is one cause of mastalgia, may be at increased risk of breast cancer. However, there are many other causative factors for mastalgia and the great majority of these are benign disease conditions with no known association with cancer.</P>
      <P>I have not been advised of any reference in the international medical literature which links mastalgia with consumption of poultry containing residues of exogenous oestrogens. Women who take exogenous oestrogens, for example, the oral contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy have been shown to have an increased breast cancer risk. If poultry contained appreciable levels of exogenous oestrogens, this would indicate a theoretical risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland and in the EU it is illegal to use oestogens in poultry feed. Testing for hormones in foods of animal origin is carried out by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development as part of the national residue monitoring programme. The efficacy of this programme is monitored by the Food Safety Auth<Col N="1519" /> ority of Ireland which is keeping the matter under continuing review.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a study that was carried out in the early 1990s that attempted to establish a possible association between mastalgia, smoking and dietary factors. I understand that the study involved a small number of women and the results were not published in the peer reviewed scientific literature. My Department is not sponsoring any research in this field.</P>

      <Quest>the reason Comhairle na Ospidéal recently turned down an application by Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, and Tallaght Hospital for a shared consultant paediatric surgeon after he had given financial clearance for an appointment; the explanation he has received from the comhairle; and the implications of this decision for the hospitals concerned.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The consultant paediatric surgeon application referred to by the Deputy is a restructuring of an existing post which is currently shared by the three Dublin paediatric hospitals, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, the Adelaide and Meath Hospital Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital and The Children's Hospital, Temple Street. The application envisaged a new structure for the position to be shared between two of these hospitals, that is, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, and the Adelaide and Meath Hospital Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1998 Comhairle published its report on paediatric surgery services. The report recommended that specialist paediatric surgery for children throughout the State be concentrated in one unit in Dublin with all three children's hospitals providing non-specialist paediatric surgery and less complex urology. Comhairle is satis<Col N="1520" /> fied that the report and its recommendation represented the best way forward for the organisation and delivery of high quality and safe paediatric surgical care for children in the State given the presence of three paediatric institutions in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Comhairle na Ospidéal is a statutory body set up under the Health Act, 1970, and its main function is to regulate appointments of consultant medical staffs in hospitals providing services under the Health Acts, and to specify qualifications for such appointments.</P>
    <P>The Comhairle has indicated to my Department that it welcomes this joint application for the post as evidence of co-operation between two of the hospitals involved. However, the Comhairle considers that the structure of the proposed post is contrary to that envisaged in its report. It does not indicate that specialist paediatric surgery will be concentrated in one unit, it leaves one hospital short of sessions, it does not address the restructuring of existing posts and has adverse implications for the structuring of other posts as set out in its report.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that a joint council for children's hospital care has been established and includes representation from the three Dublin paediatric hospitals. The council's primary role is to assist the paediatric hospitals to work with each other and with the Eastern Regional Health Authority to plan and develop acute paediatric services on a co-ordinated basis in the functional area of the authority. One of the priority items identified for the council's work programme is the organisation of paediatric surgery in Dublin. My Department has already indicated its support for the restructuring of paediatric surgical services.</P>
    <P>I understand that Comhairle has already informed the three paediatric hospitals and the council for children's hospital care of its concerns regarding this post and in the meantime I understand that consideration is being given to the filling of the existing consultant post in a locum capacity to ensure a continuation of service.</P>
    <P>My Department together with the Eastern Regional Health Authority will keep this matter under review.</P>

      <P>The Southern Health Board is the body responsible for the provision of health services within the board's area, including those which will be provided at the proposed new maternity facility at Cork University Hospital. The board has advised that the position with regard to the treatment of couples with infertility problems within <Col N="1521" /> its area is that, in addition to the facilities available at Tralee General Hospital for investigation and treatment of basic forms of infertility, there is an intra-uterine insemination service available at Erinville/Cork University Hospital which was developed by Professor Jenkins, former professor of obstetrics with the Southern Health Board, who has recently retired. Arrangements have been put in place to ensure a continuation of this service by Dr. P. Hughes who is a locum consultant obstetrician. If a woman is not suitable for this treatment, or, if it is unsuccessful she will be referred to the HARI Institute in Dublin, the regional fertility centre in University College Hospital, Galway or the infertility centre in Belfast for IVF. Pending the appointment of a permanent replacement for Professor Jenkins, the board is not in a position to say whether or not his replacement will have a special interest in IVF services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, that the child in question has had his surgery carried out in the United Kingdom privately and has been discharged home.</P>
      <P>Under arrangements for public hospital services introduced in June 1991, everyone, regardless of income, is entitled to public hospital and public consultant services subject only to modest statutory charges, from which medical card holders are exempt. At present these charges are set at £26 per night, subject to a maximum of £260 in any twelve month period, in respect of in-patient public hospital services. Hospital services are provided on the basis of medical need and clinical urgency.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. Any patient, whether a medical card holder or not, who opts for treatment in a private hospital or as a private patient in a public hospital is liable for the costs relating to such treatment, and neither my Department nor the health boards are in a position to provide financial assistance towards these costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement that patients make an explicit choice between public and private care was recommended by the Commission on Health <Col N="1522" /> Funding on the grounds of equity since, under the previous system, it was possible that some public patients of the hospital could receive preferential treatment over other public patients by virtue of either being private to the consultant or by obtaining a private bed.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is funding the purchase of paediatric cardiac surgery procedures from appropriate UK paediatric hospitals under the cardiac waiting list initiative and in this regard I wish to advise the Deputy that £0.7 million was allocated to Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in 2000 under this initiative.</P>
    <P>The decision to refer a patient to the UK for congenital cardiac surgery is based entirely on the degree of medical urgency. These patients who are on the urgent list on Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children and who cannot be operated on there because of limited facilities are referred to the UK according to the degree of medical urgency as determined by the consultant cardiologist/surgeon involved. Should a child be considered appropriate for transfer to the UK for surgery by the consultant concerned, the associated costs will be met under the initiative.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the prioritisation of the waiting list is a matter for the clinicians concerned and that immediate medical treatment is provided to all urgent cases.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the need to increase the hospital's cardiac surgical capacity and in this regard a design team for a new theatre development at the hospital has been appointed. When completed, the new theatre development will provide five new operating theatres complete with ancillary accommodation, a day surgery area and a central sterile supplies department. The existing theatre facilities will also be upgraded to provide a further two theatre suites. When these theatres are fully commissioned it is expected that Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children will be in a position to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures per annum, which is an increase of 40% on its existing capacity. The estimated completion date for the development is 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 310, 311, 312 and 313 together.</P>
      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that there is no waiting list for in-patient services at St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown and I understand that the reason St. Columcille's Hospital was excluded from the list of hospitals referred to was due to the fact that they have no patients waiting for in-patient treatment in excess of three months.</P>
      <P>With reference to the casemix programme, I refer the Deputy to Question No. 356 of Tuesday, 21 March, in which the annual financial adjustments for all hospitals participating in casemix, including St. Columcille's, were detailed in full.</P>
      <P>Casemix is an internationally accepted methodology, used in a wide variety of health care settings, to compare activity and costs between hospitals. The essence of casemix is to allow the workload of hospitals to be compared in a manner which takes account of the complexity and volume of the cases treated in each hospital. Furthermore, hospitals participating in casemix also have the opportunity to have any other unique circumstances taken into account to ensure that casemix operates on a consistent basis of comparison. Any such issues that have been brought to the attention of my Department in respect of St. Columcille's have been taken into account in calculating the casemix adjustment, in line with the objective of ensuring the consistent treatment of all participating hospitals.</P>
      <P>St. Columcille's Hospital has submitted a development plan to my Department to meet priority needs. These proposals will be considered in the context of decisions to be made on the allocation of funding for hospital developments under the national development plan. In relation to respite beds, a 50 bed community unit for older people is scheduled to open in Dalkey later this year. This unit will include the provision of respite facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. Columcille's Hospital has been known by this name since 1952. The people in the area have become familiar with this name and change of the name could lead to confusion among the catchment population. In addition, any proposed name <Col N="1524" /> change to St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown would require wide consultation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services and the maintenance of waiting lists in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area are the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
      <P>Difficulties were encountered in the latter part of 1999 and early 2000 which caused the cancellation of routine orthodontic treatment appointments through the absence of consultant cover. These difficulties have been resolved and the consultant orthodontist is currently involved in drawing up an action plan to deal with those patients whose ongoing treatment was delayed. Routine treatment has been recommenced for the majority of patients and every effort is being made to ensure that those whose appointments are outstanding are seen as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>There are currently 291 category 1 patients and 8,925 category 2 patients in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area awaiting assessment to determine their eligibility for orthodontic treatment. The average waiting time for category 1 patients is approximately nine months and the average waiting time for category 2 patients is four years.</P>

      <P>This scheme was processed up to tender stage by Limerick County Council under the devolved small scheme programme for projects costing less than £250,000. In light of actual tender costs the council has now included it, in tenth place, on the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted to my Department for consideration under the main water services investment programme in response to the Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists will be taken into account in the framing of water services investment programmes for this and future years under the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>

      <P>I propose to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, currently before the Dáil to prevent a planning application being considered while an application for the same development is being considered by An Bord Pleanála on appeal. It would, however, not be appropriate to prevent applications being submitted for development where previous applications have been refused. For example, where a development is refused on particular grounds a modified version of the development could prove acceptable if the grounds for the refusal are satisfactorily dealt with. In addition, such a proposal could effectively sterilise land even in a situation where the planning circumstances of the land have materially changed, for example, where unserviced land is subsequently serviced by roads and underground services.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals at this stage to change the basis of assessment of motor tax but the matter will be kept under review. As a move towards &ldquo;greening&rdquo; of motor tax rates, changes in motor tax rates for public service vehicles which came into effect in August 1998 provided for substantial reductions in motor tax for categories of vehicles used as public transport vehicles. The motor tax base is already highly differentiated, in that cars with a higher cubic capacity which, in general, use more fuel and have higher emissions pay a higher <i>pro rata</i> rate of motor tax.</P>

      <P>There is already a number of initiatives whereby, in accordance with the principle of producer responsibility, business sectors have accepted responsibility for devising, operating and financing systems for the recovery of wastes arising directly or indirectly as a result of their activities.</P>
      <P>Repak Limited was established in 1997 by Irish industry as a voluntary compliance scheme to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste, so as to achieve the national targets specified in Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste. Repak Limited's activities are financed by fees from member businesses which, I understand, are expected to exceed £11 million this year.</P>
      <P>An equivalent recovery scheme for farm plastic waste is being operated by the Irish Farm Films Producers Group, and very good progress has been made to date in relation to the collection from farms, and recovery of, used silage wrap and other farm plastic wastes. Work is ongoing on the development of further producer responsibility initiatives in relation to specific waste streams.</P>
      <P>The construction industry was invited to develop proposals for a producer responsibility initiative aimed at meeting national recovery targets for construction and demolition waste. In response, the forum for the construction industry has established a dedicated task force to address this issue, with a view to submitting proposals to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government by July 2000. The motor industry is also developing proposals for a producer responsibility initiative in relation to end-of-life vehicles and waste tyres, while initial discussions have taken place with industry concerning waste electronic and electrical equipment.</P>
      <P>It is the intention further to expand upon the 1998 policy statement, Changing our Ways, with the publication of another policy statement focusing on waste prevention and minimisation, recycling and waste recovery generally. This policy document will,<i> inter alia,</i> outline the scope of measures, including fiscal instruments, which may be undertaken to provide an incentive for the diversion of waste from landfill in favour of waste recycling and recovery activities.</P>
      <P>Following a recent public consultation process, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will shortly bring forward proposals to implement the Government commitment to tax plastic shopping bags.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of litter wardens is a matter for individual local authorities within each auth<Col N="1531" /> ority's current authorised staffing level and is one in which I have no function.

      <P>The farm assist scheme, which introduced the special arrangements for farmers on low incomes, was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1999, and came into operation with effect from 7 April 1999.</P>
      <P>To date there have been 9,547 applications received for farm assist, comprising 2,815 new applications and 5,922 claimants formerly in receipt of smallholders unemployment assistance, 15 widows non-contributory pensions, 767 pre-retirement allowance and 28 disability allowance.</P>
      <P>The number of claimants in receipt of a farm assist payment, on week ending 17 March 2000, was 7,570. A further 453 claimants are still in receipt of smallholders unemployment assistance and are being reviewed at present.</P>
      <P>On the application form completed by former smallholders, many of them indicated that their circumstances had changed since their last assessment. Following reviews of their means, 3,553 claimants are now in receipt of an increased payment while 1,205 have had their payments reduced. The number of cases where persons in receipt of other social welfare payments are now receiving less on the farm assist scheme is not readily available. The information will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible. In these cases, payment would only be less where a claimant's means have changed since s/he was last reviewed.</P>
      <P>Former smallholders are receiving on average a weekly payment of £83.45, an increase of £9 per week compared with smallholders unemployment assistance. New applicants receive on average a weekly payment of £58.86.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is open to any person who is dissatisfied with <Col N="1532" /> a decision of a deciding officer, in relation to the assessment of means in his-her case, to appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill, 2000, proposes to make a number of important changes to the means test for the farm assist scheme. It is proposed to increase the child related disregards from £100 for the first two children and £200 for each subsequent qualified child to £200 and £300 respectively. Only 70% of self-employment income, including off-farm self-employment, will now be taken into account. There are also changes proposed in the way capital is assessed, with the first £10,000 held by a claimant disregarded and the balance treated more favourably than heretofore.</P>

Thus, the process is designed to have minimal impact on Garda day-to-day operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Signing arrangements are reviewed regularly to ensure that they continue to meet the needs of <Col N="1533" /> customer service, control and operational efficiency. Currently, there are no plans to alter existing signing arrangements. However, different approaches to managing the live register and assisting those on the live register make the transition back to work are being actively explored and piloted. In some cases this may involve less frequent signing in individual cases but more in-depth interviews at the social welfare local office during which the customer's job-readiness and attempts to return to the labour market are discussed and assessed.</P>
    <P>The wider operational and other implications of applying such an approach on a wider basis are being considered at present. Any such new arrangements would further reduce Garda involvement in this area.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, and to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. It is also available to certain people with disabilities and people who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>The free travel companion pass, which is available to certain people who are medically assessed as unfit to travel alone, enables a person 16 years of age, or over, to accompany the pass holder free of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The companion pass is available to recipients of a disability allowance, formerly disabled person's maintenance allowance, who are certified as unfit to travel alone. In general, a companion free travel pass is available to persons aged over 66 years who held a pass when they were under 66. Other eligible categories include people who are <Col N="1534" /> blind, confined to wheelchairs, those who are 75 years and over who are certified as unfit to travel alone and people who are being cared for by a carer who is in receipt of a carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware, a fundamental review of the free schemes of this Department is nearing completion and will be published shortly by the Policy Institute, Trinity College, Dublin, in the Studies in Public Policy series. The issues raised by the Deputies are examined in the review.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of the review findings, I announced two specific measures in budget 2000. These are the extension of the free schemes to all persons aged 75 years and over, regardless of their income and household composition and the extension of the free electricity allowance and free television licence to all carers in receipt of the carer's allowance and to carers who are caring for people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance. Both of these measures will be implemented from October 2000 at an estimated full year cost of £6 million.</P>
    <P>I will consider further measures when I examine the final report in the context of future budgetary policy.</P>

      <P>The special measure which I have introduced in the Social Welfare Bill, 2000, is targeted at a specific group &ndash; namely those people who had paid contributions prior to 1953 but failed to qualify for an old age contributory pension due to the operation of the yearly average test.</P>
      <P>The measure is designed to give further recognition to contributions paid prior to 1953, which may, at present, be used to satisfy two of the three qualifying contribution conditions for the old age contributory pension but cannot be used for the yearly average test as they contain no pension element.</P>
      <P>The Bill, therefore, provides for the introduction, from next May, of a special, flat-rate old age contributory pension, payable at 50% of the maximum personal rate, to any person who became insurably employed prior to 1953 and who, due to the yearly average rule, failed to qualify for pension or qualified for a pension at less than 50%, i.e. £48 per week from May, of the standard maximum rate. To qualify, a person must have paid, at least, 260 contributions which may comprise all pre-53 contributions or a combination of pre and post 1953 insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that this new pension arrangement represents a reasonable response to the dif<Col N="1535" /> ficulties faced by this group and I have no plans to alter the arrangement along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 337 and 339 together.</P>
      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance. A person who fails to satisfy these conditions on an ongoing basis is not entitled to an unemployment payment. In applying the legislation, deciding officers do not treat actors any differently to any other unemployment benefit or assistance claimant.</P>
      <P>The legislation does not impose any restriction or limitation on the right of a person to the opportunity to engage in the employment of his or her choice. Where a person is seeking work in his or her usual employment and there is a reasonable prospect of securing work of that nature, he or she would normally satisfy the conditions for receipt of payment. However, if it is obvious that there is no employment available within a specialised field within a reasonable period of time, the unemployed person would be expected to broaden his or her search so as to include other types of employment. After a period of unemployment, a person must be prepared to accept any employment for which he or she is qualified.</P>
      <P>Where a person is dissatisfied with a decision made by a deciding officer he or she may appeal this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The pre-retirement allowance &ndash; PRETA &ndash; is a means-tested payment which allows a person aged 55 or over to opt to retire from the labour force and receive a weekly allowance. In order to qualify for the payment, the person concerned must be in receipt of a long-term unemployment payment, or be no longer entitled to one-parent family payment or carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>Claimants of PRETA must be retired from the labour force and are not, therefore, subject to the same requirements as claimants of unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>PRETA was initially introduced in 1990 for long-term unemployed persons aged 60 or over. The qualifying age limit was subsequently reduced to 58 years in 1991 and to 55 years of age in 1992.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise that the scheme is entirely optional and there is no obligation therefore on anyone to avail of PRETA. The current strong performance of the Irish economy is reflected in a steady reduction in the numbers seeking to avail of the scheme in recent years and I expect that this trend will continue in the future.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that expenditure on PRETA will amount to £61.1 million in 2000. As the payment rates, means test etc. that apply to PRETA are the same as those applying to long-term unemployment assistance, it is likely that the same level of expenditure would arise if PRETA did not exist and claimants were on the live register instead. Some 13,151 claimants were in receipt of PRETA at end-December, 1999 of which over 60% were aged 60 years or more.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the families research programme, which I introduced last year is to support innovative, original research in the field of family policy and family services and in areas highlighted by the Commission on the Family in its report Strengthening Families for Life, as being in need of further investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 33 proposals were received from universities, academic institutions, social policy researchers and analysts and national voluntary organisations which work with families, in response to the advertisement of the families research programme in the national press. Thirteen proposals, covering a range of family themes have been prioritised for funding. Themes to be <Col N="1537" /> researched include marriage and the processes of family formation, marital breakdown, children and parental separation, parenting needs and the roles of fathers and grandparents in family life.</P>
    <P>The intention is to publish the research outcomes and to make the findings widely available in order to contribute to the debate on the issues facing families today and to help the Government to develop policies and services which would meet the needs of children and their families in a changing environment.</P>
    <P>In addition to these projects, research to explore what would be involved in undertaking a longitudinal study of children in Ireland is to be undertaken by my Department jointly with the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>Consultations with families are a feature of several of the projects being undertaken under the families research programme. For example the major voluntary organisations providing marriage counselling services are surveying their clients to evaluate the effectiveness of the services provided. In these projects the consultations are being undertaken in accordance with established methodological approaches for this type of research work.</P>
    <P>All projects are being undertaken independently by the participating organisations in the families research programme. Advisory groups on which my Department is represented have been established to monitor progress and to address any issues arising in each individual research project.</P>
    <P>I have arranged for a copy of the families research programme information booklet to be forwarded to the Deputy. The booklet contains further details of the individual projects, the sponsoring organisations and the researchers involved and expected completion dates for the different projects.</P>
    <P>Summary details of the projects and the sponsoring organisations are as follows: Client Satisfaction Survey &ndash; ACCORD Head Office, All Hallows, Gracepark Road, Drumcondra, Dublin 9.</P>

      <P>The provision of sheltered employment and training for people with disabilities has, until now, been the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children and, more particularly, the NRB. However, new administrative and infrastructural arrangements are being introduced shortly on foot of the recommendations of the Establishment Group for the National Disability Authority and Disability Support Service. These new arrangements involve the transfer of responsibility for employment and training supports for people with disabilities to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Following this transfer the pro<Col N="1540" /> vision of employment and training supports for people with disabilities will be mainstreamed and will be provided by FÁS.</P>
      <P>In the light of this impending transfer, the employment and training supports for people with disabilities are being reviewed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS. In this regard the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that the new employment and training arrangements will have, as a priority, clear progression routes for people with disabilities from sheltered work, supported work and sheltered employment to employment options in the open labour market.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is currently in discussion with FÁS and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to see how best the various employment and training supports within the social welfare system can be aligned with the new structures being developed so as to eliminate any potential disincentives to people with disabilities in taking up available employment and training opportunities.</P>
      <P>On the question of the level of payments to people with disabilities, the recent social welfare budget package, which is the biggest ever social welfare budget allocation amounting to over £428 million on a full year basis, provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for a £7 a week increase for pensioners aged 66 and over, a special increase of £5.90 for invalidity pensioners under 65 years and a £4 a week increase for all other social welfare recipients. In addition, special increases in the rates of qualified adult allowances are being provided as part of an overall strategy to increase this allowance to 70% of the main rate over the next three budgets.</P>
      <P>As part of the process of aligning tax and social welfare changes by 2001, these increases are being paid four weeks earlier this year, from the beginning of May.</P>
      <P>In addition to the increases in the weekly rates of payment the social welfare budget package also contains a number of other measures to improve the position of people with disabilities. One of these measures will be of particular benefit to people with disabilities engaged in training and in sheltered employment. The level of earnings from rehabilitative training and employment which may be disregarded for disability allowance and blind pension purposes is being increased by £25 per week, from £50 to £75, with effect from April. In addition, this enhanced disregard is being extended to cover people in rehabilitative self-employment.</P>
      <P>Another budget improvement which is designed to further encourage and facilitate people with disabilities in accessing the open labour market is the extension of the back to work allowance and back to education allowance schemes, which currently apply to recipients of disability allowance and blind pension, to apply also to invalidity pensioners and people on unemployability supplement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the proposal by the national <Col N="1541" /> representative committee to increase the disability allowance to £100 a week, the Deputy may wish to note that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment that substantial progress will be made over the period up to 2003 towards a target of £100 per week for the lowest rates of social welfare.</P>

      <Quest>if the Government is reducing the resources available to the Garda to combat drugs trafficking in view of the fact that the White Paper on Defence has called for a number of naval vessels to be earmarked, equipped and manned primarily for fishery protection.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government is, in fact, increasing the resources available to the Garda. Garda numbers have increased in the past three years by 600 members and are on course to meet the Government target of a Garda strength of 12,000 by the year 2002. The Garda fleet has also increased from 1350 to 1800 vehicles and the Garda air support unit has become operational and an additional helicopter is being purchased.</P>
      <P>The allocation for Garda expenditure provided in the 1997 Estimates for the Garda Vote was a figure of £494 million, this years provision is £668 million.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy will agree that this clearly illustrates my commitment and that of the Government to ensure that The Garda Síochána has the necessary resources to tackle drug trafficking and crime in all its forms. In fact, the reality is that The Garda Síochána has never, in its history, been better resourced in terms of manpower and equipment than it has been since this Government took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague the Minister for Defence has <Col N="1543" /> informed me that while the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union, Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment, in 1993, of a joint task force involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.</P>
    <P>During the course of routine patrols Naval Service vessels may be deployed to anti-drug smuggling operations. Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities. While Naval Service personnel are designated as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, in practice the Naval Service operates under the direction of the joint task force where measures to combat the important of illegal drugs are concerned. In this regard, the White Paper on Defence does not envisage any change in the role of the Naval Service.</P>

      <P>Where a customer is transferring his mortgage to a new financial institution, the current Land Registry charges for the registration of a change of mortgage range from £98 to a maximum of £283 depending on the mortgage amount involved. The new Land Registry fees order which takes effect from 1 May 2000 will introduce a maximum charge of £165 for the service. There will consequently be a reduction in costs in cases where the new mortgage exceeds £15,000.</P>
      <P>Where the customer is simply increasing the amount of the mortgage with the same financial institution, then the Land Registry charges range from £65 to £250, depending on the value of the mortgage. The new Land Registry fees order will introduce a flat fee of £100 for the service. There will consequently be a reduction in costs in cases where the new mortgage exceeds £10,000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 357 and 362 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have previously informed the House, the Garda youth diversion projects are a partnership approach between the Garda, youth services, the Probation and Welfare Service, schools and local communities to addressing the problems of juvenile criminality. Identification of the need to establish such projects in particular areas rests primarily with the local Garda management. The main criteria used are as follows: the existence of a sufficiently large group of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in a particular area; that sufficient Garda manpower and resources are available to operate the project successfully; that a commitment is forthcoming from the other agencies and community representatives in the area to involve themselves in the management and running of the project; that <Col N="1547" /> local Garda management have identified the need for such project; that there is a fair geographical spread of locations throughout the country; that there is consideration given to the range of complementary services present.</P>
    <P>In addition to the criteria set out above, any decision regarding the establishment of new projects will take account of such factors as the level of socio-economic deprivation and indicators of juveniles &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; such as the levels of early school leaving, juvenile crime and drug use.</P>
    <P>To date, 29 Garda youth diversion projects have been established. These are listed on the attached table.</P>
    <P>Each of these projects has a full time project co-ordinator. Each project co-ordinator is employed by either the project management committee, or a youth organisation. The criteria for selection of a project co-ordinator is a matter for the management-advisory committee of the project in question. All appointments are made following advertisement of the positions in the national print media, and competitive interview. While no specific educational or professional qualifications are laid down, practical experience in youth work is a prerequisite.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, £16 million is being made available in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for the significant expansion of the Garda youth diversion programme. It is proposed to implement the proposal on a phased basis over the life of the plan. An application to establish a project in the area referred to by Deputies Haughey and Bruton is being considered in this context. I expect to be in a position to finalise details shortly in relation to the first phase of this programme.</P>

Officials of my Department have been in touch with the committee to clarify certain matters contained therein. Every effort is being made to bring this matter to a conclusion and I hope to be in a position to receive signed rules from the committee shortly. I will then sign the rules in the normal way and lay them before the House.</P>

    <P>(Dr. Woods): I propose to take Questions Nos. 367 and 384 together.</P>
    <P>Non-permanent teaching appointments in second level schools arise generally as a result of: the replacement of the holders of permanent teaching posts who are on leave of absence; the requirement that the number of permanent teachers employed by individual Vocational Education Committees and community-comprehensive schools may not exceed 95% of their initial teacher allocation; and the allocation of additional temporary teaching resources to the authorities of individual schools to cater for particular circumstances in those schools.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the 1997 PCW agreement on teachers' pay and conditions, my Department agreed to an increase in the number of permanent appointments which can be made in VEC and community-comprehensive schools thereby reducing the number of non-permanent teachers employed in those schools.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a scheme for the provision of grants for second level schools towards the purchase of equipment for the use of pupils with certain disabilities or communication difficulties. Under the terms of the scheme the school authorities make an application in respect of an individual pupil. I understand that the Deputy raised the issue of the pupil in question with officials in my Department in November 1999; my officials contacted the school authorities at that time to ensure that the school was fully informed about the scheme and to advise the school that it could submit an application on behalf of the pupil. No application has been received by my Department in respect of that pupil. My officials were in touch with the school authorities recently and were advised by the school that it considers that it is not in the best interests of the pupil to encourage him to use a computer during class as his handwriting is legible. The school also advised that should the situation change it has a sufficient supply of computers already and would not need to make a specific application in respect of the pupil.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 378, 380, 381 and 382 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is pursuing a five year development plan in the young offender area. The plan envisages a major refurbishment of some of the existing custodial facilities, coupled with measures aimed at ensuring that the custodial facilities operated under my Department are capable of meeting their obligations under the forthcoming Children Bill, 1999.</P>
      <P>The plan envisages the development of a pre-release unit on the Lusk campus to cater for young male offenders who are nearing completion of their sentence. The precise location and capacity of this unit has yet to be decided. However, the number of boys to be catered for in such a unit is unlikely to be more than six.</P>
      <P>The development plan also envisages major refurbishment of both Oberstown boys and Oberstown girls centres, leading to the eventual replacement of the existing residential units. The object of these measures is to ensure the highest standards of care in these facilities while maintaining a suitably secure environment.</P>
      <P>Two of the three units which comprise Trinity House have already undergone very significant refurbishment over the past year. The development plan envisages further refurbishment work at this centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The community group to which the Deputy refers is represented on the board of management which is responsible for the operation of the three young offender facilities based at Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin. Through its involvement on the board of management, the community group is kept fully informed of developments in <Col N="1556" /> relation to the Lusk campus. In addition, officials of my Department and the directors of the Lusk centres are available to meet with the community group to discuss any issues of concern. A number of such meetings have already taken place and further meetings can be arranged if necessary. In these circumstances, it is unlikely that my meeting with the community group would be of any particular benefit at this stage.</P>

      <Quest>the position regarding the current shortfall in the grants for third level students in relation to the difference in payments or subsidies to FÁS and the unemployed; the measures, if any, in place to address this shortfall; if his attention has been drawn to the number of students, who are just above the threshold for the full maintenance grant, who are denied access to a full grant in spite of the fact their parents may not be able to support them; the progress, if any, made to redress this situation and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education. For the current academic year, the rates of the maintenance grants payable are set at £1,690 at the non-adjacent rate and £676 at the adjacent rate.</P>
      <P>With 40% of third level students qualifying for maintenance grants, any proposal that student grants be brought in line with social welfare payments for the unemployed would give rise to considerable cost, estimated by my Department to be in excess of £50 million per annum.</P>
      <P>The reckonable income limit for a full maintenance grant under the student support schemes for the 1999-2000 academic year is £19,200. Candidates who do not qualify for a full maintenance grant may qualify for a part-maintenance grant, 50%, in respect of which the income limit is £20,400. Where two or more children, or the candidate's parent, are attending full-time approved third level courses the above income limits may be increased by £2,160 where there are two such children, by £4,320 for three such children and so on, by increments of £2,160. The statistical information available in respect of the higher education grants scheme for 1997-98 indicates that 1,011 grantholders, or 4% of all maintenance grantholders were in receipt of part-maintenance grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to follow the practice of recent years and increase third level maintenance grants in line with inflation. I intend to continue the practice of increasing the reckonable income limits in <Col N="1557" /> line with movements in the average industrial wage. This approach will ensure that the real value of maintenance grants is maintained. The question of providing further additional increases to the value of maintenance grants can only be considered having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector.</P>
    <P>The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins this Government's approach to tackling disadvantage. There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan. This fund will provide for additional financial support for disadvantaged students on top of the existing maintenance grants schemes. I am developing proposals in relation to these financial supports and I will be announcing the details of the new arrangements in due course.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 383 and 389 together.</P>
      <P>The position generally is that when a school bus route is open to public tender prospective operators in the locality are requested to submit a quotation. The tender submitted will include a quotation the operator has determined as necessary to meet running costs. There is no set hourly or mileage rate. The rates applied are subject to negotiation and agreement at local level between the operator and Bus Éireann. Any such negotiation takes account of the mileage involved, size of vehicle and other relevant factors including those that may be unique to any individual operation. The negotiation of contracts with individual operators is a matter for Bus Éireann, and my Department has no direct involvement in these procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there has been a significant increase in the price of diesel fuel in recent <Col N="1558" /> months and the school transport section of my Department will be reviewing the level of payments generally to contractors shortly. This review will include consultation with Bus Éireann, who operate the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department.</P>

      <P>The course in question is a post-leaving certificate course. There are no tuition fees for PLC courses. However, students are asked to pay for books, uniforms-clothing and equipment, e.g. chef's uniform, knives, where the item purchased becomes their personal property, student services, registration charges by professional bodies and examination fees.</P>
      <P>The charges for certification-registration with professional bodies may vary, depending on the vocational discipline covered by the course, and the certification authority involved. In this case the course is certified by the Institute of Accounting Technicians in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Government also introduced a means tested maintenance grants scheme for PLC students for the first time with effect from September 1998. The scheme does not cover charges for examinations, registration or certification. My Department established the National Council for Vocational Awards to provide national certification and assessment for programmes in the further education sector in 1991. A modest charge, the present fee is £25 for a full award of eight modules, and this will continue to apply for national certification from the NCVA. In view of the general availability of NCVA certification my Department has no plans to change the PLC grant scheme to cover the costs of certification from other sources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 390 and 395 together.</P>
      <P>The transition year programme attracts considerable financial support from my Department. Students on the transition year programme attract the standard teaching resources in accordance with the approved pupil-teacher ratio and <i>per capita </i>grants towards recurrent expenditure at standard rates. An additional capitation grant of £50 per pupil in transition year is given; school authorities may expend the grant on teaching hours or on any other expenses related exclusively to the transition year programme. There is also in place a transition year curriculum support service that is funded by my Department. My Department intends to maintain this level of support for the programme.</P>
      <P>The transition year programme is now offered in more than 500 schools, a significant increase on when the programme began in 1994. Ongoing evaluation by my Department's inspectorate indicates that schools demonstrate high levels of creativity while adhering to the overall programme guidelines. The expansion and the healthy state of the transition year programmes are attributable to the readiness of principals, co-ordinators, teachers, parents and pupils to engage in innovative ways of learning and teaching, as well as the excellent work of the support service.</P>
      <P>The transition year programme provides an opportunity for both schools and pupils to develop an orientation towards preparation for life and work. It has enabled many schools to develop their links with the wider community. Transition year provides an opportunity for the reflection and guidance which facilitates mature and considered choice by pupils of their leaving certificate subjects.</P>

      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person</P>
      <P>&ldquo;of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on 1 January or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Acts further provide,<i> inter alia</i>, for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants schemes, mature students are categorised as <Col N="1564" /> either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
    <P>When assessing the means of students other than mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student. The other student support schemes have similar provisions in relation to the means assessment of students. It is recognised that these provisions can give rise to difficulties in individual cases and my Department is examining the issues involved.</P>

      <P>The primary curriculum is designed as an eight year course. It is flexible and child centred and can be adapted to cater for the individual needs of pupils. Furthermore, there is no official programme for a reception class within the primary curriculum. As a general rule, primary pupils should progress from one standard to a higher standard at the end of each school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where my Department becomes aware that a school is operating a reception year or middle infant class, the board of management is advised that the three year cycle should be discontinued and a two year infant cycle re-established. Accordingly, the board of management of the <Col N="1565" /> school referred to by the Deputy has been notified that they should terminate the three year infant cycle and in the circumstances the operation of the reception year cannot be allowed to continue.</P>

      <P>The Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999, was enacted in July 1999. Section 7 of the Act sets out the objects of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland. These objects are to establish and maintain a framework of qualifications for the development, recognition and award of qualifications based on standards of knowledge, skill or competence to be acquired by learners, to establish and promote <Col N="1567" /> the maintenance and improvement of the standards of further and higher education and training awards, outside the existing universities, and to promote and facilitate access, transfer and progression.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental implementation group, comprising those Departments concerned with the operation of the Act, has been established to oversee its implementation. This group has reported on the necessary steps to bring the Act into operation. In January last, the setting up of a designate National Qualifications Authority of Ireland was announced and Mr. Richard Langford was appointed as chairperson.</P>
      <P>The new authority is being set up on an interim basis pending its establishment on a statutory basis. The task of the designate authority will be to commence work on the establishment of a national framework of qualifications and to advise on and support the transition to the new certification system as provided for in the Act. The process of securing nominations to the designate authority, as set out in the Act, is under way.  </P>
      <P>The process of securing interim accommodation and staff for the designate authority is also in hand. The address and telephone number of the designate authority will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as they are available.</P>

      <P>Within the context of the Good Friday Agreement provision was made for the North-South Ministerial Council to have an education sector format within which the Ministers for Education, North and South, could agree the basis for taking forward matters for co-operation having regard to the common concerns and interests of both sides. It was agreed that, initially, the focus would be on co-operation in relation to education for children with special needs, educational under-achievement, teacher qualifications, and school, youth and teacher exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in Education was held on 3 February 2000 shortly before the suspension of the Northern Assembly and Executive. The council agreed to establish a number of joint working groups charged with delivering concrete progress in each of the matters for co-operation. Specifically, the council agreed to establish a North-South special education co-ordination group, joint working groups on key issues in the area of educational under achievement and a teachers' <Col N="1568" /> working group to examine issues related to teacher mobility including the issue of the transfer of pension rights.</P>
    <P>The council also agreed to commission an evaluation of the range and effectiveness of the current initiatives in the area of school, youth and teacher exchanges. This will be undertaken under the auspices of a steering committee representative of both administrations. This study will, it is anticipated, lead to the adoption of a coherent integrated strategy for future co-operation in these matters.</P>
    <P>The platform created by the decisions of the NSMC meeting will provide the planning context for the immediate future and I anticipate that the Departments will be able to progress matters in these areas as well as other areas of common interest.</P>

      <P>The teaching skills initiative &ndash; TSI &ndash; the teacher-training component of the Schools IT 2000 programme, is ongoing. The National Centre for Technology in Education &ndash; NCTE &ndash; has responsibility for the development and implementation of a strategic training programme for teachers in information and communication technology &ndash; ICT &ndash; in education. The following are the details of the provision of places for teachers on inservice training programmes in ICT under <Col N="1569" />  Schools IT 2000: 1998 &ndash; 24,909 places on 1,660 courses; 1999 &ndash; 21,000 places on 1,400 courses; 2000 &ndash; 14,200 places on 947 courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the three year period from 1998 to the end of 2000 a total of 60,109 places on 4,007 courses have or are being provided for teachers on ICT <Col N="1570" /> in education under Schools IT 2000. This is a significant achievement and emphasises the level of funding and support underpinning the Schools IT 2000 programme. The teacher training component of the programme, therefore, continues to invest heavily in the development of teacher ICT skills.</P>
