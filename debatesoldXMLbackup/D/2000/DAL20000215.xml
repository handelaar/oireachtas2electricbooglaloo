      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the number of requests for information to his Department under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, which were refused in 1999; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>During 1999, my Department received 207 freedom of information requests. Of these 207 requests, 33 were refused on foot of exemptions provided in the Act, such as section 19 exemptions which deal with meetings of Government. A further 35 requests were &ldquo;technically&rdquo; refused as there were no relevant records in the Department. The 33 requests referred to represent less than 16% of all requests received in 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that the Taoiseach's office is refusing all freedom of information requests regarding correspondence concerning his Government's relationship with the five Independent Deputies on the pretext that this is a relationship between the leader of Fianna Fáil and the Independents and not between the Government and the Independents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what is or is not true. The officer decides and I do not get involved one way or the other in any decision. I go with whatever he decides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this not an evasion of responsibility given that it is the Government and not the Fianna Fáil party which is relying on the Independents for support, that it is a civil servant who is given responsibility by the Taoiseach to look after the Independents and that this civil servant is not a member of Fianna Fáil or part of its operation but a Government civil servant and that any claim that the relationship with the Independents is a party matter and not subject to the Freedom of Information Act is wrong?</P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I refused any questions on that matter. I do not have any say in what is or is not refused. I take the position of not trying to influence any of these things one way or the other. The decisions are made by the designated officer under the legislation and whatever he says goes. It is not for me to put forward a view on them.</P>
      <P>On freedom of information issues, I just look at the list once a month to see what is included and I normally answer questions in the House. I do not interfere. As far as I know, letters and documentation have been issued which related to me and other Deputies in the past. However, I need to check that to see if any other documents were refused. I do not take the view in terms of freedom of information that I am refusing anything. The decision is made by the independent designated officer under the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that he may be inadvertently misleading the Dáil. Will he agree to consult today's <i> The Irish Times </i>in which reference to a draft reply prepared for him clearly states that he is to say in the reply that &ldquo;any papers concerning Independent deputies in relation to their decision to support the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Coalition was received and dealt with by me in my capacity as leader of Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  That is a quote from a reply prepared for the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Clearly, this is a matter for which the Taoiseach has ministerial responsibility. Such a reply would not have been prepared for him if he was not the one to give the answer. His attempt to hide behind the independent officer in this instance is not in accordance with the facts. That quote is in the right-hand column of the relevant passage in <i>The Irish Times</i>. Perhaps the Taoiseach will consult it so that he will be accurate in his response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking through the list in the backup papers to see if there is any such question. On a quick run through, I cannot see it. If the Deputy is talking about questions about correspondence I had when I was leader of the Opposition and meetings I had with Independents prior to becoming Taoiseach, that is a totally different matter. That is not subject to this. There was a freedom of information question about that. If we are talking about documentation prior to my becoming Taoiseach that is not subject to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone would accept that. Will the Taoiseach outline the position in regard to his current dealings with Independent Deputies? Are they matters which he accepts he is dealing with in his capacity as Taoiseach rather than as leader of Fianna Fáil and that, therefore, matters concerning his current dealings and dealings with these Deputies since his accession to the office of Taoiseach are appropriately subject to the Freedom of Information Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="523" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still a matter for the officer. There was a question the other day about correspondence I had with Deputy Foley, who is now an Independent Deputy. That is subject to the Freedom of Information Act. There is no difficulty about that. There have been questions on correspondence I have had with any Deputy and that is subject to the Freedom of Information Act. I think the matter to which the Deputy refers was from the period prior to my becoming Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Since its establishment in 1997, the council has played a valuable role by analysing Ireland's competitive position and making policy recommendations to Government. It has now published two annual competitiveness reports and will publish a further report in the first half of this year. The council has also produced a number of policy statements on relevant issues and has provided direct input to Government decision-making at a number of levels.</P>
      <P>I understand that Forfás, which provides the secretariat to the council, has suggested a number of amendments to its terms of reference. These are being considered by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and my Department. They are essentially technical changes, which aim to reflect, with greater clarity, the role and functions of the council.</P>
      <P>The competitiveness council continues to have an important function. The council's role will be renewed by the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and I look forward to continuing to receive reports from the council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach ask the advice of the council on the impact of the current 4% inflation rate, the highest rate in the past ten years? Will he ask the competitiveness council for its views on the impact of such a rate of inflation on Ireland's competitiveness, given that it is almost twice as high as the EU average?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In all its reports and deliberations and all the meetings I have with the council from time to time, it raises all matters of concern to the economy. I have no doubt it would have a view about the high rate of inflation this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Taoiseach's view about the 4% inflation rate? Is he concerned about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said here two weeks ago, price stability is an important matter of economic policy. I am conscious the Government, through its policies, by putting a tax on cigarettes has put up the rate by about .78% of 1% and there are other matters of concern. We have to continually reflect on what is happening. Interest rates, petrol <Col N="525" /> prices and the price increase in cigarettes have created the upward trend in recent months. The Government always takes due recognition of the monthly figure, whether it is lower or higher than the previous figure. Now that the rate is edging upwards, the Minister for Finance will take whatever action he can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Finance can attempt to do a number of things. We can attempt to ensure competition in the economy. We can make sure that areas where there are price increase, such as petrol, can be examined by the Consumers' Association of Ireland, as Governments have done for years. All these matters will have to be examined closely.</P>

      <P>Is it not appropriate that there should be changes in the terms of reference to take account, in the recommendations the council will make, of the fact that our inflation rate is twice as high as the European average and is the highest in the euro zone? Should changes not also be made to take account of the fact that, notwithstanding the Taoiseach's earlier reply, when the budget has been framed there is very little the Minister for Finance or any other Minister can do about inflation, now that we are tied to the euro?</P>

      <P>During 1999, the expenditure on consultancies by my Department amounted to £502,249. This represents expenditure on ten projects or engagements, with an average spend of £50,224. In addition, a further 21 consultancies were commissioned by the Information Society Commission, the Moriarty Tribunal, the National Millennium Committee, the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum and the All-Party Committee on <Col N="529" /> the Constitution. These costs were met from my Department's Vote, at a total cost of £534,462 which is an average of £25,450 per consultancy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is based on whether there is an alternative way of carrying out the work within the Department, whether the consultancy is of sufficient benefit and whether we get value for money by engaging the consultants. There are different types of consultancies. They are not all outside people, some of them work on various committees and there are a number of individuals. Not all of them are professional consultancy bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me rephrase the question. I am referring to consultancies undertaken by bodies such as the Moriarty tribunal, the National Economic and Social Council, the National Millennium Committee and the Oireachtas All-party Committee on the Constitution, all of which are independent of the Department of the Taoiseach to one degree or another. How is the appropriateness of the nature and cost of a consultancy engaged by such a body determined, and by whom? Who is the Accounting Officer for such consultancies, both as to their appropriateness and value for money, a factor which must be taken into account in the annual audit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two issues in question. Consultancies are only engaged if there is clear justification, for example, if a specialist expertise is required. Most of the bodies I mentioned engaged consultancies because they did not have the required expertise. Competitive tendering ensures that consultancy costs are minimised. My Department monitors the outcome of all projects to ensure that they are satisfactorily carried out in accordance with the terms of reference outlined.</P>
      <P>The Department complies with EU regulations regarding procurement. It also follows guidelines issued by the Department of Finance regarding public contracts and it is standard practice to invite at least three tenders, except where clear justification exists for engaging a person with particular expertise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is the final decision taken as to whether a particular matter should be the subject of a consultancy? Is this a matter upon which the independent body has the last word, so long as it follows the procedures outlined by the Taoiseach? Does the Accounting Officer of the Department of the Taoiseach oversee the procedure to determine whether the matter is an appropriate subject for a consultancy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Accounting Officer in the Department takes more than an interest as this is <Col N="530" /> part of the Department's Vote. This issue has arisen on a number of occasions and it is not a case of an outside agency requesting a consultancy which is adhered to automatically. They must satisfy the Department. The Department co-operates with some of the tribunals if so requested. In other areas it takes the view that the money is coming from its Vote for which it is accountable. That is why it insists that procedures regarding procurement, EU regulations and value for money are followed.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on 7 December, the National Centre for Partnership, established under Partnership 2000, has undertaken a significant amount of work in the past year. In December 1998 a training programme for the development of partnership in the public sector workplace was launched. The programme entitled Working Together is designed to help managers, trade union representatives and employees to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to develop a partnership approach at the level of the workplace. It is of use to trainers and facilitators who are working with partnership groups and in particular groups which are getting started. The programme is available without charge from the NCP by attendance at half day briefings on the materials and their usage. To date, approximately 100 organisations have attended these briefings.</P>
      <P>For the private sector, a 13 module joint partnership training programme, together with a supporting 25 minute video is available. This programme was developed jointly by the NCP, IBEC and ICTU as a substantial contribution to enterprise level partnership.</P>
      <P>A business plan, which has been approved by the board of the centre, for the joint delivery of this programme is being implemented at present. The business plan sets out clear parameters for joint delivery of this programme, together with a monitoring system to measure progress. The programme is still at a pilot stage and is co-ordinated by a steering committee comprising of senior representatives from IBEC, ICTU and the NCP. This committee meets regularly to review progress against agreed objectives set out in the business plan. The steering committee reports progress to the liaison group and the board of the centre. There is a provision in the business plan for an independent evaluation to review the overall effectiveness of the public and in-company pilot phase of the programme.</P>
      <P>As I previously mentioned, in addition to the ongoing work of the NCP, an evaluation of the progress made on partnership in both the public and private sectors and the associated role of the NCP is being undertaken in my Department and is nearing completion. As set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it is proposed to enhance the role of the National Centre for Partnership to support the deepening of partnership in the public and private sectors. Following consultation with IBEC and ICTU, proposals will be made to Government on the detailed arrangements to be put in place to give effect to the strengthened institutional structures required.</P>

An agreed approach on behalf of the 14 member states was developed by the Portuguese Presidency on foot of these consultations and after it had been conveyed by Prime Minister Guterres to the Austrian President it was made public.</P>
    <P>Following this statement I spoke to Prime Minister Guterres again. In addition, my office has maintained frequent contact with the Portuguese Prime Minister's office on this issue. I also received a telephone call from the then Vice Chancellor and acting Foreign Minister, Mr. Wolfgang Schu1ssel, on 2 February in relation to the proposed programme of the new Austrian coalition Government. I took the opportunity to stress the essential importance of the common European values of democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the need for a clear reaffirmation by the new Austrian Government of its intention to honour these values and its adherence to its international obligations in the EU and other international fora.</P>
    <P>The statement from the 14 member states relates to the broad conduct of bilateral relations with Austria. It will, of course, remain for individual member states to determine the operational application of the measures in the statement. Importantly, as the Portuguese Presidency and the President of the Commission, Mr. Prodi, have made clear, the work of the EU in its institutions is not affected.</P>
    <P>I will depart for Australia on 6 March, travelling <i>en route</i> to East Timor, where I will visit the Irish contingent serving with the peacekeeping operation there. I plan to meet with the East Timorese Leaders, Mr. Xanana Gusmao and Mr. Jose Ramos Horta, as well as representatives of Irish NGOs currently working there.</P>
    <P>I will then travel on to Australia where I will meet Prime Minister Howard and other political leaders. I will also meet with Australian business leaders and, of course, with the Irish community in Australia. I will arrive in Washington from Australia on Wednesday 15 March. While in Washington, I anticipate, in accordance with tradition and established practice, that I will meet with President Clinton on St. Patrick's Day, attend a lunch hosted by the Speaker on Capitol Hill and participate in a number of receptions and media events. During my visit I hope to chair a meeting of the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board. On Saturday 18 March I will return to Dublin.</P>
    <P>My programme for Australia and the US is cur<Col N="535" /> rently being finalised by my Department in consultation with the relevant Government Departments, embassies and the Defence Forces, and I will meet with them as appropriate in advance of the visit.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it is a fundamental principle of the rule of law that an accused person should be heard before being sentenced? Why did he go along with a process of dealing with the Austrian coalition in which the 14 members conducted their business by telephone instead of convening a Council meeting at which accusations and concerns could have been put to the Austrians and the Austrians allowed to reply before a decision was taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There was much discussion and deliberation on the issue. My role is as described but some heads of member states have been raising the issue for several months. Some felt very strongly about the nature of the statement and the demands which should be made of the Austrian Government. For my part, I believed that because this took place over the weekend in advance of the establishment of the Government, a clear line should be set down on fundamental human rights issues in response to the statements made by the party leaders on a number of occasions. It was the least that could be done. There were demands to do other things.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, representatives of the Austrian Government were given an opportunity to attend the General Affairs Council to make their case. That is what Mr. Schüssel had asked for. They attended the meeting and now we must watch the position carefully. Mr. Schüssel said to me what the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs said to the General Affairs Council yesterday, that the Government should be judged on its actions.</P>
      <P>Normally I would not agree with interference with other Governments but some of the things Mr. Haider has said are outrageous. I was given some of the statements he made during the general election by the Portuguese. Frankly, if anyone in this House made a statement similar to the least offensive of them, there would be an outcry. Making the statement was the least we could do, notwithstanding that we should not interfere. Some member states and some colleagues were extremely angry about it. However, that was a matter for the Austrian people, not a matter in which we should interfere. We had a right to set down basic principles. It enabled the President of Austria to ensure these matters were dealt with in the preamble to the new Government.</P>

      <P>After yesterday's meeting the British Foreign Secretary announced that regardless of the facts and the performance of the Austrian Government, the bilateral sanctions agreed by the 14 other member states will continue in place as long as it is in power, no matter what it does. Does the Taoiseach agree this is the <Col N="536" /> position adopted by the Foreign Secretary? Can he confirm if this is the position of the EU as a whole and of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government agreed to the statement on the three principles laid down and they stand until they are rescinded. I am convinced of the need to underpin the Union's values. All the member states comprise a community of shared ideals and values and are committed to fighting racism and xenophobia. Our common policy in this area cannot be endangered and overthrown by a single state. The joint statement by EU member states with which I agreed &ndash; I have not gone along with all the statements that have since been made &ndash; was one of firm intent, rather than a list of sanctions.</P>
      <P>I do not see it as being a matter of sanctions, although some measures affect ambassadors and others. Mr. Schüssel and the Austrian Foreign Minister asked that their Government be judged by its actions. However, the formation of that Government could not proceed without some action by the other member states. In this regard the Portuguese Presidency under Antonio Guterre had to work hard to obtain agreement on what was a moderate statement. Many member states would have preferred a different kind of statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that all in this House condemn the sentiments of Mr. Haider and have no patience with his demagoguery? Given the apparent sanctions in place, is it the policy of the Government that no Minister will receive the Austrian ambassador?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that one of the founding principles of the European project has been to prevent the re-emergence in Government of the right which polluted Spain under Franco, Portugal under Salazar, Greece under Papadopoulos and fascist Germany and Vichy France? Does he also agree that the driving force underpinning the European project is to ensure that while people have the right to express their views, those views will not be accorded the authority of government and that the advent of the so-called Freedom Party into government in Austria is a memory check for everybody in Europe with regard to the role the right has played in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government will send a clear signal to the Austrian Government, or to any government, that there is a conflict between the pursuit of the European ideals, as embodied in the European project, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the presence in government, as distinct from the presence in Parliament, of people who express the views the Taoiseach referred to in the course of the recent Austrian election campaign? Does he not <Col N="537" /> agree there is a paradox and a difficulty with enlargement given on the one hand, the prospective difficulties which some member states may have with enlargement, some of whose political parties are opposed to enlargement, and, on the other hand, the prospect that parties within some of the applicant countries do not share the democratic values and views on which the European project is based?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I recently stressed in the House what must happen concerning human rights before people can gain acceptance for enlargement, which now involves 12 countries, another six having become involved today. I mentioned this in particular in the context of Turkey. We can argue about the legal position, but Article 5 clearly states that people must be mindful of human rights and what the Union stands for. Let us not talk about sanctions, which come under article 6, unless&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely, and Article 5 proves this. It states that the values must be shared and the principles must be followed. It was on that basis that Antonia Guterre acted. When I spoke to Wolfgang Schu1ssel before his appointment I stressed the essential importance of the common European values of democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the need for clear reaffirmation by the proposed Austrian Government of its intention to honour these values and adhere to its international obligations both within the Union and in other international fora. I laid down this as the issue concerning the Irish Government. In fairness, it was the wish to the Austrian people, or at least the system, which gave the result, notwithstanding the enormous differences between people, including the Austrian President who stated his position. The president succeeded in having included in the preamble issues with pro-European standards and we must wait to see how these standards are adhered to. I have spoken to some of my colleagues on different issues in the past week or so, and we will see how the new administration performs.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Taoiseach agree that Mr. Haider was heard loud and clear when he praised Nazi forced labour policies, when he praised members of the Waffen SS death squads, and when he targeted the Turkish minority, particularly for verbal attack, since coming into office? Does the Taoiseach share the concern of a significant section of the Austrian people that the arrival of Haider's party in Government is a very sinister development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Convention could allow asylum seekers to be sent to Austria to have their applications heard if that is where they first entered the EU. Is the Taoiseach concerned whether, in the climate which Haider's party is building <Col N="538" /> against immigrants and asylum seekers, those who might be sent there would get justice, fair play and a fair hearing?</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach commend the mass public protests of the labour movement, including Youth Against Racism in Europe and other groups, against Haider in Austria and which are determined that fascism will not be allowed breed again in Central Europe?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to get involved in discussing different political movements in Austria &ndash; I will not fall into that trap. Our concern is that the EU treaty, of which we are part, is adhered to, and we have stated our position in that regard and have joined all the other members and other countries in this regard. I hope the policies Mr. Haider very clearly put forward many times will not be followed by the members of the new administration. This appears to be what the President of Austria has said and what the General Affairs Council said yesterday. There is no doubt this matter will be kept under very close scrutiny and review in the months ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>What must the Austrian Government do for the Taoiseach to allow a Minister to receive the Austrian ambassador to Ireland? On the upholding of the treaties, does the Taoiseach consider it might have been better to have confronted the members of the Austrian Government at a meeting rather than decide on the sanctions before they were confronted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The sanction is in place, it is an indicator. If this Government follows the policy it has set down perhaps matters will change, but that can only be done at European Council level. Mr. Antonio Guterres had a difficult position getting a moderate statement. It was not what was said to him by many countries, including bigger and smaller ones. He used skill and judgment to get a reasonable statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not have been better to allow the Austrian Government state its case, face to face, in the same way as a person in an unfair dismissals case would be entitled to due process rather than have the job done by telephone, behind their backs and without their involvement, in such a fashion as to increase the popularity of Haider in a way that is entirely undesirable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether that is the effect is for another case; we will see that happening in the future. The thinking behind it was it was the weekend prior to the establishment of the new administration. Many people did not like it but it is not their business. Their business is their make-up and the policies they pursue against the treaty. The view was that putting on this pressure could assist the position, which it did. The President was not only able to insist, due to international press<Col N="539" /> ure, that issues be put into preamble but was effectively told he could write the preamble. He got all the issues into the preamble and people will have to live by them. From that point of view it was a good manoeuvre. I agree with Deputy Bruton that it is not always satisfactory to try to do such things on the telephone, particularly on a Sunday night, but it probably had the desired effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the action taken by the Portuguese presidency was in accordance with the European treaties? The action in advance of the formation of the Austrian Government strengthens the hand of the presidency and a signal has been sent very clearly not only to the Austrian people but also to the Belgians, French and anyone else who would wish to vote for a far right party. While their democratic rights to vote for whoever they like may be respected, the prospect of such parties forming part of a Government within a deepening European Union is something that is at variance with the values of the European project and, as a consequence of that, the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, and future enlargement raises fundamental issues of politics rather than economics that this Government must address. What steps should the Government take in respect of that issue?</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that Socialist Chancellor Kreisky had four of these party members in his Cabinet and nobody said anything? Does he agree that, even though we join him in condemning some of the things Mr. Haider has said, the manner in which the decision was made in this case has set a woeful precedent for larger member states to hijack the role of the European Community, particularly given that for the first time the Amsterdam Treaty made provision for the suspension of member states which did not meet the criteria set down? Why was it necessary to bypass these institutional arrangements? Given what is happening on this island, will we be subject to public opinion in France or elsewhere before we decide how the State should be governed? A total of 27% of Austrians are not fascists and the issue should not have been dealt with in this manner.</P>

      <P>Member states have made their statement, which was balanced. It did not go into the measures that some countries wished that weekend &ndash; they did not get their way. The Presi<Col N="540" /> dency's function was to produce a balanced statement and I believe it did that even though it creates some difficulties.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but some people wanted to fuel the extremes far more than Antonio Guterres, who tried to deal with this in a balanced way. It was successful because that pressure had a major influence on trying to get the new Government in Austria to honour its international commitments. It did that and that demonstrated good action by the Presidency.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether refugees from Ireland would be sent to Austria, but naturally these matters would have to be taken into account if such a situation arose. In fairness to the new administration, I do not believe that it will follow anything like the threatening statements Mr. Haider has made in the past. I do not envisage this becoming a difficulty. We should not prejudge the administration. It stated that it would follow the rule of law, democracy and human rights, and we will wait and see how that develops.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 37 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submitted the Warburg Dillon Read report on the strategic options for the future of Aer Rianta to my Cabinet colleagues at the Govern<Col N="541" /> ment meeting on 1 February and also made it publicly available. I am giving careful consideration to the findings and recommendations contained in that report with a view to formulating specific proposals for consideration by Government as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the position of the unions in relation to the future strategic direction of Aer Rianta. During the latter half of last year I received considerable correspondence on the subject and I met and consulted with staff and union representatives of the airports to hear their views and concerns regarding the future of the airports. The matter was further aired at a good meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport. No decisions on possible alternative ownership arrangements for the State airports or on the future of the Great Southern Hotels Group will be taken in advance of the Government's consideration of these issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Warburg Dillon Read report was published it was stated that decisions on it would be brought before Cabinet by the Minister a fortnight later, which would have been today. Why has this matter been consistently deferred? Will the Minister set a timeframe for it to be brought before Cabinet? Does she agree that State airports are no different from State ports or roads and the State can invest in them? Does she further agree that there is no reason Cork, Dublin and Shannon airports cannot continue to be 100% owned by the State and funded through the public capital programme and for Aer Rianta International to be subject to an IPO? Does she accept it is not possible for a company to pursue public policy goals in regard to regional and access transport policy issues, for example, if it is privatised and must operate to the mantra of earnings per share?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to wholly privatise the airports. The Deputy asked for a timeframe. I did not have my proposals ready to bring before the Cabinet today as I thought I would. There are other equally pressing matters and I must rearrange my priorities accordingly. I hope within the next two to three weeks I will have the proposals ready to submit to Cabinet for full discussion on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there is no case to be made for privatisation or part privatisation of Aer Rianta? Is she aware that the unions and the company's employees are opposed to such privatisation and their first option is the one the Minister said she could not avail of because the EU would prevent her from doing so, namely, State investment in the airport infrastructure as required? I refer her to document 94C350/07.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will she indicate whether she is simply flying another kite or has the agreement of Deputy Healy-Rae on the matter? When will there be a <Col N="542" /> decision on the matter? In the meantime I am sure she will agree there is a pressing need for the investment that is required in Aer Rianta. The Government has oodles of money to make such investment and there is no let or hindrance to it from doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I met the trade unions involved on several occasions and they did not press me on the matter of partial privatisation. The main item on their agenda was the sell off of airports and that is the basis on which our discussion was held. In May or June the advanced stages of capital programmes will be reached. Aer Rianta needs approximately £503 million in capital expenditure for the three State airports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat a serious net point. The driving force for this issue is Aer Rianta's need for investment. What is the legal impediment to the State investing in these airports in the same manner it does in sea ports or other infrastructure? I believe there is none. Does the Minister agree that Dublin Airport's profits should be used for the benefit of Cork and Shannon Airports and our aviation infrastructure, not for future private shareholders. Given that Dublin Airport has a monopoly, it is much better to have a public monopoly than a private one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's latter comment. It is correct that it is not worth exchanging a public monopoly for a private one. The Deputy referred to how profits earned by Aer Rianta at Dublin Airport should be invested in the three airports but, sadly, due to the abolition of duty free sales the company's profits will be considerably diminished. We await the publication of its 1999 results which should show the half year effect of that. Approximately £500 million is the amount of capital investment needed in the immediate, medium and long-term for the three State airports. That poses its own difficulties which have to be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat the question I asked and which Deputy Yates asked three times. Will the Minister accept there is no hindrance, legal or otherwise, that she has to overcome to invest money infrastructurally in the three airports, the £500 million she mentioned? She repeatedly said in the House that she was disallowed by the EU from doing so. We have now acknowledged that she was wrong in saying that and that she can now invest State money &ndash; all she has to do is convince her Cabinet colleagues to do so &ndash; and that it should be included in the national development plan along with roads, sewers and everything else except airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> Will the Minister confirm or deny the reported U-turn on the sale of Great Southern Hotels? I am looking at a statement by her colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who said the Great Southern Hotels would not be sold. I presume he was intending to gazzump his constituency colleague, Deputy Healy-Rae, on that matter. Will the Minister tell us if a decision has been made to sell the land surrounding the hotels but not the hotels themselves?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may take the last question first, the hotel unions came to me on several occasions but on the last occasion they put forward that idea to me. I thought it was constructive. The idea came from them, not from me. I want to be clear on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <Quest>the discussions, if any, she has had with the office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation on the licensing arrangements for third generation mobile telephony services; if new legislation is required for further licensing; if the office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation has sufficient powers to make these determinations; and if her attention has been drawn to the dissatisfaction and delays experienced by applicant service providers in rolling out their telecommunications infrastructure proposals.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have regular meetings with the director on the range of issues for which she has responsibility. On the licensing arrangements for third generation mobile telephony services, I understand the director intends carrying out a public consultation on this issue shortly prior to holding a competition for the award of licences.</P>
      <P>The director has sufficient powers to carry out this licensing function. However, new legislation will be required to authorise the use of radio frequency spectrum by the third generation mobile telephony operators and this will take the form of a statutory instrument to be made under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts. The draft instrument is to be developed by the director and will require my consent before it is enacted.  </P>
      <P>On the question of dissatisfaction and delays being experienced by applicant service providers, I assume the Deputy is referring to the difficulties being experienced by the present operators of second generation mobile telephony systems in obtaining planning permission; I do not know if that is what the Deputy meant. This is a matter, as the Deputy knows, for An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to anticipate the difficulties, if any, that may be encountered by licensees in rolling out their third generation mobile networks as <Col N="546" /> the specific requirements in relation to the roll-out of networks have yet to be developed by the director.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of clarification, my question relates to the first part of the Minister's answer, not the planning difficulties. Has she received the same representations as I? I have met people from the telecommunications division of IBEC and they complained to me that we went into the deregulation market behind the rest of Europe. For third generation mobile telephony, that is convergence of different types of telecommunications and data services, broadband width. The service providers are anxious to provide services to their customers but the regulator said they could not have a licence for this because new legislation is required. They then went to the Department who said the regulator had adequate powers to do this. I am trying to expedite the process. The first part of the Minister's reply set out a procedure for a statutory instrument and a public consultation process. I ask her or her officials to meet the regulator to try to expedite this process so that we will not lose any further time in the roll-out of third mobile telephony services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard the same representations as the Deputy. It is the next step forward which cannot be taken now because of what is perceived by IBEC to be a delay. I understand the director intends carrying out a public consultation, as she does on most of the issues in a very competent manner. She has sufficient powers to carry out the licensing function but legislation will be required, which will be a statutory instrument which she will compile and to which I will give consent. I take the Deputy's point about the urgency of the matter and I will certainly convey that to my officials who I am sure will speak to the director. However, she has her own agenda of work and her own plans and she is not subject to direction of any kind, nor should she be. The office was set up as an independent office. Nevertheless, I will discuss the matter with my officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>Since taking office I have had a number of meetings with representatives of the ESB group of unions, the most recent being 16 November 1999, at which a number of issues relevant to the full implementation of the European Union electricity directive were discussed. It emerged from this meeting that a tripartite group comprising representatives of the ESB management, the ESB group of unions and my Department would be best equipped to discuss these <Col N="547" /> outstanding issues in so far as they concerned the ESB. I understand the tripartite group to be nearing finalisation of its discussions and I hope to be in a position soon to make a statement on the principles of transmission system operator and other matters. I thought it might be finalised before I came to the House but it is not. I hope it will be ready by tomorrow, at the latest. It will deal with other matters besides the transmission system operator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely not. I am subject to legal advice like anybody else and I get my legal advice from the Attorney General. I will always consult with the Attorney General &ndash; it is my duty. The tripartite process was established to examine the transmission system operator, public service obligations, transitional regime, power purchase agreements, the vesting arrangements and reciprocity. A huge amount of work was put into the process by the three sides and great goodwill was engendered.</P>
      <P>Many agendas are being carried out in this process, not all of which I approve of. There are the agendas of competitors who must have their say, the agendas of those in charge of the grid and the agendas of the Department, the political parties, the EU directives and the trade unions. There is a myriad of issues and the process has been extremely complex and technical. I would be a foolish person, in light of pending EU directives on other matters, not to take the Attorney General's advice.</P>

The Minister made direct and firm promises to the unions concerning the transmission system, that it would be retained in the ownership of the ESB. Would she agree that she was making a back door attempt to privatise large chunks of the ESB by using quasi legal argument which, in the event, did not stand the test of time? Is she aware of the existence of a Mr. Kieran O'Brien who is director of the national grid in the ESB? Given that he has attempted to set up an independent republic within the ESB, would she agree that he should be sacked by the board of the ESB?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1998 the IRMS was commissioned to carry out a review of rail safety in Ireland. In its report, it identified a number of <Col N="552" /> unreasonable risks requiring urgent remedial action by Iarnród Éireann. As part of the original terms of reference for the railway safety study, it was envisaged that there would be a need for follow-up auditing by the independent consultants. While the first audit was planned to commence in October 1999, I asked the IRMS to undertake a pre-audit prior to its carrying out the full audit so that I could have an early preliminary indication of progress on the recommendations contained in the 1998 report.</P>
      <P>The pre-audit was finalised in September 1999. It concluded that a great deal had been done by Iarnród Éireann over the previous six to 12 months to reduce risk and that many encouraging initiatives had been started to improve safety culture. However, the IRMS reported that some unreasonable risks reported by Iarnród Éireann as being rectified or completed still required further attention. It concluded that the findings of the pre-audit should be examined in more depth during the full audit and that the full audit should include a more extensive survey to verify that the unreasonable risks had been rectified. From my point of view, it was good to note that progress had been made. However, it was and remains worrying to me that some unreasonable risks had not at that time been rectified.</P>
      <P>The IRMS commenced the full audit in October, because that was one year from the safety report, and drafting of the audit report is nearly complete. From contacts with the consultants, my officials advise me that the IRMS is of the view that a number of unreasonable risks still remain to be fully resolved. This is obviously of great concern to me. However, as was the case in the original review, the IRMS experts were at all times accompanied on site visits by Iarnród Éireann staff who would have been aware of the deficiencies as they were discovered by the IRMS team.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has assured me that it is continuing to work on resolving those unreasonable risks. I expect to have the final audit report from the IRMS within the next two weeks and I will take whatever action is appropriate after considering the report. I will seek Iarnród Éireann's immediate response to the findings of the audit. I intend to publish the audit report at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that this is a serious situation where the consultants appointed by her to compile an interim report found that Iarnród Éireann was covering up or giving less than frank answers in its assessment of the safety situation, that it said it had corrected things it had still not corrected and that unreasonable risk continued to exist in these areas? Will the Minister publish that report? Does she agree that the travelling public has a right to know the risk it takes when buying a rail ticket? Can she identify the lines with the highest risk? The Minister said she will take whatever action is appropriate. Does she agree she should have taken <Col N="553" /> appropriate action long ago? This is ongoing and there was a debate on it in the House during which I gave full credit to the Minister for commissioning the safety report. However, it is now past time for taking appropriate action. Does the Minister agree that waiting for another report before taking that appropriate action is not acceptable where there is unreasonable risk?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the situation as outlined by the Deputy. I will publish both reports in two weeks' time and it is right that the public should know. A sum of £86 million was spent in 1999 and £100 million is provided this year and again next year for the work detailed in the IRMS report. It is vital that any work identified as necessary is carried out according to the consultants' specifications. I presented the first IRMS report to Cabinet and sought funding, which I obtained. I then brought the idea to Cabinet that there should be yearly reports so that we would know if the railways were being made safe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>The IRMS doubted that the safety department in Iarnród Éireann had sufficient resources to undertake development work as well as co-ordinating the safety programme. In light of that part of the report and given that sizeable resources have been provided, something I acknowledge, does the Minister agree that the resources are not being directed where they are needed if the safety department in Iarnród Éireann has no money or resources? Will the Minister take immediate action to ensure that this flaw in the system identified by IRMS is rectified immediately so that the safety department is brought up to standard?</P>

      <P>The interim or half-yearly audit report began last February and I had been told at the end of the previous year that I would receive £86 million in funding for rail safety. CIE's concern about the closeness of the two developments was identified by IRMS. That has now been rectified because £100 million is ringfenced in CIE for safety for this year. I am perturbed that the risks identified by IRMS in Iarnród Éireann have not been fully resolved. It is something on which I will take immediate action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not. I have waited patiently, but I will be brief. The IRMS report of October 1998 stated that all unreasonable risk deficiencies were to be remedied within six months. The data I received on this matter under the Freedom of Information Act showed a serious amount of unreasonable risk had still not been attended to and that little progress had been made by the Department in strengthening the railway inspectorate. Will those two specific areas be dealt with?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not carry out the work and neither do the officials in my Department. The IRMS identified the unreasonable risks which needed to be rectified and I want to see that happen and do not want to hear any more excuses. It is why I commissioned the interim report alongside the yearly report which I will receive soon. Regarding the railway inspectorate, a third person has been offered a position and we await a reply. There is already a female and male inspector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>I have made no specific proposals to end CIE's rail monopoly or to privatise any part of Iarnród Éireann's existing rail network, either in my speech to Ballinasloe Chamber of Commerce or otherwise. I do not intend to privatise any part of Iarnród Éireann's existing rail network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006 we will spend £500 million on the safety study. This sum is comprised of £350 million for the continuation of the railway safety programme and other spending of which the Deputy will be aware. However, investment alone is not enough. I suggested in my Ballinasloe speech that the time had come for a fundamental re-think about how we deliver public transport services and that it was now appropriate to consider if the existing institutional arrangements are adequate for a new era of public transport. I also asked the question whether it is necessary for the State to both procure and provide practically all public transport services and whether it is essential to retain a vir<Col N="555" /> tual State monopoly in the provision of public transport. I hoped that by asking these questions I might begin a constructive debate on these important issues.</P>
    <P>I also observed that other European countries have developed partnership models in which both the public and private sectors are involved in the provision of public transport. Such an approach could have a beneficial effect in Ireland, particularly in the present context.</P>
    <P>The Government has already committed itself to the use of public-private partnerships. It has endorsed a public-private partnership approach to elements of Dublin rail. This approach may also be appropriate for other public transport facilities and services. Another factor which would have to be taken into account is possible EU legislative proposals in this area.</P>

Does she agree it is bad form for the Minister for public transport to be bad-mouthing her own company when she speaks before the enemy, as it were, who would want to see it cut down and knocked about? Does the Minister agree that if it is the case that, as she states, it is perceived as a poor quality service, unreliable, slow, inefficient and bad value for money, the reason is she and her predecessors have starved the company of finances which would have made it an efficient company that would give a good service and provide good value? Does she agree it is time for her to acknowledge publicly and clearly, without flying kites, that her intention is to allow&mdash;</P>

The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and her colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="557" /> Jacob, have made specific rhetorical utterances about competition. When will there be legislation to provide for bus competition like that which exists in London, where one sees red buses under different franchises? When will there be orderly re-regulation and competition in the bus transport sector? The Minister has talked the talk but little action has emerged from it.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>It has been my understanding for some time that Dublin does not need a second airport in terms of the capacity of Dublin Airport to grow for the foreseeable future. Aside from the capacity issue, the other possible reason for proposing a second airport for Dublin relates to the question of promoting competition in the airport sector. Both those aspects were considered in the recent consultancy report on Aer Rianta's future strategic direction which assessed the merits of a second airport in Dublin, particularly in the context of the possible development by commercial interests of Baldonnel Aerodrome.</P>
      <P>The advisers formed the view that Dublin Airport is not constrained from a capacity point of view and that it has sufficient capacity to expand and accommodate up to 40 million passengers per annum. With regard to Baldonnel, the advisers see no reason for the Government to hinder commercial development at the aerodrome subject to Department of Defence approval, appropriate planning and Irish Aviation Authority approvals. They believe, however, that while the development of a corporate jet facility on a commercial basis could be viable, a larger scale passenger airport development at Baldonnel would be commercially challenging. I fully recognise the economic and social importance locally of Dublin Airport for the northside of Dublin but its significance and impact extends throughout the whole Dublin region and beyond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>Do we take it from the Minister's reply that the Government has no intention of developing a second commercial airport at Baldonnel? I do not know what that answer means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no intention of developing another State airport. If somebody has a proposal to develop it commercially, they can put forward their plans, and their money, and the Department of Defence, which owns the land, could consider it. The Government has no intention of setting up another State airport, if that is what the Deputy is asking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister put on record that any commercial development at Baldonnel will be for corporate and commercial jets and not for the scheduled airline business? In that context and in terms of the future of Aer Rianta, we need to be clear that Dublin Airport will be the hub international airport for the foreseeable future. It is a three hour drive to Cork and Shannon. We are dealing with the linchpin of aviation policy when we talk about the future of Dublin Airport <i>per se</i>.</P>

I also agree that it would seem suitable to develop Baldonnel, which is not under the aegis of my Department, to enhance corporate jet arrival and departure facilities.

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for putting down these questions. I express sincere regret and apologies to all those who have been extremely discommoded today because of the lack of bus transport. I thank the gardaí and the Office of the <Col N="562" /> Director of Traffic for their efforts to keep traffic flowing and road users for their patience.</P>
      <P>On 4 February, the National Bus and Rail Union served strike notice on Bus Átha Cliath in respect of an increase in basic pay for drivers. The existing basic pay for most drivers is £273 and the claim issued was for a 20% increase in basic pay. Further strikes are threatened for Tuesday and Wednesday next, for three days from Monday, 28 February, for four days from Wednesday, 8 March and an all out strike the following week.</P>
      <P>The NBRU originally served strike notice in support of a 20% increase in basic pay for bus drivers in September 1999. SIPTU also served strike notice at the same time but did not quantify the percentage. The Labour Court considered this dispute on 28 September and issued a recommendation on 11 October which found that the claim was in breach of Partnership 2000. I understand the NBRU is not a partner in Partnership 2000. However, the court recommended that an independent third party carry out an investigation of a range of issues on which there was wide disparity between the parties on the factual position, including pay and conditions, pensions, the effect of State subvention, comparisons with other driver groups, current working practices and methods of payment. The court recommended that the third party report, when it would issue, would be used as a basis for further negotiation.</P>
      <P>The company agreed to the appointment of the independent third party whose name was nominated by the unions. It was a group headed by Mr. Seán Healy. I must explain that it is not the Seán Healy of CORI because I heard somebody say on radio it was. His report was submitted to both parties at the end of January. The third party concluded that the current pay claim would place in jeopardy the future viability of Bus Átha Cliath if conceded in isolation. It also states, however, that inflexiblities still exist in work practices within the company and that there are significant opportunities for cost savings, which could form the basis of a productivity deal to address the basic pay issue in a meaningful way. The report also states that there certainly is room to examine the starter pay of drivers.</P>
      <P>I have been in regular contact with the management and unions in Dublin Bus to ascertain if a basis can be found for negotiations that will lead to an early and satisfactory resolution of this dispute. I will continue those contacts and urge the parties to enter into urgent negotiations without preconditions on either side or the threat of industrial action, but with the interests of customers foremost in their minds.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court recommendation of 11 October provided the context for the resolution of this dispute. It also recommended that the third party report should be used as the basis for future negotiations. While I am aware of union concerns about the report, it should be possible to use it as an agenda for negotiations.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the progress of <Col N="563" /> Dublin Bus in recent years, does the Minister accept that an ongoing strike would not be in the interests of the company, the workers or the commuters? What specific action does she intend to take to assist in finding a solution to this dispute? Does she believe a basic starting salary of £207, which is only £30 above the proposed national minimum wage, is adequate pay for the difficult and stressful job of bus drivers in Dublin city every day? Rather than pussyfooting around the edges of this dispute, will she do what she has often done on previous occasions and intervene directly with management and tell them to sit down around the table with the unions who are prepared to talk to resolve this strike before it escalates any further? The Minister has plenty of experience of doing that with this company.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree Dublin Bus management and staff have treated 200,000 commuters with utter contempt in that people have been unable to go to work today because of the strike, the unions have taken an approach to strike as a first rather than a last resort and Dublin Bus management has laid down a precondition to talks, which is different from what the Minister said? Has there been a shift in the management's position? Its members laid down a precondition that while there was a threat of a strike they could not talk? Is the Minister saying that precondition has been lifted and that there will be talks on the Healy review of the six productivity areas? Can she give an assurance to the House that the two days' strike threatened for next week will not go ahead and dialogue will replace it?</P>

Will she address the question, which I also raised in my private notice question, about providing alternative transport if this strike is not settled next week? Will she consider bringing in the Army to provide a skeleton service for the public, as happened in 1979?</P>

Does she agree that, while the emphasis in the questioning up to now has been quite properly on the plight of commuters, it is unconscionable to expect people to do the kind of work bus drivers do for the paltry wage they are paid? Is it not the case that they are the worst paid essential workers in Dublin and that it is incumbent on her as Minister to require the management of Dublin Bus to pay bus drivers who are now manning one person buses a proper salary and, if it does not, to sack the management?</P>

      <P>The study, from which we seem to have strayed, was suggested by the Labour Court.

Does she accept that the 5% subvention to Bus Átha Cliath, which the Government and previous Governments have underwritten, is at the heart of the drivers' dispute, given that they feel they are underwriting, by means of their low pay, the operation of Dublin Bus? Does she also accept there is a public safety issue which affects both the drivers who operate one person buses &ndash; this must be recognised and compensated for &ndash; and the commuters who endure overcrowded conditions on those buses? Will Deputy O'Rourke intervene, not only as Minister for Public Enterprise but also as the people's representative in the operation of an efficient public transport system? In the absence of a statutorily recognised public transport users' group, it is the Minister's responsibility to rep<Col N="566" /> resent the public by intervening, not merely by wishing for the problem to be resolved.</P>

I reiterate that the people who drive buses in Dublin traffic are doing a most competent job.</P>
      <P>The Deputy inquired why I have not intervened directly. The Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission and the bodies of State which were established and reinforced by various Governments are those to whom we look for leadership in respect of matters of this nature. Having said that, it was under the aegis of the Labour Court that the suggestion for the third party study arose.

That did not materialise. It is entitled to stay out if it wishes but it poses difficulties because there are two unions. It is clear that SIPTU members do not wish to pass pickets of their work colleagues.

        <b>: </b>Does the Minister agree that it is pathetic that the Government will not make a proper subsidy available for public transport in Dublin when the Exchequer surplus was in the order of £678 million in January? Will she agree that Fine Gael's proposal that the Army should be used in strike breaking is an insult to the workers in uniform who constitute the Army rank and file and should not be contemplated? Does she give any credence to Deputy Yates's proposal for organised strike breaking? Since she would not give a straight answer when asked if she considers Dublin Bus drivers' pay to be pathetic, could she do a bus driver's job or live comfortably on a Dublin Bus driver's wage, including paying for a home and family?</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Government, I convey heartfelt condolences to the families, relatives, comrades and friends of the four young Irish soldiers who were working for peace in Lebanon and who died yesterday in a tragic road traffic accident.

These men came from a part of the country which has a strong military tradition. Athy, in particular, has given many people to the armed forces, many of whom lost their lives in this and previous centuries.

This has been a major tragedy for the Defence Forces and for the parish of Athy.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a cause of great disappointment to me to have to address the House in these circumstances. I know that this sense of disappointment is shared by every one of us here. Our disappointment is all the greater because the rich potential of the Good Friday Agreement has, since the establishment of the institutions in <Col N="579" /> December, begun to translate itself into full reality. Few would have anticipated just how quickly and significantly the institutions would begin to make their mark.</P>
      <P>The Executive, under the joint stewardship of Mr. David Trimble and Mr. Séamus Mallon, has succeeded in bringing together representatives of both communities to work together with common purpose. The long awaited &ldquo;real politics&rdquo; has begun with local, and locally accountable Ministers taking decisions on matters of enormous importance and significance to the lives of the people in Northern Ireland. The operation of the Executive has demonstrated fully that the values underpinning the Agreement &ndash; partnership, mutual respect and equality &ndash; can be brought to bear in a meaningful and practical way for the benefit of both Nationalists and Unionists.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the Assembly has been working well. Like any other elected body, it has seen its share of robust debate. I have been deeply impressed by the manner in which parliamentarians from all perspectives and backgrounds have been approaching their work with diligence, commitment and enthusiasm.</P>
      <P>Ministers from both jurisdictions on the island have been meeting each other regularly and frequently in the North-South Ministerial Council, to the point where such meetings have become almost unremarkable. From the longer-term historical perspective, the very ordinariness of these meetings is itself astounding. At their meetings, Ministers from North and South have been making decisions which stand to benefit all the people of the island in a practical, meaningful and constructive way, and to promote real partnership.</P>
      <P>The Implementation Bodies are up and running. The British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference have identified for themselves substantial programmes of work which they are now beginning to take forward.</P>
      <P>In December, few would have anticipated such solid progress being made in just ten weeks, with so few teething problems. However, we now find ourselves in a situation where, as I said in my article in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday, difficulties of trust and confidence have once again crystallised around the issue of decommissioning and the Assembly and the Executive have been suspended. I passionately wish it were not so. It was not an outcome that any supporter of the Agreement would have wished to see and I believe that nobody other than those who remain opposed to the Agreement can relish the prospect of suspension. However, suspension has happened, and it is a very serious setback. The Government did all it could to seek to avert it. We now need to dedicate ourselves not to apportioning blame, because recrimination simply makes our task more difficult, but to encouraging the earliest possible restoration of the institutions so that the progress we have all welcomed can be built upon and developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="580" /> Throughout the peace process, for at least the past five years, decommissioning has been a thorn in our sides. It has provoked emotions and polarised attitudes in a way which is out of proportion to its intrinsic importance, significant though it is. It proved impossible for the parties and the Governments alone to resolve, and was so charged and difficult an issue that the parties to the Good Friday Agreement decided that it was best left to the independent International Commission on Decommissioning to oversee. Similarly, both as they entered and as they left the Mitchell Review, it was common ground among all of the pro-Agreement parties that the decommissioning which they were all committed to seeking to bring about should be carried out in a manner determined by the independent commission. The pre-eminent role of the commission with regard to decommissioning is, therefore, unquestioned. As I have said elsewhere, the de Chastelain commission is the instrument of the Agreement in terms of decommissioning and the key to it happening. That is why it is so important that we study carefully what it has had to say.</P>
    <P>Since devolution and the entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement, the commission has made three reports to the Governments. On 10 December, the commission was able to positively report that the improved political atmosphere created by the establishment of the new political institutions, the renewed collective commitment of the parties, and the appointment of authorised representatives by the IRA and the UFF provided &ldquo;the basis for an assessment that decommissioning will occur&rdquo;. On 31 January, and following several meetings with authorised representatives, the commission was further able to report that it had been assured by the IRA of its unequivocal continuing support for the political process.</P>
    <P>The commission also acknowledged the important part that the maintenance of the IRA cease-fire has played, and continues to play, in the political advances that have been achieved to date. However, it also reported that, at that point, it had received no information as to when decommissioning would start. As both Prime Minister Blair and I said at that time, clarity was needed about the intentions of the paramilitary organisations. We recognised, and we still recognise, that decommissioning is an integral and essential aspect of the Agreement. It is neither possible nor wise to hope that the issue will simply wither away.</P>
    <P>However, on 31 January, the commission also placed its statement in the context of ongoing negotiations and undertook to report any concrete progress to the Governments. Before and after the de Chastelain report of 31 January, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I, together with our most senior officials, engaged in the most intensive and extensive discussions with the parties, especially with Sinn Féin, to facilitate, in whatever way we could, a successful outcome.</P>
    <P>The result of those negotiations was the report <Col N="581" /> submitted to the two Governments on 11 February, which I have already described as highly significant. In that report, following further contacts with the IRA representative, the commission was able to state: &ldquo;The representative indicated to us today the context in which the IRA will initiate a comprehensive process to put arms beyond use.&rdquo;  It was also able to state that &ldquo;the commission believes that this commitment . holds out the real prospect of an agreement which would enable it to fulfil the substance of its mandate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has been engaged in the process and, in particular, who has studied the difficult question of decommissioning, will realise the deep significance of these statements. In effect, the commission is saying that, for the first time, it believes it has a commitment from the IRA that decommissioning will happen. This is, beyond doubt, a huge advance and progress which we should build upon as quickly as possible. I am glad that the British Government has also recognised the significance of this statement, as have the political parties.</P>
    <P>There is now a basis on which the de Chastelain commission should be able to take forward its work quickly, but that is likely to happen only in a context where the institutions are functioning. As Senator George Mitchell said in November on publication of his final report, it is certain that without the institutions there will be no decommissioning. However, I also appreciate that given the long legacy of distrust which has surrounded this question, there are questions to which the report inevitably gives rise which need to be worked through. It is for this reason that I have urged David Trimble to talk to the commission and to seek assurance from General de Chastelain. The general is a man of great integrity and one in whom all of the participants in this process have felt able to place their complete trust. His credibility is unquestioned. I am sure he will be pleased to assist in whatever way he can in enabling us to move forward.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I hope that, having played such a constructive and hugely valuable part in making such a report possible, Sinn Féin will also wish to offer whatever assurances they can to their partners in the political process. For this reason, I have said it would also be most useful for David Trimble to meet with Gerry Adams to discuss the contents of the de Chastelain report.</P>
    <P>With such statements and assurances I firmly believe it should be possible to bring the Assembly and the Executive back into operation as quickly as possible. It is in nobody's interest to see a political vacuum develop. Having made so much progress, we cannot now let matters slide into stalemate. I assure the House that, for the Government's part, no effort will be spared in seeking to move matters forward.</P>
    <P>In saying that and to assist the fullness of this debate, I have just heard that the IRA issued a statement at 5 o'clock. It is pulling its representative from the International Commission on Decommissioning. I have the statement before <Col N="582" /> me. It says that the IRA has withdrawn its interlocutor from the decommissioning body, it has taken its latest proposals on disarmament off the table and it accuses the Ulster Unionists and the British Government of trying to achieve military victory, which it says will not happen. It goes on to say that in the light of this the IRA leadership has decided to end its engagement with the decommissioning body and withdrawn all the propositions put to it since last November. That covers all the propositions to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Having given the House an outline of the IRA statement I shall now return to my prepared script. Since the events of last Friday, I have been in constant contact with Prime Minister Blair. The Minister for Foreign Affairs met with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland twice in Belfast yesterday, where they discussed the de Chastelain report and how best to secure the earliest restoration of the institutions. The Minister also has had meetings with the UUP, Sinn Féin, the Alliance Party, the Women's Coalition and the PUP. Tonight the Government is meeting the SDLP and tomorrow I will meet Prime Minister Blair in London and together we will be meeting the leaderships of the Ulster Unionist Party, the SDLP and Sinn Féin. We are determined to maintain the momentum towards restoration of the institutions.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the contacts that have taken place, I assure the House that the British and Irish Governments are at one on the need to secure the earliest possible progress so that suspension can be short lived. Moreover, none of the parties want the institutions to be placed in deep freeze. As we work to end suspension, we need to make continuing progress on other aspects of the Agreement where full implementation has yet to be achieved. In this regard, I welcome the Secretary of State's clear statement of his continuing determination to implement the Patten report. It is important that the review of the criminal justice system be published as soon as possible and that it be comprehensive and ambitious in its recommendations. Progress in security normalisation must be advanced urgently, while progress in decommissioning can be mutually reinforcing.</P>
    <P>As we work to move matters forward, I am aware that the decision of the Secretary of State last Friday to move to suspend the operation of the Assembly and the Executive has given rise not only to political questions and difficulties. Questions have also rightly been asked regarding legal and constitutional issues in the wake of suspension. We have, as a State with a written Constitution, specific issues and responsibilities to which we must give careful consideration. When we amended the Constitution on 2 December last, in addition to the changes that were made to Articles 2 and 3, we also agreed to be bound by the British-Irish Agreement, which was thereby incorporated into the Constitution. The terms of that agreement do not expressly provide for the situation in which we now find ourselves, where <Col N="583" /> some of the interlocking institutions under it have been suspended. This clearly gives rise to concerns for the Government and it is important for us to tread carefully.</P>
    <P>However, it is equally clear that these concerns will be most readily allayed by the speediest possible restoration of the institutions. Prolonging suspension can only make the situation more difficult, politically, practically and legally. There is a degree of public concern about the fact that the institutions have been suspended so quickly after the irreversible amendments of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. I understand the frustrations which have been expressed, but I would make a number of points which I hope will offer reassurance. First, all participants in the Agreement were called upon to take risks, ourselves included. Second, balancing British constitutional change, including the repeal of the Government of Ireland Act, remains in place. Third, as I have said before, the new articles stand by themselves as a valid and modern expression of our fundamental values and aspirations as a people.</P>
    <P>I again assure the House that we will spare no effort to ensure the early restoration of the institutions. They are central to the Agreement. As I said earlier, their operation to date has been an extraordinary success. They have allowed the people of Northern Ireland a greater deal of control over matters directly affecting them than they have known in decades. An inclusive Executive has been put in place where both communities are fully represented. The North-South Ministerial Council has provided us with the means of advancing co-operation and partnership on this island in a more structured and, therefore, more effective way than ever before. The implementation bodies are doing real work.</P>
    <P>Alongside the institutional developments, the implementation of other aspects of the Agreement has been delivering real and tangible benefits to all the people in the areas of human rights, equality, reconciliation and policing, in opening up the possibility of a new and better future built in partnership and hope together and in presenting us with a unique opportunity to put the divisions of our past behind us so that the real business of improving the quality of life of all our people can take precedence. It is for these very sound reasons that all the parties know we must overcome our present difficulties and I remain fully confident that we will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to know how to react to what has just happened in the House. I believe the IRA has set out, in a calculated way, to humiliate the Taoiseach, the elected leader of the Irish people, and that is not acceptable. How can it allow the Taoiseach, who has acted in good faith in this matter with Sinn Féin and all the parties and who has worked all the hours God sends to bring peace, to come to the House to deliver a careful, moderately optimistic message and be placed in a position where he was handed a note <Col N="584" /> telling him that the entire basis upon which he was speaking had been taken away from him by a secret organisation which is accountable to nobody, elected by nobody and has no right to act on behalf of the Irish people? The Minister for Foreign Affairs met Sinn Féin today or yesterday, and I have no doubt there has been telephone communication with Sinn Féin in the past hour or two. This is the height of impertinence and I compliment the Taoiseach on the calm and dignified way he dealt with the appalling way in which he has been treated by Sinn Féin and the IRA.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the fiction that these are two entirely separate organisations. I and the Taoiseach know that this is just not true. I was at pains to ensure that the information available to me about the close links at the very top between the two organisations was drawn to the Taoiseach's attention on taking office. Sinn Féin and the IRA are indivisible, yet Sinn Féin met the Minister for Foreign Affairs today or yesterday and, I have no doubt, did not breathe a word of this to him. What way is that to treat a newly appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs who is also working with dedication, as his predecessors have done, to bring peace?</P>
      <P>Everything the IRA says in its statement is not in accordance with the facts. It says, for example, that Mr. Adams said following his meeting with Mr. Mandelson that he had no evidence the British Government was contemplating re-establishing devolved institutions in the North. From what I have been told by Government sources, every effort is being made by the British and Irish Governments to restore devolved institutions in Northern Ireland virtually immediately. The Taoiseach has ensured that I and, I have no doubt, Deputy Quinn have been kept fully up to speed on what is going on, and I appreciate this. That is why I can say with absolute confidence that what was stated by Mr. Adams is wrong. I believe that the people who are telling me on behalf of the Government that there was a serious prospect this week of the institutions being re-established with the agreement of the British Government are telling the truth. Yet these people come along and allow the Taoiseach to stand in the House and be treated like this. It is outrageous. The Taoiseach has conducted himself very well in the face of the utmost provocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was done the day before the Taoiseach was due to meet the British Prime Minister, a meeting which was a court of appeal of sorts in terms of any issue regarding Mr. Mandelson. However, the IRA could not wait for the Taoiseach to meet the British Prime Minister to deal with outstanding problems. This suggests that they did not want the problem to be resolved. It appears that the only possible motivation for sabotaging an imminent effort by the Taoiseach with reasonable prospects of success of having the institutions re-established was to ensure they were not successful, as success would embarrass the IRA. It would have meant that the IRA <Col N="585" /> would have had to do something which it does not want to do. The movement puts its own pride before all else. It seems that not losing face is more important than making peace. The issue of putting arms beyond use is one of losing face for the republican movement &ndash; it is not a practical matter. As John Hume has frequently pointed out, putting a certain amount of semtex beyond use would immediately resolve the issue. Nobody is expecting everything stored by the IRA to be removed, and nobody could finally verify in any event if everything had been removed. It is probable that only very few within the organisation know the exact extent of the IRA arsenal. However, they could not even make a gesture.</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult to speak on this occasion. The decision by the IRA is throwing back in my face and in the face of Deputy Dick Spring the work we did. It is also throwing back in the face of Deputy Albert Reynolds the work he did, just as it is throwing back in the face of Deputy Andrews, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs the work they have done. It is also a full frontal rejection of Senator George Mitchell and the US Government.</P>
    <P>I remind Sinn Féin and the IRA &ndash; two sides of the same coin, as the Taoiseach very aptly put it &ndash; that the Mitchell principles which they signed up to even before entering the talks contain a total and absolute commitment to the total disarmament of paramilitary organisations and a commitment that disarmament be verifiable to the satisfaction of an independent commission. Sinn Féin agreed to these commitments even before entering the talks. That commitment was a recommendation of Senator George Mitchell, not a precondition laid down by other parties. The people voted for the Good Friday Agreement on the basis of the commitment by all the parties to the Mitchell principles, which included the total disarmament of paramilitary organisations. Without that commitment, there would not have been a Good Friday Agreement. That is a practical fact. If there had been no signing up to the Mitchell principles by Sinn Féin there would not have been all-party talks and if there had not been all-party talks there would not have been a Good Friday Agreement. The Good Friday Agreement explicitly recalled and drew into itself and its commitment those Mitchell principles containing a commitment to total disarmament. The people voted for the Good Friday Agreement and in so doing they voted for the total disarmament of paramilitary organisations to the satisfaction of an independent commission. It is simply bad faith to go back on those commitments now. People who signed a total commitment to the disarmament of paramilitary organisations got all the other concessions which are part of the talks but they are simply acting in bad faith when it comes to delivering on their side of the bargain by withdrawing that commitment.</P>
    <P>In business, negotiation or any transaction in life there must be good faith. One can have the most profound disagreements with people, the <Col N="586" /> most profound differences with them, but business can be done with them if they act in good faith. I have to question the good faith of people who signed the Mitchell principles and now, on the eve of a summit meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, withdraw their interlocutor from the commission which was set up with their agreement in the Good Friday accord. The refusal to disarm not only flouts the democratic will of the people in the 32 counties who voted for the decommissioning of weapons, North-South bodies, RUC reform and other parts of the British-Irish Agreement but also the democratic decision, the first since 1918, by the decision about which we have so discourteously learned in the midst of this debate &ndash; it is an act of bad faith.</P>
    <P>I recognise the Government's task is not to indulge in recrimination other than that which is necessary so the public can understand the true facts. There is a role for the Government in setting out the facts and giving people moral leadership at this time of crisis. There is a difference between right and wrong, it is not all about process. There must be a case for saying that some actions are bad and some actions are good and not all actions are equivalent. This is a very bad action by the IRA and their political supporters, Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>Having established clearly the moral parameters of the discussion which is part of the Government's role and of leadership, I have no doubt if the Taoiseach had been given more time to digest what was happening, he would have said a lot more and perhaps said many of the things which I have said. I recognise it is the Taoiseach's job, distasteful as it may be, to pick up the burden again and to go ahead to try to find a solution tomorrow. It is difficult and discouraging, but I assure the Taoiseach, in taking up this burden again and in seeking to put things together, he has not just the passive support of the other parties in this House but the acts of sympathetic support of us all.</P>
    <P>We have had our divisions in this House and we will have them again, but we support the Taoiseach in this matter. I also support the Minister for Foreign Affairs as somebody who has the ability to do business in good faith, speak his mind and make a deal. I hope his qualities and those of the Government which has worked so hard for peace will supervene over the sly, cheap, impoverished mind which decided to withdraw co-operation from the de Chastelain Commission just as the Taoiseach was getting to his feet in this House.</P>

      <P>It is seldom a pre-arranged set of statements has been transformed by information that literally comes in the midst of the first speaker. I would like to add my words of deep disappointment and regret that the IRA has so precipitously responded to an action which none <Col N="587" /> of us wanted to see happen, namely, the suspension of the institutions in Northern Ireland, but which we nevertheless saw as perhaps being an inevitable consequence of a failure by some participants to the process to meet what was understood by others to be their obligations within a given timeframe, a timeframe set not by one political party but by the Mitchell process of review. We must go on and I will look at some of the things we have just forfeited.</P>
      <P>One hundred days is normally regarded as an appropriate political honeymoon for any new political regime. That the Northern Executive did not last that long is particularly sad and disappointing. Even in 72 days we saw enough to vindicate the choice made by the Irish people by referendum two years ago. Even the DUP, for all its objections, has worked the Agreement.</P>
      <P>The peace process has, for my party, been about the normalisation of politics, warts and all. Rows about the allocation of projects to ministerial constituencies, for instance, is a time honoured tradition on this side of the Border. In Northern Ireland though, the row about the location of maternity services and the decision taken by the Health Minister, Barbara de Bruin, was almost a refreshing change. Real politics at last &ndash; a Minister being made to account for her decision to her own electorate.</P>
      <P>Few of the fears people had about the Executive prior to its formation proved to be real. There was no attempt by Unionists, for instance, to bypass or ignore the cross-Border bodies. Sinn Féin's participation in Government did not mean the end of the world as had been feared by Unionists despite a few spats about flags and symbols. The £73 million made available to the Minister for Education, Martin McGuinness, for construction of primary schools stands out as a beacon of the possible progress to come.</P>
      <P>For these resasons, the decision by the Secretary of State to suspend the institution is all the more tragic. In particular, I would like to sympathise with the other political parties and especially the SDLP which is not directly party to this dispute. I am not in the business of playing the blame game. The blame game is the most singular sign that things are not going well in the peace process. It has been part and parcel of the worst moments of the peace process. In the participants themselves, it is inevitably a sign of fatigue and frustration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to carry out a post-mortem into the events of last Friday evening. It has happened and we must live with its consequences. Both Governments have shown commendable determination to get the process back on track very quickly. However, some points need to be made. The first de Chastelain report is a damning indictment of the republican movement. I understand that the establishment of a new deadline for decommissioning by the Ulster Unionists caused difficulties and deeply annoyed republicans. Although most parties to the talks, including the <Col N="588" /> SDLP, seemed to expect some decommissioning by the end of January, none of this excuses the failure of the IRA to engage with the international body when its colleagues in the movement's political wing, Sinn Féin, have been championing it for months. The reality is, sadly, that republicans could have snubbed the Trimble deadline and adhered to the de Chastelain principles if they so chose. It remains a source of enormous frustration for those of us largely outside this process that developments and breakthroughs only occur as deadlines disappear. Deadlines appear to have the effect of concentrating minds in this process, even if their sanctions are not to be taken literally. That is no harm in itself.</P>
    <P>However, I would be the first to recognise that the second de Chastelain report last week represented considerable progress on the first report and, notwithstanding this afternoon's statements by the IRA and Sinn Féin, once something has been put on paper it is there and as much as the IRA wishes to withdraw its proposals, effectively I do not believe they can in their entirety be withdrawn. Sinn Féin spokespersons are right to stress the significance of the decommissioning body's assertion that it is in place to carry out its mandate based on what it has already received from the IRA.</P>
    <P>However, it is fair to respond that there can be no justifiable reason why the IRA cannot go further and indicate publicly when weapons will be put beyond use &ndash; the &ldquo;if and when&rdquo; question put so succinctly once again by Séamus Mallon. There should be no difficulty on any side with weapons being put beyond use as opposed to destroyed or handed over. A timetable was clearly set out in the de Chastelain report published in December. It is one thing for republicans to complain about a Unionist veto on the process, but, in a similar vein, members of the IRA are also being allowed to veto the process.</P>
    <P>There are also questions to answer on the Unionist side. David Trimble can have been in no doubt that by setting a deadline for republican decommissioning he made the event less rather than more likely. I will not second guess that he felt compelled to do so in order to carry his brave decision to enter the Executive at the meeting of his party's governing body without prior decommissioning. However, threatened resignation, on a point of principle, cannot be accompanied by undercurrents about an attempted re-negotiation of the Patten report. Any attempt to do so will fuel Nationalists' suspicion that unionism has been engaged in strategic manoeuvring, with this just the latest in a long line of incidents. This week's statement by Mr. Mandelson that there can be no going back on the Patten report is important and should be accepted by Unionists.</P>
    <P>They should also recognise the significance of the second report of the decommissioning body. They have a right to be sceptical about the IRA's intentions, all the more so now. The first Mitchell report on decommissioning, prior to the start of <Col N="589" /> inter-party talks, suggested that paramilitary groups should agree to the start of decommissioning during the inter-party talks themselves. At each stage of the process Unionists have moderated their position on decommissioning to facilitate progress. However, the IRA is clearly now engaged in this process in a manner in which it was not even two weeks ago. Assuming that further clarification is forthcoming and intent is confirmed, flexibility must be allowed. The context in which we find ourselves, however, will need to be clarified in the light of what we have just heard. Decommissioning is not the only item for which the timetable has slipped during the Agreement, but without a start to the process before May and a clear agenda for progress after that, the process will falter, perhaps irrecoverably.</P>
    <P>I welcome this morning's reports, confirmed by the Taoiseach, that both Governments are working closely together to ensure the suspension is of as short a duration as possible. I hope that the IRA's announcement at 5 p.m. does not lengthen that timeframe. The Taoiseach's concern about constitutional implications arising from the suspension are not with foundation. Suspension is not contemplated in the British-Irish Agreement which, as a result of the referendum of May 1998, has constitutional standing, but if we have learned anything from this process it is that progress is made, however painstakingly, by face to face dialogue and negotiations rather than recourse to the courts. It must not come to that.</P>
    <P>Decommissioning is a central component of the Good Friday Agreement. It has been supported by public opinion in countless opinion polls, including among Sinn Féin supporters. It is not about surrender or humiliation, but building trust between all the peoples on this island. It would represent a recognition on the part of republicans that the Irish people are mature enough to make their own decisions. As Parnell famously put it &ldquo;No man has the right to set a boundary to the march of a nation&rdquo;, and on this issue the nation has spoken clearly.</P>
    <P>Republicans argued trenchantly for the repeal of the Government of Ireland Act and they got it, but the IRA must also accept the implications of that advance. The people, not Westminster, are now sovereign and change can only come about if they are persuaded that the people want it. There has never been a clearer indication that the public want the Good Friday Agreement implemented in full. I wish the Taoiseach and his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs success and assure them of our full support. Many issues divide the parties in this House but we are not divided on this. I commend the commitment, energy and dedication that the Taoiseach and his team of officials and advisers have brought to this process, particularly over the past fortnight. We will gladly offer now anything we can do to help the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with charter fees when I concluded last Thursday. If one does not object to planning permission at application stage, one cannot make submissions or lodge an objection to An Bord Pleanála subsequently. However, it is possible that an individual who has an interest in a planning application could examine it and find that it does not impinge on his or her rights in any way or affect his or her property and be quite satisfied. Subsequently, a local authority could stipulate conditions and that is a regular occurrence. The individual who examined the planning application originally could discover that a condition had been laid down which adversely affects him or her but it is too late to appeal to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>An example of this could be an application to build a nursing home. The person living beside the proposed development might not have a problem having examined the plans, but if the local authority lays down a stipulation whereby additional car parking must be provided and rezones a green area for that purpose, it might affect the person and he has no right to appeal because he had not objected initially.</P>
      <P>The erection of site notices is another issue which can lead to disagreement. Site notices can be difficult to see. If they are put up in the spring they can be viewed for a short period but then the leaves come out on the trees and they disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>Site notices are written in such a way that one might need binoculars to read them. It is important that there should be controls in respect of such notices. I know the intention is to have them in clear view on the roadside but that <Col N="591" /> is not always the case. This may not be done deliberately but on occasions it is deliberate. The Minister should ensure that signs of a substantial size, perhaps in colour, are placed on sites and that they are protected from the elements. If the site is substantial, a number of different notices could be placed around it. The site could be measured to determine the number of notices required.</P>
      <P>The Minister should also examine the position with regard to notices in the newspapers. Notices should be placed in two newspapers if possible, not just one. In addition, all planning notices should be printed on one page of a newspaper because notices dispersed throughout the paper could result in an individual missing some of them. There should be a regulation that all planning notices in newspapers should appear on one page and under one heading.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the county development plans. Engineers spend months drawing up a county development plan &ndash; in our case it could have taken up to six months &ndash; and going into a lot of issues in great depth. They are experts in the area and good luck to them. They then present the plan to the councillors who have to defend what they have been given. Councillors make some amendments but they do not make any root and branch changes to the plan. The plan then goes back to the planners, slightly adjusted, but it is then called the councillors' plan. It may be the councillors' plan in name but it is the planners' plan which has been slightly amended by the councillors. Conflict can arise subsequently because the councillors make representations on behalf of their constituents but the county development plan is referred to as the councillors' plan, despite the fact that the planners spent months drawing it up.</P>
      <P>Councillors do not have the expertise to change a development plan but they do the best they can with it. There should be a means whereby councillors are involved from the beginning of the process, before the planners put anything on paper. Their views should be obtained on a range of matters before the planners draw up the county development plan. The planners could respond to the councillors' needs or disagree with them but at least the councillors would be involved from the outset.</P>
      <P>Expertise should be made available to councillors because planning is a complex issue which can cause a lot of grief, as we all know only too well. Independent expertise should be available to the elected members when the county development plan is being drawn up and their views should be taken on board and put into planners' language. It is difficult for a councillor to argue every point with planners. Planners often say that this or that should be done and that this or that is good planning, but we may discover subsequently that some of the things they do are not necessary and are not good planning. Often their agenda is to push the boats out further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" /> Everybody in this House wants rural Ireland to survive and for that to happen we need people living in these areas, but planners will examine every angle to ensure planning permission is not granted in a rural area. Planning permissions may be granted, but it is happening less frequently. The time will come when planning permission will not be granted in rural areas without proper sewerage schemes. Permissions will be granted only in the bigger towns and cities. We are a rural nation. People want to live in rural areas and our planners and the system should facilitate that.</P>
    <P>At a time when technology has advanced in most areas to a degree beyond that envisaged 20, 30 or 40 years ago, before man was put on the moon, I cannot understand why an effective and cheap system cannot be developed to treat sewage from a single house in an environmentally friendly manner. I know we have various biocycles but the planners say they are not 100% effective. They were fine when they first came out but in two or three years' time they will not be accepted at all. That is the trend.</P>
    <P>The provision that planning decisions should be made within four weeks, rather than the present two months, is welcome. In speeding up this process, however, problems may be created because of staff shortages. We have seen this in my council where everything is run up to the wire. Planners sometimes only get a chance to examine an application days before the end of the two month period because they do not have the staff. Planners under pressure will make decisions they would not normally make and the first decision they will make will be to put the matter aside for another two months. They will ask a list of questions which will allow them space to complete the planning process.</P>
    <P>One of the first steps the Minister should take is ensure staffing levels in planning departments are examined because there is no doubt that with increasing affluence, the number of planning applications increases. It is a natural consequence of a growth in the economy but it has implications for staff. In Limerick County Council, the planning section and the engineers are understaffed and people who are under pressure cannot be as responsive to the public as we would like. We had a great system at one stage where somebody could come in and have a discussion or send in a map and ask for some advice. That no longer happens in Limerick County Council because the staff do not have the time.</P>
    <P>The Bill is as important to the planners as it is to local government representatives and those applying for planning permission. The decision to hold seminars, which the Minister mentioned, is important. The Minister knows well that those who attended the seminars found them very useful. Even if they gave people reasons to disagree with the Minister, they were a worthwhile exercise. The Department should be congratulated for organising them.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not provide for any democratic reform of the planning system. The system should <Col N="593" /> be more open, more responsive to public needs and more amenable to properly exercised political influence by elected members of local authorities. After all, they are elected by the people to do that job. Planners often resent councillors and believe they are interfering in the planners' role. The councillors' role is to represent their electors in all areas of council business. That should be recognised but in certain circumstances planners do not recognise it. They feel they are a law unto themselves. That is fine for housing, roads, sanitary services and other council areas but not for the planning section.</P>
    <P>The housing provisions in Part V of the Bill are unworkable and any attempt to implement them will further increase the price of houses, not only in the upper end of the market but also in what is now referred to as the &ldquo;affordable housing&rdquo; sector. Adequate resources are needed for local authorities to build houses for rental and purchase and to make sites available at reasonable prices. At present, An Bord Pleanála cannot cope with the volume of appeals. It needs further strengthening because the changes made some time ago are inadequate. The Bill's provisions with regard to the content and objectives of development plans are incomplete. They can be strengthened by making mandatory the provisions that are optional.</P>
    <P>Last week, Members received a worthwhile and comprehensive submission from the Irish Home Builders Association. The document is commendable and the Minister should examine some of its suggestions. It has been said that the Bill's proposals are similar to those which operate in England. The Irish Home Builders Association says this is not true and that the Bill's provisions are rigid and cannot be compared with the English system, in which there is no provision referring land to local authorities at below market value.</P>
    <P>The association goes on to point out that an element of affordable housing should be sought on suitable sites, not arbitrary sites. Indicative targets for specified suitable sites should be set and it should be indicated in plans that it is planned to negotiate with developers for the inclusion of an element of affordable housing on such sites. Affordable housing is also delivered in the UK through bringing vacant houses back into use and by encouraging the conversion of larger homes into more suitable units.</P>
    <P>The economics of provision must be considered. The flexibility and mutually acceptable solutions referred to by the Minister are not reflected in the Bill, according to the association, in so far as all options available are based on the transfer of land, houses or sites at agricultural value. It is their view that Part V will not increase the overall supply of housing, which is its objective, but will reduce the supply of private housing. The expropriation of up to 20% of private land, sites or houses for social housing will reduce the supply of private housing in the market and result <Col N="594" /> in increased prices for the 80% of houses sold in the private market.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to draw the Minister's attention to the contents of the submission. They should be responded to by the Minister in his reply or taken on board on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wade:</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the recently announced national development plan, it is likely that this country will experience unprecedented development in the public and private sectors in the coming years. The introduction of this Bill is timely in that, if speedily implemented, it will pave the way for such development to take place without unnecessary delay and cost.</P>
      <P>Planning law is currently scattered among a series of Acts and it is acknowledged by officials to be cumbersome and confusing. It has been impossible for members of the public and public representatives to maintain an overview of planning legislation. This Bill is welcome because it collates and updates the process in a comprehensive document and is, in effect, a one stop shop for officials, public representatives and the public.</P>
      <P>The Bill also contains some welcome initiatives. I wish to make some observations on the key improvements in the planning process. Part II deals with development plans, providing that all development plans for individual towns and areas are to be co-ordinated to ensure consistent policies for neighbouring areas. This will ensure that all areas are planned fairly with no area receiving more favourable treatment than another. Such co-ordination may extend between different authorities which should eventually lead to consistent planning procedures throughout similar areas of the country.</P>
      <P>At last, due recognition has been given to smaller communities in the form of local area plans which are dealt with extensively in the Bill. In the past development plans were confined to large and urban areas and it is welcome that smaller rural villages, some with a population of less than 500 inhabitants, are given the opportunity to formulate their own plans. This measure is important in giving local people a focus and a chance to contribute to shaping the future of their locality. Such areas fell behind in the past while heavily industrialised areas forged ahead. These areas will benefit now from the economic, physical and social renewal which are the goals of local area plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome Part III which provides for the shortening of the time period available to the planning authority to consider additional information from two months to four weeks. This will impose extra pressure on planning staff who are already overstretched. The Bill should be accompanied by measures to adequately staff local authorities so that it will not be necessary <Col N="595" /> for them to rely on additional information requests to gain more time to consider an application. This is an unfortunate practice which has crept into the planning process in busy local authorities.</P>
    <P>There has always been a facility for a member of the public to inspect planning files but under Part IV of the Bill it will be possible to purchase a hard copy of the permission once the planning authority has made its decision. This gives those appealing a decision the chance to do so on a fair and informed basis. I welcome the fact that such transparency has been ingrained in the Bill. The status of outline planning permissions has been upgraded. Once outline permission has been granted, the planning authority will not be able to refuse planning permission when it is applied for on the basis of matters agreed by the planning authority at the outline stage.</P>
    <P>While the Bill was not perfect in the initial draft, great steps have been taken to iron out any wrinkles that might prevent it from achieving its objectives. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has worked with representatives from all sides and sought to respond to their concerns. As a result of these discussions and his examination of the Bill, the Minister has carefully revised it to its new, improved form.</P>
    <P>After a two year review of Irish planning law, it is the accepted and widespread belief that the Bill represents a genuine effort to reform and update planning laws in a fundamental way. At regional seminars many useful suggestions were taken into consideration. The careful planning of the Bill represents a comprehensive effort to bring about an effective and substantial improvement of planning law.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most crucial section is the commitment to provide social and affordable housing for those in need. As much as one fifth of future housing developments are to be set aside for affordable housing. This strategy requires developers to sell a portion of land zoned for housing to local authorities at existing value which will then be made available for affordable housing. Those eligible for affordable housing are those whose income does not measure up to the cost of a mortgage. This provision is the best way to guarantee housing for all who need it. As the Celtic tiger passes over Ireland, there is no excuse for hard-working citizens to be denied a new home in which to live. The impact of the housing strategy provision reaches beyond merely providing homes for those in need. It is also a method of counteracting social segregation. While the housing strategy may be controversial, it is the most logical way of solving the housing shortage and preparing for future shortages.</P>
    <P>Planning development is another central element to the Bill which introduces a more open procedure for local authority development plans. It will give local communities an opportunity to participate at an early stage. By involving localit<Col N="596" /> ies, a better sense of needs and concerns will be taken into account when policy decisions are made. For example, the same development strategies are not needed in Limerick as in Sligo. Different areas and communities have different needs and the provision responds to this fact. A sense of ownership of development plans should help reduce controversy about them.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives development plans a six-year term and ensures that out of date plans will not be a feature of the future. Progressive action is needed for a progressive future and time and resources cannot be wasted on unnecessary plans. With a greater focus on local authorities, local area plans are to be given statutory recognition, which will allow the development of areas zoned for larger scale new development, and are to be subject to more detailed planning and future local consultation. Local area plans will fill the planning void between the broad objectives of the development plan and individual development proposals. As previously stated, local authorities are in the best position to determine and study the effects of huge scale development.</P>
    <P>The need for a broader, more strategic context for development plans is recognised in the provisions for the strategic planning guidelines at regional level. Statutory recognition will be given to regional guidelines undertaken by regional authorities and this represents a significant empowerment of these authorities. The backbone of the development plan provision is a bridge between the broad objectives of the development plan and actual development proposals. Steps must be taken to ensure that plans meet objectives and the involvement of local and regional authorities provides feedback and insight into the process of such development plans.</P>
    <P>The concept of sustainable development is a primary consideration in all planning decisions and is the underlying principle of the Bill. A wide range of measures is designed to ensure more sustainable development patterns which will take full cognisance of environmental considerations. The concept of sustainable development is dynamic and all-embracing. Thus, a concrete definition would only stifle and limit future development. Sustainable development is an elastic and flexible concept which provides for future needs. We do not have a crystal ball into which we can gaze to see the future. Therefore, we must not erect concrete barriers for future planning and development.</P>
    <P>As we make provisions for future development, we can also assist the present by streamlining the planning system at development and planning levels. By speeding up the processing of planning applications we can prevent the delay of necessary housing, commercial and other developments. Emphasis should also be placed on timely decision making and the tightening up of a number of time limits under existing law.</P>
    <P>A new feature of planning is the provision for strategic development zones which are designed to ensure that sites selected for development are <Col N="597" /> of importance to the national economy. Strategic development zones provide for greater certainty in securing planning permission and about the timeframe for securing it. SDZs are a way of controlling development for the present and future. This is not necessarily a sure death for the Celtic tiger, rather an opportunity to tame the beast before he slips back into the economic jungle.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the protection of existing legislation. It ensures that planning law takes into account other legislative objectives and removes a number of provisions which are now dealt with by other legislation. The Bill includes in full the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, which provides local authorities with the power to protect structures of architectural, cultural and historical importance. It also enables local authorities to control developments affecting the natural environment. The Bill also offers a way for owners or occupiers of land affected by a proposed development to lodge an objection to it. These provisions present the humane face of the Bill by taking more than economic and financial concerns into consideration. The Bill seeks to benefit all Ireland and not just developers and bank books.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Wade for sharing his time. I compliment the Minister, the Minister of State and their officials on the huge volume of work done and the amount of time spent compiling this major and comprehensive legislation. It is timely in the sense that it coincides with the publication of the national development plan. The Bill recognises the need to modernise structures and put in place a streamlined, efficient service to meet the challenges of the future.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that the planning process has gone through a period of dramatic change in the past few years which has been brought about by the dramatic upturn in economic activity which has affected almost every part of Ireland. It is also true that, in putting forward legislation of this nature, it is difficult to devise an overall, national framework which meets the specific needs of different localities. For example, the specific needs of west Clare which has seen a decline in population and a movement of people into towns and cities would be different from those of the cities. Nevertheless, we have proposed the framework which will meet the challenges of the next number of years and which has left open the opportunity to make adjustments where it is felt necessary and desirable to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always believed &ndash; my view is unlikely to change &ndash; that a national planning authority is needed. While the various local authorities with their responsibilities have been to the forefront in this area, it is time we examined the establishment in the long term of a national planning framework which would be applicable to the whole island and which would avoid some of the shortcomings which have bedevilled the existing system for too long. For example, one of the areas with which County Clare has had difficulty, <Col N="598" /> and I think the same applies in many counties, is the constant movement of planners and planning officials between authorities. The county manager for Clare said yesterday that only one individual in the planning office in Clare has about six months' experience in the office. This is the same for many counties. Planners are moving from one authority to another and changing positions often, presumably because there is a shortage of planners generally. There is a need for an overall examination of this and to establish at a future stage a national authority, along the same lines as An Bord Pleanála, to deal with matters at a national level to avoid conflicts arising in different areas.</P>
    <P>There is an attempt in the Bill to deal with some of the problems I have highlighted. To take the Limerick area for instance, there are three authorities, Limerick Corporation, Limerick County Council and Clare County Council. To date these would have operated on their own initiatives in the different areas. Nevertheless, the environs of Limerick, which take in much of County Clare and County Limerick, have stagnated over the past number of years because of the absence of a co-ordinated plan. A few years ago a study undertaken by consultants hired by the authorities tried to sort out where the services would be provided and where the road network and by-passes would be constructed so that there would be uniformity in the way in which these matters could be dealt with. It seemed to me a little ludicrous that each of the three authorities had their own engineers to deal with planning, sanitation and other matters, and that the three were certainly not going in the same direction.</P>
    <P>The Bill attempts to deal with such circumstances in that it provides for taking regional considerations into account in planning decisions. This is evident in the plan adjacent to Dublin city, where Meath County Council and other local authorities have but forward a proposal which is incorporated in this legislation. We need to do the same in many built up areas. I am sure they are doing the same in Cork city and its environs. There is a need to do the same to some extent in Waterford, Kilkenny and Galway. The Bill will endeavour to deal with that.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is dramatic change in every area means that there is a need for legislation which will be capable of responding to the challenges. Local and regional development plans are becoming ever more important and they will take on a greater importance in development. There is an additional, very real reason to develop the provincial areas, that is, to counter the accelerating development in Dublin which is creating imbalances not only here but in regions such as Galway, Limerick, Shannon and Cork. There is a need to tackle this in an efficient and effective way. An efficient and effective planning service will go some of the way towards dealing with the evident shortcomings.</P>
    <P>There has been a shortage of planners and I am sure that can be addressed. It is possible to <Col N="599" /> greatly enhance the number of planners. There is a need to find ways in which much of the detail can be given to administrative assistants in the planning offices which would speed up the service. However, the main complaints I hear from the public in my local authority area relate to the delays and frustration in getting conclusions to what seem to them to be minor decisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been debated at length in the Seanad, but on Committee Stage I would like a closer look taken at section 4, which deals with the exemptions. There are a fairly wide range of exemptions here.</P>

      <P>Some of these are welcome but many of them need to be looked at in more detail. For instance, nothing has created more consternation for communities than the installation of huge sewerage systems nearby. Nothing creates more problems for people than huge agricultural developments, which could be exempted in some respects, taking shape on their back doors without consultation.</P>
      <P>A review of the judicial review system is long overdue. For instance, there is a daft situation in Clare where a £13 million project has been held up having gone through the county council and An Bord Pleanála. There was time given for lodging objections and months after the date for judicial review under the planning Acts had expired, a judicial review is taking place in the courts. People who are employed on that site are being put out of work at the whim of an individual who has no material interest or involvement in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it consolidates much of the planning legislation since 1963. If, as it is claimed, its purpose is to transform the way planning is operated, I welcome it but I have my doubts because of certain of its sections.</P>
      <P>Most people will agree that planning reform is necessary. Too often planning has raised the interest of bodies other than the local authorities for all the wrong reasons. That is a pity. While I am concerned about the negative aspects of various irregularities in planning over the years, which have been drawn to our attention, many organisations, which have contributed to the highlighting of certain aspects, are doing so for the wrong reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past An Taisce has been an impediment to planning. I have been a member of Galway County Council since 1974 and at that time there <Col N="600" /> was a facility, which is not used frequently now, which was abused. Often I cringed at the attitude of my fellow councillors because of the abuse of section 4 to ram through planning permissions against the wishes of the executive and the planners, the professionals who were paid to guide proper planning. For all the wrong reasons, political majorities were used and abused to make sure that planning permission was granted. Bad decisions were made as a result of this attitude. Recently some of them have come back to haunt us in County Galway, where we highlighted the need to have many families relocated as a result of flooding. It was section 4 decisions which forced through planning applications and allowed those people to build in the very areas in which they had been told not to build. The flooding to which I refer has caused problems and it has imposed serious relocation costs on the Government and local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to reconcile one aspect of planning which annoys me. In the local authorities there are many elected members who, as auctioneers or property developers, derive a living from involvement with property. One seldom hears those councillors declare an interest prior to or during a debate on an application in which they have an interest. I would hope that the Bill will include a provision which would put the onus clearly on the elected representative, who has made representations on behalf of an application in which he has a direct interest, to state that he might sell or develop the property at a later stage.</P>
    <P>It would take much of the sleaze out of the planning process if there were some such provision in the Bill. I have not found it, although it could be there. I would appreciate it if we could hear about the provisions in the Bill which would make it imperative for local authority members to come clean, to declare their interests and to take a back seat. Too often, they sit quietly and slip information into a process about which they have prior information. All of us have that information and we appreciate it, but I hate to see it being abused. They get prior notice of the decision of the council which gives an unfavourable advantage in that instance. The Bill does not deal with these small technical issues but it should do so. If we are to restore the confidence of the electorate in the planning process, it is time we dealt with such issues. They may be small matters which are not frequently abused but they can be. It is important to deal with them.</P>
    <P>I am sure other interest groups have made submissions to the Minister prior to the publication of the Bill, including architects, engineers and so on. These submissions should be given credence. It is an important matter when one sees a recommendation from an architectural body suggesting that every council should have an architect in the planning section. One must query the sincerity with which they make that suggestion. It casts doubt on the professionals in place and their adequacy to make proper or reasonably good planning decisions. The Minister has had diffi<Col N="601" /> culty because of the great scope of the Bill and all he has tried to embrace in it. However, it is important, at a time when transparency is required, that we play our cards face up. Only the tribunals will bring out into the open what has gone on. It is important that is done precisely and that those who have been found wanting and who have abused their power and the privileged position in which they found themselves face stringent penalties.</P>
    <P>From time to time, planning issues have been emotive &ndash; when certain decisions were made by local authorities, where huge developments were involved and when lobbying occurs. Lobbying is fine provided pressure is not put on the local representatives, executive or planners, as has happened in the past. There is an onus on people, on whistleblowers, to highlight where this has happened. The developer who uses such tactics should be wiped off the map. The Bill is very weak in this respect.</P>
    <P>A main problem with the planning process is the delay which is caused by two legitimate factors. The first is the inadequacy of the staff and resources available in many local authority. I will give the Minister an example of the increase in the volume of applications received by local authorities. Galway County Council has the second highest number of applications in the country, and that includes Dublin and Cork cities. In 1995, Galway County Council received 2,350 applications, in 1996 it received 3,700, in 1997 it received 4,100, in 1998 it received 4,700 and in 1999 it received 5,500. &ndash; a 250% increase in five years. Resources or additional personnel in proportion to the increase in applications were not made available to Galway County Council. As a result, personnel in the planning section and the executive were under considerable pressure to make decisions.</P>
    <P>While we welcome the Minister's decision to increase personnel and the number of planning officers in the local authorities, it is totally inadequate. If we add to the mix the demands which this Bill places because of the considerable extension of responsibilities in the planning area, there is an urgent need to look at every local authority to assess the professional personnel available in planning sections and the back-up service they have by way of facilities and administrative staff. If the Bill is to be successful, we must do that. It will cost money and will not be cheap, but it must be done.</P>
    <P>I read some of the contributions we, as public representatives, received. The one which caused me the greatest concern was from IBEC. It was extremely frightening in that it said that individual projects should not have to seek planning permission but rather confirmation that if they comply with the agreed planning scheme they can proceed. What is the intention behind that? What vested interest does IBEC have in saying that we should take a function away from the local authority, its executive and members and allow a project to go ahead without going through the plan<Col N="602" /> ning process? I do not know how IBEC will explain that? If it has a viable explanation, I would like to hear it. If IBEC's recommendation had the Minister's ear and was successful, who would be the next group to ask for a free run? I have serious reservations about fast tracking certain aspects of planning. I do not agree that any major industrialist has turned away from this country because of a delay in planning. For that reason, I question seriously IBEC's contribution to the Minister on this issue.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will ensure finance and personnel are made available to the local authorities to allow them to continue the good work which many of them have done down through the years. In the 1998 list of applications to Galway County Council 3,520, the majority of the 4,752 applications, were for private housing, 595 were for domestic extensions, 70 for agricultural buildings and 424 for commercial developments. There were 119 applications in respect of other applications for development and 184 appeals to An Bord Pleanála. There were 15 material contraventions and 500 unauthorised developments. Those figures provide food for thought. I am sure the breakdown of applications in other local authorities is similar.</P>
    <P>A total of only 500 unauthorised developments were investigated by Galway County Council in 1998 because the enforcement section of its planning department does not have the personnel nor the resources to adequately check on developments. When that position prevails for a long time unauthorised developments may become acceptable, but they should never be acceptable. I am not sure if the provisions in the Bill that deal with the pursuance of unauthorised development, where works are carried out contrary to planning conditions or without planning, are strict enough. If they are weak, it is unfair to applicants who are required to follow the legitimate route and put up with the delays involved.</P>
    <P>There is a need to reduce the large number of planning permissions for domestic extensions. Where there is a legitimate reason for a domestic extension, small house extensions should be exempt by way of notification. The current limits, which are totally inadequate, must be increased. I propose an exemption facility similar to that which applies to the agricultural sector. That exemption process is legitimate. I do not propose that applicants should not need to apply for an exemption for a house extension. They should notify the local authority of their request for an exemption. The high number of planning applications for domestic extensions clogs up the planning process unnecessarily. I am talking about cases where there is a legitimate need for an extension which can be proven to a local authority, such as one required to meet the needs of a disabled person. Such applicants should not be required to pursue the long planning process required for other planning applications but should be able to avail of an exemption facility similar to that which applies to the agricultural <Col N="603" /> sector. I hope the Minister of State will consider such a proposal and include it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why An Bord Pleanála is not required to give detailed report why it overturns decisions of its planners. That is not dealt with in the Bill. There must be suspicion why An Bord Pleanála would overturn a decision of its planners. I had hoped Dúchas would not have responsibility for planning. We, in Galway County Council, are forced to refer some planning applications to Dúchas for its blessing. That requirement is not fair.</P>
    <P>In the case of waste disposal a licence must be sought from the EPA. I am upset at present about a rumour, and maybe that is all it is, that the EPA will grant additional tonnage in respect of waste disposal into a landfill site in Ballinasloe without recourse to the local authority by way of application. If that happens, it will be an abuse by another statutory agency which we cannot accept. Henceforth, I hope a restriction will apply to bodies outside the local planning authority and An Bord Pleanála, in respect of such activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady" hpid="Mr. M. Brady Mr. M. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and this opportunity to speak on it. The Bill is an impressive and welcome development for a wide range of people and institutions, including planners and developers, local authorities, public representatives, An Bord Pleanála, those concerned with the preservation of architectural heritage, purchasers of houses in general and, in particular, those on local authority housing lists.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Department are to be complimented on this comprehensive revision and consolidation of our planning law, which will provide a positive legislative framework within which the Government's major initiatives on housing and infrastructure incorporated in the national development plan can be effectively brought to fruition. Of the £40.6 billion expenditure projected in the national development plan, £21 billion or just over 50% will be invested in social and economic infrastructure. This is an average yearly spend of £3 billion, which is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>More than 42,000 houses were completed in 1998, which is a record. The number of planning permissions for housing in 1998 was up 27% on 1997 and continued to grow during 1999. This will ensure continued output growth. Planning guidelines on residential density issued last September will ensure more efficient use of serviced development land, facilitate provision of more affordable housing and promote sustainable development. Local authorities and An Bord Pleanála are required by law to have regard to these guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major expansion of social housing is planned with an expenditure of £6 billion over the next six years compared to £2.4 billion spent over the past six years. The Government's housing and infrastructural programmes in the national plan have received a broad welcome from the construction <Col N="604" /> industry. This positive reaction is exemplified in the recent annual review from Patterson Kempster &amp; Shortall who are reputable commentators as well as practitioners in the industry. They are particularly complimentary about the introduction of multi-annual planning and the positive benefits that brings to the sector. This creates a stable set of parameters within which firms can plan without having to factor in a major risk element relating to possible changes in Government policy.</P>
    <P>The construction sector welcomes the certainty provided by the Government's policies. It can now be further reassured by the provisions of this Bill, which sets out clearly the statutory framework within which business plans can be implemented.</P>
    <P>The measures contained in the Bill designed to streamline the planning system and speed up the processing of planning applications will assist in ensuring that delays to necessary housing developments are minimised. Not only are financial resources being committed to solving housing and infrastructural problems but they are being supported by the commitment of additional human resources.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to staff shortages in planning departments. Additional staff have been provided in local authority planning departments. Staff numbers in planning departments are 14% higher than in 1998, with further increases in the pipeline. The Government is committed to the elimination of obstructions to progress regardless of where they exist.</P>
    <P>Membership of An Bord Pleanála has been increased from six to ten members. It has also received significant additional personnel, with staff numbers up from 70 in 1995, under the rainbow Government, to 105 in 1999. However, a great deal more must be done in this regard. The board's Exchequer grant has almost doubled in the same period. Appeals on all housing and apartment developments involving more than 50 units are being allocated priority status by An Bord Pleanála at all stages. Appeals are also being monitored on a weekly basis by the chief officer and priority is being given to the processing of housing cases.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure, through the creative provisions of the Bill, that this progress is maintained and that no delays are allowed to be attributed to a lack of human or financial resources. The provisions in section 105 which relate to the employment of other than permanent, full-time staff should be availed of in this regard. The section might be amended to enable the employment of staff in a short-term capacity or on a part-time basis.</P>
    <P>The necessity for a comprehensive and integrated range of initiatives to address unfulfilled demand in the housing market &ndash; through measures on house pricing, the removal of constraints and delays to investment, fiscal measures and measures to assist housing affordability &ndash; will be significantly assisted by the passage of the <Col N="605" /> Bill. While not wishing to diminish in any way other important components of the Bill, the statutory framework to be put in place in relation to housing supply is of the utmost importance, particularly to young people. It is a clear indication of the Government's recognition of housing as a continuing priority.</P>
    <P>The commitment to a comprehensive housing policy will maximise housing output and supply and promote affordable housing for all. It will free up land for development through the serviced land initiative which was introduced in 1997. Exchequer funding of £39 million is being provided towards water and sewerage schemes in order to open up land for residential development. Total investment, including local development levies, will come to £100 million.</P>
    <P>The initiative will yield 100,000 sites by the end of this year. Approximately 100 schemes commenced construction in 1999, providing over 60,000 serviced sites. A further 43 schemes are due to commence this year, yielding a further 35,000 sites. That is not a bad achievement. Local authorities are being asked to allow the use of temporary waste water treatment facilities to allow development to commence in advance of permanent facilities. For example, on Dublin's north side this has the potential to bring forward up to 16,000 sites for construction in advance of the completion of the north fringe interceptor sewer in 2002. These measures exemplify the Government's creative approach to resolving planning bottlenecks in the housing development process.</P>
    <P>Local authority housing starts were 4,500 in 1999, the highest since 1986. A multi-annual local authority programme of 22,000 starts of a four year period, 2000-03, will commence this year. The authorities are currently being notified of their starts under the programme. Net local authority need has increased by approximately 40% from 27,400 in 1996 to 39,100 at present. This underlines the urgency of the multi-annual programme and the accelerated social housing programme. The commitment to increase local authority housing stock by an additional 22,000 dwellings to be built over the next four years will have a major impact on disadvantaged areas in particular.</P>
    <P>The various provisions should reinforce and further facilitate planning authorities in major urban areas in their efforts to rapidly develop private and identified surplus State lands through the creation of temporary water and sewerage treatment systems and by the application of the recently announced high density guidelines to rapidly boost housing supply. It is also heartening to see that statutory provision is being made to ensure that planning authorities will be permitted to take the necessary measures to counteract undue segregation in housing between persons of different social backgrounds.</P>
    <P>The continued economic boom, with its associated and inevitable differential impact on incomes, renders positive action on social <Col N="606" /> inclusion and cohesiveness all the more necessary. Planning for socially integrated housing is an important element in promoting this. I trust that planning authorities will learn from their past mistakes in the planning of housing schemes and use the Bill's provisions in a creative fashion which will attempt to remedy past deficiencies and prevent their repetition in the future.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a number of specific issues which are of particular concern to many of my constituents in north-east Dublin. I refer here to the recurring problem of developers making substantial variations to projects in the course of construction or after initial planning permission has been secured. I agree with many of the points made by Deputy Ulick Burke in this regard. People who have an ongoing interest in the nature and content of developments in their general areas are often at a disadvantage to know what is happening, even where legitimate variations occur. I refer to developers who, for example, make planning applications for 46 three bedroom houses, alter it the following week to 60 two bedroom houses and change it again two weeks later to five apartments and a mixture of other dwellings. The general public and councillors are sometimes so confused that they do not know what is happening. This problem must be tackled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady" hpid="Mr. M. Brady Mr. M. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady:</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be helpful if planning authorities used the provisions in section 34 to impose conditions on developers to display public notices on sites where they are engaged in significant variations from the original planning permission and, where appropriate, to publish same in the local or national media on each occasion on which such a variation is made.</P>
      <P>There are continuing problems in many areas with developers failing to complete works on estates in order that they can be taken in charge by local authorities. It is well known that some of these developers are repeat offenders in this regard. Developers who fail to complete estates &ndash; it has taken up to five or six years for some estates on Dublin's north side to be taken in charge by local authorities &ndash; should not obtain planning permission for other developments until they do so. Accordingly, I would welcome an assurance from the Minister that the various provisions in section 34, which enable planning authorities to impose conditions on planning permissions, can be used to refuse, restrict or further delay planning permissions for such offending developers until such work has been carried out to the satisfaction of local authorities, which will allow them to take such developments in charge without delay. It might also be worth considering the practicality and utility of making the persistent disregard of such conditions an offence under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister for his comprehensive and creative approach to the revision of the plan<Col N="607" /> ning code, which is intended to address fully the contemporary problems I have outlined.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>&ndash;recognising the uniqueness of the credit union movement;</P>
      <P>&ndash;acknowledging its work in fostering thrift and providing advice to persons on low incomes in both rural parishes and in urban disadvantaged areas;</P>
      <P>&ndash;appreciative of the efforts of so many volunteers who give freely of their time to the service of credit unions;</P>
      <P>&ndash;conscious of the danger to the ethos and fundamental principles of credit unions posed by the application of an inequitable tax regime;</P>
      <P>deplores the refusal of the Minister for Finance to meet representatives of the Irish League of  Credit Unions, and calls on the Government to amend the Finance Bill, 2000, so that returns on credit union savings are taxed in accordance with the recommendations made by the Chairman of the working group which examined this issue.</P>
      <P>This is another fine mess the Minister for Finance has gotten us into. His refusal to meet the Irish League of Credit Unions for over two years is unprecedented in Irish political history. Because of some imagined slight by the credit union movement, the Minister has gone into a sulk and refused to meet representatives of almost two million depositors in the credit union movement. One can imagine the outrage if he refused to meet the IFA, the GAA, the ICTU or representatives of the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have raised this issue on several occasions in the Dáil and the Minister still refuses to make an appointment to meet the credit union movement. I raised this issue with the Taoiseach at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. The Taoiseach greeted my request with incredulity and promised to rectify the matter. However, the Minister continues to refuse to arrange a meeting and snubbed the <Col N="608" /> Taoiseach in the same way he snubbed the Irish League of Credit Unions. Two weeks ago the Minister refused a similar request by the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn.</P>
    <P>Margaret Thatcher once famously said that she was &ldquo;not for turning&rdquo;. In his dreams, the Minister sometimes thinks he is an Irish Margaret Thatcher, but on this occasion he is confusing petulance with principle. The Government does not appear in a good light when such a large number of respected citizens, who give of their time voluntarily in the service of their communities, are treated with such contempt.</P>
    <P>Thankfully we live in a democratic republic whose citizens are equal before the law. Each citizen has a democratic right of access to those they elect, including access to Ministers. Ministers must be accountable to this House, and in this debate I am asking Dáil Éireann to hold the Minister for Finance accountable and to formally deplore the fact that he has refused to meet representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions.</P>
    <P>After two years of being refused a meeting, one would imagine that credit unions were looking for something extraordinary, but that is not the case. They are looking for a fair and equitable taxation system for their members. This request is supported by Mr. Terence Larkin, chairman of the working group which examined and reported on this issue, officials of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Mr. Martin Sisk, the Registrar of Friendly Societies.</P>
    <P>The credit unions were also supported in principle by the Minister for Finance in the measure he introduced in the Finance Bill, 1998, which he subsequently aborted and to which, either through lack of nerve or lack of interest, or because of the longest fit of pique in the history of Ireland, he has not yet returned. The Minister should take this opportunity to clarify what he has against the Irish League of Credit Unions as nothing on the record can adequately explain his behaviour.</P>
    <P>This motion not only calls on the Minister to return to this issue but asks Dáil Éireann to specifically instruct him to introduce an amendment to the now published Finance Bill which would tax credit unions in accordance with the recommendations made by the chairman of the working group on the taxation of returns on credit union savings. I hope all Members will support the motion.</P>
    <P>The manner in which credit union members are taxed is unfair and inequitable. While the surplus income or profits of credit unions are exempt from corporation tax, dividends and interest on credit union shares or deposits are liable to tax at the members' or depositors' marginal income tax rate which can be 0%, 24% or 44%. On a number of occasions in the House the Minister tried to portray that, because they are not liable for DIRT or corporation tax, credit unions are treated more favourably than other financial institutions. However, this is to miss the point and I remind the Minister that credit unions are not <Col N="609" /> for profit organisations. They are no more than the sum of their members, and when so many of their members are being discriminated against there is no point in pretending that the unions themselves are the beneficiaries of a favourable tax regime.</P>
    <P>The blunt fact remains that depositors in banks and building societies make a full and final settlement with the Revenue Commissioners when the financial institution which holds their deposits has returned DIRT at 24% on the interest they receive. If the deposit is in a special savings account the full liability is discharged at 20%. However, shareholders in credit unions are liable to tax on their interest and dividends up to a rate of 44% and have to make individual returns to the Revenue Commissioners. How can the Minister claim that the tax regime is fair when one group of savers pays tax on its returns at 44% and the other pays tax at 20%? The only difference between the two groups is the type of financial institution in which they deposit their savings.</P>
    <P>All these matters were examined carefully by the working group. The Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners opposed the recommendations made by the chairman, but then that is their job. The Registrar of Friendly Societies, the chairman of the working group, the representatives of the credit unions and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment supported the recommendations.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling that the recommendations were that: the first £375 of a credit union member's dividend income be exempt from tax; any excess of dividends more that £375 up to £750 to be subject to 20% tax; where dividends are more than £750 the entire dividend to be taxed at 20%; all interest on deposits to be taxed at the 20% DIRT rate; and there should be no reporting of dividends or interest by credit unions to the Revenue Commissioners. This motion calls on the House to request the Minister for Finance to amend the Finance Bill to reflect the recommendations of the chairman of the working group.</P>
    <P>In defending his inactivity, the Minister has made great play of the fact that competitors of the credit unions for the public's savings have asked the European Commission to investigate what they describe as the favourable taxation treatment of credit unions by the Irish Government. The Minister knows that the European Union investigated this issue before and in the Finance Bill, 1998, he had no difficulty in getting the agreement of the European Commission to maintain the traditional exemption from corporation tax which the credit union movement has enjoyed since its foundation.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister will use this defence again and will try to frighten credit union members with the prospect of an immediate and terrible war waged by the European Commission on the credit union movement if he introduces a fair and equitable tax regime for its members. The Commission has already decided on this <Col N="610" /> issue and has taken no action since receiving the complaint to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Anyone who thinks that the credit union movement is unique in being exempt from corporation tax should consider the tax treatment of credit unions in other jurisdictions, an issue also considered by the working group. Of five common law jurisdictions &ndash; the UK, the US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia &ndash; the working group reported that in three countries credit unions are exempt from corporation tax and in the other two only investment income and chargeable gains are charged to corporation tax.</P>
    <P>I spoke to officials in Brussels this afternoon and, while they received the basis for a complaint, they have taken no action. They stated that if the complaint is not substantiated within the week, it will be dismissed as an irrelevancy. I know that the Minister will insist in this debate that it is dangerous to do anything with credit unions because the Brussels sword of Damocles is hanging over him. That was the defence he put forward to Deputy Quinn two weeks ago and the defence he has used in this House every time the issue is raised. The Minister should come clean with the House and accept that this is a bogus defence and that the fears he has been expressing about Brussels are unreal. A complaint has been lodged with Brussels but it is on an issue on which Brussels has already adjudicated. The Minister will mislead the House if he runs that line again tonight.</P>
    <P>The position of the Tánaiste on this issue is interesting. Her Department supported the recommendations of the chairman of the working group and correspondence issuing from her Department with her name subscribed has informed individual credit union members that she supports them and that she expects them to be implemented shortly by the Government. The statement by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which is published in the report of the working group, makes as strong a case in favour of the credit unions as any Opposition Deputy could possibly make in this House tonight. It states, <i>inter alia: </i>&ldquo;the present tax regime is clearly unhelpful to the long-term development of the credit union movement, there are a number of substantial reasons why a different taxation regime should apply to credit unions and the credit union movement provides a source of finance for a significant number of persons whose financial needs have been neglected by banks and building societies in the past.&rdquo;  It also states: &ldquo;the service of credit unions is a valuable one in social terms, that a reasonable exemption should be made available on the annual dividend income of individual credit union members and, while acknowledging the reservations of the Department of Finance, it is the case that exemptions and allowances are a feature of many forms of taxation and consequently that an exemption on dividend income should not create any insurmountable difficulties.&rdquo;  The Tánaiste has supported this position in recent correspondence. <Col N="611" /> Where does the Government stand on it when the Tánaiste is taking a different view from the Minister for Finance?</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment also recommends that interest on deposits in credit unions should be liable to DIRT at 20%, which is the preferential rate four points below the standard rate, that dividends on credit union shares up to a value of £375 per annum should be exempt from tax, that dividends above this should be subject to DIRT at 20% and that this would fully discharge the tax liabilities of members.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister speaks to the Tánaiste, but I would have thought that some time in the south of France while nibbling <i>foie gras</i>, sipping the Beaujolais or playfully duck diving in the pool, she might have said, &ldquo;Charlie, will you do something about the credit unions please?&rdquo;  It is difficult to understand the position where the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Tánaiste are on record supporting a change in taxation law along the lines recommended by the chairman of the working group and the Minister for Finance stands firmly on petulance rather than principle and refuses to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the debt of gratitude which many people owe to the credit union movement. I acknowledge in particular the work by the thousands of volunteers who give of their time free of charge in the interest of their neighbours and their community and who over the years have built up the credit union movement to its present strength. Many families know that First Communion, Confirmation and funeral expenses were paid by the credit unions. Many families know they were not acceptable visitors to banks and building societies and that the credit unions lifted them out of the clutches of moneylenders. That should not be forgotten when we vote on this motion.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has jumped on his horse and ridden to rescue the Minister for Finance by tabling an amendment to the motion. It supports the exemption from corporation tax, with which we all agree, &ldquo;endorses the tax treatment of the credit union savings provided for in the Finance Act, 1998&rdquo;, which has been rejected out of hand and which the Minister should know is not a runner, &ldquo;notes that the tax treatment of credit unions has been raised with the European Commission by way of complaint under Treaty competition rules&rdquo;, which put the frighteners on everyone, and finally &ldquo;notes that, as already indicated, the Government will meet without delay with the Credit Union movement and that a date is being set&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I understand this breakthrough has resulted in the Taoiseach arranging a meeting for Thursday week. However, the Minister for Finance has not yet agreed to attend that meeting. Perhaps he will be dragged along to it. It is interesting to note that the amendment states that the &ldquo;Government <Col N="612" /> will meet without delay with the Credit Union movement&rdquo;. It does not state that the Minister for Finance will meet the credit union movement. I would like the Minister to clarify that he will be at that meeting, that this is not a device to get out of parliamentary difficulty with the vote tomorrow night and that this will be a transparent and credible meeting where the issues will be discussed with a view to amending the Finance Bill along the lines of this motion.</P>
    <P>The final part of the Government's amendment calls on the &ldquo;Minister for Finance to take account of these factors in his ongoing consideration of the Report of the Working Group on the Taxation of Returns on Credit Union savings which was established by him in this regard&rdquo;. I ask the Minister to explain his retreat and to what grounds he is now retreating behind the smokescreen of this amendment.</P>
    <P>I recommend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the presence of many credit union members and I compliment them on their unselfish work with no financial reward. I acknowledge Ms Nora Herlihy from a neighbouring constituency, who founded the movement in the early 1950s. The credit union movement has grown from three credit unions in 1959 to 435 at present. It has 1.9 million members, savings of approximately £2.5 billion, deposits of approximately £340 million and loans of up to £2.1 billion. This shows how successful the movement has been. It has done more for rural Ireland than any Government or State institution. Rural Ireland would be in a worse position today but for the credit union movement.</P>
      <P>In the working group set up by the Minister for Finance, it was expected that the Department of Finance would see no reason to change the tax law in favour of credit unions. I have no doubt Department officials were well coached in this approach. The Department felt the contribution of the credit union movement was already recognised by the substantial benefit conferred on it by the current exemption of surplus income from corporation tax.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in its statement to the working group felt that taxing the returns on the savings of many credit union members at the marginal rates of 22% and 44% would not help the long-term development of the credit union movement. It believed there were a number of reasons a different tax regime should apply to credit unions, particularly to credit union shares which provide the source of much credit union lending. It recognised that much of this lending is for small amounts and is of no commercial character. The Department pointed out that it provides a source of finance for a significant number of persons whose financial needs have been neglected by banks and buildings societies in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The service offered by credit unions is a valuable one in social terms. It encourages credit union members to meet their financial needs <Col N="613" /> through regular savings and loans. It offers a viable alternative to dependency on State support or on moneylenders.</P>
    <P>That view was confirmed by the chairman of the working group, Mr. Terence Larkin. He concluded that there was a significant majority view in the group set up by the Minister that the credit unions merited concessionary tax treatment in relation to the return on savings. This tax treatment should be transparent, should be legislated for and should be supported positively by the Government.</P>
    <P>He also mentioned that, in examining the submissions made to the working group, it became clear that there are significant groups in the financial services sector which are critical of the tax treatment of credit unions. These groups are in competition with credit unions and are influenced to an extent by the implications for themselves of the growth in the credit union movement. They made comparisons on purely commercial and financial grounds. Their case ignores the voluntary efforts of local people and credit unions to lift up their communities and areas by fostering thrift and providing financial services and advice to low income groups in rural parishes and disadvantaged urban areas. In many of these areas there are no facilities for financial advice or services and, in the past, the scourge of money lending was common.</P>
    <P>I refer to the Minister's responses to questions asked by Deputy Noonan and me and to a matter raised on the Adjournment by Deputy Quinn. The Minister indicated that he believed the proposals contained in the Finance Act, 1998, substantially met the league's requests. The Minister knows this is only partially true. The league agreed that DIRT should be deducted from credit union dividends and interest but, to protect the small savers, who make up 90% of membership of credit unions, it needed an exemption limit below which there would be no tax liability. This would ensure that people outside the tax net would not end up paying tax. It asked for an exemption on the return from the first £15,000 of shares. Unfortunately, in the Bill the Minister introduced DIRT but did not give the exemption.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced a requirement for credit unions to report members' names and dividend amounts to the Revenue in the same way as interest was reportable until then. The credit union movement did not request this, it requested the imposition of the DIRT system above the exemption threshold. This would have removed a requirement to report members' names and dividends.</P>
    <P>The Minister has accused the credit unions of hanging him out to dry. He has said that several times in response to questions in the Dáil. He feels that he was stabbed in the back by the credit union movement and is now giving credit unions what they asked for. To clear up any misunderstandings, I have a copy of the letter sent to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and programme managers prior to the Minister for Finance's action in <Col N="614" /> 1998. It shows clearly that the credit unions sought to manage the information process in relation to the Dáil and credit unions. Far from working against the Government, the credit unions tried to work with it to minimise any fall-out. The credit unions never received a response to these letters and the Minister failed to take on board the request for an exemption level for credit union shareholders.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also mentioned multiple accounts and tax evasion. The Department of Finance indicated in the report of the working group that the proposals could be open to abuse if members had multiple accounts. This view was reiterated by the Minister in the Dáil on 2 February. The credit union movement took the views of the Department of Finance on board after the publication of the working group's report. In the amendment proposed by Deputy Noonan and me on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, 1999, the credit union movement proposed to tackle this issue through the establishment of a scheme similar to that in operation for special savings accounts. The Irish League of Credit Unions is willing to meet the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners to discuss the practical steps needed to prevent use of multiple accounts for tax evasion. This would be supported by the massive investment now being made by the credit union movement into a computerised system that should be able to identify multiple accounts.</P>
    <P>The credit unions' common bond would also act to limit the danger of abuse through multiple accounts. Very few people hold a common bond with more than one credit union. Credit unions adhere to the money laundering regulations rigidly and it would not be possible for people to falsely claim to be entitled to membership.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that if the existing taxation regime respecting credit unions and their depositors has triggered a complaint to the Commission, any legislation at this stage has the potential to aggravate the position. The complaint to which the Minister refers was made by the Irish Mortgage and Savers Association. It follows a similar complaint from the Irish Bankers Federation, a complaint which the directorate found to be unwarranted. I understand the Irish Mortgage and Savers Association has not responded to DG4 as yet.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Minister to bury his pride before the Taoiseach directs him to do so. The Minister must make his mind up tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Taoiseach does direct the Minister because it is time someone did &ndash; the sooner he is pointed in the right direction the better. I have heard tonight that we must beware of Brussels, that is where the big, bad wolf is. From what the credits unions have told the finance committee, the big, bad wolf is in the Department of Finance and the sooner action is taken the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The credit unions have given a service, mostly <Col N="615" /> on a voluntary basis, to the people. They were not involved in high finance or profiteering, activities many politicians in this House adhered to in the past. These are honest people but the Government is drip feeding them. They want a meeting to set out their stall, not for today but for the future, to guarantee that they will keep this social service going. These organisations must have modern technology to exist and to prevent their being gobbled up by large financial institutions. That is all they ask. That is why Fine Gael has tabled the motion and why the Government has slipped from one gear into another.</P>
    <P>We saw the Tánaiste, who speaks with two voices, do her double act again. I hope the Irish League of Credit Unions will not fall for such propaganda. When the Tánaiste was in Opposition and I was staying across the street in Buswell's Hotel, often on dark nights I would walk across the street only to see the camera lights flashing. I asked Paddy Kelly, the porter, who it was. &ldquo;That is Mary Harney telling the truth to the Irish people&rdquo;, he would said. It is about time she told us the truth because often, when people enter Government, they do not know the difference between truth and propaganda.</P>
    <P>The Minister should forget about the Taoiseach and Tánaiste. He was appointed by this House to do the job of Minister for Finance. It is up to the Minister to get on with it. He should look after these decent people so they can continue the good work they have started. Some of the Minister's own colleagues want him to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that the credit unions are not commercial organisations. The Minister is probably the only one in this House who is not prepared to accept that fact. We are concerned here with what in many parts of the country is regarded as the poor man's bank. It is a movement with a mere 1,500 to 1,600 employees but with 15,000 or 16,000 volunteers. Anybody who suggests that taxes applicable to commercial banks or financial institutions should apply to this movement is making a case that is unsustainable.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, the scourge of moneylending is on the wane because of the credit union movement. It has been the biggest contributing factor to lifting this scourge from many people on this island. The Minister may not recognise this, but the Government recognises it, including the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must be aware of the Kildare Money Advice and Budgeting Service &ndash; its annual report contains a photograph of him. Is he also aware that in its arrangements to assist poor people in debt this service is now one of the main arms of the Government? It is not run by, but supported by the Government. In response to a recent parliamentary question on the issue of <Col N="616" /> money lending, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs stated:</P>
    <P>Strong emphasis is placed on practical, budget based measures that will succeed in removing people permanently from dependence on moneylenders and open up alternative sources of low cost credit through the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>In his reply he goes on to refer to the management committees and community groups, which often include credit union representatives. Will he now accept that the credit union movement is rendering a public service to the people, especially to those who are not well off?</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposed amendment is farcical and the farce is compounded when the amendment, in the name of the Minister, &ldquo;calls on the Minister for Finance&rdquo; to take account of certain factors. That is ridiculous drafting. This aside, the amendment is designed to win the supporters of the Independent Members of the House. It uses the EU situation as a fig leaf to defend the Minister's refusal to meet this national organisation for the past two years. The position with regard to the EU is addressed in the working group report, which refers to the investigation by the EU Commission &ndash; the DG IV investigation &ndash; the decision of which was not available at the time of the publication of the report in February 1999.</P>
    <P>However, when the Minister wrote a personal letter to the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, on 13 April 1999, arising from representations from the Ballydrohane Credit Union, it was clear that the complaint to DG IV had been disposed of. In this letter the Minister states: &ldquo;In addition, there is also an EU dimension which must be carefully examined&rdquo;. He goes on to state: &ldquo;While the EU Commission decided not to regard the exemption as a State aid.&rdquo;. It is clear the complaint had been disposed off by April 1999 and the EU had decided that the exemption would not be regarded as a State aid.</P>
    <P>The Minister's conduct towards a fine, decent organisation is not only regrettable and deplorable but outrageous. He does not have the gumption to admit he is wrong and to offer to meet representatives of the movement to resolve this problem. If he does not do so he should resign.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have put my name to this motion. It recognises the valuable and unique role played by credit unions in our society and calls on the Minister for Finance to recognise and acknowledge the recommendations of the chairman of the working group set up by him. The terms of reference of the group were to examine the taxation of returns on credit union savings bearing in mind the special and unique nature of the credit union movement, its contribution to society and the wider taxation issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 1.9 million Irish citizens are credit union members. The movement is a substantial lobby <Col N="617" /> and it consists of many members who do not see themselves as belonging to a financial institution. Rather, they consider they have joined a local, community run institution which offers help and financial support as they struggle to rear their families and to meet commitments or fund occasions, such as first communions, confirmation, holidays, Christmas, a new car or unexpected financial outlays, which they would be unable to do on a day to day basis.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the movement are to encourage among its members a build-up of savings and thrift, creating a source of credit for the mutual benefit of all members, the training of members in household budgetary matters and the use and control of members' savings for their mutual benefit. Given this latter aspect, business in generally transacted among members only. It is another unique aspect of the movement. Each credit union is generally confined to its local area, from which it accepts members.</P>
    <P>Credit unions are owned by their members and are generally run by them on a voluntary basis. The movement employs approximately 1,500 but, most importantly, these are backed by approximately 16,000 volunteers, 8,000 of whom are directors on a voluntary basis. This is not the case with any other financial institution and is another unique aspect of the movement.</P>
    <P>In his statement and recommendations the chairperson of the working group acknowledges that there is little doubt that the credit union movement is unique in Ireland, and perhaps even in Europe. He goes on to acknowledge the contribution it makes to the well being of the less well off sections of society, even in the remotest parts of the country and in disadvantaged urban areas. However, this uniqueness is not widely recognised and the report emphasises that the case for the credit unions should be made in a stronger fashion by those who occupy seats of power. The chairman also noted that during the course of his meetings with his group, it was apparent that many misunderstandings initially arose because of a lack of knowledge of the reasons credit unions exist and of the benefits they bring to many communities, especially those that are deemed to be unattractive and unworthy of attention by other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to recognise the unique position of the credit unions and to meet their representatives. I hope he will clarify the amendment in his name and in doing so will indicate if he, the Government, its members or representatives &ndash; perhaps even the Taoiseach &ndash; will meet them. Or will it be the Independent Members of the House?</P>

      <P>The House will be aware that in 1997 the most recent Credit Union Act was brought into force. This Act consolidated the legislation which was then in existence in relation to the arrangements for the registration and supervision of credit unions. It also contained a number of provisions in order to permit credit unions to expand their services in the future. The Act allows credit unions to provide, within a proper regulatory framework, financial services on a similar basis to those currently being provided by the financial institutions that are to be found on every main street.</P>
      <P>Contrary to the belief being expressed in some quarters, I have great regard for the very active contribution which the credit union movement has made and continues to make to communities throughout the country. I have great admiration for the dedication, effort and integrity of the army of credit union workers, those who serve in a full-time capacity and those who do so on a voluntary basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that the credit union movement in this country has its origins in the late 1950s and has grown considerably over that time. From an initial three credit unions in 1959 there are currently over 400 credit unions with approximately 1.9 million accounts. The credit union concept was given recognition in statute law in agreed terms in the Credit Union Act, <Col N="619" /> 1966, as a legal person in the nature of an industrial and provident society.</P>
    <P>The question of the taxation arrangements for credit unions and their members did not arise for the first time when I took office as Minister for Finance. The records of my Department show that the league had raised the issue of taxation at a meeting which they requested and which took place with the Department on 17 July 1996. A further meeting was held on 6 December 1996 between the league and my predecessor.</P>
    <P>Since becoming Minister for Finance in the summer of 1997, the Irish League of Credit Unions has made a number of representations to myself and my Department. In December 1997, on foot of a request from the league, I met with them to discuss the taxation treatment of credit unions. Arising from the league's representations at the meeting in December 1997 I included a number of proposals for the tax treatment of credit union shareholdings and deposits in the subsequent Finance Bill, 1998, published on 12 February 1998 as follows, the continuation of the corporation tax exemption as requested by the league, the application of DIRT to credit union deposits at the special savings account rate of 20% as requested by the league and a requirement for credit unions to report to the Revenue Commissioners the dividends that they pay to their members in the same way as interest was reportable up to that point.</P>
    <P>I believed these proposals had gone a long way towards meeting the league's requests. However, it transpired that these measures were unacceptable to the league and its individual members. Consequently, I proceeded to have further discussions with the league in February 1998. I agreed to withdraw these proposals, except for the proposal concerning the corporation tax exemption, and I also agreed to provide an exemption to the credit unions in respect of the reporting requirement for deposit interest.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the House it might be as well to make clear the current tax treatment of credit unions. The income of credit unions, including income from investment activity, is exempt from corporation tax. The exemption was first introduced in 1972 to acknowledge the social purpose and community self-help nature of the credit union movement. Section 58 of the Finance Act, 1998, provided for this exemption to continue after the grant of new powers to the credit union movement in 1997. The section took account of the fact that since 1 October 1997 credit unions are registered under the Credit Union Act, 1997, rather than the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1978. Credit unions are not currently within the deposit interest retention tax scheme and as a result they are not obliged to deduct DIRT from interest or dividends accruing in respect of the savings of their members. However, it would be a mistake to interpret this as meaning that interest and dividends on credit union accounts are free of tax. Credit union <Col N="620" /> members are obliged to report or return interest and dividends on their savings as part of their income for tax purposes and are liable, if their income exceeds the exemption or personal allowance limits, to income tax at their marginal tax rate in respect of that income. These marginal rates are currently 24% and 46%. There is in fact a special box on the standard income tax return where one is expected to declare credit union dividends. There is no requirement in existence for credit unions to report the dividend payments that they make to their members in respect of shareholdings. Since the Finance Act, 1998, there is no longer a requirement on credit unions to report interest payments of any amount to the Revenue Commissioners. Previously, they were subject to a requirement to make a report of interest payments of over £500 in any one year. However, as I have already said, the individual members of credit unions are under an obligation to submit a full report to the Revenue Commissioners on the returns on their savings as part of their income for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>I agreed in February 1998 to establish a working group to examine the issue of the taxation of returns on credit union members savings. The terms of reference of the working group were to examine the taxation of returns on credit union savings bearing in mind the special and particular nature of the credit union movement, their contribution to Irish society and the wider taxation issues involved. The report of the group was presented to me in October 1998. Early last year I made the report available to the public. The group was made up of officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance, as well as representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Registrar of Friendly Societies and an independent chairperson. The group met on seven occasions between May and September 1998, but it failed to agree on a set of findings. However, the chairman made a recommendation that a certain amount of tax free savings for credit union members should be allowed. The chairman's proposals were as follows: the first £375 of credit union members dividend income to be exempt from tax; any excess of dividends over £375 up to £750 to be subject to 20% tax; where dividends are over £750 the entire dividend to be taxed at 20%; all interest on deposits to be taxed at the 20% DIRT rate and no reporting of dividends or interest by credit unions to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>My Department and the Revenue Commissioners did not agree with some of these recommendations. The Department considered that there was no case for any further changes to tax law in order to favour credit unions. The contribution of the credit union movement was already amply recognised by the substantial benefit that was conferred on it by the current exemption from corporation tax which they enjoy in respect of surplus income.</P>
    <P>The Department considered that all interest <Col N="621" /> and dividends which credit union members earn on their savings should be made subject to the DIRT arrangements in the same way as for other financial institutions which are in competition with the credit unions for deposits. This would help to ensure a measure of horizontal equity between individual taxpayers in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>As a member of the working group, the Irish League of Credit Unions proposed a package of measures which it considered should be taken as a whole to address the needs of the credit union movement in what it felt was a reasonable and equitable manner. Its proposed package was a separate tax code for credit union shares whereby the returns from the first £15,000 of shares would be tax exempt and DIRT would be withheld at a rate of 20% from returns on all remaining shares, with 20% DIRT on all credit union deposits.</P>
    <P>In my view, it is difficult to understand why the league pursued their proposal for a £15,000 exemption threshold given that, according to the league's own figures, the average credit union saving in 1998 was £1,583. The information available to the working group shows that only 1,457 account holders or 0.1% had savings with credit unions in excess of £20,000. These figures would seem to indicate that under the league's proposal a significant proportion of share accounts would be completely exempt from taxation.</P>
    <P>Any concessions given to credit union savers would inevitably lead to demands also by corresponding savers with other financial institutions on the grounds of equitable treatment. The cost in DIRT terms of exempting the first £15,000 of savings over all financial institutions could be substantial. This would distort the market for savings at a time when efforts are being made to harmonise the taxation arrangements for products availed of by savers and investors.</P>
    <P>While the league lays much emphasis on the acknowledged social and community role of credit unions, market research provided by the league to the working group indicates that members join credit unions for many of the reasons they open an account with any other deposit-taker. These factors are security, availability of loans, adequate return and that the motivation of credit union philosophy was considerably down the order of ranking. This is not to underestimate the worth of this philosophy or the drive and commitment of credit unions to their locale and community. It simply reflects that persons seek the best return on their savings in many cases.</P>
    <P>I am currently considering the report of the working group. As some commentators have said, given all we have seen and heard on DIRT and tax evasion in recent times&mdash;</P>

      <P>The complaint makes the allegation that the credit union movement in Ireland has benefited from preferential tax treatment by virtue of its exemption from corporation tax and DIRT. The complaint goes on to claim that these measures favour the credit union movement and that they place other credit institutions at a competitive disadvantage. The complaint asserts that this treatment of credit unions in Irish taxation law is contrary to EU law. I understand that the EU Commission is in the course of investigating this complaint.</P>

      <P>While my Department has not been asked, thus far, by the Commission to provide observations on the subject matter of the complaint, such a request from the Commission is expected.</P>
      <P>I am also conscious of the external environment within which we have to frame our overall taxation requirements. As regards the powers of the competition directorate of the European Commission, Deputies will no doubt be aware that Ireland has had to change its taxation code in several respects in recent years as a direct result of rulings and decisions of the directorate and of the EU Commission. For example, we have had to bring in a single low rate of corporation tax across the board so as to conform to EU state aid rules. The system of reliefs for taxpayers who invest in film projects has had to be changed because of objections from the EU Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last December the EU Commission decided to <Col N="623" /> limit the period of eligibility for double rent and rates relief for certain buildings in the Custom House docks area in Dublin. In the Finance Bill, 2000, which was published last Thursday, a number of new tax reliefs were announced, for example, for the new town renewal scheme and for crèches, but these cannot commence until the EU Commission has given its formal approval. In the Finance Act, 1998, I announced the introduction of certain business reliefs for the new urban and rural renewal schemes but these have now had to be changed because they were not in conformity with the relevant EU rules. Whatever our feelings on this, we have to comply with EU rules on this matter. There is nothing to be gained by ignoring this reality.</P>
    <P>The amended motion makes it clear that the Government will review the tax situation of the credit unions after the EU complaint is disposed of. If the existing taxation regime respecting credit unions and their depositors has triggered a complaint to the Commission, obviously any legislative initiative at this stage has the potential to aggravate the situation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach will be meeting the credit union movement shortly and a date for this is being set. I urge the House, in this light, to accept the terms of the amended motion. To pass the Opposition motion to change the law would not be of service to the credit unions.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Fine Gael Party has put down this motion because the credit unions deserve recognition for the great work they do and have done. This gives us an opportunity to debate this motion and the amendment and to show due recognition to the many people involved in the trade union movement. We can truthfully say that we have great respect for credit unions and the work they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to focus on Dublin South-Central, my constituency &ndash; I have the constituents' greatest interests at heart. Economically, Dublin South-Central is the most deprived area. If one overlays the data available by the CSO from the last census of the socio-economic groupings in a digitised mapping format and overlays that onto a map of Ireland, which I have done, one will see that Dublin South-Central is the blackest area. I would like more Members of both Houses to recognise that. I see that Deputy Upton, who also represents Dublin South-Central, is here. Together we work very hard for the constituency, which is in need of much development and is recognised as an economically deprived area. Not only is it economically deprived but the banks have taken an attitude towards it that they do not want to have anything to do with it. It is not too long ago since one of the branches of a bank in Kimmage was closed, last year a bank in Thomas Street was <Col N="624" /> closed and only recently a bank in Ballyfermot was closed. The services are not being provided to the people who are economically deprived in Dublin South-Central and I am sure that mirrors what is happening throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The treasury in the United States, the equivalent of the Revenue Commissioners, stated on 24 December 1997 that the most important difference between the credit unions and other depository institutions, namely, banks and building societies, is that they have a public purpose to &ldquo;promote thrift among their members and create a source of credit for people of small means.&rdquo; I wish the Revenue took it to heart that credit unions exist not only for the purpose of generating interest upon which tax can be paid but their primary purpose is to promote thrift and create a source of credit for people with low means. I understand the Revenue's position. Its job is to collect tax on all earned income, but the credit unions have a special case.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer particularly to the volunteers in the credit union movement, many of whom are in the public gallery. Some are my guests and I recognise their voluntary work. I quote an American source:</P>
    <P>Another difference between credit unions and banks is volunteers. Quite frankly, its hard to find them at banks. At credit unions, however, they're plentiful. The boards of directors are volunteers, as is the supervisory committee that oversee the activities of the credit union with respect to risk management.</P>
    <P>Not only do volunteers work for as long as they are needed, vast improvements have been made to the buildings which house credit unions. Walkinstown, Sundrive Road, Crumlin and Drimnagh credit unions have been newly built or vastly renovated in recent years. I surfed the Internet earlier and visited Drimnagh credit union's website, which sets out the various services it provides to the many people in Drimnagh who are not acceptable to or wanted by other banks. I am delighted it is at the leading edge of banking technology. The Internet is a great device.</P>

      <P>There were 430 credit unions in Ireland at the time with a total membership of 1.85 million and assets totalling £2.2 billion. Of the total membership 1.83 million held savings of less than £10,000, and their average savings was £1,070. The Minister referred to those with savings of £20,000 and £40,000, but less than 2,000 <Col N="625" /> had savings in excess of £20,000. The credit union movement works with the small saver.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh:</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague is of the same mind as me on this. We want to encourage people to save in a co-operative manner. The credit union allows almost two million people to save small amounts on a weekly basis at times that suit them. That is not the case with banks.</P>
      <P>I estimate that 90 per cent of my constituents are members of credit unions. Savings and loans are used for house improvements, family events, such as births, deaths and weddings, and travel. Jack Charlton was followed on the back of the credit union movement. People who have savings in excess of £10,000 should pay a graduated tax. If people have savings of more than £20,000 they can afford to pay the small amount of tax that is normally due. I visited the credit unions in my constituency and asked them whether they had savers with more than £40,000. None of them had and only 68 credit unions in Ireland have members whose savings are in excess of this figure.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated at the end of his contribution that an official of the EU competition directorate is due to begin a formal investigation to determine whether the credit union movement has received favourable tax treatment from the State. This has resulted from a complaint lodged by &ldquo;institutions or organisations&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Credit unions deserve special treatment. US banks made a similar complaint against the credit union movement in 1997 and President Clinton signed a Bill into law in 1998 which protects credit unions. The banks lost and the credit unions won.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A battle is being fought currently and if, as the Minister said, precipitative legislation is introduced and railroaded through the House, the European Commission will have no option but to say that due process was not followed in Ireland and it will throw out whatever hope the credit unions have of receiving the treatment to which <Col N="626" /> they are entitled because of the service they give to the public.</P>
    <P>The Revenue has raised the question of account splitting where a number of relatives hold separate accounts containing £10,000. The bona fides of volunteer credit union workers with whom I am familiar will ensure that they will work in every way to make sure that does not happen. They would not be associated with anything that might happen in that regard.</P>
    <P>I spent the past year, along with colleagues from all parties, working on the Committee of Public Accounts sub-committee on certain revenue matters, and we discussed the question of DIRT on deposit accounts. However, we cannot decide to do something which would undermine all the good work of that sub-committee in trying to establish a system that is transparent and accountable and under which everybody will receive equitable treatment under our tax regime.</P>
    <P>All of us are on the side of the credit union movement. The Bill that was introduced in the US was passed by 92 votes to six. Similar figures would apply in this House if the Bill were drafted in a reasonable, methodical manner that would not undermine the work of Government or that of credit unions in Europe generally. There is no point saying that all savings under £375 per annum will be tax free. It is important that we all consider this matter in a level headed way and ensure that over time, the credit unions and their members get the favourable tax treatment that movement deserves.</P>

I heard Deputy Healy-Rae on the radio at lunch time today painting a truly appalling vista of a rampaging 'flu in the corridors of power and I got the notion that, certainly at any time since Deputy Healy-Rae became aware of this over the past two or three months, everybody in the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance was afflicted with this 'flu in such a way as they could not possibly meet members of the credit union movement lest they be contaminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may find they are more than he thinks, but it is a relief to see him here this evening in such good health. Deputy Healy-Rae is nobody's fool and he should not try to take the rest of the Members of the House for fools either. It is about time Deputy Healy-Rae put his vote where his mouth is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate this evening is about two things. It <Col N="627" /> is about how we deal with credit union savings and dividends, but it is also about the extraordinary and arrogant behaviour of the Minister for Finance, not just over the past two months since Deputy Healy-Rae became aware of the issue but over the past two years, since the 1998 Finance Bill, in dealing with the issue and in refusing to meet the League of Credit Unions.</P>
    <P>It is important that we approach the issue with a serious appreciation of the reality. In theory, dividend income on credit union shares is no different from any other kind of dividend income. The recipient is obliged to make an annual declaration to the Revenue and the dividend income is then subject to income tax at the marginal rate that applies to that individual, whether that is 22% or 24%, 44% or 46%. However, the majority of people do not declare dividend income on credit union shares for income tax purposes. In truth, many people probably do not know that they are meant to declare that income in the first place. I acknowledge that the League of Credit Unions has made efforts in recent years to make people aware of their obligations but the reality, and we do ourselves no favour by ignoring it, is that most people do not return their dividend income in that way.</P>
    <P>For some years now, Governments of various parties have suggested that they want to put things on a reasonable basis that would improve the level of compliance while recognising the special position of credit unions in society. The 1998 Finance Bill, when published, gave the credit unions some of what they wanted but also contained proposals about which they were not happy. I will not go into the rest of what happened then. We know the Minister agreed to set up the working party, the working party made recommendations and some specific proposals are included in that. It is important to acknowledge, and I do, that officials from the Department of Finance and the Revenue dissented from that report.</P>
    <P>The least we might have expected was that the Minister would give some response. Surely it was and still is reasonable to expect him to say whether he agrees with the proposals. He still has not said so here this evening. Surely it is not unreasonable to ask him to indicate whether he intends to do anything on foot of the report. It is hardly unfair to ask him if he agreed with his officials who made it impossible for the working group to produce a consensus report. Deputy McCreevy has not done any of this. Instead, we have been treated, time and time again, to the supercilious repetition of something which is clearly untrue. We are told that the Minister is considering the report and that he is prevented from taking action by the possibility that the European Commission might impose corporation tax on foot of a complaint that has been made on the surpluses of credit unions.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister is considering the report. He has long since decided that he intends <Col N="628" /> to do nothing at all about the credit unions for the rest of his time in office. This Minister is not slow to wash his hands of the views expressed by officials on his behalf but in this instance the officials were doing just that. They were representing the views of the Minister and that view is very simple: credit unions are just the same as other financial institutions. Everything the Minister has done and said flows from that basic misunderstanding of what credit unions really are. The Minister clearly believes that he was hard done by in 1998. Perhaps he was hard done by, by his party colleagues who are noticeable, incidentally, by their absence here this evening, but in any event that was two years ago and it is now high time the Minster emerged from his sulk and looked again at what is a very serious issue.</P>
    <P>Before I go into the merits of this case I will deal with the second element of the Minister's mantra. He said he cannot deal with the issue of interest on dividends for fear that it might provoke the Commission into imposing corporation tax. This is nonsense. The issue of the corporation tax exemption will fall or stand on its own merits. The reason for the exemption is that all previous Governments have accepted that credit unions are not profit-making institutions as such and that their surpluses should not be treated as profit for tax purposes. In the past, the European Commission has accepted this argument and there is not any reason to presume that it is about to change its mind. In any event, the corporation tax issue is distinct in itself. I do not see that a determination on the issue of corporation tax would be adversely affected by the tax treatment of savings in the hands of credit union members. The two issues are separate and distinct and should be treated as such.</P>
    <P>I have relatively limited time available to me so I will not repeat what others have said about the special position of credit unions in any great detail, but there are a number of distinctive features which make them different and perhaps it is worth mentioning them briefly. Credit unions are democratically controlled. They are now one of the few types of mutual institutions remaining in this country. They do not have clients. They do not have customers. They have members who must share a common bond, whether it is their place of work, where they live or whatever. They are largely operated by volunteers rather than paid individuals but, most importantly, they are not for profit institutions and there are statutory limits on what they can and cannot do.</P>
    <P>The most telling comment from the Minister this evening was when he talked about how treating the credit unions in a particular way would &ldquo;distort the market for savings&rdquo;. It is interesting that he should say this at a time when many credit unions are beginning to re-examine the sort of interest they give people on their dividends. They do not want to attract too much savings; they want to lend to people to help them buy things they would not otherwise be able to purchase. Most importantly in terms of distinguishing credit <Col N="629" /> unions from the banks, of which Deputy Ardagh spoke so eloquently earlier, is the demographic breakdown of the people who are members of credit unions. There is no doubt that they provide a service to people and in areas where the services of the banks are not as readily available as perhaps they should be. It is noteworthy that 40% of credit union members do not have a tax liability of any kind in the first instance. All of this is a persuasive case for dealing with credit unions in a way that is preferential but also fair in all the circumstances. It is worth pointing out that the loss of revenue to the Exchequer would be minimal. It is possible that the tax from credit union savings would increase since we all acknowledge that the level of non-compliance with the existing arrangements is almost certainly very high. The maximum tax foregone from any one taxpayer would be 44% of £375 or just £165. The maximum foregone in the case of somebody who pays tax at the standard rate of income tax would be half of that amount.</P>
    <P>Normally this Minister is greatly taken by the concept of self-financing tax cuts and I can only conclude that in this instance he is refusing to co-operate as a result of what is just a silly fit of pique. I have stated from the start that the working group report is a reasonable compromise and that the Labour Party endorses it as such. We tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill last year and the year before last to that effect. I stress the word &ldquo;compromise&rdquo;. The credit union movement has voluntarily agreed to treat deposits in the same way that deposits in financial institutions are treated. Their central case is that shares in credit unions are not the same as shares in any other company. That case is persuasive and it is therefore reasonable to treat the return on those shares in a way that acknowledges that difference.</P>
    <P>Nobody, least of all the credit union movement, wants to see credit unions used as a means of evading tax. I am fully persuaded, from the contacts I have had with the credit union movement, that it is aware of that possibility. Everybody acknowledges that effective measures must be taken to ensure there are not multiple accounts. I am persuaded of the <i>bona fides</i> of the League of Credit Unions when it says it has put in place the necessary information technology and that it has the will to ensure it does not happen. It is also important to ensure that when the exemption is taken into account the tax of 20%, whether it is called DIRT or a withholding tax, is levied. There must be a mechanism whereby the credit unions deduct DIRT or operate a withholding tax on the dividends above the agreed exemption limit.</P>
    <P>It is time this issue was finally dealt with and for the bluster and prevarication to stop. This issue, which affects nearly half the Irish population, must be tackled with the seriousness it deserves.</P>

Hopefully, that facility will always be available to me.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this debate is to enable Members to apply maximum pressure on the Government to acknowledge the role and contribution of the credit union movement. It is a movement with 536 credit unions throughout the country, a membership of 2.1 million people, 16,000 volunteers and 2,000 employees. The fact that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has refused, despite numerous requests over the past two years, to meet the Irish League of Credit Unions to discuss the implementation of the report of the working group on the taxation of returns on credit union savings is an utter scandal. Do any of the credit union members in the Public Gallery this evening or throughout the country seriously believe that the Minister would refuse to meet the Irish Bankers Federation, the GAA, ICTU, IBEC, the Irish Horseracing Authority or the Turf Club&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;for whom he is currently proposing a £50 million carrot to facilitate a merger of the horse racing fraternity? Furthermore, according to media reports, the Minister intends to have these proposals included in the Finance Bill, 2001. This is in complete contrast to the manner in which the Minister has treated the credit unions and their exclusion from the Finance Bill published last week.</P>
      <P>Last month a shocking report by the Director of Consumer Affairs, Ms Carmel Foley, highlighted the extortionate interest rates legal moneylenders are charging for credit. Unfortunate families caught in the net are expected to pay interest rates of up to 197% for relatively small loans. Unfortunately, the report did not mention the activities and sinister practices of illegal moneylenders and the appalling pressure they place on families living in poverty. However, the stark reality of life for thousands of families was laid bare in that report.</P>
      <P>The credit union movement knows this reality. It prevents thousands of families from falling into the trap of moneylenders every year. It provides a magnificent example of people working to produce real results in their communities. Credit unions assist families in budgeting, availing of credit and with a wide range of other services, including MABS. They play a vital role in every community and parish throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague and party leader, Deputy Quinn, raised this matter on the Adjournment on 2 February last. He highlighted the obduracy of the Minister for Finance and urged him to grow up and to meet the credit unions. His sensible words fell on deaf ears a fortnight ago and the credit <Col N="631" /> union movement remains locked out at the behest of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Nobody is suggesting that the issue of credit union taxation is not complex. However, what is beyond belief is how this Government can intend to address the matter if it is not engaged in discussions with the credit union movement. It is a ridiculous way to develop policy and a stance which insults nearly two million credit union members.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the attitude of the EU to certain recommendations. One of the original founders of the credit union movement in Ireland, John Hume MEP, has stated that any concerns within the EU can be overcome. It is unacceptable that a Minister for Finance will be dictated to by bureaucrats in Brussels without a fight, especially when he has justice on his side. Over the years other Ministers, particularly Ministers for Agriculture, have fought the system in Europe on behalf of Irish farmers. It is the obligation of the Minister for Finance to fight and campaign for the credit union movement and its members. If he is not prepared to do this job, he should move aside and allow the Members on this side of the House to take up the cudgels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <P>The first point I wish to make, which was correctly addressed by Deputy Noonan, is with regard to the suggestion that due to a complaint having been lodged with the European Commission, the Government cannot accept this motion. Deputy Noonan correctly described this as a fig leaf. If this were the case, how would it be possible to proceed with the Planning and Development Bill or the Wildlife Bill or several other Bills when up to 40 complaints have been lodged in Europe against Ireland? The suggestion has no basis in fact. If a complaint being lodged in Europe had such an effect, any legislature in any member state would be precluded from action. It is not true.</P>
      <P>I can give the House another example. The Minister says the complaint has been made &ndash; we know it was made by the banks &ndash; to Commissioner Monti in DG4. It is arguable whether this is within the competence of DG4. It is probably arguable in European law that the matter should be considered in the social affairs directorate. It is also true that Commissioner Monti is negligent, for example, in the matter the Minister for Finance raised with regard to introducing a regime for film. He failed to introduce a solemnly promised directive in relation to concentration of ownership in the media. It is not true that any suggestion of that nature to DG4 affected, at least when I was Minister with responsibility for film, anything in relation to the film industry. I stress this point to demonstrate that the fig leaf has no basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of St. Anthony's Credit Union since 1968. When one heard about the credit union movement in the west of Ireland, it was always after the most appalling stories about <Col N="632" /> moneylenders, how they had been removed and how the credit union movement's efforts were sought to help people in crisis. Let us call a spade a spade. If there are places where the banks would not open branches, there are clients of the same banks who would not be seen dead going into a credit union. They are depositors in banks which have behaved disgracefully. Now the Minister for Finance would like to visit on the credit union movement the sins of the banks. That is outrageous.</P>
    <P>The credit union movement has always spoken about membership, community, fraternity and solidarity. I never heard those words spoken in a bank. The credit unions are not the same as the banks and there is a difference between membership and clients. There is a difference between the person who arrives with a speculative deposit and the person who arrives with his or her savings. If the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance had their people on all the commissions which have been established, something they did to consistently block the film industry, we would not have had a successful outcome to any commission. It is time to vindicate the proposals of the chairman of the commission and for the people on this side of the House who make worthy speeches to think between now and 8.30 p.m. tomorrow and to vote against the banks and in favour of the credit union movement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this human rights abuse case. The case of Andrei Babitsky is a cause of grave concern. Nearly a month after he was first captured by Russian soldiers, his whereabouts are still shrouded in mystery. His story entails an abuse of human rights, the patent flouting of the Geneva Convention and an attack on the principle of a free press.</P>
      <P>Andrei Babitsky is from Moscow and has reported on the ongoing war in Chechnya for Radio Free Europe. Russian military authorities, as is the way of major military powers the world over, have tried to severely restrict and censor reporting of the Chechen conflict. Controlling coverage of the war has become another weapon in the conflict. Andrei Babitsky did not adhere to the strict rules laid down by the Russian authorities. His reporting from Grozny as the city suffered constant artillery bombardment from the Russian forces was a severe source of embarrassment. His reports contradicted the official line on the war propagated by Moscow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time after 16 January last, Andrei Babitsky was arrested by the Russian authorities under a law on the prevention of vagabondism and beggary. He was denied access to a lawyer and <Col N="633" /> prevented from phoning his wife and family. The family's apartment in Moscow was also raided. On 3 February a chilling video showing Mr. Babitsky being handed over to a group of armed and masked men was released by the Russians. They claimed to have swapped Mr. Babitsky for a number of Russian soldiers captured by Chechen rebels. The veracity of this account is questioned by a number of informed observers.</P>
    <P>If Mr. Babitsky was handed over to Chechen rebels, this is a flagrant breach of Article 3 and Protocol 2 of the Geneva Convention, 1949, an issue that the Human Rights Watch organisation has taken up with Acting President Putin. If the supposed hand-over was staged, the consequences for Mr. Babitsky and his family may be even more sinister. Whatever the truth of the matter, Mr. Babitsky's whereabouts still remain uncertain.</P>
    <P>A number of news organisations and journalists have highlighted the case of Andrei Babitsky, most notably Séamus Martin in <i>The Irish Times</i>. It is a case which raises concerns about respect for human rights and press freedom in the Russian Federation. It also raises serious questions about the conduct of the war in Chechnya and the seemingly feeble response of the international community to this tragedy. The Government cannot shirk its responsibility to defend human rights. The case of Mr. Babitsky should be raised with the Russian Government at EU and bilateral level. The Government should also have the courage and commitment to demand an investigation into other serious allegations of human rights abuses in Chechnya. These investigations have been demanded by, among others, Amnesty International, the Glasnost Foundation and the European Commission.</P>
    <P>At this critical time in the development of the Russian Federation, it is vital that the international community makes it abundantly clear that abuse of both human rights and binding international agreements will not be tolerated. Opposition must also be voiced to the ruthless militarism which has characterised Russia's policy towards the breakaway state of Chechnya. Grozny has been razed to the ground, tens of thousands of people have been displaced and thousands have died in the conflict. Russia is intent on securing the total military subjugation of the territory, an objective which has failed before. Ireland and the European Union must demand an end to this policy of barbarism and militarism. A negotiated settlement to the war is the only hope for the region and the carnage must stop. I look forward to the Minister's reply on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and apologise for the absence of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, who is otherwise engaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is deeply concerned about the fate of the Russian journalist, Mr. Andrei <Col N="634" /> Babitsky, who was working with Radio Free Europe in Chechnya. Mr. Babitsky was reportedly handed over by Russian forces to an alleged Chechen rebel unit in exchange for a number of Russian soldiers. This case raises serious concerns about Russia's compliance with its obligations in the field of international human rights.</P>
    <P>The Government stresses that a free media is a cornerstone of democracy. Any undue interference with the work of journalists, including their arrest or exchange for prisoners, even with their consent, is incompatible with the rights of a free press. Our deep concerns have been conveyed in the strongest terms at bilateral level by our ambassador in Moscow.</P>
    <P>The case of Andrei Babitsky is the latest in a series of allegations of human rights abuses committed by both sides during the Chechen conflict. It comes at a time when concern is also mounting at reports of summary executions by Russian soldiers and other horrific crimes. The international organisations, including the European Union, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, have voiced their serious concern at these cases. They have been active for some time in stressing to the Russian authorities in high level <i>démarches</i> the need for a full investigation of all these allegations.</P>
    <P>Andrei Babitsky disappeared in Chechnya on 15 January. On 28 January Russian federal authorities confirmed holding Mr. Babitsky in detention, claiming that he was lacking proper accreditation for work in Chechnya. On 4 February Russian television broadcast a videotape showing Mr. Babitsky being handed over by Russian military to an alleged Chechen rebel unit in exchange for five Russian soldiers. The reported exchange, said to have taken place on 3 February, was later confirmed by a Russian Government spokesman, who also claimed it had been carried out with Mr. Babitsky's consent. The spokesman added that, with the exchange, Russian authorities could no longer be considered responsible for Mr. Babitsky's personal safety. The Chechens have denied the exchange. The whereabouts of Mr. Babitsky are unknown.</P>
    <P>The gravity of this case has been stressed by the Council of Europe and the OSCE. The EU's profound concerns about the fate of Mr. Babitsky were expressed to the Russian authorities at a political directors troika meeting in Lisbon on 4 February. Ireland also strongly supported an EU <i>démarche</i> to the Russian authorities in Moscow on Friday, 11 February. The <i>démarche</i> was made by the EU troika to the Russian Government's press and information director with specific responsibility for Chechnya. The troika expressed its serious concern regarding a number of issues connected to Mr. Babitsky's case, in particular freedom of the press and freedom of speech in Russia; the legal and factual aspects of Mr. Babitsky's detention which seems to have lasted longer than is permitted by law and the denial of basic rights such as being able to communicate with his family and being assisted by a lawyer; and several conflicting explanations by the Russian auth<Col N="635" /> orities as to Mr. Babitsky's fate which give rise to doubts about what really happened. The announcement that he was handed over to Chechens in exchange for a number of Russian soldiers calls into question Russia's compliance with its international obligations in the field of human rights. In response to the EU <i>démarche</i>, the Russian authorities said that they had already simplified the accreditation process for the north Caucasus region and that 286 journalists had received accreditation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the situation of Mr. Babitsky, the Russian side promised that &ldquo;within two days&rdquo; information on the legal aspects of the case would be made available to EU embassies in Moscow. This is still awaited. Concern for Mr. Babitsky's safety has increased due to his failure to contact his wife or his lawyer several days after his reported transfer into Chechen custody. Russia has also failed to produce the soldiers allegedly exchanged for him.</P>
    <P>EU Foreign Ministers, meeting in the General Affairs Council in Brussels yesterday, again stressed the EU's concern regarding Mr. Babitsky's fate. Acting President Putin said earlier today that he has instructed the Russian security services to &ldquo;guarantee life and freedom&rdquo; to Mr. Babitsky. The Russian Interior Minister had previously claimed that Mr. Babitsky &ldquo;is alive and well and is where he wants to be&rdquo;, but there is no evidence for this.</P>
    <P>Many see Russia's actions in Chechnya as a test of the functioning of democracy in the new Russia. The Russian authorities for their part have sought to assure domestic opinion and international critics that they are maintaining the democratic principles and values to which they are committed. The Government will use every opportunity, both bilaterally, within the EU, in the Council of Europe and at the OSCE, to hold Russia to its commitments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, thank you for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. It is disappointing to hear that Ballinasloe swimming pool is to remain closed for at least three months following damage caused to its roof by high winds a week ago. A consultant engineer has carried out an inspection of the pool on behalf of Ballinasloe Urban District Council and the report is available &ndash; perhaps the Minister has that report. I understand there are serious safety implications for Ballinasloe UDC because of the condition of the pool. Irrespective of the consultant's report, the local engineer stated that the pool will remain closed for at least three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ballinasloe swimming pool opened in 1972 and approximately 100,000 people use it annually. It is very popular with school children, many of whom are involved in local and national competitions. The closure is disappointing for everyone <Col N="636" /> who uses the pool, including me, &ndash; I use the pool as often as I can &ndash; but it is particularly disappointing for those swimmers who train for national competitions. The pool, as the Minister will be aware, was used to launch the Connacht special olympics. Indeed, I would hope that Ballinasloe could be used as a centre when Ireland hosts the Special Olympics.</P>
    <P>Last year when the issue of swimming pools was debated in the Dáil, I mentioned in particular the case for a new pool at Loughrea and refurbishment of the pools at Ballinasloe and Tuam, and the Ballinasloe pool was put on a list for refurbishment under a public private partnership proposal. I would like to know the present position in that regard.</P>
    <P>In 1993, a study carried out on the future development of Ballinasloe swimming pool highlighted certain defects in the building, including the condition of the roof. The report stated that the existing steel work was corroding with rust and that it must be replaced. I have heard figures of £378,000 and £650,000 suggested to carry out the necessary refurbishment to keep the pool in operation without providing any new amenities. In fact, it was estimated in 1993 that to provide additional facilities, such as a children's pool, fitness suite and an aerobics gym, would cost £1.1 million. Perhaps the Minister can give us some detail on a new public private partnership arrangement for a new pool at Ballinasloe. The people of Ballinasloe are most anxious to have the existing pool re-opened.</P>
    <P>Swimming is one of the best ways to keep fit and this is one of the reasons adult clubs also use the swimming pool, particularly women's groups and organisations like Macra na Feirme. There is provision for special olympic facilities on Sunday mornings also and the pool serves the people of south Roscommon and east Galway as well as the local people.</P>
    <P>I call for action on Ballinasloe swimming pool. If matters are left in limbo, it will be more difficult to re-open the pool and that will be very disappointing for the people who use it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Michael Kitt for raising this important issue on the Adjournment. I am sorry to hear of the damage sustained by the swimming pool operated by Ballinasloe Urban District Council during the recent storms, which has necessitated the closure of the pool for safety reasons. I understand that a status report on the pool in Ballinasloe is to be considered by the members of the council this week. No doubt they will also give consideration to the options open to them under the local authority swimming pool programme, responsibility for the administration of which transferred to my Department from the Department of Environment and Local Government in 1998. Under the programme grants of up to 100% of the approved cost of refurbishing existing local authority swimming pools are available, as are grants of up to 80% of the approved cost of new swimming pools, with the remainder <Col N="637" /> of the cost in that case being funded by local contribution.</P>
      <P>In the past ten years, the number of indoor hotel clubs in Ireland has more than doubled. In addition, there has been an increase over the past three years in the provision of private stand alone leisure clubs throughout the country. The lack of quality public swimming facilities, despite a steady stream of investment in their refurbishment over the years, is considered to be one of the main reasons for the increase in private facilities. In general, adult markets are more affluent today. People enjoy a higher standard of living and, consequently, have more disposable income available for sports and leisure activities. Increasingly, customer expectations of the standard of facility on offer are higher also.</P>
      <P>The type, level and quality of public swimming pool facilities which was provided and accepted in the 1970s and 1980s are no longer acceptable as we enter a new millennium. Local authority pools must now compete with private facilities and must provide additional health and fitness facilities over and above a basic pool to be viable and successful ventures. Where new public pools have been provided in recent years, the improvement in quality and the actual facilities available has been significant, and these have become the minimum standard for the future.</P>
      <P>On taking over responsibility for the local authority swimming pool programme, it became clear to me that a considerable investment would be required in order to update a number of the existing local authority pools and to provide attractive, competitive and viable public facilities. With this in mind, I had the Institute of Leisure and Amenity Management commissioned to conduct an analysis of the condition of local authority swimming pools. ILAM identified upwards of 30 pools, including the UDC pool at Ballinasloe, constructed between 1966 and 1981 and in varying degrees of disrepair in need of major refurbishment. In this context, I was pleased last year to secure an increase in funding of £36 million over three years for the swimming pool programme &ndash; from £3 million last year to £15 million for this year and the next two years. A total of £45 million will be spent over the next three years.</P>
      <P>During this period, £10 million per year will be available in grant aid for the refurbishment of existing pools and a further £5 million will go towards the construction costs of new pools. Anxious to accelerate the refurbishment of the older stock of swimming pools, in particular, I invited proposals from the local authorities responsible for the pools identified by ILAM, for consideration under the newly expanded swimming pool programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time, Ballinasloe UDC had a refurbishment proposal with my Department already. Indeed, it had been given the go ahead to appoint an architect in connection with the replacement of the roof at the swimming pool, but I understand that the question of making a revised appli<Col N="638" /> cation was to be considered. I now await any proposals which the council may decide to bring forward for my consideration under the enhanced programme and I look forward to continuing to work with all the local authorities to ensure the ongoing development of a high quality product for swimming, the most popular recreational activity.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, I am anxious to ensure that the stock of swimming pools, which are so important from a sport and recreational point of view for the people who reside adjacent to them, are safe and of a comfortable standard. I look forward to receiving proposals from Ballinasloe UDC so that the necessary work which is needed to get the swimming facilities restored for the residents of Ballinasloe and its surrounding areas can be proceeded with as a priority.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy wishes to get further information regarding public private partnerships which are operating successfully in a number of areas throughout the country, he has only to contact the Department and that information will be made available to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>This school was built in 1948 and this application has been with the Department of Education and Science for the past six years. Unfortunately, because the Department failed to contact the board of management, the parents' association or the chairman of the board, the parents found it necessary to fund raise and to provide one additional general purpose room in the school. That was a fantastic achievement in a small rural community. The former President of Ireland, Mrs. Robinson, honoured them by opening it when she visited the area in 1996.</P>
      <P>The application before the Department is twofold. One part relates to a matter of safety for the children, parents and all who use the school on a regular basis. It is located on the main Limerick-Galway road on which a considerable amount of traffic travels at a very high speed. To avoid the danger of allowing young children wander along the main national primary route, parents must drop off and pick up their children on the side of the road. The board of management has requested permission and assistance from the Office of Public Works and the Department to provide off-road parking at the school &ndash; inside the boundary wall. Nobody could refuse such an application given the high volume and high speed of traffic on this route.</P>
      <P>The second element of the application relates to the provision of two additional rooms &ndash; one for use as a staff room-cum-library-cum-medical room and the other for use by a resource and remedial teacher. The school is lucky enough to have the benefit of a remedial teacher based in the school. It also has a resource teacher thus necessitating a large amount of space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When they contacted the Department recently <Col N="639" /> the Office of Public Works person, Mr. Michael Burke, was sent out. He indicated that they should apply to Galway County Council for permission. Planning permission has been received for that work if the Board of Works, under the observation and brief of the Department, will allow it to start as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Department indicated to the board of management and the parents' association that the other element of the request will be a long-term project. It is a small request from a rural school which is unique in that enrolment figures show an increase. Because it was built in 1948, other refurbishment, including sanitary facilities, windows, doors, etc. in addition to the two rooms, are needed. Will the Minister ensure it does not become a long-term project because it is a matter of great urgency to all involved? To take a short cut around the long report which might be needed or reviews as they were termed in the past, the parents have undertaken a survey of the potential enrolment in the school over the next five years. From third class to fifth class, which is four classes, the intake in the forthcoming four years will more than compensate for loss of numbers. If the Department is questioning the viability of the school, it has been given proof that there is no danger of it being a non-viable project.</P>
    <P>This area, which is within commuting distance of Galway, is growing. Will the Minister respond as a matter of urgency to their meagre needs? The parents have indicated their determination to provide the best education possible by their initiative in fund-raising to provide an all purpose room. Safety is of the utmost importance in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods. I thank the Deputy for this opportunity to clarify the current position with regard to the application for additional accommodation and improved car parking facilities submitted in respect of Kiltiernan national school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> At present the school has a staffing level of a principal teacher, one assistant teacher, a shared remedial teacher and a resource teacher. The school management has applied to the Department of Education and Science for grant aid towards a car parking bay and additional accommodation for the school. The board has informed the Department that it has arranged for plans to be drafted for the required parking development. The board has also indicated that it is planning for the construction of two additional rooms which are to serve as resource-remedial and staff-office-library rooms.</P>
    <P>The Department is arranging to have a member of its technical unit inspect the premises to review the options best suited to meet the school's accommodation requirements. The Office of Public Works is also investigating the additional car parking facilities on the Department's behalf. When all the relevant reports are to hand, the Department will be in a position to assess the school's requirements. In the meantime, it would be advisable for the board to await the outcome of the Department's assessment of the situation before proceeding further in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there is a large number of school building projects on hand in the Department of Education and Science. Because of the priority this Government has given to reversing the neglect of our primary schools evident previously, the spending estimates published show primary school building and renovation funding increasing by an unprecedented 186% from the 1997 budget allocation. In addition, we have significantly reduced the burden of fund-raising faced by schools and communities.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the application by Kiltiernan national school will be dealt with as speedily as possible by the Department of Education and Science. He will appreciate that, at this early stage, it is not possible to say the extent of the accommodation to be provided.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 16 February 2000.</P>

    <P>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke): It creates a wrong impression to suggest that new carriages are in storage. The position is that, of an initial order of ten DART carriages, two have been recently delivered. Some basic preparatory examination and testing of these two vehicles has taken place and it is planned to carry out live testing under power next week. Subject to no faults being identified in these initial examination and tests, the remaining eight will be delivered in tranches of two within the next month. The new carriages will then be brought into service as soon as the essential commissioning work on these units is completed. This work is necessary to ensure that the carriages meet specifications and safety standards.</P>

      <P>The circumstances of the incident on 8 November 1999 at Tara Street Station to which the Deputy refers have been reviewed by a railway inspecting officer in my Department.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has notified the railway inspecting officer that, following this incident, the company carried out a review of its emergency procedures at Tara Street. Following this review, additional procedures have been, or are in the process of being, put in place to deal with crowd movements and build up. In particular, a platform supervisor will be on duty during peak times every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the closed circuit television unit, Iarnród Éireann has advised the railway inspecting officer that crowd numbers are monitored on the platforms at Tara Street by a CCTV monitor at the entrance point. Where there is an <Col N="642" /> excessive build up of crowd numbers, passengers can be restricted from going up to the platforms.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has confirmed to the chief railway inspecting officer that the CCTV system monitoring the platform was fully functional and in use at the time of the incident. However, the member of staff responsible for monitoring the platform judged that the crowd build-up was not excessive at the time of the incident and passengers were not therefore restricted from entering the platform. I understand that safety consultants have been commissioned by Iarnród Éireann to review its procedures and to look particularly at the issue of crowd control.</P>
    <P>While the safety of rail operations is the statutory responsibility of Iarnród Éireann, passengers should exercise proper caution and due care for themselves and other passengers when boarding or travelling on trains.</P>
    <P>The railway inspecting officers will monitor emergency procedures in Tara Street on an ongoing basis, and in other stations if they deem it necessary. Such monitoring will include visits to the station at peak periods to observe the procedures in practice.</P>

      <P>There has been substantial investment in suburban rail in the greater Dublin area under the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999 and the DTO short-term action plan. By the end of 2000 Iarnród Éireann will have acquired 47 new suburban rail cars and 20 new DART cars.</P>
      <P>Over the period of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 there will be further substantial investment in suburban rail. Over the period of the plan Iarnród Éireann will acquire a further 58 suburban railcars and 46 DART cars.</P>
      <P>The combined effect of all this additional rolling stock will be to increase the capacity of the suburban rail network by over 27,000 places. I expect that this improvement in capacity on the suburban rail system will, allied to the other measures of the strategy for the development of public transport outlined in the national development plan, serve to substantially alleviate road traffic congestion in the greater Dublin area.</P>

      <P>The committee is at present finalising its report and I expect to receive this by the end of this month. Pending the finalisation of the report I am not in a position to comment on the schedule for the design and testing of an integrated ticketing system.</P>
      <P>EU funding of just over £1 million is being provided for consultancy studies associated with the work of the committee and also for capital expenditure. I am satisfied that this money will be drawn down. The capital expenditure will be in respect of facilities at the Maynooth line rail stations.</P>
      <P>This is, of course, only preliminary work. The National Development Plan 2000-2006 provides £12 million in respect of the anticipated expenditure in this period on equipment needed to introduce a new integrated ticketing system for the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has approved an Exchequer allocation of £1 million for 2000 to facilitate the early introduction of integrated ticketing. This funding will be used by both Iarnród Éireann and <Col N="644" /> Dublin Bus in placing initial orders for ticketing equipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland was informed on 10 February by the UK Nuclear Installations Inspectorate that the NII's investigation into the falsification of quality control checks for nuclear fuel rods at the Sellafield fuel pellet manufacturing plant is now complete.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the institute, which has been in regular contact with the NII since this incident came to light, that the NII will publish its report on the investigation shortly and that a copy will be sent immediately by the NII to the institute and my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the fuel pellet manufacturing plant will remain closed until the NII is satisfied <Col N="645" /> that the proper procedures are in place at the plant.</P>
    <P>The falsification of any data relating to such hazardous material is a matter of serious concern. I am, therefore, awaiting, with interest, receipt of the NII's report. On receipt of this report, I will consider whether any intervention is required on my part or that of the institute.</P>
    <P>I understand from the UK authorities that a UK delegation visited Japan last week to discuss the subject of the return of MOX fuel sent to Japan. According to the communiqué, the UK was asked to arrange for the sending back of the fuel to the UK. The UK in response pointed out the seriousness of the issue which raised contractual issues and involved both Governments. The UK Government resolved to consider all the options, including the sending of the fuel back to the UK as soon as possible. Both sides agreed to continue further discussions between the two Governments.</P>
    <P>The question of the sending back of MOX fuel is, of course, linked with the authorisation of the proposed MOX plant by the UK authorities. On behalf of the Irish Government, I have made a number of submissions outlining the Irish Government's outright opposition to this plant. As contracts with Japanese customers would have a significant impact on the commercial viability of MOX, it is my view that no authorisation should be granted for the MOX plant in current circumstances. I will be monitoring closely developments in Japan relating to MOX. While no specific action is required at EU level or internationally at present, I will be keeping the matter under review.</P>
    <P>If a decision is taken to return the fuel to the UK, responsibility for the transport by sea rests with the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 53 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>I met with Peter Cassells and other officials of ICTU and SIPTU yesterday as part of an ongoing series of meetings with ICTU and with the representatives of various trade unions that I and officials of my Department have held prior to and since implementation of the Groundhandling Directive. In order to address trade union concerns that there may be a gap in safety regulation as regards groundhandling activities, it was agreed that my Department would open discussions with the Irish Aviation Authority and the Health and Safety Authority to explore whether additional steps might be required in this area.</P>
      <P>The Irish Aviation Authority is the regulatory body responsible for the safety and technical aspects of civil aviation and to the extent that they affect air safety, the Irish Aviation Authority monitors the airlines' supervision in regard to groundhandling.</P>
      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the national body with overall responsibility for the administration and enforcement of health and safety at work in Ireland. The authority monitors and enforces compliance with the legislation, provides expert advice to employers and the self-employed and promotes education, training and research. It brings forward, as necessary, proposals for regulations and codes of practice.</P>
      <P>The authority carries out regular inspection of airport activities to which the safety and health laws apply, including compliance with the duties imposed on either those who control workplaces or who employ workers. These inspections encompass airside activities, including groundhandling.</P>
      <P>The functions of the proposed aviation regulator will relate to the economic regulation of airlines and airports including groundhandling activities. His functions will not cut across or diminish in any way the safety regulatory functions of the Health and Safety Authority and the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>
      <P>Regulations governing access to the groundhandling market were signed by me on 16 December 1998 for the purpose of implementing EU Directive No. 96/67/EC of 15 October 1996.</P>

      <P>With regard to Aer Rianta, the report submitted by that company on the future strategic direction of the Aer Rianta group as a whole, sought, <i>inter alia</i>, authorisation to prepare for an IPO.

      <P>The OSPAR strategy with regard to radioactive substances, adopted by the OSPAR Ministers in 1998, commits the OSPAR contracting parties to the virtual elimination by the year 2020 of discharges of radioactive substances to the marine environment.</P>
      <P>The OSPAR Commission, on which all OSPAR participating states are represented, will, at its meeting in June this year, consider a draft report as to how the objectives of the strategy and the timetable for its implementation will be met. There is some evidence from the current version of that draft report and the minutes of an OSPAR working group meeting in January of an attempt by France and the UK to dilute some of the strategy's objectives. Further negotiations on the draft report will be necessary in advance of the June meeting and at a heads of delegation meeting on 16-17 May next. It is important to recognise that the UK is preparing a national strategy for discharges of radioactive substances covering the period 2001 to 2020 to meet the objectives of the OSPAR strategy. It expects its national strategy to be published before the end of this year after a full public consultation process. Allied to this, the UK is also undertaking a full scale review of all radioactive discharges from Sellafield. The UK's domestic processes and their outcome will be a measure of their commitment to the OSPAR strategy.</P>
      <P>I will keep a close eye on developments in the run up to the OSPAR Commission meeting in June. I will consider bilateral contact and correspondence with the UK Ministers and officials in the period between now and the June meeting if that appears necessary. I am determined to ensure that OSPAR participating states can demonstrate at that meeting that they are working positively towards achieving further substantial reductions of discharges as required under the OSPAR strategy so that the objectives of the strategy can be achieved fully between now and 2020.</P>

      <P>With regard to the future of the State airports, including Cork Airport, I submitted the recent Warburg Dillon Read report on the future strategic direction of Aer Rianta to my Cabinet colleagues on 1 February and made it publicly available. I intend to bring specific recommendations in this regard to Government as soon as possible. No decision on future plans for any of the three State airports, including Cork Airport, will be taken in advance of that.</P>
      <P>There are no restrictions on the operation of charter services at Cork Airport. I am advised by Aer Rianta that the company is actively engaged in assisting the development of all passenger and cargo business at its airports and that marketing support is available to assist in the start up phase of new services, including charters.</P>

      <P>Under the Radiological Protection Act, 1991 (General Control of Radioactive Substances, Nuclear Devices and Irradiating Apparatus) Order, 1993, S.I. No. 151 of 1993, the use of radioactive substances, including contaminated metals and other materials which might arise from the decommissioning of nuclear installations is prohibited except under a licence issued by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. Only very small and trivial amounts of radioactivity would be exempt from this requirement as provided for in the relevant EU directive. My Department is currently preparing legislation which will replace SI 151 of 1993 and give effect to EU Directive 96/29 on Basic Safety Standards for the Protection of Workers and the General Public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation. It similarly prohibits the use, recycling or re-use of radioactive substances except where licensed by the institute.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the institute that there is no evidence that there are consumer goods in Ireland which contain recycled radioactive contaminated material. It is doubtful whether any producer of consumer goods would permit contaminated materials to be used in the manufacture of consumer goods.</P>

      <Quest>if she has satisfied herself that, following developments in the past 12 months in the telecommunications industry with particular reference to industrial and domestic needs, land based and mobile, adequate investment is available to the industry to ensure the delivery of the highest quality service, nationally and internationally; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The availability of a top quality telecommunications system, covering both fixed and mobile services, is important for economic and social development as well as for economic growth and competitiveness. It is generally recognised that one of the best ways to bring this about is to foster a pro-competition environment and a regulatory framework for the sector which stimulates ongoing investment in both infrastructure and services. Now with the advent of the full liberalisation of the Irish telecommunications sector and with growing competition, investment in telecommunications infrastructure is primarily a matter for the commercial judgment of network operators.</P>
      <P>However, recognising that, in certain parts of the country, competition alone may not be sufficient to generate the necessary investment in advanced telecommunications infrastructure, there is a role for State intervention to ensure that certain public interest objectives are met. Such intervention includes ensuring that a certain minimum level of telecommunications services is universally available by providing for the designation of a universal service provider as well as stimulating investment in areas which might not otherwise attract sufficient investment. The ongoing development of technologies such as wireless and satellite will facilitate this process.</P>
      <P>In total I have utilised EU aid of 26.5 million euros to leverage a total investment of 68 million euros in broadband infrastructure throughout the country. These networks will link 120 different towns throughout the country and will touch 21 counties. They will involve the laying of approximately 1,000 kilometres of optic fibre cable and will be completed by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, £120 million has been allocated under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for further investment in advanced telecommunications infrastructure and my Department is currently drawing up plans for this investment. Some 2.5 million euros in EU aid has also been allocated to develop a number of e-commerce demonstration projects for Irish industry. A total of 25 projects have been chosen for funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has also successfully concluded a project by way of open competition whereby ownership has been acquired of con<Col N="654" /> nectivity on the Global Crossing international fibre optic system seamlessly linking Ireland to 24 European business centres and to the US at internationally competitive prices. This infrastructure will be in place by June 2000.</P>

      <Quest>if this extra revenue generated due to the EU directive, which obliged Aer Rianta to terminate discount landing charges for new routes with effect from 1 January 2000, will be used to reduce the general level of landing charges; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>Aer Rianta's standard charges have not increased since 1987. Discount schemes which the company has operated from time to time represented the sacrifice of some aeronautical revenues for a limited period to stimulate the establishment of new routes and passenger growth on existing routes. The resulting growth in passengers and associated growth in duty free revenue more than compensated for the loss of revenue due to the discounts.</P>
      <P>That the EU Commission had expressed its concern on the issue of the discounts was a major factor in Aer Rianta's review of the position.</P>
      <P>As to the general level of Aer Rianta's charges in the future, this will be a matter for the aviation regulator who will be statutorily appointed later this year upon enactment of the necessary legislation.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta is continuing its successful programme of promoting the establishment of new routes from Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports with a new scheme of marketing supports this year. The new package on offer by Aer Rianta which is available to any airline contemplating a new route in 2000 is very attractive and will contribute to the stimulation of further traffic growth at each of the three airports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Consumer Credit Act, 1995, which commenced on 13 May 1996 allocated responsibility for the regulation of non-interest related charges imposed by credit institutions to the Director of Consumer Affairs. The Act obliged credit institutions to formally notify the director of all their charges within three months of the commencement of the Act and to further notify any proposals to increase their existing charges or to introduce charges for services not previously notified. The director may issue a direction to an institution to refrain from imposing a proposed increase or new charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's question relates to the charges imposed by credit institutions for foreign exchange transactions, particularly foreign bank <Col N="657" /> drafts, after the introduction of the euro for cashless transactions on 1 January 1999 when compared with the charges imposed pre euro.</P>
    <P>The pre euro charging structures imposed by credit institutions and bureaux de changes for foreign exchange transactions in respect of Eurozone currencies were based on a commission and a margin or spread, the difference between the rate at which a currency is bought and the rate at which it is sold. With the fixing of exchange rates for Eurozone currencies from 1 January 1999 the spread no longer applied.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the director that credit institutions notified her that as the majority of their income, approximately 80%, derived from the spread rather than the commission element of their foreign exchange charges, they were seeking to amend their pricing structures for Eurozone transactions. I understand that, in submitting their notifications, the director required that the institutions provide her with a commercial justification for their proposals. In that context, while the exchange rate element of risk in respect of Eurozone currencies no longer existed, the costs involved in providing a foreign exchange service, including staff, premises, transport and security costs still remained. The director has informed me that she was concerned that the savings accruing from the elimination of the exchange rate risk and the benefits of the single currency should be passed on to consumers and that the directions which she issued to credit institutions were framed in that light. I understand from the director that, overall, reductions averaging between 20% to 30% in the cost of transacting in euro currencies, when compared with the cost of such transactions prior to the introduction of the euro, have resulted since 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>In relation to the charges imposed for foreign bank drafts and, in particular, the instance detailed in the Deputy's question, while it is not possible from the details supplied to know the value of the transaction referred to or which institution was involved in the transaction, I understand from the director that it is not correct to say that the only charge imposed prior to the introduction of the euro for a transaction was a straightforward £3.50. A spread would also have pertained. The spread or margin was not transparent to customers as it was included in the rate upon which the transaction was calculated and was not, therefore, readily identified as a charge.</P>
    <P>The director has informed me that as part of her directions to credit institutions regarding their euro charges she obliged them to conduct a number of positive customer communication exercises, including advertising their charges in the national newspapers and providing information leaflets outlining their charges, with pre-post euro comparisons of their pricing structures. The purpose of these exercises was to ensure that the new euro pricing arrangements would be as transparent as possible thereby enabling customers to shop around for value. A consequence of this has been that a significant number of insti<Col N="658" /> tutions have reduced their charges, including charges relating to the cost of foreign bank drafts, below those approved by the director.</P>

    <P>IDA Ireland has carried out an extensive analysis to determine the needs of the different regions and to identify the industrial sectors most likely to deliver quality jobs. The main aim of the agency's activity is to try to increase the share of new greenfield projects locating in the regions to achieve greater regional impact.</P>
    <P>However, it is not merely a question of jobs dispersal, the agency is seeking to bring a better mix of industry sectors and higher value industries to locations around the country, in particular, to locations that have not seen the emergence of the modern industries. The agency's new strategy also addresses the need to increase the value and sustainability of overseas companies already established or about to establish in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am confident the Donegal region will benefit from the new regional focus of IDA Ireland.</P>

      <P>On 7 December 1999 the EU Commission adopted a decision banning the placing on the market of child care articles, including teething rings and soothers, and toys intended to be placed in the mouth by children under three and made of soft PVC, containing specified phthalates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" /> The decision had previously been endorsed by all member states at a meeting on 1 December 1999. At this meeting, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs indicated that the decision would be implemented in Ireland by way of administrative procedures under Article 6 of Council Directive 92/59/EEC of 29 June 1992, on general product safety.</P>
    <P>Following notification of the decision, the Director of Consumer Affairs, who has responsibility for enforcing this measure, issued a press release advising the public of the Commission decision and of the director's intention to actively enforce the Commission ban. A copy of the press release was communicated to the main importers and retailers of such products as well as representatives of the pharmaceutical industry.</P>
    <P>On 7 December 1999, officials from the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs met a delegation of industry representatives which included importers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers. The representatives confirmed that they would comply with the Commission decision and gave assurances of co-operation for a voluntary withdrawal of products &ldquo;already placed on the market&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On 16 December 1999 the ODCA met with the UK authorities and UK distributors, who supply the bulk of the Irish market, and were given an assurance that they would co-operate fully with the implementation of the Commission decision by not shipping the products affected into Ireland.</P>
    <P>The ODCA has also advised the customs authorities of the decision and the need for co-operation in its implementation by monitoring imports of PVC articles which may be imported directly into Ireland from third countries.</P>
    <P>Responses received by the ODCA to follow-up letters issued on 27 January 2000 indicate that brands currently on the market comply with the decision and that manufacturers who had used phthalates in the past had already changed formulations in anticipation of such a decision by the Commission.</P>
    <P>Inspectors from the ODCA are monitoring the implementation of the decision on an ongoing basis through visits to distributors, wholesalers and retailers. To date no products containing the banned phthalates have been found.</P>

      <P>The unprecedented increase in apprenticeship numbers in recent years has created capacity problems in off-the-job training phases, two, four and six, resulting in delays in scheduling training provision for apprentices. FÁS and the education sector have been significantly expanding their capacities to address this issue and there are proposals in train to reduce the current bottlenecks.</P>
      <P>The National Apprenticeship Advisory Committee which includes representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science, FÁS and the social partners has already considered the issue at a number of meetings at which a range of possible options was put forward aimed at increasing capacity in the short-term in the critical trades. These possible options were considered in the context of the principal belief that the quality of training and the achievement of the agreed standards should not be diluted in any way.</P>
      <P>As regards the specific focus on the education sector, I refer to the recent reply by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science to a question on this subject. In that reply, it was indicated that efforts are being made to expand capacity as a matter of urgency in a number of centres, particularly in the Dublin region. In addition the Department of Education and Science is liaising with the institutes of technology and the Teachers Union of Ireland with a view to putting in place the necessary arrangements to run courses for apprentices during the coming summer months.</P>

      <P>While investment in commercial ports has greatly improved the capacity and quality of port infrastructure and facilities, the level of growth in Ireland's international trade and in port activity generally underlines the need for continued investment. Almost 93% of trade by volume and 84% by value is transported through Ireland's ports each year. The returns from the top 20 ports for 1998, the last year for which we have CSO statistics, show that seaborne trade is at an all time high. Ports cargo throughput in 1998 increased by some 9.2% from 36.66 million tonnes to a record level of 40.05 million tonnes and passenger numbers increased by almost 6% over 1997 to 4.65 million. The figures for 1999 will show these trends continuing.</P>
      <P>The Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium recognises that the necessary infrastructure to handle ever increasing volumes of tourism and trade has to be underpinned by continuing investment and the maintenance of competitiveness. The key policy objective of my Department in relation to the maritime transport sector is to support and facilitate the availability of efficient and competitive port and shipping services.</P>
      <P>There has been significant development in maritime infrastructural works at the commercial ports with the assistance of EU funding. On completion of the current programme of modernisation and infrastructural development at these key ports, some £163 million will have been invested in new and upgraded infrastructure and access improvements. The development and modernisation of the ports industry could not have been achieved without grant assistance under EU programmes. The scale of the various funding programmes reflected the low level of investment in the ports industry generally before EU funding became available.</P>
      <P>As regards the next round of Structural Funding for our commercial ports, based on an examination of their importance to the economy and their development needs over the period to 2007 &ndash; as determined in a recent detailed study on future port capacity requirements undertaken by independent consultants &ndash; a port development programme has been included in the current National Development Plan 2000 to 2006. An overall provision of £46 million in EU aid has been granted for investment in commercial ports.</P>

      <P>A general felling licence was awarded in July 1995 for two areas of woodland covering 12.3 ha in Tobertynan Demesne. This licence was for a duration of five years. The application was to facilitate a woodland improvement plan covering the removal of overmature dying trees, badly formed young trees and scrub clearance so that the site could be underplanted with 25,000 broadleaf trees.</P>
      <P>In a letter last July to the Tobertynan Residents Committee, my predecessor indicated that he instructed the forest service to monitor the site on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance with the conditions of the relevant felling licence. Any variations would be examined and if significant the necessary action would be taken.</P>
      <P>The forest service was informed of activity on the site on 31 January 2000. An official from my Department visited the site on 1 and 2 February 2000.

To assist in this matter appropriate advice is sought from relevant competent bodies. In the case in question, the views of the relevant regional fisheries board and local authority were sought. Both competent authorities were opposed to the application as they were of the opinion that afforestation would adversely affect the water quality in the Lough Conn catchment. Moreover, it is the opinion of my Department that the fertility of the site in question is such as to be unlikely to produce a commercial crop of trees. For the above reasons the proposal could not be grant-aided. Each application is considered on its merits.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>Robert Hamill died following a vicious attack in Portadown on 27 April 1997. RUC officers were in the vicinity at the time. Six people were charged in 1997 with his murder. Only one was convicted on 25 March 1999 of causing an affray and not of murder. The Independent Commission for Police Complaints supervised the RUC investigation into the actions of the RUC officers on the night in question, following which a report was sent to the DPP. On 30 September 1999, the DPP decided not to proceed with the prosecution of any RUC officer. The RUC file on the case remains open.</P>
      <P>Since 1997 the case has been actively pursued with the British authorities both at official and at ministerial level. Following the DPP's decision of 30 September not to prosecute any RUC officer, an urgent report was requested through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast. The report received emphasised that an internal RUC disciplinary investigation was ongoing, and that no option, including a public inquiry, had been ruled out.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday 19 October, the Government's disappointment at the DPP's decision and the widespread and deep concern that exists about this case was personally conveyed to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, by my predecessor, Deputy Andrews.</P>
      <P>There is grave dissatisfaction throughout the nationalist community and among human rights groups and others about the case, and this has led, understandably, to a mounting number of calls for a public inquiry, for which there are strong grounds. I am now giving very serious consideration to calling for such an inquiry.</P>

      <P>The inquest into the death of the person in question began on 31 January at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court and is expected to continue into next week. The Embassy in London is monitoring proceedings. Embassy officials have attended the inquest on a number of occasions and have reported to me as appropriate. So far, the inquest has heard mainly the evidence of the police officers involved in the operation in the course of which the person referred to was killed. I understand that the remainder of the inquest will concentrate on the evidence of forensic and technical experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of the view that the first priority must be to establish the truth about the circumstances surrounding the death of the person in question. I <Col N="669" /> consider that the inquest will be of assistance in this regard, and I await its outcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>Policy initiatives relating to the electricity sector generally are within the remit of the Minister for Public Enterprise. The Commission for Electricity Regulation has an advisory function in relation to policy. The commission is otherwise responsible for regulating the emerging liberalised electricity market in accordance with the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September last, I published a Green Paper on Sustainable Energy as part of my policy review of measures for energy efficiency and the increased use of renewable resources. I established an increased target of 500 MWe of additional renewable energy based electricity <Col N="670" /> generating plant to be procured in the period 2000-05.</P>
    <P>The Act partially liberalised the electricity market for producers of electricity by conventional means from 19 February next. In the case of electricity produced from renewable energy sources, the entire retail electricity market is liberalised on the same day. The 500 MWe target will be met through a combination of alternative energy requirement competitions, projects successful in related European Commission sponsored programmes, Fifth Framework, Altener &amp; INTERREG, and projects built to take market advantage from the liberalisation of the entire electricity market for electricity generated from renewable energy sources.</P>
    <P>I also established a renewable energy strategy group to examine all aspects of, and obstacles to, the further deployment of renewable energy technologies, including wind. The group's initial report, which will concentrate on wind energy, is due for completion in the middle of the year. I expect to announce a further competition, under the AER programme, for rights to generate and sell green electricity to the Electricity Supply Board shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, the right of AER winners to enter into power purchase agreements with the ESB was based on an administrative arrangement between the ESB and my Department. Section 39 of the Act established, <i>inter alia</i>, a legal base to order the ESB to take electricity from generating stations using renewable forms of energy chosen as a result of competitions organised by me or the European Commission. This provision gives legal certainty to the previous administrative arrangement.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Regulation Act also made provision for the award, by the commission, of authorisations to build electricity generating stations and licenses to generate and supply electricity. The commission is, subject to the Act, independent in the performance of its functions. Applications for authorisations and licenses should, therefore, be addressed directly to the commission in the first instance.</P>

      <P>I am advised by Aer Rianta that it estimates that the loss of income to the three State airports arising from the abolition of intra EU duty free on 1 July last is approximately £30 million per annum. The actual loss of income will become clearer during the course of this year. The privately owned regional airports have also <Col N="671" /> been hit with a loss of revenue which is among the reasons for the significant ongoing Exchequer support schemes for those airports.</P>
      <P>Prior to the adoption, in the early 1990s, of the EU directives which provided for the abolition of duty free purchases by intra-EU travellers, both the Department of Finance and the then Department of Tourism and Transport were aware of the potential implications. In addition, the Department of Finance commissioned a report in 1998 on the impact of the abolition of duty free sales in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware of the discomfort passengers have experienced due to overcrowding on trains in recent times. There has been continuing growth in passenger numbers and this has resulted in heavy loading at peak periods on some routes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has recognised the problems facing commuters in the greater Dublin area and responded by approving the purchase of 26 additional DART units and 47 suburban railcars. Two DART units have already been delivered this month and, subject to satisfactory examination and testing of this initial tranche, a further eight are due to be delivered within the next month. The remaining 16 will be delivered towards the end of this year. Twenty seven of the railcars have also been delivered and the remaining 20 will be delivered towards the end of next <Col N="672" /> year. Of the 27 railcars delivered 14 have already been put in operation on the northern suburban rail line.</P>
    <P>The national development plan sets out the Government's plans for large scale investment in public transport over the period from 2000 to 2006. This includes substantial expenditure on the acquisition of 58 additional suburban railcars and 46 additional DART cars over the life of the plan. This ongoing investment will increase the capacity available to deal with peak periods and should help to alleviate the difficulties with regard to overcrowding.</P>
    <P>However, I have no statutory function in relation to overcrowding of public transport vehicles. Responsibility for ensuring safety on these vehicles rests with CIE and its subsidiaries. It is therefore a matter for Iarnród Éireann to satisfy itself that the number of passengers being carried in any particular train or carriage does not compromise overall passenger safety.</P>
    <P>I have advised the House previously that there are no safety standards in place in relation to overcrowding of trains either in this country or at EU level. However, my Department's railway inspecting officers have been in contact with Iarnród Éireann on a number of occasions drawing its attention to the importance of keeping this matter under review. I understand from Iarnród Éireann that an independent appraisal of the carrying capacity of all of its rolling stock is being undertaken and will be completed by end March.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>Due to concerns about electricity generating capacity for late 2001 and early 2002, I have given limited and conditional approval for capital expenditure by the ESB on certain specified aspects of its planned new gas-fired generating plant at Ringsend including preparatory work related to the planning process and more recently the procurement of a turbine and associated expenditure.</P>
      <P>The Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1982, obliges the ESB to secure my approval for any expenditure proposed for capital purposes.</P>
      <P>In 1998, the ESB gave my Department advance notice of its intention to build a large new gas fired generating plant at Ringsend.</P>
      <P>In the light of the pending opening of the market to competition and the expressed intention of a number of independent players to enter the Irish market, I have at all times exercised my statutory functions in relation to the ESB proposal on the basis of legal advice.</P>
      <P>In November 1998, on the basis of legal advice, I gave the ESB approval for the capital expenditure involved in the preparatory work up to completion of the planning permission process.</P>
      <P>On 1 December 1999, again on the basis of legal advice, I published a letter which set out the conditions under which I would be prepared to give approval for further capital expenditure by the ESB on the Ringsend project.</P>
      <P>That letter made clear that I could only consider giving an approval in relation to expenditure for the turbine after I had received a written undertaking from the ESB that, if I am of the opinion that competition law makes it appropriate, the ESB would sell its interest &ndash; including any interest in any consortium having an interest &ndash; in any generating station to be built at Ringsend on appropriate terms.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of explicit acceptance of that condition by the ESB, the company sought approval to enter into commitments up to £120 million in relation to the procurement of a turbine and associated works.</P>
      <P>Following due consideration and after taking further legal advice the ESB was given the necessary letter of capital approval on 23 December 1999.</P>

    <P>The specific issue of level competition and the question of possible public subsidy referred to in the Deputy's question were specifically addressed in my Department's professional assessment of the ESB's application. My Department's consent therefore, specified that the relevant financial <Col N="676" /> arrangements between the ESB and Dublin Bay Power Limited must be on an arms length basis and governed by terms and conditions such as to preclude the passing on or conferral on Dublin Bay Power Limited, Statoil Dublin Bay AS, or the partnership, Dublin Bay Power, of any financial advantage derived by the ESB as a State owned monopoly and dominant player in the market which would fall to be classified as a State aid.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the draft terms and conditions of the loan agreement are required to be submitted for prior ministerial approval as soon as possible. The rate of interest and other conditions of the loan must be those likely to be experienced by similar private-sector projects so as to avoid any suggestion of State aid or similar advantage to this project. In particular, the ESB was advised that I will need to be satisfied that the interest rate charged and other loan conditions applied to the project reflect its stand-alone borrowing capacity rather than the borrowing capacity of the ESB itself.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the site, the Commissioner for Electricity Regulation in a letter to my Department on 18 November 1999 indicated that the question of the site at Ringsend being transferred to Dublin Bay Power without any public tender or other offer process was of concern to him. This matter was duly taken up with the ESB who indicated the site had been leased to the Ringsend consortium, Dublin Bay Power Limited for 35 years. The company indicated that the lease has been negotiated at full open market rent and the ESB had conducted the negotiations on an arms length basis with the assistance of an independent valuer.</P>
    <P>ESB has taken the view that a tendering process was not required for these arrangements by virtue of the ownership remaining with the ESB; the control remaining with the ESB through its majority share in the partnership, and rent having been established on the basis of open market as determined by independent valuation.</P>
    <P>In my letter of 1 December 1999 to the chairman of the ESB, I reiterated that the commissioner for Electricity Regulation had raised the question as to whether there should be third party access to sites which are owned by the ESB as a result of its monopoly position pre-liberalisation.</P>
    <P>The treatment and procedures followed by the ESB in relation to the Ringsend site is one of a number of complex competition issues arising in relation to the Ringsend plant which are the subject of continuing inquiry by my Department.</P>
    <P>The allocation of scarce gas pipeline capacity for the ESB and other independent power producers wishing to enter the market will be the subject of legislative proposals which I expect to put before the House in the very near future. The constrained pipeline capacity will be of short duration.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>Economic growth in recent years has been reflected in record levels of growth in demand for electricity by all sectors of the economy, averaging around 6% per annum in recent years.</P>
      <P>In general, the current and foreseeable levels of growth in demand for electricity will require the provision of between 150MW and 200MW of additional capacity each year for the foreseeable future, by means of new plant or imports over the interconnector.</P>
      <P>The ESB, in consultation with my Department, published a report in October 1998 on &ldquo;Generation Capacity Requirements to 2005&rdquo; for the information of the industry. This was done having regard to the imminent opening of the market to competition under EU provisions. An update of this report is being prepared by ESB at the request of the Commission for Electricity Regulation in response to the requirement of section 38 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999.</P>
      <P>I am informed that growth in demand for electricity is being managed competently by the ESB. I have received a categoric assurance from the chairman of ESB that there will be no shortages in electricity supply this winter or during winter 2000-spring 2001.</P>
      <P>The ESB has recently commissioned the third unit, 160MW of its plant at Poolbeg and the new 120MW peat fired plant at Edenderry will be coming on stream in December of this year.</P>
      <P>It is accepted that a major tranche of additional capacity will be required two years from now, that is, for winter 2001-spring 2002. In that regard, the ESB and the independent power consortium Viridian-CRH recently received planning permission for two large new gas fired generation plants, of 400 and 600MW respectively, at Ringsend and Huntstown, north County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> In addition to this and arising from a meeting on 7 December 1999 between me and Sir Reg Empey, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland, the grid operators on each side of the Border are proceeding with plans to upgrade the existing North-South interconnector over the next 18 months from around 280MW currently to around 400MW.</P>
    <P>The ESB currently has approximately 4500MW of installed generating capacity provided by 19 power stations listed at the end of this reply. Arising from the opening of the electricity market to competition from the 19th of this month, interests have signalled their intention to enter the generating market. Some of these have lodged planning applications.</P>
    <P>In summary, the current capacity situation is being managed professionally by the ESB and as regards the future, I am confident the additional capacity required by economic growth will be provided by the industry based on projects currently planned or in the pipeline.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The availability of a top quality telecommunications system, covering both fixed and mobile services, is important for economic and social development as well as for economic growth and competitiveness. It is generally recognised that one of the best ways to bring this about is to foster a pro-competition environment and a regulatory framework for the sector which stimulates ongoing investment in both infrastructure and services. With the advent of the full liberalisation of the Irish telecommunications sector and with growing competition, investment in telecom<Col N="681" /> munications infrastructure is primarily a matter for the commercial judgment of network operators.</P>
      <P>However, recognising that in certain parts of the country competition alone may not be sufficient to generate the necessary investment in advanced telecommunications infrastructure, there is a role for State intervention to ensure that certain public interest objectives are met. Such intervention includes ensuring that a certain minimum level of telecommunications services is universally available by providing for the designation of a universal service provider, as well as stimulating investment in areas which might not otherwise attract sufficient investment. The ongoing development of technologies such as wireless and satellite will facilitate this process.</P>
      <P>In total I have utilised EU aid of 26.5 million to leverage a total investment of 68 million in broadband infrastructure throughout the country. These networks will link 120 different towns throughout the country and will touch 21 counties. They will involve the laying of approximately 1,000 kilometres of optic fibre cable and will be completed by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, £120 million has been allocated under the National Development Plan 2000-06 for further investment in advanced telecommunications infrastructure and my Department is currently drawing up plans for this investment. A total of 2.5 million in EU aid has also been allocated to develop a number of e-commerce demonstration projects for Irish industry. Some 25 projects have been chosen for funding.</P>
      <P>The Government has also successfully concluded a project by way of open competition whereby ownership has been acquired of connectivity on the global crossing international fibre optic system seamlessly linking Ireland to 24 European business centres and to the US at internationally competitive prices. This infrastructure will be in place by June 2000.</P>

      <P>The Army Pensions Acts provide that a disability pension may, following retirement, be granted to a former member of the Permanent Defence Force in respect of permanent disablement due to a wound or injury attributable to military service, whether at home or abroad, or to a disease attributable to or aggravated by overseas service with a United Nations Force. A wound is defined for the purposes of those Acts as an interruption of the normal continuity of body tissue caused by direct or indirect violence but does not include any injury due to the serious negligence or mis<Col N="682" /> conduct of the person suffering therefrom. An application for a disability pension in respect of psychiatric illness could be considered if the condition was due to a wound or to overseas service.</P>
      <P>Under the Defence Forces pension schemes, a soldier qualifies for a service pension payable immediately on discharge if he has at least 21 years service. The minimum service requirement is 12 years if the soldier is discharged on medical grounds. Retired soldiers are also eligible for benefits such as disability benefit and invalidity pension under the Social Welfare Acts subject to the usual conditions.</P>

      <P>At a meeting with Castleblayney Urban District Council on 15 July 1999, I indicated that I had decided to dispose of the former military barracks to the North Eastern Health Board and that the property would be transferred as soon as possible. In this regard the former barracks was handed over to the board on 9 February 2000 on foot of a caretaker's agreement pending completion of the legal formalities.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the proposed project will provide for 45 permanent appointments and a sum in excess of £1 million will be invested on the provision of the necessary facilities. In addition, the annual revenue to the town is estimated to be in the region of £1.2 million. The proposal from the NEHB includes a gymnasium, an all-weather pitch and a swimming pool. I understand these facilities would be made available to the local community when not in use for child care purposes. The arrangements regarding their use will be a matter to be agreed between the local community and the North Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <P>The regulatory framework arising from the Agenda 2000 agreement allows for greater flexibility in the operation of the milk quota regime. I have decided to take the opportunity to make changes in the system which operates in Ireland in order to ensure that active, committed producers have greater access to quota over the coming years.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the new arrangements are to provide for more flexibility and certainty for milk producers in the operation of the milk quota regime; greater priority access to additional permanent milk quota for small scale and medium size producers; the retention of as many dairying enterprises as possible; and greater competitiveness within the milk production sector.</P>

EU regulations allow meat plants to pass on to cattle producers that element of the cost that is appropriate to slaughtering. The amount passed on to producers can vary and will depend on the precise arrangements between the individual plants and their suppliers. The veterinary inspection system in Northern Ireland differs from this Department's system and the charges are based on the standard cost approach.</P>

      <P>The proposed new early retirement scheme is different in some respects from the scheme which ended on 31 December last.

Other changes include an income ceiling for certain transferers and a limit on transferees' off-farm income, a phased reduction in the upper age limit for receipt of payments and a phased reduction in the upper age limit for transferees. New agri-environmental conditions applying to transferees are proposed. In addition, the proposals provide for an element of indexation of payments.</P>

      <P>Council Directive 91/630/EEC laying down minimum standards for the protection of pigs has been transposed into national rules by the European Communities (Welfare of Pigs) Regulations, 1995 (S.I. No. 91 of 1995). The regulations set down rules for the accommodation of pigs and the general conditions to be met to protect the health and welfare of pigs. Article 6 of the directive requires the EU Commission to submit to the Council of Ministers a report, drawn up on the basis of an opinion from the Scientific Veterinary Committee, on the intensive systems of pig rearing which comply with the welfare requirements of pigs from the pathological, zootechnical, physiological and behavioural points of view and on the socio-economic implications of the different systems. The Commission report must in particular take into account the welfare of sows reared in varying degrees of confinement and in groups. The report, in the light of its conclusions, must be accompanied by appropriate proposals for amendment of the directive. My Department has been in touch with the Commission to request that the report and the accompanying proposals be brought forward as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I would be anxious that any new scheme of grant assistance for Irish pig farmers should take account of both current and prospective developments at European Union level.</P>

      <P>The person named sought admission to the scheme under the joint management arrangement with her husband. It is a condition of the scheme that in a joint management application, a participant or a participant's spouse must apply, on reaching their sixty-sixth birthday, to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for both the contributory and non-contributory old age pension. If such a pension is awarded it must be offset against the farm retirement pension. All applicants for the scheme are made aware of the requirement. It is contained in the scheme guidelines booklet which they receive when they apply, and it is set out in the letter of approval which is sent to all applicants when they are sanctioned for payment.</P>
      <P>The letter of approval mentioned above was sent to the person named on 17 May 1995. Her husband became entitled to a contributory old age pension from 9 October 1998. This came to light in August 1999 and the early retirement pension was adjusted at the earliest possible date, namely at the end of September 1999.</P>

      <P>My Department is at an advanced stage of discussions with the Civil Service staff unions on the introduction of a comprehensive policy on harassment, sexual harassment and bullying for the Civil Service. The Civil Service is committed to the development and maintenance of a positive working environment and the introduction of the policy will underpin the commitment of management to ensuring that every employee has a right to carry out her or his duties free from any form of harassment, sexual harassment and bullying. However, it is recognised that the introduction of a policy is not in itself sufficient to counteract harassment, sexual harassment and bullying in the workplace and the policy will recognise the need for management in Government Departments to adopt a proactive approach to ensuring the workplace is free of such behaviour.</P>

      <P>In general terms, when the sale, in whole or in part, of <Col N="695" /> commercial State bodies occurs, the burden on the Exchequer is set to diminish both from the revenue realised from the process itself and the reduced need to inject share capital into the bodies to keep them adequately capitalised. In addition, the economy, and therefore, the Exchequer, stand to benefit from the efficiencies which flow from the release of commercial State bodies from State control to compete in a fully commercial manner in the market place.</P>
      <P>However, it is not possible to quantify the exact extent of the savings to the taxpayer from the process of disposing of commercial State bodies. This would be dependent on a wide range of factors, which would include the financial position of individual bodies prior to sale, the interest shown in acquiring them, the method and timing of, and conditions applying to, sale and the circumstances pertaining to the particular sectors of the economy in which individual bodies have been operating.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 to 166, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Since the questions with reference nos. 3956/00 to 3963/00 refer to interrelated matters, that is, offences and prosecutions, they are being taken together. As the questions all appear to relate to the issue of serious tax evasion, the information supplied should be read in that context. Revenue initiate large numbers of other prosecutions each year for failure to file tax returns and for customs and excise offences.</P>
      <P>The development of a more effective prosecution policy for serious tax evasion is one of the key strategies in Revenue's statement of strategy 1997-1999. The strategy envisaged that, as well as dealing with such evasion through recovery of underpaid tax along with interest and penalties, there would be a policy of more active prosecution in appropriate cases.</P>
      <P>I know that the Deputy, in his former capacity as Minister for Finance, played a part in promoting this chance. I too have made clear to Revenue that the prosecution initiative should be developed and built upon. I have discussed the general strategy on a number of occasions with the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, including discussion in the recent past and last year I approved the appointment of additional staffing in the investigation and legal areas in Revenue. Further proposals are at present under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that under the changed approach initiated in 1996, in order to speed tip the earlier prosecution approach and improve the chances for successful prosecutions, Revenue took over in most tax cases the work previously handled by the Garda Sochána, including the taking of statements and preparing of reports for direct referral to the DPP. The investigation branch in the office of the chief inspector of taxes was restructured <Col N="698" /> for this purpose. A senior officer of the DPP's office has been made available to assist Revenue. Necessary training of staff has taken place and operating manuals have been prepared. A case admissions committee evaluates cases by reference to criteria which are outlined in the Code of Practice for Revenue Auditors published in 1998.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that, while they are satisfied with the development of the prosecution policy to date and that it has speeded up the number of cases going before the courts, the procedures are under constant review in consultation with the DPP's office with a view to further improvements. It should be noted that there is a particularly heavy burden of proof for criminal prosecution and this makes it an onerous task.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the replies to the specific queries raised by the Deputy are as follows.</P>
    <P>Numbers of prosecutions regarding section 9 of the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993: There are two elements to a possible offence under this section &ndash; (i) the knowing and wilful commission of a revenue offence before 5 April 1991 and (ii) the failure to make an amnesty declaration or a correct amnesty declaration.</P>
    <P>Where these conditions appear to be present in a case and the requisite evidence to ground a successful prosecution may, be available, the possibility of prosecution under section 9 is investigated. Of the 24 cases at present under examination for possible prosecution ten cases have circumstances which appear to come within section 9. If sufficient evidence can be assembled in a case the matter is referred to the DPP.</P>
    <P>Imprisonment for breach of the taxation code: Of the eight convictions since 1997 a suspended prison sentence was imposed in two cases. In the other six cases monetary fines were imposed by the courts. Whether a prison sentence is, or is not, imposed in the circumstances of any given case is a matter wholly for the courts.</P>
    <P>Time lapse between investigation and prosecution: In the cases in which investigations were begun by Revenue investigators over the last three years and which have come to trial, the average length of time that has elapsed from the initiation of the investigation to the hearing of the case in court has been approximately 17 months. No such case has been rejected by the DPP, or the courts, due to delay. Revenue investigators are very conscious of the need to complete investigations and prepare a report for the DPP in the shortest possible time so that issues are brought to trial with due expedition.</P>
    <P>Procedures in cases involving possible offences under Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993: In the published tax prosecution criteria of the Revenue Commissioners, which are the guidelines under which Revenue officers carry out their audit work, offences under the Waiver of Certain Tax Interest and Penalties Act, 1993, are included in the list of the types of tax <Col N="699" /> offences which are most likely to be prosecuted. From the cases submitted to it by audit and compliance districts, the case admissions committee in investigation branch selects the most suitable cases for investigation with a view to prosecution. The strength of available evidence, the degree of culpability, responsibility and experience of the alleged offender and the period of time that has elapsed since the alleged offence was discovered are among the factors to be weighed in deciding on a prosecution.</P>
    <P>Applications to Appeal Commissioners: There have been 14 applications to the appeals commissioners under section 5 of the Waiver of Tax Interest and Penalties Act, 1993, as follows:</P>

    <P>Number of files referred to the DPP since 1993: The detailed information sought by the Deputy about files referred to the DPP's office is not readily available. It will be forwarded to the Deputy when it comes to hand.</P>
    <P>Communication with the Office of the DPP: As indicated earlier, the Revenue Commissioners have been greatly assisted since 1997 by a senior officer from the DPP's office in developing the prosecution function. This arrangement facilitates prompt and efficient communication with the Office of the DPP and I understand that Revenue is very satisfied in that regard.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the passenger road service fuel relief scheme which dates back to section 10(8) of the Finance Act, 1957. I wish to make it clear to the Deputy that the scheme is not restricted to CIE alone. It is open to any operator providing passenger road services within the meaning of section 2 of the Road Transport Act, 1932, where the provider of such services is either licensed under the Act or exempted from such licensing. The board of CIE is exempt by virtue of section 24 of the Transport Act, 1958.</P>

I understand, however, that the formal complaint to the EU Commission was made by an umbrella group representing financial organisations in this country. The complaint alleges that the credit union movement in Ireland has benefited from preferential tax treatment by virtue of its exemption from corporation tax and its exemption from DIRT. The complaint asserts that this treatment of credit unions in Irish taxation law is contrary to EU law. The EU Commission is in the course of investigating this complaint, which I understand will involve consultation with my Department.</P>

      <P>Section 474 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for tax relief in respect of certain tuition fees paid to certain colleges in the State for full-time third level education. Section 474A provides for tax relief for fees paid to publicly funded colleges in other member states of the European Union for full-time third level education. Under section 474A, income tax relief, up to a maximum of £2,500 per year, is available in respect of tuition fees paid to a &ldquo;qualifying college&rdquo; for a &ldquo;qualifying course&rdquo;. A &ldquo;qualifying college&rdquo; is any university or similar institution of higher education in a member state of the European Union, other than this State, which is maintained or assisted from public funds. A &ldquo;qualifying course&rdquo; is a full-time undergraduate course of study in a qualifying college which is of at least two years duration other than a course in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine or in teacher training.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners do not have information about the status of Magee College, Derry, but if it is a qualifying college, as defined, and if the course is a qualifying course, as defined, income tax relief is available for tuition fees paid in respect of the course on the same terms as a qualifying college and course within the State. Relief is available at the standard rate of tax &ndash; currently 24%-22% from 6 April 2000. Relief is not available for any part of the tuition fees which are met directly or indirectly by grants, scholarships, or otherwise or administration or examination fees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision under the new drug payment scheme for the reimbursement of approved gluten free foods. The new scheme, with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family, was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme, DCSS, and drug refund scheme, DRS. The primary aim of the new drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes. The list of reimbursable food items to which persons registered under the drug payment scheme are entitled is, therefore, in line with those items available to medical card holders and includes breads, bread mixes, flours and pizza bases. It is considered that the range of such items available under State reimbursement schemes provides a reasonable choice and persons requiring items which are not reimbursable would be expected to meet the full cost of such items. There are no plans to include other coeliac foods in the common list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the per<Col N="704" /> son may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>

This function is in keeping with the boards' overall responsibilities under the Child Care Act, 1991, in regard to the promotion of the welfare of children and the provision of family support services. Funding of approximately £3.9 million &ndash; capital and revenue &ndash; was provided by the health boards towards these services in 1999 and approximately 600 facilities were funded. An additional £1.75 million is being provided in 2000. In addition, a small number of grants were paid to service providers <Col N="707" /> from my Department's 1999 national lottery allocation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was allocated £250 million to develop child care over the next seven years under the national development plan 2000-2006. This funding will facilitate the child care measures which were announced in budget 2000. These measures comprise the equal opportunities child care programme which includes grant supports to establish, upgrade, enhance and staff community based child care facilities; capital grants for private providers of child care catering for up to 20 child care places; and grants to develop local child care networks.</P>
      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is finalising the criteria and the eligibility requirements for the grant schemes at present and it intends to begin promoting the various initiatives shortly in the national media.</P>
      <P>In addition, it was announced in budget 2000 that accelerated capital allowances, at the rate of 100% in the first year, will apply in relation to expenditure incurred on and from 1 December 1999 on child care facilities which meet the required standards as provided under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996. The allowances are subject to clearance by the EU Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of payment by the patient does not arise where a person is attending a general practitioner or consultant as a public patient. In regard to private consultations and services, my Department has no role or function in the setting or monitoring of private fees of general practitioners or consultants. Accordingly, they may fix their charges according to what they believe is reasonable either generally or with regard to the circumstances of individual patients. In all cases where the patient believes himself or herself to be overcharged for the service provided they should, in the first instance, query the matter with the doctor concerned and if they are unhappy with the explanation given they can ultimately go elsewhere. That consideration is likely to be a most important one for doctors in terms of deciding their fee structure.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment in the Dublin 8 area is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board experienced difficulties in the provision of services in their regional orthodontic unit at St James's Hospital in the past few months. I understand these difficulties were caused by the consultant orthodontist's unilateral decision to withdraw from the provision of orthodontic assessments, orthodontic <Col N="711" /> opinions and the commencement of orthodontic appliance therapy for new patients. The position was exacerbated by the withdrawal of consultant cover and the consultant orthodontist's refusal to provide guidance to dental clinicians regarding orthodontic procedures. The consultant orthodontist's actions led to her suspension from duty with effect from 4 November 1999.</P>
    <P>At the subsequent request of the Eastern Health Board, my predecessor in office terminated the suspension of the consultant orthodontist in question and she resumed duty on Monday 7 February 2000. Normal service will be resumed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The current waiting list for orthodontic assessment in area 8 consists of 19 patients in category A and 869 patients in category B. I regret to inform the Deputy that the other statistical information requested is not maintained by the Eastern Health Board in the form required.</P>

      <P>The Western Health Board has indicated that the provision of a community nursing unit in Ballinrobe, County Mayo is one of its priorities as part of the development of services for older people in the region. In this connection, the board is examining a number of options for siting the unit, including the location referred to by the Deputy. This proposal will be considered in the context of capital funding available under the national development plan and the Western Health Board's other priority developments.</P>

      <P>Concern has been expressed to the General Medical Council regarding changes for limited registration. However, the position is that the GMC is the statutory authority which registers all medical practitioners in the UK. Until 1 January 2000 non-EU nationals, with Irish primary medical qualifications, were eligible to apply for limited registration in the UK. Following a review by <Col N="712" /> the GMC, all non-EU doctors who wish to apply for limited registration are now required to either pass a test of professional knowledge and skill, known as the PLAB test, or provide other objective evidence of their capability for medical practice in the UK.</P>
      <P>The new arrangement is not as a result of any concern in relation to the standards of undergraduate medical education in this country. According to the GMC, this new arrangement reflects overall policy that, subject to the constraints imposed by UK and EU law, registration should be based, not on doctors' place of qualification, but on an assessment of their knowledge and skill at the point of registration. Under the new arrangement the position of EU nationals with Irish primary qualifications, and of other doctors with enforceable Community rights, are not affected.</P>

      <P>The Health Research Board is the statutory body with responsibility for health research in Ireland. Its functions are to promote, assist, commission or conduct medical, health and health services research and such epidemiological research as may appropriately be carried out at national level, to assist and support other health agencies in promoting or conducting epidemiological research and to liaise and co-operate with other research bodies in Ireland or elsewhere in promoting, commissioning or conducting relevant research.</P>
      <P>In 1999 the Health Research Board allocation was £5.170 million, of which £320,000 was spent on cancer research. Under the terms of the action plan for the implementation of the national cancer strategy, the board also received additional funding of £320,000 for cancer research in respect of period 1997-2000 inclusive.</P>
      <P>The board's revenue allocation for 2000 is £6.803 million. In addition I am also allocating £700,000 capital funding for research equipment. Both of these figures represent increases of approximately 32% and 40% respectively over last year's figures.</P>
      <P>The National Cancer Registry Board also plays a key role in establishing a comprehensive and systematic picture of trends in cancer illnesses and deaths in Ireland. In 1999, the board's funding was £724,000, which has been increased to £800,000 this year.</P>

      <P>I have no plans at present to introduce a universal immunisation programme for hepatitis B.</P>
      <P>My Department's policy on immunisations is guided by the advice of the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The committee states that, despite evidence of undernotification, examination of the recent epidemiological data in Ireland indicates a low prevalence of hepatitis B, in line with other northern European countries. Immunisation is therefore recommended only for individuals who are at increased risk of hepatitis B because of their occupation, lifestyle or other factors, such as close contact with a case or carrier. The committee states that it will continue to review the policy on hepatitis B immunisation in the light of changing epidemiological data and evidence of the effectiveness of delivery of immunisation against this disease.</P>
      <P>A national study into the prevalence of hepatitis B in the population has recently been completed. The study indicated that Ireland has a very low endemicity for hepatitis B, approximately one in 200 of the population, which is much lower than that found in other low endemicity northern European countries. The authors of the study concluded that the current national hepatitis B immunisation policy, that is, selective immunisation of high risk individuals, is appropriate at present and recommend that it continue.</P>

      <Col N="717" /> Arrangements for the provision of diagnostic imaging services at Cork University Hospital are the statutory responsibility of the Southern Health Board. It is a matter for the board to ensure that these arrangements are in line with any relevant procedures governing public procurement and in this regard I have asked the board to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the recent renewal of the contract for the provision of MRI scans. The board has assured me that the arrangements currently in place facilitate improved access for patients who would otherwise need to travel to Dublin for access to MRI facilities to this specialised service and are cost effective in terms of the overall cost to the board.</P>
    <P>My Department is in regular contact with the Southern Health Board concerning development priorities and has worked to address a large capital investment programme at Cork University Hospital.

      <P>As there is no directive currently in force dealing specifically with ambulances, I take the Deputy's question to refer to EN 1789 which is a European standard published by CEN &ndash; the European Committee for Standardisation. CEN was mandated to develop a European standard for road ambulances which was ratified in September 1999 as EN 1789: 1999 Medical vehicles and their equipment &ndash; Road ambulances.</P>
      <P>This standard specifies requirements for the design and performance of road ambulances. Requirements are specified for three categories of vehicles which are described in EN 1789 as the patient transport ambulance, the emergency ambulance and the mobile intensive care unit. The standard specifies that one stretcher should be carried in each type of ambulance.</P>

    <P>EU directives define the essential requirements that particular products must meet when they are placed on the market. Compliance with a relevant European standard may provide evidence of con<Col N="718" /> formity to the essential requirements of a directive. However, compliance with standards remains voluntary, and manufacturers are free to choose any other technical solution that provides compliance with the essential requirements. As with other products, it is a matter for health boards to ensure that ambulances purchased by them meet the essential requirements of any relevant directives in force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, due to the manner in which statistics are currently maintained, the information the Deputy is seeking is not readily available. The absence of comparable statistics across health boards in relation to inter-country assessment waiting times and procedures is one of the issues identified in the recent review of inter-country adoption assessments. The review entitled &ldquo;Towards a Standardised Framework for Inter-Country Adoption Assessment Procedures&rdquo;  provides a comprehensive overview of the existing inter-country adoption services and assessment procedures in all health board areas. It also provides an analysis of best practice in the area of assessment and a clear agenda for moving forward.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be pleased to note a number of developments over the past number of months which will help develop and promote an efficient and effective inter-country adoption process across all health boards. A working group has been established to prioritise and plan implementation of the report's recommendations. This includes recommendations in relation to information technology standards, which will ensure timely and accurate national statistics on waiting times and other important management information statistics in the future.</P>
      <P>An additional £500,000 was allocated to health boards in 1999, of which £213,000 was allocated to the Eastern Health Board. A further £500,000 is being made available to health boards in 2000, of which £236,000 of the total has been allocated to the Eastern Health Board. This represents almost a doubling of resources in the area of inter-country adoption services.</P>
      <P>A training seminar on the standardised framework for inter-country adoption assessment was held in November 1999, which was attended by all social work practitioners and many managers in inter-country adoption services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Interim guidance on the implementation of new framework has been provided to all social <Col N="719" /> work staff and a comprehensive Guide for Practitioners on the standardised framework for inter-country adoption assessment procedures is currently being commissioned.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these initiatives will help to streamline the assessment process and to ensure standard assessment procedures across the country. In due course, this should result in waiting times being reduced to acceptable levels in all board areas.</P>

This survey will be part of a systematic collection of oral health status information for the whole population including children and special need groups that is being put in place by health boards and the Department of Health and Children in association with the oral health services research centre, University College Cork.</P>
      <P>One of the main barriers to maintaining good oral health in the medical card population was lack of access to appropriate dental care. This barrier has been removed with the full implementation of the dental treatment services scheme (DTSS) for medical card holders from 1 January 2000.</P>

      <P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, provide for notification to, and inspection by, health boards of pre-school services. The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, crèches, child-minders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on, or proposing to carry on, a pre-school service, rather than to register. On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person.</P>
      <P>Under Article 7 of these regulations, a person carrying on a pre-school service is required to &ldquo;ensure that a sufficient number of competent adults are supervising the pre-school children in the service at all times.&rdquo;  A competent adult is defined as a person who has appropriate experience in caring for children under six years of age and/or who has an appropriate qualification in child care and is a suitable person to care for children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The child care strategy referred to in the National Development Plan, 2000-06, in which the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a lead role and which will be facilitated by the national child care infrastructure, has among its objectives an increase in the quantity of childcare places and also an improvement in the quality of services available. In this context, the range of supports being developed includes <Col N="721" /> training supports for community based childcare services and supports to enhance the national voluntary child care organisations which provide advice, support and training to child care service providers.</P>
    <P>I might add that qualifications and training in the child care sector are among the issues addressed in the White Paper on early childhood Education, &ldquo;Ready to Learn&rdquo;, which was launched recently by the Minister for Education and Science.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the relevant hospital authorities and have been informed that the Mater Misericordiae Hospital has two echo cardiographic machines. Beaumont Hospital has one echo machine which has been in operation since 1986 and is due to be replaced by a new machine within the next two weeks. The hospital is also purchasing a second echo machine, which it hopes will be in place in March 2000. At present James Connolly Memorial Hospital does not have an echo machine on site and patients are transferred to the Mater Hospital when required. The hospital has, however identified the need for such a machine on site and the additional funding of £160,000 will be included in a submission on priority equipment needs to my Department. On receipt of this submission, it will be considered within the context of the hospital's overall priorities for the year 2000 and the many competing demands within the acute sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present waiting time for a routine out patient appointment is 20 weeks in Beaumont Hospital. Once the second echo machine is oper<Col N="722" /> ational, the hospital hopes to provide extra sessions on Saturdays for a limited period in order to bring forward the longer appointment dates and reduce waiting times substantially. Due to the large number of emergency cardiac patients admitted to the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, the current out patient waiting time at that hospital is six months.</P>

The lump sum was also payable to student public health nurses, post registration student nurses and pupil midwives. It was not payable to student nurses participating in the nursing registration/diploma programmes or to agency nurses.</P>
      <P>The qualifying date for payment of the lump sum was 5 November 1999. The Nursing Alliance has raised queries with the health service employers agency (HSEA) regarding temporary/part-time nurses who may not have worked on that date.

      <P>I have asked the South Eastern Health Board about the matter raised by the Deputy and they have advised that the position is as follows. Currently, general practitioners working in Fethard, Duncannon, Newbawn and Taghmon operate on a one-in-two rota during weekdays and bank holiday periods. Since October 1998, they have <Col N="724" /> operated on a one-in-four rota during the weekend period of Saturday mid-day to 8 a.m. Monday.</P>
      <P>The furthest distance from health centre to health centre in this one-in-four rota is 16 miles, which takes approximately 25 minutes travel time. The general practitioners involved acknowledged that there were some minor communications difficulties and, indeed, met with local residents' groups to address and resolve those difficulties since they are concerned to ensure the provision of a quality out of hours service to their patients.</P>
      <P>I should add that since the commencement of their one-in-four rota there has been no recorded complaint from any patient in the geographical area concerned. Further, the health board keeps the matter of services under ongoing review in order to ensure that general practitioners meet their contracted responsibilities to their patients. However, if the Deputy is aware of any specific case or complaint, I will be happy to have the matter further examined by the board.</P>

      <P>The Hospital's Trust (1940) Limited was a private company which went into voluntary liquidation in 1987. In 1988 the Government decided that the unclaimed prize money of sweepstakes promoted by Hospital's Trust (1940) Limited should be used to benefit former employees. In December 1990 the Public Hospitals (Amendment) Act, 1990, enabled the then Minister for Health to take over approximately £481,000 in unclaimed sweepstake prize money, together with accrued interest, for distribution to former employees of the company.</P>
      <P>The money was distributed to the two categories of former employees of the Hospital's Trust (1940) Limited generally regarded as being the most seriously disadvantaged when the company ceased trading. The two groups were former employees still living who opted for early retirement in 1978 or later and from whom an<i> ex-gratia</i> element of pension entitlement was withdrawn in 1987 and former employees still living who were made redundant when the company was placed in voluntary liquidation in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Spouses of deceased persons belonging to either of the above categories were eligible to receive the amount which the deceased person would have been qualified to receive. Persons in category 1 received a flat rate payment of £1,000. The balance of moneys available after category 1 payments were finalised was distributed among persons in category 2 on the age and service weighted basis used to calculate statutory redundancy payments. The money was distributed in <Col N="725" /> 1990 and 1991 to 282 persons on receipt of valid application forms. These payments were made on a once-off basis as part of a special arrangement at the time.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the authorities of individual agencies to ensure that hospital bed complements are managed in an effective and efficient manner. The implementation of, and adherence to, admission and discharge policies are an essential element of the management process. These policies include an assessment of the scale and scope of the provision of laboratory and X-ray department services including whether such services are required to operate on a twenty-four hour basis and the determination of what, if any, impact extended hours in these areas would have on an agency's discharge policy.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy may wish to note that my Department is constantly looking at ways in which hospitals can be more efficient and effective and in this regard my Department has already launched the clinicians in management initiative.

      <P>It is anticipated that a new conjugate vaccine to protect against group C meningococcal disease should be licensed and available for use in Ireland in the summer of this year. The vaccine will be incorporated into the primary childhood immunisation programme and will also be given to older children and young people in a catch-up programme.</P>
      <P>It is expected that general practitioners will have a significant role in the delivery of this vaccine, particularly to infants and pre-school children. The Health Service Employers Agency has been asked to convene discussions with general practitioners' representatives about their involvement in these arrangements.</P>

    <P>The start date of each appointment is the date of appointment with the exception of the board of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA. The establishment date for the ERHA is 1 March 2000. However, the board of the new authority is meeting informally prior to the establishment date in order to facilitate the transfer of functions from the Eastern Health Board, EHB, to the new authority.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's question regarding the qualifications and expertise relevant to each appointment, arrangements for the selection of board members vary considerably. In the case of some boards, for example, health boards and An Bord Altranais, the majority of members are elected representatives. In other cases the nominating bodies for certain members are laid down by statute, for example, St. James's Hospital board. In further cases it has been the practice to consult with appropriate organisations and following such consultations draw up a list of persons suitable for appointment, for example, Comhairle na nÓspidéal and Beaumont Hospital board.</P>
    <P>In nominating any board under the aegis of the Department the needs of the board itself are taken into account and the Minister of the day will have consulted widely before making nominations even where no procedure is laid down.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the overall range of medical and surgical services available at Waterford Regional Hospital has been greatly expanded in recent years.  New regional specialties of dermatology, nephrology, rheumatology, vascular surgery and oncology have been established. A trauma orthopaedic service has also been developed on site.  Additional consultant appointments will be made this year in haematology and microbiology. These developments have been made possible by an increase of over £9.5 million in revenue funding for the hospital in the last three years and by the completion of major phased capital works on the site at a total cost of some £65 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> The board's service plan for 2000 indicates that it will be assessing the need for the provision of rehabilitation services and the appointment of a consultant neurologist in that context. My Department will continue to work with the South Eastern Health Board management in this ongoing process of identifying and addressing priorities for the continuing development of services at the hospital in the context of available funding.</P>

      <P>On the capital side, I have provided increased funding in the area of services for older people since coming into office and this has facilitated the development of new community nursing units in locations such as Dublin, Fermoy, Achill, Killybegs, Virginia, Ballyconnell, Birr and Clonmel. On the revenue side, I am providing funding to operate these new faciliteis when they become ready to open. I am also providing revenue funding to improve staff ratios in long-stay units to compensate for increased levels of dependency.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, the health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. There are three rates of subvention payable, £70, £95 and £120, in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high and maximum, which are eligible for subvention. Since coming into office, this Government has increased the level of funding on subventions from £17 million in 1997 to approximately £38 million in 2000. This additional funding has been made available to provide for, <i>inter alia, </i>increases in the number of people in receipt of subventions, and higher overall levels of dependency resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he will take to ensure that persons requiring general practitioner care will not be prevented from receiving it as a result of their exclusion from the medical card scheme; and if he will examine the present income limits for medical cards in view of recent disclosures that Irish people have one of the highest rates of mortality in Europe.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Ireland does have a mortality rate higher than the EU average, it is important to recognise that health status and mortality rates are influenced by several factors. These include people's natural endowment; the physical and emotional nurturing they receive; the lifestyle they adopt; the degree to which the health services and the wider environment support and complement their attempts to prevent disease and to improve their health as well as the access they have to quality <Col N="735" /> health and personal social services in times of need. International research has found that there are large differentials in mortality and morbidity between the higher and lower socio-economic groups and the conclusions from this research are that health inequalities are primarily a consequence of material differences in living standards.</P>
    <P>The health strategy recognised that the pursuit of equity &ndash; one of the main principles underlying the strategy &ndash; must extend beyond the question of access to services and must also be concerned with variations in health status between groups. The strategy sets a framework for reorienting the health services to achieve health and social gain with a particular emphasis on improving the situation of people in the lower socio-economic groups.</P>
    <P>A range of measures are in place to reduce health inequalities and improve health status and mortality rates. These include the national cancer strategy, the national cardiovascular health strategy and the waiting list initiative. My Department's new health promotion strategy for the years 2000 to 2005 is informed by the findings of the national health and lifestyles surveys, SLAN. All these measures include specific strategic aims and objectives for the reduction of health inequalities.</P>
    <P>Many of the causal factors of health inequalities, such as poverty and unemployment, are outside the direct control of the health services. This has been recognised in the establishment of structures such as the Cabinet committee on social inclusion, the associated senior officials social inclusion group and the NAPS interdepartmental group, which provides the principal strategic focus for the national anti-poverty strategy. In the context of the new partnership agreement, Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my Department will take part in a group to consider the setting of health targets to be included in the next phase of the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan includes an amount of £4.7 billion for the improvement and maintenance of the national road network in the period 2000 to 2006. This is a threefold increase in the level of investment in national roads provided for in the period 1994 to 1999. This funding will ensure the development by 2006 of the major inter-urban routes to motorway-high quality dual carriageway standard; further major improvements on other <Col N="737" /> national primary routes, and improvement of national secondary roads, with emphasis on routes which are of particular importance to economic and regional development, including links to the strategic corridors, roads serving key ports, airports, tourists areas, industry and multi-purpose roads. Further details of this national roads strategy are set out in the national development plan and will be simplified in the operational programme for economic and social infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Addressing urban transport needs in the greater Dublin area will be a major priority during the period to 2006. An allocation of £1,585 million is being provided over the period of the national development plan for public transport and traffic management and substantial additional resources will also be made available for major investment, including completion of the M50, Dublin Port access tunnel and other national road projects. These measures will, on completion, facilitate exporters in gaining access to overseas destinations through Dublin Port and Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>In so far as rail is concerned, CIE is being provided with very substantial resources for the maintenance and renewal of the railway infrastructure and the operation of rail services. The national development plan makes provision for an investment of £500 million in mainline rail during the period 2000 to 2006. This includes a sum of £350 million for the continuation of the railway safety programme and a further £150 million for non-safety related investment such as the purchase of new rolling stock, the upgrading of railway stations and the renewal of railway plant and equipment. It is planned that by end 2003 practically all the track on intercity routes will be converted to continuously welded rail. In addition to track renewal substantial investment is being made in the renewal of bridges and fencing and in the upgrading of level crossings. This programme should facilitate the provision of improved services and result in reductions in journey times on all mainline services.</P>

      <P>A brief for a major extension of the Lough Mask regional water supply scheme to serve Westport, Newport, Mulranny, Murrisk, and Louisburg, at an estimated cost of almost £21 million, was received in my Department in April 1998. Mayo County Council was subsequently requested to review the proposals in light of approvals of water supply augmentation schemes for Newport and Mulranny under the serviced land initiative. Following this review, the council intends to advance the proposal on a phased basis and has submitted a revised brief for phase I, involving an extension from Shrah to Westport at an estimated cost of £7 million. This phase is fifth on the list of water supply schemes submitted to my Department by Mayo County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists will be taken into account in the framing of water services investment programmes for this and future years under the National Development Plan, 2000-06.</P>
      <P>The group water scheme referred to were advised in response to their request for a meeting to discuss the upgrading of their scheme that the matter was appropriate to the rural water programme, responsibility for which has been devolved to the local authorities.</P>

      <P>Local authorities were advised in February 1994 that full central heating should be provided in all new local authority housing as part of the overall cost of the schemes. The choice of heating system and fuel should be determined by the local authority primarily by reference to expected capital and running costs, including possible servicing and maintenance costs, and the preference of the likely occupants. Social housing design guidelines issued in September 1999 also advised that the most usual choice of heating system will be a standard central heating system based on a single boiler for dwellings and heat distribution by hot water to radiators. Designers were also advised that if they wish they could <Col N="739" /> consider the possibility of utilising solar panels to provide a proportion of water and space heating, where economic and practicable.</P>
      <P>Where capital funding is being provided under the remedial works scheme to assist authorities to carry out major structural works to designated estates, the installation of central heating in these houses may form part of the works undertaken.</P>
      <P>The recent report, Homes for the 21st Century, launched on 2 February 2000, laid particular emphasis on energy efficiency in heating homes. The social housing design guidelines particularly encourage energy efficiency in the construction of local authority housing and during the lifetime of the housing. The guidelines also encourage the optimisation of the energy performance of the house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the tenant purchase scheme, a tenant of a local authority house for at least one year may apply to the local authority to purchase the house. The price of the house is based on its market value, as determined by the local authority. Valuations stand for such period, not exceeding 12 months, as the local authority sees fit. Any increase in the market value due to improvements by the tenant is disregarded in calculating the price. In order to assist tenants to purchase their homes, a discount of 3% of the value of the house is allowed for each year of tenancy, up to a maximum discount of 30% with a further discount of £3,000. Thus, a local authority house with a market value of £60,000 would be available for purchase by a tenant of ten years standing at £39,000 with the price fixed for up to 12 months. Furthermore, a shared ownership option is available to enable a tenant to buy a share in the house now and the remainder within 25 years.</P>
      <P>The proceeds of the sale of local authority houses to tenants are used to part fund the local authority housing programme. I consider that the terms of the present scheme strike a reasonable balance between the aspirations of existing tenants to own their homes and the needs of those on local authority waiting lists. I have, therefore, no proposals to amend the terms of the current scheme.</P>

The draft guidelines recommended that, pending the preparation and adoption of development plan policies by local authorities, the floorspace cap of 3,000 square metres, which was introduced on supermarket development, should be retained in the rest of the State outside Dublin. Within the greater Dublin area, it is recommended that the floorspace cap be increased to 3,500 square metres. When publishing the draft guidelines, the carrying out of a further study of the economic effect of the implementation of the guidelines was announced. This study commenced in early January and is expected to be completed by the end of March 2000.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Provisional approval to the funding of an eight bay permanent halting site and caretaker's facility at Lower Dodder Road was given by my Department to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown <Col N="743" /> County Council in February 1997. However, the council subsequently sought my consent for the appropriation, for the purposes of the housing Acts, of the land on which the halting site was to be located. This was necessary as the local authority was in effect proposing to use the site for purposes other than that for which it had originally been acquired.</P>
      <P>When considering the council's request for my consent to the appropriation of the land for housing purposes I reviewed all aspects of the issue, including the general suitability of the location for housing and related development. Dublin Corporation had purchased the site in 1980 as part of its policy to provide a Dodder Valley parkway. However, under the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993, there was a redrawing of the local authority boundaries in the area with effect from 1 January 1994 and the site became part of the functional area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. Planning permission for housing development on the site had been refused by Dublin Corporation, then the planning authority for the area, and on appeal by An Bord Pleanála, on the grounds that it was the objective of the corporation as expressed in its development plan then in force to secure the reservation as open space of lands abutting the River Dodder. An Bord Pleanála found that the site, while separated from the river by Dodder Road Lower, was an integral part of the river valley and the proposed development would have taken from the open character of the area, interfered with views and prospects regarded as being of special amenity value and inhibited the satisfactory achievement of the local authority's objective.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the purposes for which the land had previously been appropriated, the history of flooding associated with the site and the fact that the proposed site was at the intersection of the boundaries of three local authorities, I considered, in all the circumstances of this case, that it would, on balance, be inappropriate to give consent to the appropriation of the land for housing purposes.</P>
      <P>As regards the issue of traveller accommodation generally, I reaffirm my commitment to providing the necessary framework and support, legislative and financial, to accelerate the provision of accommodation. The Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, requires all relevant housing authorities to draw up and adopt five year traveller accommodation programmes by 31 March 2000. I am confident that these programmes, when adopted, will advance the provision of accommodation to meet the needs of travellers.</P>

      <P>Local authorities were advised in the new social housing design guidelines issued by my Department in September 1999 that they should consider ways to facilitate and encourage the provision of services and amenities, including community buildings, either within or adjacent to the site of proposed schemes. The type of building to be provided should be based on needs identified in consultation with the residents. They were advised that funding from scheme budgets is limited and relates to the size and nature of individual schemes and that additional sources of funding and the possibility of shared use of facilities with residents of adjacent developments should be investigated so as to ensure the best and most appropriate provision is made. While the provision of community facilities in new local authority housing schemes is a matter for individual local authorities in the first instance, any proposals which may be put to my Department will be considered on a scheme by scheme basis.</P>

An Bord Pleanála is a prescribed authority under section 21 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, as amended, and as such, each planning authority must send to An Bord Pleanála copies of any draft or variation of a development plan it has prepared. Copies of development plans for each area are therefore available to board members in arriving at their decisions. Board members also have an inspector's report on each appeal. I have taken a variety of measures to ensure the board is adequately resourced. The number of board members has been increased from six to ten. I approved all the board's proposals for additional staffing in 1998 and 1999. The board's Exchequer grant almost doubled during the period 1995 to 1999, and has been further increased in 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment of litter wardens is a matter for individual local authorities within each authority's current authorised staffing level and is one in which I have no function. Any proposal by <Col N="749" /> a local authority to create additional posts over and above this authorised level may be implemented if approved by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government; every request for such a sanction is considered on its merits.</P>
      <P>In relation to funding, it is open to local authorities to utilise resources available from the local government fund, as well as other general sources of local authority funding, to intensify enforcement and education activity in relation to litter and waste management. In addition, I have allocated a total of almost £1 million to local authorities in the last three years for public education and awareness initiatives against litter and I intend to allocate further grants in the current year. My Department also provides financial support for the An Taisce-led project, National Spring Clean, aimed at raising public awareness and participation in local anti-litter clean-ups and awareness actions to improve the local environment; the project includes a central role for local authorities and will run again in 2000. In these circumstances, I have no proposals to introduce a new grant along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Last December, the Minister Deputy Dempsey, and I announced details of a new, integrated national awareness campaign which encourages individual action and shared responsibility towards the environment. The campaign, The Environment, It's Easy to Make a Difference, is a major public information initiative which will continue during the course of this year and will address key environmental themes, including litter and waste, as well as water quality, water conservation, air quality and climate change.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, primary responsibility for the development and implementation of management and enforcement responses to deal with the litter problem rests with local authorities under the Litter Pollution Act, 1997. I am satisfied that local authorities are extending their use of the enhanced powers available to them under the Act to combat litter. Statistical returns for the first half of 1999, the most recent national figures available, show further increases in the number of litter wardens employed, prosecutions taken and on-the-spot fines issued. These figures are available in the Library.</P>

Castlebar UDC sought funding in 2000 under the specific improvements grants scheme for three projects: Mountain View  &ndash; distributor road; Barrack Bridge &ndash; Castle Street link road and McHale Road, Castlebar. These applications, with all other applications under the specific improvement grants scheme, were considered in my Department, having regard to the need to prioritise projects, to competing demands from other local authorities and to the funds available for the scheme in 2000. The three projects mentioned were not among the Mayo local authorities' ten projects selected for funding in 2000 totalling £2,295,000. The total grant allocation to the Mayo authorities, announced on 31 January, is some £12.4 million.</P>

      <P>In January 1999, a dedicated public private partnerships &ndash; PPP &ndash; unit was established in my Department to promote and develop the PPP approach in sectors where infrastructure or service provision takes place. The unit is headed by a principal officer and has five staff, one part-time. Other line sections in the Department overseeing capital investment programmes are also involved in the delivery of the PPP programme. In addition, the National Roads Authority which has responsibility for the development and delivery of the PPP programme for roads, recruited a dedicated PPP manager during 1999.</P>
      <P>Effort is being concentrated on the development of PPP projects in the roads, water services and solid waste sectors. The national development plan has set a minimum target of £1.55 billion for PPP projects involving private finance in these sectors. Other forms of public-private partnership arrangements which do not involve private finance will also make a significant contribution to the delivery of the national development plan. Work is progressing on a series of pilot projects in these sectors which will allow us to develop guidance and standard documentation to facilitate the more general use of the PPP approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also anticipated that PPP arrangements may offer benefits for other areas of infrastructure development and service delivery. The new system of car testing is being provided under a concession contract with the Department, and <Col N="751" /> similar arrangements will apply to the delivery of the new driver's theory test. It is also proposed to examine the feasibility of PPP options in the housing sector, and local authorities have been invited to submit proposals for PPP projects in other areas of their functional responsibilities. I have established a PPP fund of £5 million over the next three years to assist local authorities with the investigation and set up costs of PPP projects outside the main investment programmes.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the PPP approach has an important role to play in the coming years in major infrastructural projects and other smaller projects at local level. Public-private partnerships can offer better value for money and speedier delivery of services to the public and I am firmly committed to promoting and developing this approach, which I will allow the private and public sectors to work together to the ultimate benefit of the public.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to the issue of child benefit entitlements and multiple births is as follows. Prior to the introduction of the Social Welfare Act, 1998, child benefit was payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children were born together. In the case of twins, child benefit was paid at the normal rate but a grant of £500 was payable at the birth of twins and further grants of £500 were payable when the twins reached the ages of four and 12.</P>
      <P>I introduced two key additional measures in the Social Welfare Act, 1998, in fulfilment of our pre-election commitments. The rate of child benefit payable in respect of twins was increased to 150% of the normal rate. In the run-up to the election we promised to increase child benefit for twins by 50% and we carried this out. The £500 grants, which previously were confined to families with twins, were extended to also include families with multiple births of three or more children. These measures took effect in September 1998 at a full-year cost of some £4.8 million.</P>
      <P>In the interim, I have provided for very substantial additional investments in the child benefit scheme. The 1999 budget provided for an additional full year investment in the scheme of over £40 million, while the recent budget provides for a full year investment of almost £106 million. From September this year, the basic child benefit monthly rates will have risen to £42.50 in respect of the first two children and £56 in respect of the third and subsequent children. These improvements will benefit all families with children, including families with twins, and represent the most effective use of the available resources.</P>

      <P>As announced in budget 2000, an annual allocation of £5 million has been provided for the Department to support provision of out-of-school hours and child care services in disadvantaged communities. It is envisaged that the funding will mainly be made available to the projects funded under the community development support programmes, CDSP, namely community development pro<Col N="753" /> gramme, family and community services resource centre programme, and core-funded community and family support groups programme.</P>
      <P>The report of the interdepartmental committee on child care recommended that funding be provided totalling £5 million per annum for community groups towards developing out-of-school hours services. The committee anticipated that the provision of this funding to less well-off communities would address a number of issues, namely the provision of low cost out-of-school child care for parents in the paid labour market; practical support for children who need additional support to maintain their interest in school; the promotion of parental and community involvement in engaging young people in school and community life; and the provision of additional community based services for families.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the spirit of partnership which informs the way in which these community development programmes are managed in the Department, a working group representative of the local community development groups and other interests and expertise in the child care area is being established to advise on the detailed design of this scheme and, in particular, issues such as criteria for applications, technical support needs, service standards, staff issues, etc.</P>
      <P>The intention is that the working group will be convened shortly and the availability of the grants will be advertised more widely once the detailed scheme has been drawn up and agreed. Given the need to allow sufficient time for local groups to draw up and submit applications, I anticipate that I will be in a position to commence allocation of moneys under the scheme in April.</P>

      <P>The widowed parent's grant of £1,000 which I announced in the recent budget, is a new scheme designed to assist with the income support needs of widows and widowers with dependent children in the immediate aftermath of a bereavement. Provision for the new scheme is contained in the current Social Welfare Bill which has been published this week. Guidelines on the operation of the new scheme will be prepared as soon as the Bill is enacted and the guidelines will be published on the Department's website at www.welfare.ie. A copy will be forwarded to the Deputy at that stage.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the grant will be paid to a person who becomes a widow or widower on or after 1 December 1999 provided he or she has at least one qualified child normally residing with him or her. Where a person claims either a widow's or widower's contributory pension or a one parent family payment, the £1,000 grant will be paid automatically by cheque once the condition relating to child dependency is satisfied. Where a person is not pursuing a claim to such a payment, application for the grant may be made to the widows/widower's pension section of the Department at College Road, Sligo.</P>
      <P>A qualified child for the purpose of the grant is a child under 18 years or a child between the ages of 18 and 22 who is in full-time education.</P>

      <P>No payments were made by my Department to consultants in respect of public relations or information services during 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the nature and extent of this Department's work, dealing with 800,000 payments per week affecting 1.5 million people, much effort is required in the dissemination of information. In recent years there has been <i>in situ</i> in the Department a central information unit and press office which are responsible in this regard. About £600,000 was spent on the printing of information leaflets, booklets and application forms for use in connection with the Department's schemes. Approximately £450,000 is paid in respect of salaries and related costs for staff in the central information unit and press office. The above figure does not include the cost of staff throughout <Col N="755" /> the Department who may provide information at local level as part of their normal administrative duties. Approximately £750,000 is spent in the design and distribution of information leaflets and other materials, attendance at exhibitions and relevant information events, press, television and radio advertising, and miscellaneous expenses arising from the provision of information for customers and other organisations.</P>
    <P>Relevant expenditure by agencies under the aegis of my Department was as follows. The National Social Service Board spent approximately £875,000 on salaries and related costs during 1999 in respect of staff employed directly by the organisation. It also provided £1,769,000 towards the operating costs, including staff costs where relevant, of 85 citizen information centres throughout the country. Further costs included £55,000 for publicity and promotion of CIC services at local level, £140,000 for research and production of information publications, £100,000 towards the development of a new telephone information service pilot project, and £128,000 in the form of grants to other organisations and groups for approved information projects. A total of £9,870 was paid to consultants engaged in the production and launch of the annual report and in the preparation of a national conference.</P>
    <P>In the case of Pensions Board, relevant expenditure included £21,000 for staff costs and £3,300 for advertising and publicity. A further £18,000 was paid to consultants in respect of public relations services.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Combat Poverty Agency, relevant expenditure on public relations, press and information activities, including staff costs and payments to consultants, was £484,000. This figure is comprised of £100,000 for salaries and related costs, approximately £362,000 for operating costs of the information services, including publications, and £22,000 paid to consultants in respect of public relations and information services provided during 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for entitlement to the old age contributory pension requires that the claimant achieves a certain standard number of social insurance contributions. Where this standard is met, payment is made at the maximum rate. However, even where this standard has not been <Col N="756" /> achieved, payment can still be made in certain cases, but at a reduced rate.</P>
      <P>The actual rates of reduced pension are determined by the number of contributions paid. The level of pension payable in such cases is generally set as a percentage of the maximum payment.</P>
      <P>For example, a yearly average of 48 contributions is required in order to qualify for the maximum rate of old age contributory pension, currently £89 a week. Reduced rate pensions ranging between 92% and 98% of the maximum pension are paid where a person has a yearly average of between 20 and 47 contributions. As can be seen, these reduced rates of pension are not paid in direct proportion to the periods of insurance completed. This system was designed to ensure reduced rate contributory pensions were pitched higher than the maximum rate of old age non-contributory pension, thereby obviating the need to supplement the contributory pensions scheme by way of Exchequer subvention.</P>
      <P>Special measures have been introduced however in recent years, in light of difficulties which have arisen in the case of certain categories of workers, so as to extend entitlement to reduced rate contributory pensions to additional categories of workers. These special reduced rate pensions have been set at 25%, 50% and 75% of the maximum rate pension. These levels of reduced rate pensions are very favourable when account is taken of the relatively low number of contributions paid in these cases. For example, a person with a yearly average of, say, ten contributions, that is, one-fifth of the required standard for the maximum pension, can still receive a pension at half the maximum rate.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently been reviewing the qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions. One of the issues examined as part of this review is the current structure of the contributory rate bands. Arising from this review, I have made provision in the Social Welfare Bill, 2000, for an improvement in the structure of the payment bands for old age contributory and retirement pensions. Accordingly, some 38,000 pensioners currently receiving reduced rate of old age contributory and retirement pensions ranging from £81.90 to £86.60 a week will have their personal rate of payment increased to £94.10 a week, from May 2000. This will mean overall increases in personal weekly rates of pension of between £7.50 and £12.20 for people in this category.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the level of budgetary increases provided for recipients of reduced rate contributory pensions, this matter is determined by the existing percentage relationship between the reduced rate and the appropriate maximum rate of payment. This is the system which has operated since the introduction of the old age contributory pension scheme and it applies equally where the general increases are provided on a percentage basis or, as has been the case in recent years, on a monetary basis.</P>

      <P>A free travel pass automatically issues to all recipients of disability allowance at the time their disability allowance is awarded. A free travel companion pass is issued to recipients of disability allowance who are medically assessed as being unfit to travel alone. This type of pass allows any one person, aged 16 or over, to accompany the pass holder free of charge when travelling. An unrestricted free travel pass is available to recipients of disability allowance who have a mental disability; attend a long-term rehabilitative course recognised by this Department &ndash; the course must be full-time, that is from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday and last for at least three months; or are aged 16 to 18 and studying at a special second level school for people with a disability.</P>
      <P>This type of pass allows the pass holder to avail of free travel during the times normally restricted for standard free travel pass holders.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children operates a mobility allowance scheme to provide financial support for severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport. This allowance is available to applicants over the age of 16 and under 66 and may be used to finance taxi journeys. That Department also administers the motorised transport grants scheme to provide financial assistance for disabled persons who may need a car to obtain or retain employment or who are living in very isolated circumstances and have serious transport problems. Issues in relation to this area are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>I understand the Deputy is referring to the use of the free travel pass on transport services that are generally provided by the health boards and do not form part of the free travel scheme. I am not aware of a review group that is examining the possibility of extending free travel facilities to encompass these types of services.

      <P>The review of the carer's allowance, published in October 1998, recognised that the caring role can differ widely in relation to care intensity and the time and stress involved. It proposed the introduction of a new continual care payment to formally recognise those carers who are providing the highest levels of care and to promote care in the community. The review envisaged that the payment would be available to carers who provide care for those who are in the highest category of dependency and would be paid irrespective of income or social welfare entitlement.</P>
      <P>In order to differentiate between the levels of care and care needs, the review considered that a needs assessment encompassing the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced, and that the continual care payment could be introduced following the introduction of such an assessment. It was considered that a needs assessment would separate care needs from income support needs and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants for those in need of care. A working group, chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, and comprising membership from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the health boards has been established to examine the feasibility of introducing such a needs assessment approach.</P>
      <P>One of the key priorities identified in the Government's review of An Action Programme for the Millennium is to establish a pilot system of needs assessment for carers and people needing care to be operated by the health boards. This area is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children. The introduction of a continual care payment will be examined further following the outcome of this pilot scheme.</P>

      <P>The functions of the health and safety authority differ from those of my Department and many substances listed as hazardous by the authority would not be appropriate in the context of the occupational injuries scheme.</P>
      <P>A working group headed up by the Department's chief medical adviser has recently been established within the Department to review the current list of prescribed diseases and employments and to make recommendations on any appropriate amendments, deletions and additions that should be made to it in light of current medical knowledge and having regard to changing work environments. The working group, as part of its deliberations, will consider the question of whether employments which have exposure to glutaraldehyde should be added to the list.</P>

      <P>The income limit of £60 referred to by the Deputy was set by way of regu<Col N="760" /> lations in June 1993. At that time, once the income of the spouse of a welfare claimant exceeded that threshold, the qualified adult allowance was withdrawn in its entirety. In addition, the rate of child dependant allowance payable was halved. In the interim, however, I have introduced regulations which currently provide for the tapered withdrawal of the QAA for claimants of certain welfare payments where the spouse of the claimant has an income of between £60 and £105 per week.</P>
      <P>A range of further significant improvements to these tapering arrangements which will take effect from April of this year were announced in the recent budget. Most notably, these changes include: an adjustment in the income range over which the tapering arrangements apply from the current £60 &ndash; £105 to £70 &ndash; £135; an improvement in the withdrawal rate of QAA; the deferral of the reduction of 50% in the level of child dependant allowances, which currently takes effect when the income of the spouse exceeds £60, until such income exceeds £135.</P>
      <P>I am also providing for the extension of tapering arrangements to long-term welfare payments such as invalidity pension, retirement pension and old age contributory pension with effect from April 2000. In effect, this means that all relevant welfare schemes will now be covered by tapering arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the key priorities of this Government is to secure the future of our older people. The Social Welfare Bill, 2000, which I published yesterday, provides for investment of over £428 million in social welfare measures as well as reductions in PRSI and health contributions. This represents an increase of £128 million since the budget, aimed mainly at improving the position of pensioners, people with disabilities and those on low income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to pensioners, the following improvements will be put in place during the course of this year. In respect of pension rates the Government, in its review of An Action Programme for the Millennium, committed to advancing the goal of bringing the rate of the old age contributory and retirement pensions to £100 and to extending this commitment to all social welfare old age pensioners by 2002. We have also committed to increasing old age pension rates in line with increases in average earnings over the life-time of this Government. Accordingly, an increase of £7 per week in percentage terms between 7.9% and 8.9% has been provided for pensioners aged 66 and over and for people aged 65 on retirement and invalidity pensions. The maximum personal rate of the old age contribu<Col N="761" /> tory and retirement pensions will increase from £89 to £96 from May 2000 which equates to 30% of average industrial earnings. In addition, as part of the process of aligning the implementation of tax and social welfare increases by 2001, the improved payments will take effect four weeks earlier this year, from the beginning of May.</P>
    <P>Other significant improvements are: increases of £4 per week &ndash; in percentage terms between 5.2% and 5.6% &ndash; in the personal rates of other pensions; improvements in the structure of the payment bands for old age contributory and retirement pension &ndash; some 38,000 pensioners who are on reduced rate pensions ranging from £81.90 to £86.60 per week will have their personal rate of pension increased to £94.10 from May 2000 and this will mean overall increases in personal rates of pension of between £7.50 and £12.20 for people in this category; special increases in the qualified adult allowance &ndash; QAA &ndash;  rate of £4.70 per week for recipients of old age contributory pension and £7.50 per week for those on old age non-contributory pension &ndash; again, these will be effective from May 2000 and this is the first step, over a three year period, towards increasing the QAA rate to 70% of the main rate and extension of tapered QAA to recipients of old age contributory and retirement pensions from October 2000 to allow for an income range for a qualified adult of between £70 and £135.</P>
    <P>There will be new arrangements for the assessment of capital for non-contributory pensions. The first £10,000 of capital will be completely disregarded. Capital between £10,000 and £20,000 will be assessed on the basis of £1 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital; capital between £20,000 and £30,000 will be assessed on the basis of £2 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital, and capital above £30,000 will be assessed on the basis of £4 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital. These limits will be doubled in the case of a married couple.</P>
    <P>Certain people who paid contributions prior to 1953 under the old national insurance scheme have failed to qualify for an old age contributory pension. A special pension is, therefore, being introduced for those who have at least five years contributions paid since they entered social insurance. From May 2000, this new pension will be paid at 50%, that is, £48, of the maximum weekly personal rate. Equivalent increases for adult and child dependants will be paid, where applicable. Some 3,000 people are expected to gain from this measure.</P>
    <P>In respect of measures for carers from April 2000 disability benefit PRSI contribution conditions will be relaxed for former carers. From May 2000 there will be a rate increase. From June 2000 the annual respite care grant is to be increased by £100 to £300. From September 2000 the back-to-education allowance scheme is to be extended to carers after ceasing caring responsibilities. From October 2000 the free electricity allowance and free television licence schemes are to be extended to qualified carers. The introduction of a new carer's benefit scheme is also being provided for.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> The new carer's benefit scheme is specifically intended to support people who must leave the workforce to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention. The carer's benefit scheme involves two central elements. The first is a weekly income support payment to be operated and paid by this Department. This will be based on PRSI contributions paid by the carer. The second is the protection of the carer's employment rights for the duration of the caring period. The maximum duration of the scheme will be 15 months and the scheme will be introduced in October 2000.</P>
    <P>In respect of bereavement the current practice is that following the death of a recipient of a social welfare payment, his or her spouse continues to receive payment at the same rate for six weeks in circumstances where both spouses had a separate entitlement provided one or both of the entitlements was a non-contributory old age pension, a blind pension or a carer's allowance or where the payment includes a payment for a qualified adult. The payment does not arise where each spouse had an independent entitlement to an insurance based contributory pension. A number of additional measures are being introduced in the Social Welfare Bill, 2000, to address the position where the six weeks after death payment is not currently made or is paid at a reduced amount. These measures are as follows: where a pensioner and his or her spouse-partner are each in receipt of an old age contributory or retirement pension and if either party dies, a six weeks payment of the deceased person's pension will be made to the survivor. Under the current arrangements no after death payment is made in these cases.</P>
    <P>Where a person who is in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension or blind person's pension dies and his or her spouse-partner is in receipt of an old age contributory or retirement pension, a six weeks payment of the deceased person's non-contributory pension will be paid to the survivor in addition to his or her own personal rate of contributory pension. At present an amount equal to the qualified adult allowance only is payable.</P>
    <P>Where the only dependent child of a person in receipt of one-parent family payment dies, the parent will receive the same amount of the one-parent family payment for six weeks following the death of the child. At present the parent receives only the child dependant allowance.</P>
    <P>These measures will be introduced from April 2000 and will mean that a six weeks after death payment now applies in all circumstances under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>A review of the free schemes is being conducted by an official of the Department on secondment, as a visiting research fellow at the Policy Institute, Trinity College, Dublin. It is expected that the research conducted will be formally published by the Policy Institute in the Trinity Studies in Public Policy series in March 2000. In anticipation of the review findings, two specific measures were announced in budget 2000 as follows: the extension of the free schemes to all persons aged 75 years and over, regardless of <Col N="763" /> their income and household composition; the extension of the free electricity allowance and free television licence to all carers in receipt of the carer's allowance and to carers caring for people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. Both measures will be implemented from October 2000.</P>

    <P>The heritage divisions of my Department engage consultants from time to time as the need arises. These consultants are engaged to provide a particular service as an integral part of specific projects. These are paid from the individual operational subhead, and are not included in the above.</P>
    <P>In the time available to reply to this question, I regret that it would not have been possible to extract the information in respect of operational consultancies for the years in question, as this would have necessitated an examination by my officials of each file and expenditure subhead relating to every project undertaken by the heritage divisions over the last three years. Should the Deputy be interested in a particular project however, I would be happy to instruct my officials to elicit the relevant information.</P>
    <P>In 2000, the provision made in the Book of Estimates for general consultancies across the Department is £578,000. It is too early to say what proportion of this provision will be given to consultancies related to Dúchas.</P>
    <P>Other consultants will be engaged to assist in operational projects in 2000 as the need arises and will be charged to the operational subheads as heretofore.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to parliamentary Questions Nos. 79 and 87 of 2 February 2000 the Garda Commissioner, in 1999, commenced a comprehensive review of Garda &lsquo;clearance' arrangements. He established an internal working group to recommend improved &lsquo;clearance' arrangements which would allow An Garda Síochána to respond effectively to the increasing number of requests to expand the system. Arising from the recommendations of the working group, the Garda Commissioner has approved the establishment of an implementation group which will report on the practical and resource implications of establishing a new centralised unit to deal with these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for detailed allocation of Garda personnel and resources. They have informed me that the Donaghmede area consists of Clarehall, Donaghmede, St. Donaghs, Grangmore, Grange Abbey, New Grove, Millbrook, Newbury, Hollywell, the Donahies and the Beeches housing estates. It is located between two and three miles from Coolock Garda station. This area consists of approximately 18,000 people. It is a residential area with local authority houses in St Donagh's and Millbrook.</P>
      <P>The main amenities in the area include one church, junior and senior national schools, two community schools, railway station, community club and the Donaghmede shopping complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1973, numerous representations have been made by public representatives and residents' associations for a Garda station in Donaghmede. This was studied in detail, and it was decided to <Col N="769" /> increase the Garda strength in Coolock to provide a better police service for the area. The current strength of Coolock Garda station is 91.</P>
    <P>A Garda clinic opened in Donaghmede shopping centre on 11 December 1987 and is opened to the public when resources permit as follows: Monday&ndash;Tuesday&ndash;Saturday, 10 a.m. to 12 midday and 3 p.m. to 4 p.m.; Wednesday&ndash; Thursday&ndash;Friday, 1 a.m. to 12 midday, 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>
    <P>The Donaghmede area receives maximum Garda attention at all times from available resources.</P>
    <P>Crime in Donaghmede area has decreased over the past number of years which must be attributed to a significant degree to the ongoing efforts of the Garda.</P>
    <P>Even though there are problems in the Donaghmede area, they are not of a proportion which would require an additional Garda station. The allocation of additional personnel will be considered as extra resources become available and in the context of policing requirements nationally.</P>

      <P>On the 10 February 2000 a meeting took place at Castlebar Garda station between representatives of the probation and welfare service, health board, social services and local Garda management to co-ordinate measures in addressing the needs of these juveniles in a multi-agency approach. I am also informed that crime prevention measures have been stepped up in Castlebar, and that a special patrol involving detective and uniformed gardaí is deployed to curb juvenile crime.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the allocation of Garda resources is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.

      <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the term refugee applies to applicants who have been granted asylum following an examination of their application by reference to the definition of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; contained in the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees as amended by the 1967 protocol and as defined in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended. In this context where it is established that a well-founded fear of persecution, within the definition laid down in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, exists in any country, applicants will be granted refugee status. Persons who have been granted, and I emphasise granted, refugee status do not require work permits to engage in employment in the State.</P>
      <P>The Government decision of 26 July 1999 which allowed certain asylum seekers seek employment agreed that (i) applicants who had made their applications for asylum on or before 26 July 1999; (ii) whose applications are over 12 months old and have not been finally determined; and (iii) who have been complying with their obligations as asylum seekers may seek employment.</P>
      <P>On 14 December 1999 the Government dispensed with the requirement for work permits for asylum seekers eligible under the previous decision of 26 July 1999. The Government also decided that each eligible asylum seeker should be issued with a letter which sets out the position and which would enable them to present this letter to a potential employer and my Department has arranged accordingly. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has informed my Department that up to 14 December 99 applications for work permits had been received in respect of eligible asylum seekers of which 56 had issued and a further 11 had been approved, which subsequently issued.</P>
      <P>On 31 January 2000 my Department had 10,472 applications for asylum on hands. A breakdown of this figure is contained on the attached tabular statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>Cloverhill prison was officially opened on 1 June 1999.</P>
      <P>At that time, there was a list of outstanding snag works to be attended to by the contractor in line with long-standing prison building practice. In addition, peculiar to prisons building projects, there was also a process to be undertaken which involved the fitting of all lockings in the prison by the governor of works of the Prisons Service. In accordance with international practice in this respect, lockings in a prison do not form part of the construction contract and are only fitted after most of the contract staff have left the environs of a new prison.</P>
      <P>Final commissioning of a modern prison as a working institution is a substantial and protracted undertaking. Fire safety systems, fire alarm systems, security and general electrical systems must, of necessity, meet standards far in excess of those in commercial premises such as hotels or office blocks. The safety and control systems in a modern prison must conform to a multiplicity of independent tests and must operate satisfactorily in conjunction with one another to meet both everyday and emergency needs in a fully occupied prison.</P>
      <P>Substantial and unforeseen difficulties arose during the commissioning period and delays occurred in having them addressed by the contractors. However, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Office of Public Works, Director General of the Prisons Service and his staff have been making the most strenuous efforts to ensure the earliest possible rectification of all outstanding issues causing concern. I am being kept informed of all relevant developments on a continuous basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 74 prisoners in Cloverhill at present with further prisoners being transferred into the <Col N="778" /> prison every week as outstanding issues are rectified. The number of staff at Cloverhill is 102. This staffing complement will cater for a prisoner population of up to 120, which I am advised by the director general will be attained in a matter of weeks.</P>

      <P>However, Bord Fáilte has recently begun publishing estimates of overseas visitors and associated revenue on a county basis. This data is available from Bord Fáilte and shows, in relation to Mayo, that in 1997 the county received 298,000 overseas visitors, generating an estimated £45 million, with revenue increasing to an estimated £50 million in 1998, notwithstanding a slight drop in visitor numbers to 288,000 in that year. Estimates for 1999 will not be available from the board until later in the year. Visitor numbers are not compiled on a town by town basis.</P>

    <P>(Dr. Woods): Measures to raise standards and assist the development of early childhood education provision are set out in the White Paper on Early Childhood Education &ldquo;Ready to Learn&rdquo; which was published on 17 December last. Although care and education are closely linked for the under six age group, the focus of the White Paper is on educational aspects. Crèches which include an element of educational provision may qualify for assistance, but this will be primarily in the form of advice, support, evaluation and inspection.</P>
    <P>At present my Department provides no assistance by way of grant aid towards the establishment of crèches, except in relation to supporting access to the vocational training opportunity scheme &ndash; VTOS &ndash; Youthreach and senior traveller training programmes for unemployed adults and early school leavers, as described below.</P>
    <P>In relation to vocational training opportunity scheme, Youthreach and senior traveller training centres, a budget of £2.357 million this year has been provided to vocational education committees to support access of participants with children to the programmes. The grant covers: direct provision of crèches; purchase of places on existing community or commercial crèches subject to a maximum of £50 per week per child; and payment of child minders, subject to a maximum of £50 per week per child, tax compliance, and registration as required under the Child Care Acts.</P>

      <P>The higher education grants scheme has a provision to the effect that, in the case of a candidate other than an independent mature candidate, the candidate's reckonable income shall be that of the candidate and of the candidate's parents or guardians, except where the candidate's parents are divorced, legally separated or it is established to the satisfaction of the local authority that they are separated, in which case the candidate's reckonable income is taken as that of the candidate and of the parent with whom the candidate resides. The other student support schemes have a similar provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some 20 cases that have been referred to my Department by local authorities and vocational education committees where the candidate is not living with or being supported by their parents. The question of whose income, if <Col N="781" /> any, should be reckoned for the purpose of deciding whether a candidate is eligible for a higher education grant arises in these cases.</P>

      <P>The current situation is that my Department provides a psychological service to all second level schools in County Donegal. This service has not yet been extended to primary schools in the county and I share the Deputy's concern about this matter.</P>
      <P>However, I am now able to report some real progress towards improving the situation. The National Educational Psychological Service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; Agency was formally established on 1 September 1999. It is envisaged that all schools, both in County Donegal and nationally, will have access to the psychological service by the end of a five-year period.</P>

    <P>The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission is currently in the process of <Col N="782" /> recruiting additional psychologists for NEPS. The process is well advanced and my Department hopes to be in a position to make offers of appointment in the near future.</P>
    <P>The management of NEPS is collecting evidence of the level of need for a psychological service and the current availability of other psychological services, county by county, in order to set priorities for the expansion of the service. Local issues such as a high incidence of early school leaving will be included in the data being collected.</P>

In the case of the second school, the position is that, despite a number of advertisements, the school authorities were unable to secure the services of a trained guidance counsellor. This post will be re-advertised for the next school year.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive circular on all aspects of guidance is currently being drafted within my Department and will issue to all second level schools as soon as possible.</P>

      <Quest>his views on national schools insisting that parents buy specific types of uniforms from specific suppliers which can cost far greater than similar items of clothing from other suppliers; his further views on whether insisting on a parent paying up to £35 for a navy school skirt from a specific supplier is unreasonable when the same type of skirt can be bought in other retail outlets for £10 to £15; and his views on whether this is a serious imposition on families who have two and three children going to the same school and have limited income.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The rules for national schools contain no regulations relating to the wearing of school uniforms. The wearing of uniforms cannot be compulsory, and school authorities should not insist on uniforms, or any type of school clothing, being purchased from a specific supplier.</P>
      <P>School authorities are, of course, entitled to set down guidelines relating to pupils' clothing, and to make provision for the wearing of school uniforms. However, I would expect school authorities to exercise discretion at all times, and to have regard to the costs involved, particularly in the case of families with two or more children involved.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I would not condone a situation where pressure is placed on parents to purchase specific clothing from any particular retail outlet. Neither would I condone any discrimination against pupils who do not wear the school uniform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic entry requirements for university courses are a matter for the individual university. In the case of the National University of Ireland, section 47 of the Universities Act, 1997, provides, <i>inter alia, </i>that the Senate of the National University of Ireland shall determine the basic matriculation requirements for its constituent universities but that each university can prescribe additional requirements generally or in respect of particular faculties of the university.</P>
      <P>The constituent universities of the National University of Ireland require applicants to have passed Irish. As the Deputy will appreciate, the statutory responsibility for this requirement lies with the National University of Ireland. In this regard, I understand that the National University of Ireland has no proposal to amend the Irish requirement.</P>
