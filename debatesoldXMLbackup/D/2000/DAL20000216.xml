    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. a19, Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Instruction to Committee; No. 47, Equal Status Bill, 1999 &ndash; Report and Final Stages (resumed); No. 46, Planning and Development Bill, 1999<i> [Seanad]</i>&ndash; Second Stage (resumed). It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) the proceedings on No. a19, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion within 35 minutes and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the opening speech of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed five minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed five minutes in each case; (iii) Members may share time; (iv) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed five minutes; and (2) the Report and Final Stages of No. 47 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. tonight by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Private Members' Business shall be No. 99, motion re credit unions (resumed).</P>

      <P>There are two proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. a19 agreed to?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate the reason for these fairly restrictive time limits on what is an unusual procedure, the issuance of an instruction to a committee? If we establish committees and delegate responsibilities to them, it is normal that the House does not issue them with interim instructions of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach also take into account that this is the second occasion that a Bill, having passed Second Stage, is being sub<Col N="790" /> stantially amended in Committee in relation to the Refugee Act, which is not a substantive part of the Bill in question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, rather than have to introduce a new Bill, it is proposed to make changes to the existing Bill. The instruction to the select committee is to ensure that it has power to make provisions to amend or extend the law relating to refugees and asylum seekers provided for in the original Act of 1996 and last year's Act.</P>
      <P>
        <b>
        </b>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Howlin: By way of clarification, this Bill is about trafficking, it is not an amending Bill of the Refugee Act. The immigration Bill, a similarly narrowly focused Bill, was used to amend the Refugee Act. Every time legislation is introduced in this area, major and impactive changes are proposed to the Refugee Act on Committee Stage of the Bill in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That circumvents the right of this House to review legislation on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today was agreed between the Whips. It was agreed to have a short debate on this matter. If Members wanted a longer debate on it, I am sure they would have raised that when they discussed the time to be allocated for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Such instructions are provided for in Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly provided for and normally debate on the content of an amendment should take place in Committee, but it is the right of all other Members who are not members of this committee to have former sight of amendments to the Refugee Act. That Act is not the subject of the trafficking Bill, which is the main business of the committee in question. It is the right of every Member on Second Stage to examine legislation. On two occasions we have sought to make substantive and impactive changes to the Refugee Act, which the House has already unanimously agreed should be implemented. It will be amended substantially now without the purview of the majority of the Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The House must decide on this proposal now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure being adopted in relation to this Bill seriously undermines the rights of Deputies and the legislative procedures of this House. Does the Taoiseach agree it is a bad precedent to create a situation where, effectively, Second Stages of proposed Bills will be removed from the floor of this House by amending another measure that is related but not directly connected to the Bill being amended? That precedent dangerously undermines parlia<Col N="791" /> mentary democracy and it is not one that should be followed. The fact that this precedent is being adopted in the area of refugees and asylum seekers is yet another example of the shambles of Government policy in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This procedure is strictly in accordance with Standing Orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>In view of the serious matters that have been raised, I ask the Taoiseach to ensure Committee Stage of this Bill is taken by way of a committee of the full Dáil. In that way these issues can be fully debated as they should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The House must make a decision on this proposal now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We must consider the arguments here. Effectively, we will skip Second Stage of this Bill if we agree this resolution. When we skipped Second Stage of the refugee legislation in 1994, a raft of amendments had to be introduced because matters which ought to have been teased out were not. Perhaps the Taoiseach might reconsider the procedure. I am not suggesting that he is attempting to be unfair because I am aware that consultation has taken place. However, on reflection he might realise that the House requires that time be spent on this item and adopt a different procedure as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make three points. Deputy Shatter is not correct in stating that a precedent is being created, it is provided for in Standing Orders and has been used many times. It is not a precedent to be followed, it is subsequent to many earlier precedents.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of discussion about the Bill and people saw merit in amending it rather than introducing new legislation. There will be a debate of 35 minutes duration in which people can raise any relevant points. In the normal course the Bill would be sent to the committee before being returned to the Dáil for Report Stage. I have no difficulty if the Whips want to hold discussions after the House has followed the procedure set down and sent the Bill to the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not in a position to postpone this business until tomorrow? It will not be the end of the world if the Bill is not sent to the committee today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Submissions were invited from a range of interested parties in respect of the Bill, as debated and passed on Second Stage. The parties to which I refer made their submissions without having sight of these new amendments which fundamentally alter the impact of the Bill. That undermines the work of the committee and the regime we put in place to encourage broad public input into the passage of legislation. The pro<Col N="792" /> cedure set down is wrong and I ask the Taoiseach to withdraw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure is in accordance with Standing Order 117 and is strictly in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that what the Taoiseach is doing is procedurally improper. I accept that the Government can take this course but the question is whether it is wise to proceed in this way without taking a normal Second Stage debate. I submit that while the Government has procedure on its side it does not have wisdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that people considered the procedure and it was agreed to follow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the timings, not to mention the procedure, were agreed. It is not correct to state that Deputies cannot attend committees of which they are not members; they cannot vote but they can attend and, if they so desire, discuss each section of the legislation in great detail. I am not sure what can be gained in this instance by not following the procedure set down. That is obviously the reasoning behind using the procedure. I acknowledge that I was not present at the discussions but I believe that is why the procedure was adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can categorically state that, as far as the Labour Party is concerned, this procedure was not agreed by its Whip. My party has grave reservations about the time allocation because making available 35 minutes for a substantial debate is inadequate. We are opposed to this business being taken today.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, will the Taoiseach join with me in calling on the IRA to reinstate its contacts with the de Chastelain Commission and to reinstate the proposal it made late last Friday which led to a positive report by the commission so that the Taoiseach can have the best prospect in his meeting with Mr. Blair today of getting the speedy re-establishment of the institutions in Northern Ireland and on a cross-Border basis? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The task the Taoiseach faces today has been undoubtedly complicated and made more difficult by the actions of the IRA and the political wing of the republican movement, Sinn Féin. We wish the Taoiseach well in his negotiations with the Prime Minister and hope that a formula can be arrived at which will enable the re-establishment of the institutions in Northern Ireland, particularly within Stormont, and the continuation of the dialogue that had commenced with the de Chastelain Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the IRA to go back to the table with General de Chastelain and resume what was a promising, if a long drawn out and painful process. While I wish the Taoiseach well in his meeting with the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, I ask him not to forget the voices of people such as Monica McWilliams and David Ervine who have appealed for inclusiveness to be maintained in the face of the temptation to polarise the situation. We must keep people on board and, if necessary, go back to the drawing board again, even if that means the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.

      <P>Last night I had an opportunity to discuss in detail the events of recent days with the SDLP, whose ongoing efforts I appreciate. Statements were made overnight about the inclusive process. Deputies John Bruton, Quinn and Sargent are correct in what they said. It would be extremely useful in trying to take matters forward if we could get back to the position we were in last Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is consensus here and among many of the parties, including the SDLP and the smaller parties in the North which have been responsible for much of the progress we have made. Instead of thinking these issues are impossible, my view is that this is a two way street. There is a consensus that we need to restore the institutions as quickly as possible. Everyone from republican and Nationalist areas is calling on us to try to achieve that. We must remember there is also consensus that decommissioning is essential and that it will contribute to a wider demilitarisation. There is consensus on the fundamental principles <Col N="797" /> of democracy as set out in George Mitchell's report to which the parties signed up before they entered the multi-party talks. We cannot forget that the Mitchell review and the Mitchell principles are also part of where we are today.</P>
    <P>Everyone understands and accepts that participation in Government can only be on the basis of a democratic mandate. Whether people like it or not, it is not compatible beyond a short transitional period to have that democratic mandate with armed backing. I could not agree to that. If the consensus is respected and acted upon, it will provide the basis for reaching agreement with the other parties and it will enable the Governments acting together to quickly put the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement back on track. However, I cannot put only one part back on track; it must be all the parts.</P>

The mandate Sinn Féin received from the ballot box was on the understanding that it would, in turn, persuade the military wing of that movement to commence decommissioning in accordance with the overall terms of the Good Friday Agreement. There is a breach of faith now. We must all work together to make it clear on this democratic island that unless someone has a mandate that enables him to speak authoritatively on behalf of the people who elected him, he does not have a role to play in Irish politics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That it be an instruction to the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights in the case of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, 1999, that it has power to make provisions to amend and extend the law relating to refugees and asylum seekers provided for in the Refugee Act, 1996, in the Immigration Act, 1999, and matters connected thereto.</P>
      <P>This is a procedural motion, the purpose of which is to enable the Dáil Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to debate the substance of a number of amendments to the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill which I have tabled on behalf of the Government. That Bill is an important part of my overall strategy for bringing Ireland's immigration and asylum laws up to a modern standard capable of dealing with the issues that present themselves in today's world. My commitment to that strategy has been demonstrated already by the Immigration Act, 1999, which exemplified the strategy in a number of significant respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Act, for the first time in Irish statute law, set out clearly in legislative form the principles and procedures governing an aspect of the State's relations with non-nationals. The Act dealt with the procedures for removal of non-nationals from the State. The immigration and residence Bill, <Col N="801" /> which is being developed within my Department, will take the same clear approach to all other aspects of the manner in which the State deals with non-nationals, including the issue of visas, procedures for entry into the State and the grant and renewal of residence permits. I aim to bring detailed proposals for this major legislation to Government as soon as possible this year. My aim is that this comprehensive legislation will provide a modern framework of principle and procedures for the development and implementation of immigration policies which will meet the needs of Irish society and respect the humanity of those who seek to come to our shores.</P>
    <P>That Act also made the necessary changes to the Refugee Act, 1996, to make it workable. I am pleased to report that the process of implementing that Act is well advanced. The competition for the post of refugee applications commissioner is already under way and the recruitment process for the chair and ordinary members of the refugee appeals tribunal will also commence shortly. The necessary regulations are also well advanced. I can tell the House that I recently made a commencement order bringing into effect the bulk of the amendments to the Refugee Act made by way of the Immigration Act, 1999, and as soon as the recruitment processes are complete, which I expect will be around Easter, I will be able to commence the Refugee Act itself.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I am taking advantage of the opportunity offered by the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill to bring forward now, in advance of the major comprehensive Bill, provision for some refinement of aspects of immigration and asylum law. This is the context in which the amendments in my name to the trafficking Bill propose new sections 4 and 7 on the second list of amendments, circulated by the Bills Office to Deputies on 9 February 1999.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to abuse the good order of the House by going into detail on the substance of these amendments in this procedural debate. The amendment relating to the Refugee Act will facilitate the smooth coming into operation of that Act and, in particular, the recruitment process for the chairperson and other members of the refugee appeals tribunal.</P>
    <P>The amendment dealing with judicial review is aimed at providing for the first time a statutory code for the courts to deal with applications for judicial review of decisions in the deportation process, including where the deportation in question arises from the asylum process. Judicial review by the courts of administrative acts such as these is one of the fundamentals of our system of law and my proposals are designed to ensure the procedures are streamlined consistent with the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>When the issue is debated most Deputies will agree that it does not make any sense under the present rules to allow a person who is, for example, the subject of a deportation order, three months within which to apply for leave to apply <Col N="802" /> for judicial review. That period is out of line with reality.</P>
    <P>Deportation orders normally require the person named to leave the State within 14 days. In line with that, the amendment I propose will shorten the period for seeking leave to apply for judicial review to 14 days. Doubtless some will say the period is too short, but I would remind Deputies that a person who is the subject of a deportation order will likely have availed of every system of appeal that exists prior to the order being made, while an unsuccessful asylum applicant will already, if he or she wishes, have had the benefit of legal aid. The legal aid service will already be familiar with the case, sufficient to enable it give early aid and advice on the question of judicial review.</P>
    <P>The procedure in the amendment that I propose will ensure that the rights of all concerned in cases of this type are vindicated without undue delay, and that includes ensuring that court time is not unduly spent on applications for judicial review which do not have a substantial basis. Contrary to comment outside the House in recent days, the proposal has no bearing on questions of detention, which are protected by the <i>habeas corpus</i> provisions of Article 40 of the Constitution and which no statute law could seek to compromise.</P>
    <P>The place to discuss these amendments is in the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. I look forward to a stimulating debate there as soon as that can be arranged and I urge the House to accept this procedural motion to enable that debate take place.</P>

        <b>:</b> This is an enabling motion to allow the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to deal with amendments to the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended by section 11 of the Immigration Act, 1999. It is yet another illustration of the unco-ordinated, incremental, inept and confused manner in which asylum issues have been dealt with by the Government. Two Acts passed by Parliament are now to be amended to facilitate another Bill, the Illegal Immigrant (Trafficking) Bill, 1999.</P>
      <P>Last week the Minister circulated amendments which dramatically changed the thrust of that Bill as originally published. The new proposals to tighten up the High Court appeals process for asylum seekers who have been refused refugee status are unacceptable, unjustifiable and discriminatory. The proposal to reduce from three months to ten working days the length of time that asylum seekers can seek access to judicial review proceedings is a serious infringement on the rights of non-nationals in the Irish judicial system and we will strenuously oppose them. It means that one category of people will be discriminated against within that system. This probably contravenes the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After two years and eight months in office the <Col N="803" /> universal conclusion is that the Minister and his Department are still foundering and are incapable of managing a situation that is manageable. People are still queuing in the driving rain, except that the queue has moved from St. Stephen's Green to Lower Mount Street. Of the 5,500 applications for asylum made in 1999, taken in conjunction with the thousands caught in the backlog, only 516 were granted asylum and two-thirds of those on appeal. Many applicants are left in a legal limbo for up to two years before their applications are processed.</P>
    <P>The work permits scheme is a farce. On the one hand, the Government announces that 2,000 asylum seekers will be eligible for work permits while, on the other hand, only 53 have been granted. Asylum seekers are no longer to be trusted with the cash in hand supplementary welfare allowance of £72 to provide for the basic necessities of life. Instead they are to be given vouchers. Eight weeks into the new millennium, the national coffers are laden with cash, there is a massive property boom and people are queue jumping with mobile 'phones in hand to get the new 00 registered cars, yet we do not trust a few thousand immigrants to spend a paltry supplementary benefit of £72 per week in a provident manner. We must give them paper vouchers instead. What kind of warped mind thought up such a scheme? It is discriminatory and degrading. It sets out to further marginalise the already marginalised and it has all the echoes of our own best forgotten poor law or South African apartheid. Is it any wonder the refugee appeals adjudicator, Mr. Peter Finlay, should resign in disgust because of procedures over which he could not stand.</P>
    <P>If one wanted to create chaos one could not do a better job than with the current mismanagement of asylum policy. All the messages are negative and defensive, yet with vision, imagination and planning it could all be so different. There is chaos because there is no immigration policy. As a result, people who are economic immigrants who are not fleeing from persecution have no option but to queue as asylum seekers at Lower Mount Street.</P>
    <P>We need a national immigration policy and a twin system to deal with population inflow. There should be a refugee asylum service to operate under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and to process applications for asylum seekers in accordance with the Geneva Convention and our domestic laws. A national immigration service should be established immediately to deal with economic immigrants. Membership of the service should be drawn from the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Foreign Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science, Health and Children and Social, Community and Family Affairs. IBEC, ISME, ICTU and representatives of the non-governmental organisations should also be involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="804" /> The service should develop and implement a cohesive immigration policy based on Ireland's capacity to absorb an annual, predetermined number of non-EU nationals to meet the labour and skills needs of the economy. It should consider applications for work visas from non-EU nationals provided such applications are made from outside the State. It should recruit staff, provide information and develop integration, education and support services. It should provide information to agencies, employers, schools, non-governmental organisations, voluntary organisations and communities on the origins, cultures and needs of the immigrant population. It should advise on the training, language and other needs of immigrants and it should provide applicants with information on work and conditions of work, housing, rights of family members to join them, education, social welfare, health services, taxation and access to the courts and administrative authorities. It should also ensure that applications of all immigrants are treated equally, irrespective of their colour, religion and ethnic origin. It should assess policy and performance and make an annual report to the Government.</P>
    <P>For more than 150 years Ireland has endured the haemorrhage of its population to all parts of the world to seek a new beginning. Now, happily, that situation has changed. Almost 20,000 more people make their homes in Ireland each year than emigrate. A recent report from the UN says Europe will need 159 million immigrants within the next 25 years. The UN has estimated that without such immigration the population of the EU will fall by 30 million within the next 25 years because the birth rate is so low. By 2050, almost half of the population of Europe will be above retirement age. We need a comprehensive immigration policy to deal with the new reality and we need it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister rightly says this is a procedural motion. It is an unusual step for motions of this type to be opposed from this side of the House, but I was greatly concerned and alarmed to learn that substantial changes to the Refugee Act were to be again piggy-backed on legislation that has already passed Second Stage and that these changes will fundamentally alter protections given to non-nationals in that Act. It is bad procedure to use limited legislation as a vehicle in this way. I argued my case on the Order of Business and, while I understand it is in order to proceed, it is an abuse of the rights of Members of the House who expressed their views on the Second Stage of legislation before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Immigration Act, 1999, was the last vehicle to be used in this way. That legislation was narrow in focus and was designed to plug what the Minister regarded as a loophole created by a constitutional decision by the courts on the Aliens Act, 1935, delimiting the Minster's power of deportation. The Bill, having passed Second Stage, was again used as a vehicle on Committee Stage to introduce substantial amendments to the <Col N="805" /> Refugee Act. Amendments were signalled in the Minister's speech at the conclusion of Second Stage when Members had already made their contributions. We had no details of those amendments until the commencement of Committee Stage, despite pressure from the Minister and his officials to take Committee Stage. The annoyance of Members on this side of the House at that procedure should have signalled to the Minister that such a procedure should not again be used. However, here we go again. The Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, with a narrow focus and presented by the Minister as a vehicle to deal with an urgent matter, namely, the trafficking in illegal immigrants, is to be used as a parachute to introduce far-reaching change in the legal rights of non-nationals in the country.</P>
    <P>The amendments circulated last week propose that no administrative order or decision relating to immigration, deportation or asylum can be questioned, other than by way of an application to the High Court for leave to apply for a judicial review. The Minister further proposes that such an application must be made within 14 days. The lawyers dealing with it tell me that this is virtually impossible and certainly not the norm, despite what the Minister has said publicly and has repeated in the House this morning. The Minister proposes that the decision of the High Court on this preliminary stage of what must be a complex and detailed argument of law, basic human rights and fact is to be final and conclusive. Unless it is found that there is a point of law of exceptional public importance the normal right of appeal to the Supreme Court will not be available. These restrictions on the right of access to the courts have been taken directly from the planning Acts. Whatever merit existed in terms of fast-tracking planning procedures, the provisions are entirely inappropriate when dealing with basic human rights which is what we are concerned with here.</P>
    <P>I take umbrage at the Minister's constant denigration of the courts. This morning he said that the proposals will ensure &ldquo;court time is not unduly spent on applications for judicial review which have no substantial basis&rdquo;. The first thing to be determined by the court is that there is a case to be heard. It is not for the Minister to delimit the powers of the High Court to review his ministerial orders.</P>
    <P>Our immigration legislation is basically administrative, flowing from the Aliens Act, 1935. It devolves on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the power to make orders from time to time. It is in wholesale need of radical reform, and it is time the Minister realised this rather than introducing piecemeal legislation which piggy-backs on inappropriate Bills.</P>
    <P>The recently published Programme for Prosperity and Fairness includes a commitment by all the social partners to implement the Refugee Act. Were the Minister's proposals to amend the Act discussed with the social partners when the new programme was being framed? It is time the Minister realised the responsibilities he has to <Col N="806" /> introduce a comprehensive immigration and refugee code of law in a fair and open way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am appalled that this motion is before the House. The manner in which the Government has dealt with all issues concerning refugees, asylum seekers and those seeking to emigrate to Ireland from outside the EU is indicative of a total incapacity to deal with an area of policy in a constructive and far-sighted way. We have seen a series of fire brigade legislative responses to perceived threats to the country or its social structure. The approach of the Minister is symptomatic of the &ldquo;fortress Ireland&rdquo; mentality. Instead of us seeing people coming to the country as an opportunity from which the State can benefit, immigration is perceived as a threat, something to be controlled, curtailed and stopped.</P>
      <P>I deeply regret that when one examines the global policy being adopted, the central issue is where a person originates. The Minister should understand that Government policies are perceived as racist. I do not believe it is the Minister's intention to be racist, but the perception is grossly damaging to the country and it is the wrong way to deal with these issues.</P>
      <P>The legislation the Minister is now seeking to deal with on Committee Stage and which has not been discussed in the House will bring about a fundamental change to our legal system which I do not believe is desirable and in respect of which there are justifiable constitutional doubts. The amendments may also be in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. Within the legal system, in the context of decisions made by administrative bodies and tribunals, a procedure has existed for decades which provides for a period during which somebody affected by a decision can consider whether to seek a judicial review. There is a three month timeframe, which the courts can extend in certain circumstances, within which such applications are normally brought. This applies to a broad range of decisions made by administrative bodies and tribunals which affect the lives of many people, nationals and non-nationals, in a variety of ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong for the Department to seek to amend the Refugee Act so as to provide that any person who has been through the appeals process and who wishes to seek a judicial review must make that application within 14 days. That distinguishes one group of individuals, namely, those seeking asylum and refugee status, from practically all others who come before the courts. It is a discriminatory provision which, if included in the legislation, should be referred by the President to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution. If that procedure is not adopted, there will at an early stage be a constitutional challenge to the provision and instead of it facilitating speedy decision making on applications for judicial review brought by those seeking political asylum we will have judicial gridlock where it will <Col N="807" /> not be possible to make decisions while a constitutional challenge remains to be determined.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider the amendments he has proposed and to withdraw the motion before the House seeking to have these matters dealt with on Committee Stage without a proper debate on Second Stage.</P>

        <b>:</b> The Minister and the Government are again acting disgracefully in the way they are treating a few thousand people seeking refuge. The amendments which the Minister is attempting to introduce are stunning in the discriminatory way in which they treat non-nationals. This powerfully re-inforces the argument made by Mr. Peter Finlay when he resigned as appeals commissioner that those seeking refuge are being treated by officialdom quite differently in terms of rights afforded them in comparison to Irish and EU citizens. This is nothing short of institutionalised racism because, in effect, it will be people of colour or of a different ethnic background or minorities who will be involved. It is well documented that black and brown people who come here are often treated disgracefully at the point of entry. There is documented evidence of even EU nationals who are a colour other than white being treated disgracefully, singled out and treated in a cavalier fashion totally repugnant to human rights. The signal to continue such disgraceful behaviour is coming from the very top. The Minister is sending the signals for that type of behaviour. It is an abuse of Dáil Éireann to introduce substantial amendments to the Immigration Act under cover of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, 1999. It is also an abuse of the Irish people and it should and must be opposed.</P>

      <P>I am sure we all want to see genuine asylum seekers catered for in a proper and humane manner. The situation is being clouded by the number of illegal immigrants, many of whom are economic immigrants, who enter this country. I am surprised the Government has not liaised with the human rights body which governs the situation in Europe, that is the Council of Europe. The Council of Europe has 42 members, including Ireland, which covers western, central and eastern Europe. It knows specifically the countries where there is persecution of people because of their religious or political persuasion or ethnic origin. We should be guided by the Council of Europe, of which we are very active members, in our judgment of who is or is not entitled to remain here. It is clear to me from being a member of the Council of Europe for five years that there is no political or ethnic persecution in Romania or Bulgaria, for example. They have democratic governments and there are economic difficulties but there is no persecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> It defies understanding why we allow thousands of illegal immigrants to come here. In the process we are jeopardising the applications of genuine asylum seekers from countries such as Nigeria, where there is persecution. It is very unfortunate that the system is being fouled up by illegal and economic immigrants at the expense of genuine asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to learn recently that more than 80% of illegal immigrants are coming into this State through Northern Ireland. Surely something should be done about that. I would have thought from reading the newspapers that they were coming through Rosslare, Dún Laoghaire, other ports and airports. I have the best of goodwill towards genuine asylum seekers but we should liaise with the Council of Europe to establish in which countries there is political, ethnic and religious persecution and work from that basis. We would have a much clearer position very quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you. I will use the minute and a half to support the position as enunciated by my colleague, Deputy Howlin. Even legislators find it difficult to understand the kinds of procedures the Minister is proceeding with in this legislation, but it must be extraordinarily difficult for asylum seekers to cope with the way in which the issue is being dealt with. As a Member of this House I strongly object to that.</P>
      <P>This complicated legislation, where Acts are being amended through other Acts, adds to the racism and xenophobia, which is clearly present. Negative messages are constantly being sent out in respect of immigration of asylum seekers and refugees. While the Minister has announced a positive education programme, the way in which it is being dealt at Government level, sends negative messages which will counteract whatever positive programme will be put in place. This is an important issue in terms of the way people perceive immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees. It would be better if the Minister directed his energies towards implementing the Refugee Act and introduced the promised legislation, the immigration and residents' Bill, rather than amending legislation in this piecemeal and negative fashion. This is contrary to human rights, particularly on the issue of judicial review and on the length of time people have to apply. I strongly support the arguments put by my colleague, Deputy Howlin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has decided to take this approach to judicial review in immigration matters on my recommendation. I have taken the advice of the Attorney General and am satisfied the proposals are consistent with the Constitution and with the principles of natural justice. They are tailored to the special requirements of the immigration and asylum area <Col N="809" /> and enhance the principle of natural justice that requires that decisions should be arrived at in an expeditious manner consistent with the administration of justice.</P>
      <P>This Government is committed to providing protection to refugees and the application of fair procedures in accordance with law to all immigrants. Those who are genuinely in need of the protection of this State will be given it in accordance with our international obligations. My aim is that such people can be identified as soon as possible after their arrival so they can take up their entitlements and commence the process of integration into their new society. In that context, as recently as last Thursday, I announced a major initiative to assist in the integration of refugees consistent with the maintenance of their cultural identities. A very comprehensive report has been presented.</P>
      <P>However, Ireland, like other EU member states, is also facing serious problems with persons who seek to abuse our asylum procedures and immigration controls. We are determined to take the necessary measures to deter and prevent such abuse. That includes ensuring that the judicial review process &ndash; which I regard as fundamental to our system of justice &ndash; cannot be used to create unnecessary delays in the deportation process where there is no issue of substance which would warrant postponement of a person's departure from the State.</P>
      <P>My proposal has the following features: the Minister will be put on notice of applications for leave to seek judicial review in immigration and asylum cases &ndash; this will ensure that he will have the opportunity to be a party to proceedings from the beginning; applications will be brought within 14 days of the decision or order being challenged &ndash; this is in line with the time limits in the deportation procedure, as set out in the Immigration Act 1999; provision is also made for the High Court to extend the time limits where there are good and sufficient reasons to do so; the court will grant leave only where there are substantial grounds; the court will give priority to such cases so as to ensure early vindication of the rights at issue; and appeals to the Supreme Court, whether by the individual or the State, will be limited to those cases where the High Court certifies there is a point of law of exceptional public importance to be decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this proposal is to ensure after all due procedures have been gone through and it has been decided that there is no basis for a non-national's continued stay in the State, the judicial review process cannot be used to delay that person's departure where a substantial case cannot be made which would warrant postponement. The proposals contain safeguards to ensure that those with a substantial case to make have full opportunity to make it. It must be remembered that the judicial review process is not an appeal from the decision in question, it is simply a means for <Col N="810" /> testing whether the procedures leading to the decision were proper.</P>
    <P>The proposals will provide that the Minister is put on notice of applications for leave to seek judicial review. This will afford the Minister, as respondent, the opportunity to address whether there is a substantial case. The High Court will have the power to refuse the application unless there is a substantial case. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court may be granted by the High Court on grounds of public importance or constitutional grounds related to the validity of any law. This condition for leave to appeal applies whether it is the State or the person affected who seeks it. These measures will foreshorten the judicial review process in any case brought for the purpose of prolonging the stay in the State of a person whose removal from the State should take place, but also contains safeguards to ensure that those with a substantial case to make have full opportunity to make it. The arguments put forward by some Deputies are at best disingenuous, and possibly mischievous, because they choose to ignore the fact that a deportation order comes at the end of a lengthy process in which the person to be deported has already had ample opportunity to put whatever case there is.</P>
    <P>In the case of a failed asylum seeker, judicial review may be invoked at the end of a process that includes a thorough investigation of the claim for asylum in the first instance, an independent appeal procedure and a further opportunity before the making of the deportation order to make a case for permission to remain in the State on other, non-asylum grounds. At each of these stages, State funded legal aid and interpreter facilities are made available.</P>

      <P>It makes no sense to make a deportation order requiring a person to leave the State within a fortnight and at the same time allow the person three months, the normal period within which judicial review applications may be brought, in which to challenge the order. The rights of the deportee are protected in any event, since a properly based challenge will result in the court putting a stay on the order until the proceedings are finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in the my proposal which attempts to curtail the <i>habeas corpus</i> provisions of the Constitution, nor could there be. The proposals do not affect detention matters in any manner. I am prepared to discuss the detail of these proposals in the proper forum, namely, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. If constructive suggestions for improvement are made at that forum, I am prepared to consider them. All I ask is that the House now approves the motion before it so the committee will be able to deal with these forward thinking and eminently sens<Col N="811" /> ible proposals in the context of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, 1999.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 52:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>8.&ndash;The partners or members or any of them of a business or of its board or governing authority whether incorporated or not that is carried out by individuals who are and share in the capital and profits of the business as its partners or members (&lsquo;a firm') shall not discriminate in relation to&mdash;</P>

      <P>(<i>c</i>) the expulsion of a partner or member from the firm or any other sanction against the partner or member.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to insert a section dealing with firms of partners etc, which was included in the original Equal Status Bill but which has been removed in this legislation. There was some lengthy debate on this issue on Committee Stage. Both myself and Deputy Fitzgerald felt that partnerships should be included under equal status legislation. The Minister felt it was more appropriate for partnership issues to be dealt with through the Companies Act or some other companies legislation. He gave us an undertaking on Committee Stage that he would discuss this matter with the Tánaiste who is the relevant Minister in terms of companies legislation. The Minister suggested that he was not the fountain of all knowledge, which was an interesting comment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be hard for the Minister to believe. Our argument on Committee Stage &ndash; I reiterate it here &ndash; is that there is no reason partnerships should not be included under equality legislation because partnerships, as with other organisations, are capable of discriminating. The experience in the past is that women have not had strong representation in these kinds of organisations, and I am sure all the other categories possibly could be discriminated against in a partnership. Has the Minister information as to what the Tánaiste intends to do or has done with regard to including the issue of discrimination in partnerships in the legislation for which she has responsibility? It should be included under some legislation and my preference is that it would be included in this equality legislation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald's amendment No. 53 is very much in line with Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment. As Deputy O'Sullivan said, this matter was debated at length on Committee Stage and I am anxious to hear if there was a response from the Tánaiste. We are very conscious of the current gender imbalances in partnership firms and given that our society will, hopefully, become more pluralist and multicultural, we need to ensure that future partnerships, promotions and so forth would not reflect those imbalances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, this Bill, unlike the 1997 Bill, does not contain a provision dealing with discrimination by firms, including firms of partners, against members or prospective members of such firms. The legal advice was that these provisions in the 1997 Bill were anomalous <i>vis-à-vis</i> the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, presented constitutional difficulties and were not required to transpose the EU directive on self-employed activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following Deputy Fitzgerald's suggestion on Committee Stage that anti-discrimination provisions within firms of partners, etc. be included <Col N="815" /> in the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1999, which was then before the House, my officials raised the matter with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, did not consider such a provision to be appropriate. The reasons for this include the lack of affinity between such a provision and the general thrust of the Bill, now the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999, and the difficulty of addressing the constitutional and other implications of such an amendment in the time available.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment had received no representations on this topic and was unable to study the issues involved, consult interested parties and resolve any issues that might emerge from such consultations. It was also pointed out that, whatever about companies, company law could not be a vehicle for anti-discrimination provisions relating to partnerships.</P>
    <P>I am not ruling out a prohibition on discrimination in firms and partnerships at some future date by statutory means. Deputies will recognise, however, that the Equal Status Bill is essentially about the provision of goods and services and that it is a complex measure with a troubled history. Given the difficulties involved, I do not intend to provide for firms or partnerships in the Bill. We have consulted with the Tánaiste and I have outlined her views. In line with my customary humility, who am I to argue?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the response of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In effect, there is no protection for firms and partnerships in relation to discrimination. If a partnership firm is not to be covered in legislation which deals with services and it is not already covered by the legislation dealing with employment, the Employment Equality Act, how can it be dealt with under equality legislation? They are the two primary pillars of legislation and it is not included in either. The Tánaiste has also indicated that it is not appropriate to companies legislation. How can we ensure there will not be discrimination in partnerships if the issue not to be included in legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be included in future legislation dealing with labour law or it could possibly be dealt with in a provision dealing with partnerships. It might also be dealt with, as Deputy O'Sullivan suggests, under an anti-discrimination measure. The truth of the matter is that we have enough on our plates in terms of this legislation, which has had a troubled history. The issues are complex and, following my consultations with the Tánaiste, I do not propose to embark on another voyage. That does not mean, of course, that the train might not leave the station on another date. It would not be appropriate to do it now. A consultative process would <Col N="816" /> have to be engaged upon and a considerable number of issues would have to be examined before we could arrive at a legislative measure such as Deputy O'Sullivan requests. However, I have not ruled out the desirability of the suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed this cannot and will not be included in the Bill. It falls between two stools in that it is not included in the two legislative measures dealing with discrimination. Discriminatory practices within companies can be and are being used. There were a few recent examples in Britain where women at partnership and board director level were subject to restrictions at work which forced them out of the workforce. They took their cases, which were costly, to the courts and won but that has probably damaged their future employment prospects. This is not a theoretical matter and it will arise more and more often.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister or the Tánaiste consider a form of grant funding or reward to deal with this? Sweden and other countries have a reward system under which grant funding is given to companies which actively encourage a better balance on boards and in management.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 54:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i) refusing to permit certain categories of members to vote at general meetings and stand for office in the management committee;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the amendments requested by the Irish Ladies Golfing Union. It arises out of concerns that in golf clubs, and presumably in other clubs, certain categories of members are not allowed to vote or stand for office. In effect, they do not enjoy the full benefits of the club in terms of controlling what happens there and the decision making process. Being able to vote in elections and to stand for election are important elements of membership of a club. The Irish Ladies Golfing Union is concerned that its members <Col N="817" /> are being discriminated against. It believes this legislation is not strong enough without the inclusion of these two and other amendments.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, the then Minister of State, Deputy Fahy, referred to the Registration of Clubs Act as the legislation under which there should be redress in this regard.</P>
    <P>It would still be possible under this legislation and the Registration of Clubs Acts for a club to refuse this right to certain types of members. In many cases, it has not been possible for women members in golf clubs to have full membership which would allow them vote in these situations and to stand for office. There is still discrimination and it would still be possible for discrimination to exist in future if these measures were not included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment because discrimination will continue to exist despite the measures taken in the Bill. The discrimination is doubled in that women golfers have no right to vote or to express their wish for their club's future because they are excluded from the decision making process within the club. Women golfers are often the people who help keep the club going and organise the social fund raising and the functions. It seems extraordinary in this day and age that women golfers who have contributed so much to their clubs can be precluded at times from being a full member and can only be an associate member. This means they are not allowed to vote, which is one of the most basic rights of all. Women golfers have indicated that it could take them 50 to 100 years to have a critical mass of full members for voting within the decision making process of the club because there is such a long waiting list for membership. These amendments should be accepted to give them this long delayed right which would contribute to the running of the club.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the concern of Deputies O'Sullivan and Barnes to ensure that associate members of golf clubs, that is, women, can have a greater say in the running of such clubs, but I cannot accept the amendment. It would give voting rights to all members of registered clubs irrespective of the nature or duration of their membership. I understand there are diverse membership categories. The implications of giving voting rights to every type of member are unclear and it may not be appropriate to give voting rights to some categories of members, for example, temporary members or affiliates. Sections 8, 9 and 10 are not a vehicle for making substantial changes to the Registration of Clubs Acts, 1904 to 1995, the consequences of which are unknown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention, as I indicated previously, to consider the wider issues mentioned by Deputies O'Sullivan and Barnes. In that context, I have referred the matter to the Attorney General. It is my intention, following receipt of his advice, to meet the Golfing Union of Ireland and the Irish <Col N="818" /> Ladies Golfing Union to discuss what measures we may take to lift the discrimination mentioned in so far as it is possible. I had intended to meet them earlier but, on reflection, I decided that it would be best to await the advice of the Attorney General so that we could have a discussion on a substantive amendment which I may bring forward in this regard. I obviously cannot guarantee that there will be a substantive amendment, but I am concerned to ensure that the matters raised by the Deputies in this respect are given careful consideration to see if I can improve the situation under the legislation. I cannot give guarantees that it is possible to do so but I will certainly try.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(iii) refusing or failing to do all that is reasonable to prevent sexual harassment from occurring in the club;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This area is very complex in that people have different perceptions of sexual harassment. However, it is clearly positive that, if women golfers press for their rights and full inclusion in clubs, sexual harassment would be seen as unacceptable. This provision is included in the employment legislation and it is a timely and appropriate amendment to add to the Bill. It should be spelled out so that women know they do not have to accept or suffer harassment and that part of the Bill deals with this area. I hope for and expect a positive reply from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I have also tabled an amendment on sexual harassment. Like Deputy Barnes, I want to ensure that <Col N="819" /> this area regarding clubs is covered in the legislation. Section 11 deals with sexual and other harassment. I do not mind in which section it is covered as long as we are clear that there is protection from sexual harassment in clubs under the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the Deputy proposes to add an additional ground to those already listed in section 8(2)(<i>b</i>), namely, that of refusing or failing to do all that is reasonable to prevent sexual harassment from occurring in the club. The core objective of the provisions dealing with registered clubs is to address the discrimination practised by such clubs against members or prospective members, most conspicuously on the gender ground. This is a complicated area and I do not intend to increase the difficulty by bringing sexual and other harassment in registered clubs into the Bill.</P>
      <P>Issues around sexual harassment could be problematic in the context of a club. Sexual harassment could occur not only between persons in authority and members and prospective members of the club but also between ordinary club members. It would be a very draconian approach were an act of sexual harassment in the club bar to result in the forfeiture of that club's drinks licence.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the District Court hearing is specific, namely, to determine if the club has a rule, practice or policy which discriminates against a member or an applicant for membership, or if a person involved in the club's management discriminated against a member or an applicant for membership in respect of the club's affairs. With a view to keeping the focus of the District Court hearings on these matters, I would not be willing to have the section enlarged in the way put forward by Deputy Barnes, and I do not, therefore, intend to include provisions on sexual harassment in registered clubs in the legislation.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of the Deputy's amendment might render the Bill in respect of the provisions dealing with registered clubs susceptible to legal challenge. I am conscious that registered clubs are members' clubs and that, in addressing inequalities in this sphere, we must respect this status and ensure that the measures pass constitutional muster.</P>
      <P>In the light of what I have said, I am unable to accept Deputy Barnes's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

      <P>I am sorry the Minister feels it would create such a difficulty because I recall the same arguments being made when sexual harassment was debated in the context of other Bills. I cannot believe it would pose constitutional difficulties. That line of argument suggests the same laws and standards should not apply to private clubs and other areas of work and recreation. I am disappointed the Minister cannot see fit to include this measure. I will not press the amend<Col N="820" /> ment but I hope the Minister will consider it further before the Bill is debated in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The Registration of Clubs Act, 1904, employs the term &ldquo;club premises&rdquo; and I understand the certificate of registration uses this term also. The term &ldquo;head office&rdquo; is not used in the court application process in the 1904 Act. I consider, however, given the type of clubs at which this provision of the Equal Status Bill, 1999, is targeted, that an applicant will not have difficulty serving the application specified in subsection (5) on the club and its club premises.</P>
      <P>Moreover, once a case of this type comes before the District Court the alleged discriminating club might endeavour to challenge the validity of the proceedings on more technical grounds by alleging that the copy application has been sent to the wrong address. I hesitate to allow scope for any possibility of such procedural irregularity.</P>
      <P>The section as it stands is clear and, accordingly, I do not propose to accept the Deputy's amendment. On Committee Stage Deputy Fitzgerald indicated that she did not feel that strongly about this measure and she would not press it. Perhaps Deputy Barnes might take the same approach.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(11) A discriminating club shall not be entitled to grants from public funds or use of public facilities.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that we must consider this type of prescription and hope it will be accepted. The history of exclusion and discrimination against <Col N="821" /> women in golf clubs has been so continuous and hard-faced in the clubs which still hold out in that regard, that, from a legislative and social point of view, this measure indicates the dislike society has for this type of discrimination. It is one of the few ways in which the State and the Legislature can insist that in this day and age women should have equal rights in golf clubs and have the choice of full membership if they so wish.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out over the years, the choice of associate or full membership should be open to women and men equally and the clubs which do not provide their members with such a choice should not be entitled to grants or public funds from taxpayers or from the EU.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Barnes's amendment; my amendment is similar. This provision, which would allow the Government to withhold public funds or public facilities from a club which discriminates against certain people, would be more effective than removing the drinks licence from offending clubs, which seems to be the safeguard upon which it will rely. It makes more sense to withhold public funding. By giving public funding to clubs that discriminate in this way, the State is subventing them with taxpayers' money. I am disappointed this measure has not been maintained in the 1999 Bill. It is a much more effective provision.</P>
      <P>In using the licensing system in this regard, the Minister is probably saying something about society. The clubs to which we refer are mainly involved in sport and the State is using the sanction of withholding their licences to sell drink. This is inappropriate. I would prefer the measure we propose, that the clubs would not be eligible for grants from public funds.</P>
      <P>It would be difficult to threaten to withdraw a licence from a club because it discriminates. There would be a great deal of pressure applied to those trying to impose that sanction. It would be difficult to maintain a campaign to use that measure to end the discrimination. The withholding of public funds would be a much more effective measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputies asserted, the 1997 Bill contained additional sanctions against discriminating clubs. However, on foot of legal advice, the sole sanction against such clubs is the removal of the drinks licence, the certificate of registration. My advice is that since the licence was one conferred under a statutory provision, it was legitimate to make the grant of a drinks licence a privilege enjoyed by the club conditional on the club not discriminating against any persons. I consider that the loss of the drinks licence alone is an effective sanction. As may be recalled, most public reaction to the registered clubs provisions in the 1997 Bill focused on the loss of the drinks licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we all know, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, administers lottery funded schemes in the sports area. I <Col N="822" /> understand applicants under his scheme are required to submit rules and procedures as evidence of non-discrimination on the grounds of sex, religion, ethnic origin and so on. It is also a requirement under his rules that the facility or the equipment is accessible to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The bulk of lottery funded expenditure goes to community and voluntary groups. Many of these groups are active in promoting equality and non-discrimination &ndash; for example, youth, women's and travellers groups and groups dealing with child care, care of the elderly and the disadvantaged. Conditions in relation to individual schemes are decided by the Departments administering the particular scheme.</P>
    <P>To a large extent, from an administrative perspective, the objective of the Deputy's amendment has been realised. I do not believe it would be appropriate for me to insert in this legislation the sanctions which really pertain to the administrative acts of another Minister and I do not believe it would be appreciated if I did so. In those circumstances, I will not do so but I am assured that the measures I have outlined are implemented by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, would support the Minister on this, given that he was a frequent contributor to the former women's rights committee when such a debate was raging at that committee. I see this as an inclusive Government decision and a legislative one for everyone in this House. Clubs which exclude and discriminate should not be subsidised by the public purse, particularly given the amount of subvention and grants provided by Europe which is the dynamo for equality and positive action in regard to the removal of discrimination. Not only is it acceptable that we do this in relation to this type of public funding, but it is also necessary.</P>

      <P>This relates to the earlier debate we had about partnerships being referred to companies legislation. We are now transferring this issue to another Department. I express dissatisfaction that much of this, which should be in the primary equality legislation, is now being hived off to other Departments. I accept the Minister's good faith in that he believes it will, in effect, happen. However, it would have been better to include it in the primary legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we are on the subject of public money, a large sum of money will be spent on a national stadium. I do not know whether the Minister would like to comment but it is very important that there will be full access and that the gender issue will be uppermost in the minds of the Government in that women's sport will have full access to the national stadium. Most national stadia do not host a large number of women's sporting activities, although I suppose the camogie and women's gaelic football finals get a fair run in Croke Park. In sport generally, women's sports <Col N="823" /> do not tend to get as much of the space in the grounds at club as well as national level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>To reply to Deputy O'Sullivan's last point, I have no doubt but that there will be equal access to the new national stadium for women and men and that there will not be discrimination in that respect.</P>
      <P>The legal advice I have is that the two additional sanctions in the 1997 Act raised issues of proportionality. The 1997 Act would have applied these two sanctions to registered clubs only but not to other private clubs. My advice is to stay with the forfeiture of the drinks licence as anything else would leave registered clubs in a worse position legally than other private clubs. That much must be apparent. The sanction which is being applied is a severe one. The forfeiture of a drinks licence is a very serious sanction where a club is concerned &ndash; make no mistake about that. As we all know, clubs rely to a large extent on drink sales for revenue and if that is taken away, it has very serious repercussions for club membership and for the club's future.</P>
      <P>In regard to the disbursement of grants by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, administratively, he seeks to ensure that grants are not given where there is discrimination. The approach I am adopting is sensible and logical. Everybody will agree that grants should not be given if there is discrimination. I accept that principle. However, my difficulty relates to including a provision in a statute which, in effect, would lead to a certain amount of legal discrimination between registered clubs and other private clubs. The sanction which I propose is sufficient.</P>

I would like to think that in 2001 a large majority of the public would agree that any grant funding or subvention would not be given to such clubs with in-built discrimination. I am disappointed this amendment cannot be taken on board because it would strengthen this considerably. Given what Deputy O'Sullivan said about the drinks licence and what the Minister pointed out, it seems to be an Irish solution to an Irish problem. I accept it is very much part of the Irish culture but the principle of this stands.</P>

    <P>I explained the purpose of this amendment on Committee Stage. It is basically to ensure a club would not use the fact that it has an element of sport in order to get away with discrimination even though sport may be only a small part of the activities of the club. I accept the Government tabled an amendment on Committee Stage which <Col N="824" /> substituted the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;justifiable&rdquo; and that it, in effect, strengthened the provision.

      <P>I understand that on Committee Stage Deputy O'Sullivan indicated that her amendment was to prevent clubs from circumventing the provisions in the Bill by using the sporting dimension to discriminate in a more general way between men and women. I consider that the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Sullivan will not have the effect she intends. The subsection at present applies to sporting facilities or events at a club but Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment would restrict the application of the subsection to specialist sports clubs. If the amendment were accepted, the exemption would be extremely narrow and would not allow for, say, an under 21 team event or a women's event in a club. I accept that was not her intention, but that is the logical conclusion of deliberations on the effects of her amendment.</P>
      <P>Any different treatment of men and women in relation to sporting facilities or events in a club must be relevant to the purpose of the facilities or events. Such different treatment must be reasonably necessary. In those circumstances, I trust the Deputy will withdraw her amendment.</P>

I am satisfied section 10(<i>b</i>) precludes multiple applications from a club by way of a determination of the District Court to reverse a decision that it is a discriminatory club. The club cannot indefinitely postpone the <Col N="825" /> loss of a certificate of registration by making repeat applications.</P>
      <P>Section 10(<i>b</i>) provides that if a club makes an application under section 8(10) for a reversal of a decision, that it is a discriminatory club. The club's certificate of registration may be renewed in the normal way when it comes up for annual renewal the following September. The annual licensing court takes place in the District Court in September, although it has often been the case that the court has been adjourned from month to month for a reasonable period. If during the following 12 months the District Court makes a determination that the club is still discriminating, the certificate ceases on the date of the determination. If the District Court decides the club is no longer discriminating, the club is no longer liable to forfeit its certificate of registration. If, however, the District Court does not make a determination during the 12 month period, the certificate lasts for 12 months but no longer.</P>

It seeks to restore the ban on harassment generally in clubs and partnerships that was included in the 1997 Bill but is not included in this Bill. As we debated this issue when we dealt with an amendment proposed by Deputy Barnes, I do not propose to repeat the points that were made. I stress that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is particularly concerned that this legislation is not as strong as the previous legislation on the issue of harassment. Between now and when the Bill is taken in the Seanad, will the Minister consider including some form of wording to address our concern that the issue of harassment should be covered in the legislation?</P>

      <P>I will not take up the time of the House by repeating the argument in support of this amendment. It is important to address this issue in the legislation. There is a good deal of proof that harassment in terms of not only discrimination but intimidation is taking place in certain circumstances. The act of harassment is a barrier and denies people their rights. It can be inflicted not only in a financial way but also in an emotional and mentally punishing way. I appeal <Col N="826" /> to the Minister to reconsider this issue between now and when the Bill is taken in the Seanad. Harassment is a reality and it will become increasingly more common as time passes. Women and minority groups will need access to this type of action, which I hope will be provided for in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept this amendment. Following careful consideration of the scope of the prohibition on sexual harassment and harassment in the 1997 Bill, it was decided that the prohibition in that Bill was justifiably wide and required rationalisation. Sexual harassment and harassment are prohibited in this Bill essentially because they constitute a form of discrimination. Logically, the prohibition on sexual harassment should operate only in those areas in which discrimination is prohibited, that is the provision of goods, services and accommodation, disposal of premises and education.</P>
      <P>While the Bill contains sanctions against discriminatory registered clubs, it does not prohibit such discrimination. It would be inappropriate to have a prohibition on discrimination in what are essentially private clubs. Similarly, since partnerships do not come within the scope of this Bill, a prohibition on harassment in the partnership area is not included. Just as the prohibition on sexual and other harassment in the Employment Equality Act applies in the employment area, the prohibition in this measure applies in those areas where discrimination is prohibited.</P>

      <P>I request the Minister to reconsider this issue. In effect, he is saying this issue cannot be covered in any legislation because it does not relate to employment or a service within his definition of this legislation. During an earlier debate this morning he was quite willing to include matters in legislation that might not have been intended in the original legislation. I refer to the issue of refugees, asylum seekers, trafficking and immigration. Those matters have been jumbled together in legislation. It is not outside the Minister's ability to broaden legislation when it suits him to include other matters. I feel strongly that harassment needs to be covered under some legislation under the equality agenda. I strongly urge the Minister to consider how he will deal with this issue. I would prefer if he would deal with it under this legislation when it is taken in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I support what Deputy O'Sullivan said. Given that this Bill is so wide-ranging and covers so many areas and groups, who are not covered in other legislation, the exclusion of this issue is a yawning gap, so to speak, in the legislation. This issue should be addressed in it to endorse what Deputy O'Sullivan said. Its inclusion would strengthen the legislation. Given that this issue is not addressed in other legislation and having regard to the length of time it takes to introduce legislation, I ask the Minister to <Col N="827" /> address this issue in this Bill. As Deputy O'Sullivan said, a precedent has been set in terms of including other matters in other legislation. Given that this issue is of central importance in regard to discrimination in the areas we discussed, I appeal to the Minister to include a provision to address it when the Bill is taken in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>No, this legislation has been given careful consideration. As Members are aware, the Bill had to be reconsidered in great detail in the past number of years as a result of a decision made by the Supreme Court which found that the Employment Equality Act was unconstitutional. The Equal Status Bill was not deeply considered by the court but, because it contained provisions similar to those in the Employment Equality Act, it was obvious that it was also unconstitutional in three respects. The legislation has been given careful consideration since then and it was decided that it should deal with the prohibition of discrimination in certain distinct areas, namely, the provision of goods, services and accommodation, the disposal of premises and education.</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to broaden the scope of the legislation to deal with areas of activity it was not intended to cover in the first instance. Logically, therefore, the amendments which Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Barnes have put forward in regard to where discrimination should be prohibited should have been tabled earlier. It is illogical to bring forward these amendments, particularly as I do not recall the Deputies seeking to extend the areas where discrimination would occur when it might have been appropriate to do so. I am not saying that Deputies O'Sullivan and Fitzgerald did not argue in favour of extensions. However, I do not recall these specific matters being raised on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In my view the thrust of the legislation would be changed entirely by what the Deputies are now suggesting. That is something which would have to considered in great depth. Deputy O'Sullivan said that the Minister is able to take the action she requires when he so desires.</P>

      <P>In the previous legislation, the sexual harassment issue was dealt with in that section. I do not know whether the Minister is suggesting that we should have tabled an amendment to the effect that a person is being sexually harassed in one situation but not in the other. As far as I am concerned, that is the only way it could have been included in the grounds for sexual harassment. It does not seem to make any sense. It is perfectly logical to include the proposal suggested in the amendment in this section and I ask the Minister to reconsider the position in that regard.</P>
      <P>The constitutional judgments that were made in relation to this legislation and the other Act did not, in any way, touch upon the possibility of adding measures in respect of harassment.

      <P>This amendment is concerned with advertising. I seek to make it an offence to publish a discriminatory advertisement, rather than it only being an offence to make a false statement in order to secure publication. This is a complicated point. According to the legislation, it is an offence to make a false statement to secure publication but it is not an offence to issue a publication. In other words, a person will be brought to court if they make a false statement whereas they will only be brought before the authority if they publish a discriminatory advertisement. It seems that the two should be dealt with together rather than by means of two different mechanisms. We debated this matter on Committee Stage with the former Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and I do not believe we got much further than his emphasising that that was the case. Will the Minister comment on this issue?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's approach would make certain <Col N="829" /> contraventions of the Bill both offences and matters which can be investigated by the director. As I explained on Committee Stage, I am advised that it would be impermissible for a matter to be prosecuted criminally while at the same time having it investigated by the director. In other words, the twin-track approach recommended by the Deputy cannot be adopted. I understand that Deputy O'Sullivan took the point of view of the former Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Fahey, on board when this matter was discussed on Committee Stage and I can only hope that I will be as fortunate.</P>

      <P>Section 14(<i>a</i>) exempts from being deemed discrimination actions required under a statute, court order, EU measure, international obligation, etc. In relation to the term &ldquo;enactment&rdquo;, for example, distinctions in the tax code based on age, marital status or family status or in social welfare legislation based on age or family status will not be regarded as discrimination under this legislation. It would not be practical in this Bill to enumerate all such items, whether direct or indirect, of other Departments' legislation and then proceed to insert specific exemptions, which would need to be tailor-made, to each such Act. I cannot conceive how it would be possible to enact legislation in the social welfare area, for example, without such legislation encompassing different treatment on grounds such as age, family status and so on. I should point out that there was a similar provision in the 1997 Bill. For these and other reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>As I pointed out when dealing with amendments Nos. 5 and 6, the exemption in section 14 applies only to actions which are mandatory under the relevant statute and not to the discretionary actions of statutory bodies or <Col N="830" /> public officials. Lest there be any doubt about this matter I should add that even where a matter is exempt under section 14, the obligation not to discriminate would apply to the interaction between officials and the public in the delivery of the relevant statutory function. For example, the fact that the requirements of the tax code are exempt does not allow Revenue officials to discriminate in respect of granting access to buildings and information or in providing advice or other forms of assistance.</P>

      <P>There are many positive aspects to this section which deals with regulations concerning vehicle equipment, particularly those dealing with access to transportation for people with disabilities. This amendment seeks to ensure consultation with the Minister for Public Enterprise rather than her agreement so that the equality agenda has primacy over the transportation agenda when it comes to access for people with disabilities. In other words, it seeks to ensure that the Minister with responsibility for equality issues would ultimately make the decision in terms of access for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>With due respect to the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, a subsequent Minister could give all kinds of arguments as to why he or she cannot afford accessible transport or whatever. I am seeking to give primacy to the equality aspect when it comes to access to transportation for people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>I am not convinced of the need for amendments Nos. 66 and 69 which envisage my making ministerial regulations in what is, by and large, the operational area of the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke. The amendments would allow me to make such regulations having consulted with the Minister, rather than secured her agreement. It may not be the Deputy's intention but accepting this amendment would be tantamount to declaring civil war which I am not prepared to do.</P>
      <P>An earlier amendment tabled by Deputy O'Sullivan would have had me trespassing on the Tánaiste's turf. I assure the Deputy that these Ministers have signs outside their Departments which read, &ldquo;Trespassers Will Be Prosecuted&rdquo;. I am not willing to take the risk in those circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has indicated that the Government is strongly committed to bringing about a situation where public transport facilities are fully accessible to all at the earliest possible date. Anyone who knows Deputy O'Rourke will know that if she says that is to happen, it will happen. It is also her policy that all public and private transport operators should, as far as is possible, make their services and facilities accessible to people with disabilities, a fact which all Members will welcome. It is appropriate that I mention the work being done by the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, in this respect which has been commended at every level. The word &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; was included in the Equal Status Bill, 1997, following an expressed decision of the then Government.</P>

I accept that there is not a great deal of difference between the wording in the Bill and the wording I am seeking to insert. However, last year, under Deputy O'Rourke's nose, Dublin Bus bought buses which were not accessible to wheelchair users. There was considerable protest at the time so vigilance is essential in terms of access to public transport.</P>
      <P>I compliment Bus Éireann in Limerick which recently introduced a number of accessible buses without any fuss. These vehicles are extremely effective and successful. However, Dublin Bus had to be dragged kicking and screaming into buying accessible buses and went ahead and bought some which were not accessible when this issue was under debate and public scrutiny. There is justification for my concern that the equality agenda should be supreme in these matters.</P>

      <P>My proposals in relation to the transport area are the same as those in the 1997 Bill, except for minor technical changes. The provisions in sections 17 and 18, which set down special provisions as regards transport accessibility for people with disabilities, are innovative and are not parallel to or drawn from existing legislation governing these areas. In contrast, the existing regulatory framework regarding taxi permits, accessibility issues for people with disabilities, as well as quality and service issues, needs to be addressed. These functions are vested in the relevant local authority which issues the taxi or hackney licence and come under the broad aegis of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

The operation and <Col N="833" /> licensing of wheelchair accessible taxis, hackneys, limousines and their drivers is controlled through the Road Traffic Public Service Vehicles Regulations, 1963 to 1999. Under these regulations, local authorities are responsible, <i>inter alia ,</i> for determining the number of taxi and wheelchair accessible taxi licences which may be granted, for monitoring the adequacy of the taxi service in their areas and for deciding on action to ensure that the demand for these services is adequately met.</P>
      <P>Everyone will welcome the recent announcement by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, that 500 wheelchair accessible taxis will be provided in Dublin. This means there will be an improvement in the situation. I am not suggesting that the current position is adequate; it is not. There is no doubt there is a need for a greater degree of access for people with disabilities to all types of transport. When one meets disability groups, the issue they raise at all times is access, whether it is access to buildings, transport or footpaths. This is a perennial problem for people with disabilities and it is appropriate that we should discuss it here. I assure the House that in so far as the Government can, it is determined to try to ensure that access for people with disabilities across a wide range of services will be improved.</P>

If a person comes in over the Border, for example, and is under the influence of an intoxicant or drink, it would be open to the gardaí to prosecute.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The National Millennium Committee was set up to advise the Government on projects for inclusion in its millennium programme. A total fund of £30 million was allocated to this programme, covering the period 1999 and 2000. Following a national advertising campaign, more than 2000 proposals have been submitted to the committee for consideration. Over the past 12 months the committee has considered the proposals received and has made recommendations on projects to the Government on a regular basis. The recommendations of the committee reflect particular themes, for example, children, youth, and the elderly, the environment and the celebration of Christianity. In addition the committee has also endeavoured to ensure a wide geographic spread of projects.</P>
      <P>To date the millennium committee has made recommendations on projects amounting to nearly £29 million. This figure includes £3 million for 193 locally based projects around the country under the millennium recognition awards, an initiative administered by Area Development Management Ltd. It also includes £3 million for 1,959 millennium events awards, administered by local authorities. To date just over £6.4 million has been drawn down in respect of the millennium programme.</P>
      <P>The National Millennium Committee is supported by a small millennium office, the operational budget of which is included in the overall millennium fund.</P>
      <P>At this stage millennium funding is almost fully committed. The National Millennium Committee is now in the process of finalising consideration of outstanding projects with a view to allocating the remaining funds available. The committee is approaching this final task with due regard to ensure a broad thematic and geographic spread, consistent with its previous recommendations to the Government.</P>
      <P>There has been enormous public interest in the work of the millennium committee and in the projects it is selecting for support and endorsement. One clear indication of the level of interest being shown is the numbers who have accessed the official website of the millennium committee. Since August 1999, when the website went on line, until 12 February 2000, there had been 745,654 &ldquo;hits&rdquo; on the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>While up to £29 million has been allocated, previous experience suggests that not all of that money will be drawn down because the sponsors of some projects will be unable to produce the matching funds. Will the Minister of State give an undertaking that the balance of money not drawn down, as determined within a reasonable period of time, will be reallocated to other millennium projects? I make a specific representation on behalf of the labour movement which sought and received £250,000 for the refur<Col N="836" /> bishment and development of Liberty Hall as the sole physical manifestation of the labour movement, one of the key social partners in the structure of the State. Where there is a shortfall because of escalating costs, I request that a matching sum of another £250,000, assuming that the money is not drawn down, will be made available for the project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If projects cannot use the money, those funds will be available for other millennium projects within the envelope of what is available. I will convey the Deputy's recommendations to the National Millennium Committee. The committee had no difficulty with supporting the Liberty Hall project. It would like to have supported it to a greater extent.</P>
      <P>Many of the capital projects are only starting. We are funding bridges, forestry, community and church projects, floodlighting, lighthouses and the Battle of the Boyne site. All of those projects are starting now and I expect the money to be drawn down quickly. The flagship projects were the millennium forest, our proposal to plant 1.2 million native trees, the children's hour, to which we allocated £2 million and the light ceremony, which was a magnificent success throughout the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of the Battle of the Boyne site was given impetus by our securing the purchase of the land and allocating £0.5 million. The final flagship project was the grant of £0.5 million to the Irish Landmark Trust which would restore the lighthouse keepers' cottages at five of Ireland's most beautiful headlands.</P>
      <P>We allocated £9.5 million to capital projects, £7 million to social projects, £6 million to community projects, £3.8 million to arts and education projects, £2 million to church projects, £2 million to exile projects and £2 million to celebratory projects. There were 2,000 proposals.</P>

      <P>Messiah XXI Productions Limited, in line with the original proposal to the National Millennium Committee, has pledged a percentage of any net after tax profits to Irish charities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On December 8, 1999 it was agreed in writing with the millennium committee that this amount will be 10% annually up to £700,000 &ndash; equivalent to the original award made to Messiah XXI Productions by the National Millennium Committee. <Col N="837" /> Thereafter the promoters pledge to continue their support for Irish charities.</P>
    <P>It was also agreed in writing by Messiah XXI Productions and the millennium committee that structures to give effect to this arrangement would be formulated. Discussions have subsequently taken place and a situation has been reached where contractual letters of agreement are being exchanged.</P>
    <P>These letters specify that the amount to be donated to charities should be 10% annually of net after tax profits up to £700,000; that an audit should be carried out annually of the accounts of Messiah XXI Productions Ltd; that decisions on the Irish charities that may benefit from the donations should be agreed between the National Millennium Committee and Messiah XXI Productions Ltd., and that provision should be made for a continuation of the agreement after the term of the National Millennium Committee expires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who first raised this issue. Have there been any sales of the television production which was broadcast here? Have preliminary accounts been received by the Minister of State's Department in respect of the first effective trading year of the Messiah XXI production? Has the charitable trust referred to been established and registered?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sought information about sales of the production but I do not have a detailed answer, it is still early days. The production took place in December and it is only February. However, I have asked the company how sales are going. I am told they are making a big effort in a part of the US that appreciates this type of performance, but I do not have any figures at this stage. While I do not have accounts for the company, I have a written agreement that they will be produced. We are not yet at the end of year one, so perhaps it would be inappropriate to demand them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how the company's sales are doing. I have sought the information and thus far I have been told it is making a big effort in the US. That is where the matter rests. However, I am very anxious about this and am determined to stay on top of it.</P>
      <P>On the question of charitable trusts, we have not finalised a decision to establish a legal trust. It was more a contractual legal agreement between the company and the committee and its successor that the funds would be awarded to charities in a certain rather than through a specific charitable trust. I agree with the Deputy that before distributing anything to charity, the first task is to ascertain how the company is doing. As soon as I have that information I will convey it to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Millennium Committee stays in being. We have a number of projects to complete and oversee and a small amount of money still <Col N="838" /> has to be allocated. I take this opportunity to thank the members and the staff of the committee who worked long hours and presented for Ireland a balanced celebration and a range of projects we will be proud to remember.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that at this stage it is probably premature to establish a distinct separate charitable trust because we do not know if there will be money to distribute. When replying to an Adjournment matter on 7 December 1999, the Minister of State indicated that the money would be distributed among charitable purposes or to a specially dedicated trust. We must wait to see what the artistic market says about this production.</P>
      <P>If the moneys generated do not warrant the establishment of an individual specially dedicated trust, will the Minister of State consider making available whatever disposable income is generated from the surplus to support the pensions or incomes of ageing or disabled performers and cultural artists and activists? For reasons of labour market uncertainty this category of people has not ever had adequate pension provision and many of them are uninsured. They have given wonderful entertainment and inspiration to countless generations of Irish people, yet many of them face penury.</P>

      <Quest>Ireland's views on and response to the UN Security Council's report of spring 1999 in relation to humanitarian relief in Iraq and on the suffering of the civilian population there as a result of sanctions; if the Government has satisfied itself as to the manner in which sanctions are being implemented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs who, as you are aware Sir, has been called away at the last moment to attend the London talks. Ireland shares the international humanitarian concern at the deprivations being suffered by the people of Iraq. The imposition and administration of the sanctions are primarily a matter for the Security Council and the Iraqi authorities.</P>
      <P>In February last year, the UN Secretary General presented a report on the implementation of the oil for food programme, which revealed inadequacies. The members of the Security Council were not, and are still not, fully agreed on the reasons for these inadequacies. The Security Council established three panels to examine the facts in regard to, first, humanitarian assistance, second, the inspection of arms and, third, prisoners of war. These reported to the Security Council in spring 1999.</P>
      <P>The panel report on humanitarian assistance stated that &ldquo;the gravity of the humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people is indisputable and cannot be overstated.&rdquo;  To help remedy this situation, the panel made a number of recommendations addressed both to the international community and to the Iraqi government, including proposals to secure additional funding for the humanitarian oil for food programme by raising the ceiling on oil exports from Iraq.</P>
      <P>On 17 December, the Security Council adopted a comprehensive resolution, No. 1284. This unconditionally abolished the ceiling on oil exports, and provided for the suspension of sanctions for renewable periods in return for satisfactory Iraqi co-operation with UN disarmament inspections. It is a matter of record that the authorities in Baghdad refused to accept the arms inspection provisions and rejected the terms of the resolution.</P>
      <P>Ireland and the European Union fully support the UN Security Council in demanding full compliance by the Government of Iraq with the terms of its resolutions, which require the verification of the elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. Compliance with these resolutions will make it possible for the entire issue of sanctions against Iraq to be resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to wish the Minister well in his appointment to the Cabinet. Is he aware that continuance of the economic sanctions is causing the death of an additional 200 children a day? Will he comment on the resignation of Hans von Sponeck on Sunday? He is the second official to be co-ordinator of humanitarian relief in Iraq and he resigned on the same principle as his predecessor, Denis Halliday, namely that the misery and death being visited on civilians in Iraq made his position unsustainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" /> The UN committee on economic, social and cultural rights stated that the inhabitants of a given country do not forfeit basic economic, social and cultural rights by virtue of any determination that their leaders have violated norms relating to international peace and security. On what basis can we possibly continue to support economic sanctions, given the facts I have outlined? Are the Minister and the Government not concerned that independent representatives of the UN &ndash; senior representatives of Kofi Annan &ndash; have said they cannot operate the policy and look on while children's deaths are increasing by hundreds every day?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is very concerned at the difficulties arising in connection with the implementation of the international humanitarian aid programmes as a result of the sanctions. These difficulties have been reflected in the two high level resignations this week. The permanent members of the Security Council appear to hold divided views on these resignations. The US and Britain have been critical of Mr. von Sponeck because of his opposition to sanctions although France is reported to have indicated that his evaluation of the humanitarian situation corresponds to reality. While the Government is concerned, we support the position of the UN Security Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the different reports on Hans von Sponeck's resignation. The coverage in the US press was disgraceful. They say it is good that he resigned on the basis that he was reported in the Iraqi press as doing a good job for children and with regard to humanitarian relief. Where does Ireland stand? We are canvassing for membership of the security council and have sent ambassadors around the world, including trawling in the Pacific, for votes. What will be our attitude to the continuance of economic sanctions if we get a seat on the Security Council? It is not clear what is meant when we say we support the Security Council. Does it mean we are supporting Britain and the US which is supporting economic sanctions to the extent that graphite for pencils used in schools are included in the embargo? Two weeks ago Jordan sent a couple of hundred thousand pencils to Iraq. We cannot simply say we are concerned by the economic sanctions. The issue concerns the lives of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noted that the Minister did not reply when I asked for his response to the statement of the UN committee on economic, social and cultural rights saying that the inhabitants of a given country do not forfeit their economic, social, cultural or other rights simply because the leadership of their country has been involved in a conflict. It is an outrageous violation of every norm and principle of international policy and I am appalled at the suggestion that we can be satisfied on the basis of a US flyer. What about the 90 law makers in the US Congress, including the second most senior <Col N="841" /> democrat, who have said they want the sanctions rescinded?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is vitally important that we lay blame in the proper place. Irrespective of what the Deputy says, the Iraqi Government continues to fail to co-operate adequately with the UN programme. A report by the UN special envoy, dated October 1999, states&mdash;</P>

      <P>The most recent information available to me on the subject is from a report by UNICEF entitled &ldquo;The State of the World's Children 1998 &ndash; Focus on Nutrition&rdquo;. Malnutrition, according to the report, plays a role in more than half of the nearly 12 million deaths each year of children under five in developing countries. The report notes that malnutrition is the result of multiple causes, including a lack of food, common and preventable infections, inadequate care and unsafe water.</P>
      <P>The state of the world's children report, 1998 also points to some progress. Nearly 60% of the world's salt is now iodised and millions of children every year are spared mental retardation as a result. Vitamin A supplements are helping bolster disease resistance in children and may soon become an important measure in helping reduce maternal deaths around the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="842" /> The Deputy will be aware that the focus of the Irish aid programme, both at multilateral and bilateral levels, is on the least developed countries and that primary health care, especially the health of children, nutrition and food security are central components of that focus.</P>

      <P>The issue of immigrants to the EU and to individual member states has not been discussed at recent meetings of the General Affairs Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Related issues which were dealt with at the <Col N="844" /> GAC over the past year concerned the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration, the preparations for the Tampere European Council and the adoption of a joint action on the reception and voluntary repatriation of refugees.</P>
    <P>At the meeting of the GAC in January 1999 the mandate for the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration, was agreed and at the June and October meetings of the GAC reports from this HLWG were approved. The main feature of the high level working group's work was to concentrate on the countries which are giving rise to the greatest problems and to see how the situation could be improved by taking measures in relation to those countries and with their co-operation. Having agreed the priority list of countries, the HLWG proceeded with the presentation of an action plan to tackle each country. The plans comprised an analysis of the causes of the influx from the countries, the possibility of strengthening economic co-operation with them, the identification of needs for humanitarian aid and the situation as regards re-admission agreements with the countries. The list of countries which the HLWG focused on was Afghanistan/ Pakistan, Albania &ndash; and the neighbouring region &ndash; Morocco, Somalia and Sri Lanka. The HLWG was also tasked to review the existing action plan for Iraq as well. The final report of the HLWG was submitted to the Tampere European Council.</P>
    <P>At the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 26 April, 1999 a joint action on the reception and the voluntary repatriation of refugees was approved. The joint action established measures to provide practical support in relation to the reception and the voluntary repatriation of refugees, displaced persons and asylum applicants, including emergency assistance to persons who fled as a result of events in Kosovo.</P>
    <P>The GAC was intimately involved in the preparations of the special European summit in Tampere last October and the issue was discussed at a number of GACs last year. The Deputy will be aware that the meeting in Tampere was the first occasion the heads of State and Government dedicated a summit to the issues of justice and home affairs and that one of the core agenda items concerned the development of a common EU asylum and migration policy. In this context the Commission has been asked to bring forward proposals to allow for the establishment of a common European asylum system. The system is to include clear rules as to the State responsible for processing asylum applications, the common standards for processing applications and receiving asylum seekers. It will also seek to codify refugee status and subsidiary forms of temporary protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Government has decided, for example, not to receive the Austrian ambassador and has generally joined other Governments in criticising the formation of the Austrian Government, does the Minister agree that we have some nerve to take that step <Col N="845" /> when the Austrian state has been dealing with a large influx of immigrants &ndash; which in part has given rise to the political change there &ndash; when we have a relatively small number of immigrants and are constantly rushing in, sometimes through the back door, more and more legislation to deal with the situation in an unacceptable manner? Is there not an element of double standard and hypocrisy involved in this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government rejects the tone of much of what the freedom party has had to say on the issue. It is obviously offensive and racist. While I am aware of some of the positions taken, I note the new Austrian situation in its programme for Government committed itself to the enlargement process. In addition, the new Austrian Chancellor, as Foreign Minister in the last Government, was closely involved in the enlargement process and commitments had already been undertaken by Austria. Thus I would not expect any substantial change in Austria's position on enlargement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware of my condemnation in the House of some of the more outrageous things said by the Freedom Party and I reiterate that condemnation. Given that 27% of the population in Austria voted the way they did, for many reasons not connected to what Jorg Haider outrageously said, does the Minister agree it is not good policy for the Government to continue to refuse to receive the Austrian ambassador who is here to represent the State and the duly elected Government of Austria? When will this boycott end and normal relations recommence on a bilateral basis between EU member states, particularly between Ireland and Austria?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that part of the solution to the problem, in so far as it is a problem with immigrants in the European Union, stems from the fact that many people are economic refugees? They simply cannot make a living in their homes. Does he agree that some of this problem is connected to my earlier question relating to the need for wealthier EU states, particularly states such as Ireland and the larger EU states, to invest in these regions to try to give people an opportunity to eke out a living in their natural homes? Can the Minister see the connection between the two? Is this part of consideration of the immigrant issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not necessarily see the connection between the two. It is fair to say Ireland has played a significant role in development work in many respects in those regions and will continue <Col N="846" /> to do so. I cannot see why there should be specific links between the two areas.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, and as was required by the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, the North-South Ministerial Council, meeting in transitional form on 1 December 1999, formally endorsed the political decision of 18 December 1998. This identified and agreed six areas for co-operation through the establishment of the new North-South implementation bodies and a further six areas for co-operation through the mechanism of existing bodies in each separate jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Education was not one of the six areas in which it was agreed that an implementation body would be established, but it was included in the &ldquo;areas for co-operation&rdquo; category.</P>
      <P>At its inaugural plenary meeting in Armagh on 13 December 1999, the North-South Ministerial Council agreed that its meetings in sectoral format would focus initially on the work areas of the implementation bodies and the six areas for co-operation, which, as I have indicated, include education.</P>
      <P>The first meeting of the council in the education sector took place at Dublin Castle on 3 February last. The Government was represented by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods. The Northern delegation comprised the Minister for Education, Mr. Martin McGuinness and his colleague, the Minister in the office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, Mr. Dermot Nesbitt.</P>
      <P>The meeting was positive and productive. The Council examined proposals on how best to take forward its work and decided to establish a number of joint working groups on various matters, charging each group with delivering concrete progress. The Minister has arranged for a copy of the detailed communiqué to be sent to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is envisaged that, as with other sectoral formats, meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council in the education sector will take place on <Col N="847" /> a quarterly basis, subject of course to the institutions being re-established.</P>

Will the Minister of State clarify what is the current status of the North-South Ministerial Council? Is it in limbo? Legally, it is in existence but is not functional.

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been indicated in reply to parliamentary questions on this issue on 29 September, 2 November and 2 December 1999, the plight of those who have been forced to leave their home areas as a result of paramilitary threats or intimidation is a cause of serious concern. The right to &ldquo;freely choose one's place of residence&rdquo; is recognised by the Good Friday Agreement. The right of those concerned to have the threats against them lifted and to return home is fully endorsed by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Government, in its communications with parties with influence on paramilitary groups, has called on them to do everything possible to help resolve this unacceptable situation and continue to do so. In recent consultations with the British authorities, within the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, it was again confirmed that no figures are maintained on the numbers of people forced to leave Northern Ireland nor is it feasible to collate such figures in the future. Given the nature of the problem, neither the groups involved in making the threats nor those who receive them are likely to make information on numbers available.</P>
      <P>As previously pointed out, the Victims Commissioner, Mr. John Wilson, noted in his report that a number of those affected by paramilitary exiling reside in this jurisdiction, and the Government is currently examining measures aimed at alleviating their plight. I again strongly urge all those with influence in this area to help put a complete end to these odious threats against individuals who wish to return to their own homes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the tone of the reply. &ldquo;Serious concern&rdquo; is a condition that is almost permanent in Iveagh House on many issues but I compliment the officials who have described what is taking place as &ldquo;odious&rdquo; and &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo;. It is incredible that the Minister of State said that it is not feasible to even estimate the number of people involved. That infor<Col N="849" /> mation is available. There are three parts to my question. One part is the estimated number of those who are forced into exile and the second is the issue of facilitating their return. Given the Government's serious concern about practices that it finds unacceptable and odious, one would have thought it was not beyond its capacity to estimate the number of people involved and put it to us hypothetically and to prepare what precise steps it proposes to take in order to facilitate the return of people to their own communities.</P>
      <P>Prisoners have been released and returned to their communities. Families and individuals have been driven out by the most cowardly, despicable practices, yet an estimate cannot be put on the numbers involved. Will the Minister of State make another attempt to seek such an estimate from the other side of the table at the talks?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants a guestimate, I will talk to him later. Information on numbers is all but impossible to obtain and I am sure the Deputy will understand that. Given the nature of the problem the groups involved in making such threats or those who receive them are not likely to help to resolve it. We can only hope to get some idea of this problem when the threats are lifted and the individuals return. It is an impossible science to try to seriously estimate the numbers involved. Cases have been brought to the attention of the Department and the Government and efforts have been made to try to alleviate the plight of those involved as far as possible.</P>

Does he agree that this is more Stalinist than republican? The concept of expulsion derives from the Stalinist era and has nothing to do with republicanism. I hope that this <Col N="850" /> heavy handed approach will be decommissioned in its own right. The Minister surely has some estimate of the numbers involved.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 62, 66 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>This reply is the same as that to Priority Question No. 5.</P>
      <P>The creation of the institutions in December was not only a major step forward in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, it also brought immediate and tangible benefits to the people of Northern Ireland and the island as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time, an Executive in Northern Ireland, fully representative of both communities, has been taking decisions and implementing policy on behalf of people to whom it is directly accountable. The Assembly has been working well, debating issues, scrutinising the work of Ministers, and fulfilling its role as a legislative body. Through the North-South Ministerial Council, and building on the success of its inaugural meeting in Armagh on 13 December, Ministers from North and South have been carrying forward important work in their meetings in sectoral format, four of which have now taken place. The implementation bodies have made an impressive start to tackling their areas of responsibility. The British-Irish Council and the <Col N="851" /> British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference have identified and agreed key areas which will constitute their initial programmes of work.</P>
    <P>Given this rapid and encouraging start, it is particularly disappointing and frustrating that the operation of the Assembly and the Executive has been suspended, and the IRA representative has withdrawn from engagement with the International Commission on Decommissioning.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, together with their officials, did all in their power to avoid suspension. Following receipt of the progress report of the Commission on 31 January, they engaged in an intensive series of meetings and contacts with the British Government and with all of the relevant parties, beginning with the meeting in Dublin between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 1 February.</P>
    <P>As a result of those discussions, and in particular those between the Government and Sinn Féin, the international commission was able to make a positive and significant report to the two Governments on 11 February. As the House will be aware, however, the presentation of that report coincided with the suspension of the Executive and the Assembly.</P>
    <P>This is undoubtedly a grave setback, but rather than spending valuable time seeking to apportion blame, we must continue to channel all of our energies into securing the earliest possible restoration of the operation of the institutions.</P>
    <P>This afternoon the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are meeting Prime Minister Blair and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, in London, and they will both meet representatives of the SDLP, the UUP and Sinn Féin. On Monday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs had two meetings with the Secretary of State in Belfast in which they took stock of the present situation and agreed the necessity to move forward as quickly as possible. Since the start of the week, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has also met all of the pro-Agreement parties in the Assembly &ndash; Sinn Féin, the UUP, the Alliance Party, the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition, the Progressive Unionist Party and, together with the Taoiseach, the SDLP. In all of these meetings, the Minister has been struck by the clear determination on all sides to find a speedy resolution to our current difficulties.</P>
    <P>That is the positive side. It is clear to me, however, that there is a continuing and large deficit of trust. All parties will need assurance that the Agreement, in all of its aspects, will be implemented in full.</P>
    <P>As we work to secure progress, it is worth recalling the words of Senator Mitchell on publication of his final report in November when he stated that the one thing which is certain is that, without the institutions, there will be no decommissioning. That the IRA representative will not for now engage further with the Commission is <Col N="852" /> deeply regrettable and disappointing. Senator Mitchell also observed that prolonging the stalemate will leave society in the North uncertain and vulnerable. That remains the case. The recent bomb in Irvinestown is a stark reminder that there are still those who would seek to bring the Agreement down and who stand ready to fill any political vacuum that we allow to develop.</P>
    <P>We urgently need to bring the institutions back into operation &ndash; they are central to the Agreement &ndash; and the IRA must also re-engage with the international commission. The operation of the institutions has been an unqualified success. They make many things, including decommissioning, possible. I know all of the parties are genuine and sincere in their wish to make early progress, but they, with the Governments, must now redouble their efforts and stretch their respective constituencies to the maximum.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to wish the Taoiseach well in his meetings today, and to extend good wishes to the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, in the difficult challenges he faces as he takes over at the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>I note with interest the Minister of State's response to the question on the level of trust. He indicated that there is a deficit in the level of trust but that political advances have been made. We all recognise that economic, social and political advances have been made since the creation of the institutions and in their operation, and that a good working relationship existed. Will the Minister identify the area in which the deficit of trust that has created this breach exists, particularly as welcome advances have been made?</P>

      <P>As events have moved so quickly, we all have our own opinion on where matters of trust have broken down. What we should do today is emphasise the positives, and very significant progress has been made. I had the pleasure of participating in one of the joint ministerial councils in Derry this day week and I was pleasantly surprised at the level of trust and the good will that existed among all the parties present for the inauguration of the commission on the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights. All of the political parties in the Assembly were represented on that body and there was much good will and camaraderie among them. Everybody to whom I spoke was of the strong view that this was a great experience. We should now concentrate on stating the positives. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are trying to deal with the negatives and the areas where there is a lack of trust so as to get the whole process back on-stream. All we can do is wish them well.</P>

      <P>I also want to wish the Taoiseach and the Minister well in their discussions but I want to make a statement, by way of asking a question, and I will leave it at that. The Minister quoted Senator George Mitchell in relation to decommissioning and the institutions. We had the institutions but we still did not have decommissioning. As somebody who joined a political party in 1969, when I was little more than a boy, and who has spent time with other Members of this House canvassing outside church gates and schools, running for election and all the drudgery we had to go through to get elected, and to stay elected, I resent people shooting their way to the table and then, when they get to the table, thinking they are some sort of heroes holding on to their guns. I do not want to go any further than that but the reality is that the Unionists, of whom I have been critical in the past, did jump and they were told if they jumped there would be a generous response. There was not a generous response.</P>
      <P>It is not fair to reply to this House by quoting Senator George Mitchell to the effect that there would be no decommissioning when there were no institutions. There were institutions but there was no decommissioning, and one party is responsible for that.</P>

      <P>The British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, was in Dublin recently on private business. The Minister for Foreign Affairs met him at an informal dinner at the British Ambassador's residence.

Was the alleged interception by the British authorities of telephone calls, e-mails and faxes from the Republic raised and, if so, what response was given?

      <P>I was previously on that side of the House answering questions for the Department of Foreign Affairs. I presume when the Minister comes to the House to make a statement on his recent meeting with the British Foreign Secretary in Dublin, the discussion will not be simply about the meeting, whether he was a nice guy, how he looked and if the beef was nice. We want to know about the content of the meeting. Surely that is in the Minister of State's brief. I accept he stepped in to take questions at the last minute but there must be some type of reply in the brief which he can read to the House. Did the Minister raise the interception of telephone calls from this country to Britain, a matter that was raised by me and others here and in the foreign affairs committee on several occasions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 15, 55 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>With a view to ensuring that the European Union could continue to work efficiently in the context of enlargement, it was agreed at the Cologne European Council in June 1999 to convene an intergovernmental council in 2000, with a mandate to examine those issues unresolved at Amsterdam, namely, the size and composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council and the possible extension of qualified majority voting in the Council, as well as changes to the institutions necessitated by enlargement and other necessary consequential amendments to the treaties.</P>
      <P>At the Helsinki European Council in December, it was agreed that the intergovernmental conference would convene in February 2000 and would aim to conclude its work by December 2000. As regards the agenda, it endorsed the focus on the issues remaining from Amsterdam, as well as other necessary amendments arising in the context of enlargement and the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty. It was also agreed that the Presidency would report to the European Council in June on progress made in the conference and on any proposals for additions to the conference agenda. There is also provision for an interim report to the Lisbon European Council in March.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the timetable drawn up by the Portuguese Presidency, the Minister attended the opening session of the Intergovernmental Conference in Brussels on 14 February. It is envisaged that the Intergovernmental Conference will meet monthly at ministerial level to coincide with meetings of the General Affairs Council and to take forward the work of the preparatory group which held its first meeting yesterday, 15 February. The Irish member of the preparatory group is Mr. Noel Dorr, former Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs, who fulfilled a similar function during the negotiation of the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's approach to the Intergovernmental Conference will be governed by our desire to ensure that the Union is adequately equipped to cope with the new institutional demands posed by enlargement and our wish that the essential balance that exists within a union of equal member states is preserved. As a smaller member state, Ireland has a particular interest in the effective functioning of the Union and its institutions, and we will examine reasonable proposals in a constructive way. We have already made clear our view that the proper functioning of the Union requires that each member state retain the right to nominate a commissioner. We note that the <Col N="857" /> report of the Finnish Presidency to the Helsinki European Council found that this was the view of the overwhelming majority of member states and we will continue to take this position in the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>As regards a review of the weighting of votes in the Council, we note that this has been linked with the suggestion that larger member states would be willing to forego their second commissioner. We will carefully consider any specific proposals which might be put forward under this heading to ensure they contribute to the effective functioning of the Union while maintaining the necessary institutional balance.</P>
    <P>On the question of extending the scope of qualified majority voting, it is, of course, the case that QMV already applies to a significant portion of Community business and has proven generally helpful from an Irish perspective. It will also be recalled that at Amsterdam, Ireland, along with a significant majority of member states, was prepared to consider extending QMV to some additional areas but agreement in the end did not prove possible. Our approach at the present Intergovernmental Conference, as before, will involve a careful examination of treaty provisions on a case by case basis, with a view to assessing whether a move to QMV would serve our interests and those of the Union, bearing in mind that in a number of sensitive areas the case for retaining the present unanimity provisions remains overwhelming.</P>
    <P>In keeping with normal practice prior to the convening of an Intergovernmental Conference, the Commission on 26 January published its opinion on the issues before the intergovernmental conference. While at an early stage in the process, it can be expected that the member states will give careful consideration to the views of the Commission, as they will to other submissions to the conference. The outcome of the conference is, of course, in the final analysis a matter for agreement among the member states.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the commitment to work closely with the institutions, it was agreed at Helsinki that the European Parliament would be invited to designate two of its Members to participate in the preparatory group and that, as was put into practice at this week's inaugural meeting in Brussels, each meeting at ministerial level would be preceded by an exchange of views with the President of the European Parliament. These arrangements, which go beyond those in place for previous Intergovernmental Conferences, will ensure a fruitful dialogue with the Parliament as the Intergovernmental Conference progresses. In this context, careful consideration will be given to the views of the Parliament on the substantive issues, although it is fair to say that we would not share the Parliament's view that the Intergovernmental Conference agenda should be considerably expanded beyond that agreed by the Helsinki European Council.</P>
    <P>It is impossible at this early stage to predict the final outcome of the Intergovernmental Con<Col N="858" /> ference. The question of whether a referendum will be required will be a matter for legal advice in the light of the text of any agreement reached. It is possible, depending on the changes agreed, that a referendum will not be required but, given the complex constitutional and legal issues involved, it will be necessary to await the relevant legal advice on the final outcome before a decision can be taken.</P>
    <P>As a country which has benefited enormously from membership of the European Union, Ireland looks forward to participating actively in the work of the conference and to contributing constructively to the development of the Union in a manner which reflects the interests of all its people and which strengthens political stability and economic progress in Europe and beyond.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that his reply differs substantially from that given by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs after Helsinki when they said a referendum probably would not be required? Does he agree that the Intergovernmental Conference is much more than a tidying-up exercise of the Amsterdam Treaty? Is it the case that people, such as Javier Solana, and the German and French Governments would like the Western European Union to be fully incorporated into the European Union? Would the Irish Government resist such moves or is it the intention to agree to a common defence in the European Council, as can happen under the Amsterdam Treaty, and to not require a referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply is not at variance with what the Taoiseach said. If the Deputy listened carefully to what I said he will have heard that, in my opinion, there will not be a need for a referendum, but obviously legal questions will arise and legal advice will be received on those. The European Council will decide in Portugal in June on the basis of a report to be made to it whether Treaty changes are likely to be needed. There are no indications that the follow-up to Helsinki will involve any change. I have no comment to make on the other matters as they are not directly related to the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two essential points on which I would like clarity. Will the Government resist moves for any incorporation of the Western European Union into the EU and what is its policy in this regard? Regarding the European Council, does the Minister accept that it is possible to proceed with a common defence under the Amsterdam Treaty without recourse to a referendum? What is the Government's attitude to a common defence in the European Council? Those are the two questions I would like the Minister to clarify as explicitly as possible.</P>

      <P> Is it correct to say that everything in the Maastricht Treaty is untouchable? There are many contradictions between the Amsterdam and Maastricht Treaties. The Maastricht Treaty was the creation of a moment when the right was in ascendancy in Europe. It has limited and narrow neo-liberal market principles at its core. The Amsterdam Treaty sought to open a window of correction in some of the worst of those. Can I take it that we are entering an Intergovernmental Conference process in which the only items to be discussed are institutional adjustments which arise from putative enlargement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">

      <P>He discussed political philosophies and we challenged him with great enthusiasm on some of those philosophies, so I will not deal with the philosophical aspects of Deputy Higgins's questions. It is fair to say that the Amsterdam Treaty represents the vast majority of the principles of Maastricht and our interests are still to the fore in the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

      <P>Deputy Gormley can see where he went wrong. He did not attend one of Deputy Higgins's lectures. That is the problem. I realise that the Minister for Foreign Affairs went <Col N="860" /> at short notice to London with the Taoiseach and that the Minister stepped into the breach and is doing a good job in difficult circumstances. If he is not in a position to respond to my questions now, perhaps he would respond later.</P>
      <P>Is it true that, following the passing of the Amsterdam Treaty and its incorporation into law and the Constitution, it would be necessary under Article N of the Maastricht Treaty to have an Intergovernmental Conference, which has now begun and could have its terms of reference added to, a unanimous decision of the European Council, which is the Heads of State or Government, including the agreement of our own Head of Government, and approval in accordance with the constitutional requirements of each member state &ndash; presumably in Ireland that automatically means a referendum &ndash; if any further defence commitments were to be taken on?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is time we stopped reacting to foreign policy with the type of statement that we are caught between a rock and a hard place and, instead of leaving the architecture for others to design, it is time we were part of the architecture and became one of the architects setting out what we, as a country which has a long tradition of peacekeeping, want to see in terms of a secure Europe? I am not afraid to say it is time these issues were discussed.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House if it is likely that the instructions of the Portuguese Presidency will be added to cover this area of security and defence, especially given the appointment of Javier Solana as Mr. CFSP while he is double hatting as Secretary General of the Western European Union, or if it is likely that the French Presidency, when it takes over to complete the Intergovernmental Conference, might add areas in the defence and security area for consideration at the Intergovernmental Conference?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot anticipate what is likely from the Portuguese Presidency, much less the French Presidency. I see no value in the new Intergovernmental Conference seeking to open up the security and defence issue in a way which runs counter to the Amsterdam Treaty and the Helsinki Conclusions. The Commission's role in the defence area is limited and Ireland wishes to see it remain limited. The common foreign and security policy should remain fundamentally intergovernmental in character with a strong emphasis on consensus and unanimity in decision making. We believe it is unlikely that there should be a referendum, but legal issues must be addressed and legal advice has been sought in respect of that.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Statute of the International Criminal Court was concluded at Rome on 17 July 1998 and was signed, subject to ratification, by Ireland on 7 October 1998. It will enter into force approximately two months after 60 states have become party to it. My information is that to date 94 states have signed the statute and, of these, six have ratified it.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a permanent international criminal court has been supported by Ireland for many years. Accordingly, considerable resources were made available to ensure that Ireland was represented at and participated in the negotiations which led to the conclusion of the statute. Ireland continues to be represented at the Preparatory Commission set up after the Rome conference to deal with matters necessary for the effective operation of the court when the statute enters into force.</P>
      <P>Ireland was anxious to sign the statute at an early date to signal our strong political support for the court, as were our EU partners and our partners in the 66 member like-minded group, which was set up to advance the conclusion of the statute and its timely entry into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the ratification process, the statute is a long and complex document which includes 13 Parts and 128 Articles. A careful and detailed examination of the statute by the <Col N="862" /> Department of Foreign Affairs, together with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the office of the Attorney General and other appropriate bodies, is necessary to determine the precise nature and scope of the legal and administrative measures which may need to be adopted in order for Ireland to be in a position to meet its obligations under the statute.</P>
    <P>At the international level, this matter is also being discussed by delegations at the Preparatory Commission with the aim of ensuring that the necessary domestic measures are taken by states not only in a timely fashion, but also in a comprehensive and consistent manner.</P>
    <P>Ireland may proceed to ratify the statute only when all the necessary legal and administrative measures have been put in place, including any necessary changes to the Constitution. I am not in a position at this point to state definitively how long this process might take, but I assure the Deputy that the timely ratification and entry into force of the statute will continue to be given a high priority by the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The supplementary question I want to ask raises the hoary old chestnut again. May we envisage any change in the policy, by which, as the Minister stated, the State must put in place the legal and administrative procedures before it moves to ratify, which would enable the State to ratify it? Other countries, including some of the six which have ratified, have a process by which they ratify and then make the legal and administrative changes. I have not ever discovered any constitutional inhibition to this in the Irish case. It is just one of those practices which was conveyed into the politics of foreign affairs. Will the Minister list the six countries which have ratified the statute?</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the detail was being discussed in a number of countries. Would the Minister agree that the blockage has been put in place and the detailed discussion of the establishment of the courts amounts to a veto? I refer to one of the significant powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of a veto in regard to any significant partners. Regarding the first part of the Deputy's question, until the Statute of the International Criminal Court was adopted it was impossible to predict the precise rules which would apply to it and therefore it would not have been possible to carry out any definitive preparatory work on ratification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is halfway through the chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, which it assumed for a six month period in November 1999. The Committee of Ministers is the decision making body of the Council and the Government regards a successful term in office as a foreign policy priority. Deputy Andrews, as Minister for Foreign Affairs presented Ireland's Presidency priorities at the Council's ministerial session in Strasbourg on 4 November 1999 and these were laid before the Dáil. These included a number of specific areas in which we hoped to advance and develop the important work of the Council in building democracy, protecting human rights and strengthening the rule of law. Deputy Andrews reported on our progress made to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council during its January part-session. The text of his oral and written reports are available to Deputies in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> The Deputy will be aware that the programme put forward by Ireland at the beginning of our chairmanship committed us to pursuing a number of current political questions, in particular, concerning south-east Europe and in the Caucasus.</P>
    <P>The main political issue with which Ireland, as Chairman of the Committee of Ministers, has had to deal is the ongoing crisis in Chechnya. As the House will be aware, Deputy Andrews, visited Moscow on 14 January and had discussions with the Russian Foreign Minister Mr. Ivanov. Through the Irish chairmanship, we are continuing to maintain close contact with the Russian authorities on this issue, and, complementing the OSCE, the Council is engaged in putting forward proposals to assist in the return of democracy, the enhancement of the principle of the rule of law and full respect for human rights in the region. Efforts are also under way in relation to Parliamentary Assembly Recommendation 1444 of 25 January, which called upon the Committee of Ministers to, <i>inter alia</i>, take steps, in close co-operation with the Russian authorities, to ensure a Council of Europe presence in the region; and provide appropriate support to the Russian authorities for the implementation of peaceful policies in conformity with the norms and principles of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Another important issue facing Ireland during our term in office is that of the accession of Bosnia-Herzegovina to the Council. As Deputies will be aware, Deputy Andrews, visited Bosnia and Herzegovina in his capacity as Chairman of the Committee of Ministers in January with the Secretary General of the Council, Mr. Walter Schwimmer. During the course of that visit, discussions took place with the main Bosnian political institutions, as well as with senior representatives of the international community. A major element of the visit was an address to the joint Houses of the Bosnian Parliament.</P>
    <P>Following the visit to Sarajevo, the delegation proceeded to Kosovo where discussions were held on the prospects for further developing the contribution of the Council of Europe to the efforts of the international community in securing peace and stability there. The Secretary General has brought forward a number of proposals in this regard, which are currently being considered by ambassadors in Strasbourg.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews, also oversaw the admission of Mexico to the Council as an observer state on 1 December and met the Mexican Foreign Minister in Strasbourg, during the Parliamentary Assembly last month. Mexico becomes the fourth non-European state to attain observer status at the Council, along with Japan, Canada and the United States.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe, with 41 member states, is, along with the European Union and the OSCE, one of the pre-eminent multilateral institutions in Europe. Within such a framework, it is important that there exist inter-institutional <Col N="865" /> cohesion and co-operation in order that each organisation is in a position to fully discharge those responsibilities that it bears within a pan-European framework. It was with this in mind that we set out in our Presidency programme the desire for closer co-operation between the various organisations. In this regard, a ministerial-level meeting between the Council of Europe, represented by the chairmanship and the Secretary General, and the EU, represented by Commissioner Patten and the Portuguese Presidency, is scheduled for 14 March. In addition, discussions are taking place with Austria, current chairman of the OSCE, regarding the date of the COE-OSCE ministerial-level meeting during our Presidency. This will fulfil our commitment that two such meetings should take place annually.</P>
    <P>We have also achieved progress in our undertaking to develop relations between the Committee of Ministers and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council. The President of the Assembly visited Dublin on 24-26 November and held meetings with Deputy Andrews, and the Taoiseach and addressed the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. The Irish Chair also addressed the Political Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly in Paris on 16 December. The spring meetings of the Parliamentary Assembly will take place in Dublin Castle in May. I am grateful to you, a Cheann Comhairle, and to the members of the Irish delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly, in particular, the leader of the delegation, my colleague, Deputy Daly, for their initiative. Ireland's chairmanship has been greatly assisted by the efforts and support of the Oireachtas, many Members of which have participated in the work of the Council of Europe and, in particular, that of the Parliamentary Assembly.</P>
    <P>Ireland's Presidency programme involved a series of commitments regarding other areas of the Council's activities, including our bilateral involvement. The budget for 2000 was successfully adopted under the Irish chairmanship on 10 December. Despite zero growth in resources, we were able to provide, through re-allocations and reductions, the necessary additional funding for priority areas: the Court of Human Rights; the new office of the Commissioner for Human Rights; the democratisation programmes and the Assembly's monitoring activities.</P>
    <P>Bilateral efforts on Ireland's part include the following. First, the dissemination of information about the role of Ireland within the Council of Europe, through the distribution of an information booklet, &ldquo;Ireland and the Council of Europe&rdquo;. Work is also well advanced on a book dealing with Ireland's early involvement with the Council, which is due for publication in the Spring. Second, Ireland's formal accession to the North-South Centre for Global Interdependence and Solidarity on 1 January 2000. Third, the successful European Conference on Social Development, hosted by my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, which took place in Dublin <Col N="866" /> Castle on 17 and 18 January. Work has since begun on a political communication from the Council of Europe addressed to the UN Special Session on Social Development in June 2000. Fourth, the staging of an international human rights conference in Dublin on 3 and 4 March.</P>

Have any efforts been made during our chairmanship  &ndash; half way through his chairmanship and our campaign for a UN Security Council seat was a dreadful time to shuffle our Minister for Foreign Affairs &ndash;  to reform and restructure the Council of Europe to make it more effective, efficient and relate more to the issues Europe faces?</P>

Does the Minister agree it highlights a serious deficiency in relation to the Council of Europe's initiatives as the basic source of the human rights charters? People asked how come the human rights issues raised in respect of Grozny and Chechnya did not seem to matter as much as the rights raised in Kosovo and elsewhere. People on the American continent asked the same question about Colombia, for example. Did we not leave ourselves open to being participants in an effort which implied that some human rights are important but others are not? A question being asked is whether we made any significant advance during our chairmanship to restore credibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say Ireland, the EU and the Council of Europe made prolonged efforts over a long period to deal with the human rights problems and the various difficulties which existed in Kosovo before any further action was taken.

Significant efforts were made before any further action was taken.</P>

    <P>Mr. Wall asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the Government's view on the implications of the deteriorating situation between Israel and the Lebanon, particularly having regard to the presence of Irish troops serving with UNIFIL; if he will urge Israel to abide by its declared intention to withdraw its personnel from southern Lebanon by June 2000 and cease its support for the SLA; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of violence in Lebanon has escalated in the past two weeks. This culminated in the killing of seven Israeli soldiers and the wounding of several others in a number of different incidents, and in Israeli air attacks against the Lebanese infrastructure causing Lebanese civilian casualties.</P>
      <P>The recent developments in the Middle East are of the deepest concern both in relation to UNIFIL and to the Middle East peace process. The General Affairs Council discussed these events on 14 February and reiterated the European Parliament's commitment to exert its maximum efforts and to work with all parties in supporting the Middle East peace process.</P>
      <P>The council also recalled the declaration made by the presidency on behalf of the European Union on 9 February in which it expressed deep concern at the escalation of hostilities in Lebanon. The council renewed the appeal to all parties to exercise utmost restraint and refrain from further acts of violence. We hope this appeal will be heeded, not least because of the implications for the safety of UNIFIL troops which the increased level of violence involves.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister Barak has repeatedly declared Israel's firm intention of withdrawing its personnel from south Lebanon by July of this year. Agreement on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks of the peace process would facilitate a withdrawal in orderly conditions. It is not clear what the position of the SLA will be at that time when the Lebanese Government will be able to exercise jurisdiction over all its territory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to extend my deepest sympathy to the families of the four <Col N="868" /> Irish soldiers who lost their lives in Lebanon on Monday and also to convey to the injured my best wishes for a speedy recovery.</P>

      <P>This House has already offered its sympathy to the families and loved ones of the four soldiers who tragically lost their lives. I join with the Minister in wishing those who were injured a speedy return to health.</P>
      <P>On the declaration by Israel to withdraw its personnel from southern Lebanon by June 2000, does the Minister believe this will happen? For some years I have been asking foreign affairs questions and we could have grown old asking questions about Israeli support for the SLA, which is the nub of the problem and the real reason our troops are regularly in danger.</P>
      <P>A line in the Minister's reply which slightly bothered me was when he spoke about the capacity of the Lebanon to exercise full jurisdiction over all its territory. Let us be clear that the Lebanon is entitled to its territory and that the SLA has been the provocateur. Does the Minister agree that we have made no progress in getting Israel to recognise that its support for the SLA is the nub of the problem in southern Lebanon?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree Israeli support for the SLA continues to be a problem. In regard to withdrawal from south Lebanon, Prime Minister Barak continues to insist he will withdraw in July. However, recent casualties among Israeli troops in Lebanon have led to increased public pressure for an earlier withdrawal &ndash; perhaps as early as April.</P>

I would like to take the opportunity to express the hope that we will honour almost 80 people who have died while on service abroad. These particular soldiers did not die in combat but they would not have died had they not been there on a peacekeeping mission. I hope we will honour them by erecting a suitable memorial on Leinster lawn. It is time they were remembered and I hope the Minister will communicate that idea to the Government.

      <P>Does the Minister agree there appear to be efforts to delay the Palestinian track of the Middle East peace process until after the US presidential election and that, strange as it may have seemed some months ago, the Syrian track and, therefore, the Lebanese element of that track will probably move ahead much more speedily?

      <P>The comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty is a cornerstone in the process leading to nuclear disarmament. Conclusion of negotiations on a test ban treaty in 1996 was an achievement of singular importance on that road, and Ireland was among the first states to sign and ratify the treaty.</P>
      <P>To bring this treaty into force presents a major challenge to the international community. For that to occur, 44 states that have nuclear capabilities must ratify. To date only 26 of those 44 states have deposited their instruments of ratification.</P>
      <P>Among the five nuclear weapon states, France and the United Kingdom have signed and ratified the treaty. While the United States, China and Russia have signed the treaty, they have not yet ratified it. India and Pakistan, states with nuclear weapon capabilities, have neither signed nor ratified the treaty.</P>
      <P>The rejection late last year of the treaty by the United States Congress is a matter of great concern to Ireland because US leadership in this field is a prerequisite to early progress leading to the elimination of nuclear weapons. We must, however, welcome the continuing and firm determination expressed by the United States Government to pursue US ratification and I have no doubt about the sincerity of this intent and the endeavours that will be made to achieve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through its active participation in the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Organization in Vienna, Ireland is helping to develop the implementation mechanisms required to give effect to this treaty when it eventually enters into force. <Col N="870" /> Notwithstanding the recent setback in Congress, the United States for its part continues to make a major political and financial contribution towards the establishment of the organisation.</P>
    <P>A conference of States party to the CTBT was held in Vienna from 6 to 8 October last year to develop strategies for the early entry into force of the treaty. Together with other States that have ratified the treaty, Ireland is actively considering the question of further meetings in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The Government strongly encourages the Middle East peace process and fully supports the role of the European Union in its active contribution to furthering the peace process. The Government welcomed the relaunching of the peace process with the signature of the Sharm-el-Sheikh Memorandum last September together with the progress which has been accomplished since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More recently, however, the peace process has <Col N="871" /> encountered some setbacks. In the Palestinian track, the implementation of agreements on a number of issues has been postponed. The negotiations leading to agreement on permanent status have been suspended. The target date foreseen in the Sharm-el-Sheikh Memorandum for concluding a Framework Agreement on Permanent Status has not been met.</P>
    <P>The Israeli-Syrian negotiations have also been suspended. There is no movement towards reopening the Lebanese track. On the contrary, recent weeks have seen escalating violence in Lebanon.</P>
    <P>These developments are of the deepest concern. They were the subject of discussion by the General Affairs Council on 14 February. The council appealed to all parties to exercise utmost restraint in the Lebanon and called for a resumption of negotiations on all tracks of the peace process in order to attain a comprehensive, lasting and just peace in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficulties I outlined, I believe the problems can be overcome, that agreement can be reached on the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon and Syria, and that the September deadline for the permanent status negotiations on Palestine can be met. This will require a redoubling of effort by all the parties involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State's officials have had plenty of notice of my question and I am sure they will have passed a comprehensive reply on it to the Minister of State. It seems there is no such thing as a Lebanese track because the Syrians have 35,000 troops in Lebanon and they cannot do very much in Lebanon without the permission of the Syrians. Whatever happens in Syria will have an effect on Lebanon.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister of State any information on the Palestinian track of the Middle East peace process? Has he any information to indicate that the Israelis want this element of the discussions postponed until after the US presidential election in November? That would be a terrible pity from the point of view of the Palestinians who are anxious to make peace and to make progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State and the Department aware that an appeal has been issued by the Palestinian people to ask those interested to redouble their efforts and become involved in seeking to overcome this impasse and that they have described this stage as the gravest state their talks have reached yet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The peace process is addressing the most difficult issues between the Israelis and the Palestinians and there is little sign of any advance. The Israeli implementation of existing agreements on a number of issues has become slow and difficult. In particular, the Palestinians accuse the Israelis of advancing their borders and <Col N="872" /> continuing to build settlements so as to create new facts on the ground which could pre-empt the negotiations on the shape of any future Palestinian state. Following on this and a particular unsuccessful meeting between Arafat and Barak, Palestinian frustration with what they see as Israeli intransigence has led them to break off negotiations.</P>

      <P>While locations such as Busáras and Heuston and Connolly railway stations would be clearly within the definition of a station, there is no need for section 18 to be so wide that, for example, a bus carriage at these locations or elsewhere, which is merely used for parking or servicing of vehicles, should come within the regulations envisaged under the amendment proposed by Deputies O'Sullivan and Barnes. There would not be any point in requesting people to make areas accessible when nobody requires access to them. It would not make any sense. There is no point in putting people to the expense of doing that when nobody would be seeking access to the places concerned. It is a matter of logic. It would not be advisable to proceed with the amendment for that simple reason.</P>

I accept that it might be stated that such rights are protected under the Employment Equality Act.</P>
      <P>The amendment is designed to ensure that these areas are as accessible as possible to people with disabilities.

It is vital that this question should be highlighted on every possible occasion in the House and elsewhere because it is of tremendous importance. To that extent, the amendment tabled by Deputies O'Sullivan and Fitzgerald is to be commended. However, from a practical point of view, my argument is that the people for whom it is meant will not actually be seeking access to the places concerned and the definition, therefore, would be too wide.

Amendments Nos. 77, 79 and 86 form a composite proposal, amendment No. 78 is an alternative to amendment No. 77, amendment No. 80 is an alternative to amendment No. 79, amendment No. 87 is an alternative to amendment No. 86 and amendments Nos. 81 and 85 are related.

      <P>I move amendment No. 72:</P>
      <P>In page 20, to delete lines 37 and 38 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;complainant' means a person referred to in <i>section 21(1)</i>;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that an extensive discussion took place on Committee Stage in respect of the procedures to be followed when a person wishes to avail of the redress mechanism set out in Part lll of the Bill. At the close of that discussion, Deputy Fitzgerald asked if it would be possible to include a provision which would stipulate that the Director of Equality Investigations would have discretion as regards late applications in very exceptional circumstances. The discussion focused on cases where the complainant had failed to comply with the two month deadline specified in section 21(2)(<i>a</i>) for a notification to be sent to the respondent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment addresses the situation adverted to on Committee Stage and gives the requisite flexibility. An extension from two months up to four months may now be afforded by the director. The director's decision to give such an extension may be exercised subject to two conditions, namely, that there were exceptional circumstances preventing the notification to the respondent within the two month time frame and that it is just as inequitable, having regard to the <Col N="875" /> nature of the alleged conduct and other relevant circumstances, to allow the extension beyond two months. The second requirement places an obligation on the director, before reaching any decision to allow an extension, to assess factors such as the burden under which a respondent might be placed were a late application or notification to be received, the seriousness of the alleged complaint, the context of the complaint, etc. The formula in this amendment was framed having regard to section 5 of the Ombudsman's Act, 1980, and also to UK and Queensland legislation with similar provisions.</P>
    <P>Since amendment No. 86 addresses the points raised on Committee Stage, it is unnecessary that I should accept the six month time frame proposed by Deputies O'Sullivan and Fitzgerald in amendments Nos. 78 and 80, for the notification of the complaint to the respondent. I also cannot accept Deputy Fitzgerald's other amendments, namely, Nos. 81 and 85, which would confer a role on the director in contacting the respondent, and No. 87 which would allow a period of 12 months in which to lodge a complaint in exceptional circumstances. However, I have gone a reasonable way towards addressing the concerns which were raised by the Deputies and I hope they will be in a position to accept that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has come a certain distance to meet our concerns and is allowing that a period of up to four months can be granted at the discretion of the director, assuming the director has decided that this is appropriate. We were seeking a slightly longer period but, in the circumstances, we should welcome the progress that has been made. I thank the Minister for taking the point on board. I hope four months will be adequate for people to comply with the provisions of the legislation. Given that the Bill makes provision for a review after two years, I presume this matter can be reconsidered if the four month period does not prove to be appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>

As Deputy O'Sullivan stated, Members, the director and the relevant agencies will be keeping this matter under review to ensure that the legislation is working.</P>
      <P>Do I take it that, in his comments on amendment No. 85 which states &ldquo;<i>paragraph (a)</i> will not apply where the complainant has reasonable grounds for making an application directly to the Director where in such cases the director shall contact the respondent.&rdquo;, the Minister was indicating that it was not within the discretion of the director to do that?</P>

      <P>As already stated, on Committee Stage Deputy Fitzgerald asked whether it would be possible to introduce a provision similar to that which has been brought in. That provision clearly allows a discretion subject to the conditions I have stipulated, which are fair and reasonable. To that extent, any person who is late in making an application will receive fair and favourable consideration provided the conditions have been fulfilled. We could not be expected to have an open door policy and not attach any conditions because, effectively, that would mean we were extending the period beyond what I would consider a reasonable limit in the first instance. The amendment we have put forward is reasonable and it should work very well.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>The ICTU requested that we table this amendment and Pavee Point also has an interest in it. The amendment involves allowing someone else to give notice where a person with a disability is not in a position to give notice in writing to the director. It is basically designed to facilitate people who might experience such difficulties. I hope the Minister will look positively on this amendment which seeks to facilitate people who might have a difficulty.</P>

      <P>I accept that the 1997 Bill and my Bill, as initiated, allowed a person to refer a claim of prohibited conduct to the director, even though that claim concerned another person. My Committee Stage amendment confined the right to complain to the person claiming discrimination and the position was fully outlined at that stage. Even though Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment has a balancing sufficient interest requirement, the damage could be done by the time the director establishes that the complainant does not have a sufficient interest. It could also impose an undue burden on the director if persons without a sufficient interest could lodge multiple complaints and the director would have to establish in each case that a sufficient interest did not exist. It would also be outside legislative norms to allow a person to bring a case about something which does not affect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment includes the provision that the person must have a sufficient interest in the matter and I would have thought <Col N="877" /> this would be a sufficient safeguard. This amendment is tabled in response to a genuine concern that an individual might not be able to bring forward the appropriate written notice.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the Minister's first point that this would over-burden the director or that it might be too much trouble to figure out the nature of the sufficient interest. I would have thought this kind of clause exists in many other situations and does not normally prove too burdensome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan. The concerns are covered by the phrase &ldquo;a sufficient interest in the matter&rdquo; which should exclude someone who has no interest, or a hostile or vexatious interest in the matter. Almost all legislation provides for complaints to be treated legally or within an authority. There is always a risk that the policy will be too open but, in the circumstances of this Bill and the disabilities from which some complainants might suffer, representations should be accepted from people with sufficient interest acting on behalf of these complainants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that the director would still have to establish whether the person had a sufficient interest. The amendment would not prevent an individual from lodging multiple vexatious or frivolous claims. Much time and effort would have been expended by the time the director established that the person did not have a sufficient interest. I am trying to prevent the director from examining claims which have no basis in fact. If I accepted this amendment I would expose the director to the threat and the real possibility of multiple claims being lodged, and he or she wasting his or her valuable time. Members would not wish to see such an outcome.</P>

However, this is part of the argument that we want to make this procedure as positive, accessible and supportive as possible to people who may have a disadvantage or disability which prevents them from having the same access as most citizens.</P>

      <P>Section 21(2) makes it clear that it is the complainant, that is the person at the heart of the alleged prohibited conduct, who must issue the notification to the respondent. It would not be appropriate for a third party to take on this core task. It would be open to the complainant to have sought the assistance of the Equality Authority beforehand with a view to determining what particular contravention of the equal status legislation has arisen and how best to approach the respondent. The authority will be there as first port of call for most equal status cases and it has the function of assisting complainants by providing forms, advice and so on.</P>
      <P>The authority would facilitate persons with disabilities, language or literacy problems, or who otherwise require special help in notifying the respondent. Against this background I cannot agree to give the complainant an opt-out by permitting some other person to initiate the notification process.</P>

      <P>These are amendments to the Government's Committee Stage amendment which seek to facilitate the complainant more than is the case in the Bill at present. Amendment No. 82 proposes the insertion of the words &ldquo;or subsequently&rdquo; so that complainants would be free to question the respondent in writing to obtain information in, and subsequent to, the notification.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 83 seeks to allow a similar situation during the prosecution of the case, and not just at the initial stage of deciding whether to refer the case to the director. The amendments aim to facilitate the complainant seeking information from the respondent on an ongoing basis rather than just at the initial stage when deciding whether to refer the case to the director.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's proposed amendment would not be in line with the procedures I propose to be followed when a complainant initiates the redress procedures by sending a notification to the respondent. There is a balance to be struck and I must also have regard to the perspective of the service provider who would be the recipient of such notification. Following the initial notification and depending on the response, the complainant can then take the matter to the director.</P>
      <P>On the matter being referred to the director her office will take over the case and will avail of the investigation procedures specified in section 25. Section 33 gives the director extensive powers to obtain information. Moreover, section 26 allows appropriate inferences to be drawn from either the failure by a respondent to respond to the complainant's notification or where the respondent gave false or misleading information. Rather than there being repeated requests for information from the complainant to the respondent, as envisaged in Deputy O'Sullivan's amendments, it is more appropriate that such a matter be handled by the director.</P>

      <P>I am advised it would not be appropriate to require the respondent to reply to the complainant's request for information. To do so would be legally questionable and it is difficult to see what it would achieve. Furthermore, it creates an inconsistency with the comparable provisions of section 76 of the Employment Equality Act. The respondent may reply within the one month period specified or may reply later or may not reply at all. There may be circumstances where although the respondent has good reasons for his action, he or she is not prepared to disclose them at the initial stage of the process. This has to be allowed for and the imposition of a duty on the respondent would not do this. I also point to section 26 which allows the director to draw inferences from the respondent's response or failure to respond. This amendment, if accepted, would be legally questionable. In those circumstances, I am sure the Deputies understand why I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>There is no secretive motivation behind this. It merely enables the director to exercise discretion where it is called for. Sometimes discretion is the better part of valour and it can be the most sensible course to adopt. People might not want the detail set out in the manner the Deputies are requesting.

      <P>The amendment is aimed at preventing the striking out of cases without prior notice to the complainant. I am reluctant to accept it. The principle difficulty with regard to giving notice in writing to complainants about the striking out of a reference is that it is not always possible to locate them. Often the lapse in pursuing a case on the part of the complainant may be connected to a change in permanent address, perhaps because of travel abroad for study or work. Deputies can be assured that it is the current practice to notify a complainant, if connectable, of the intention to strike out and to provide every opportunity to reactivate the reference. I have no doubt this practice will continue in the office of the director. This is identical with section 88 of the Employment Equality Act, 1998. It is sometimes not feasible to contact the person concerned. Where the person can be contacted he or she will be if there is an intention to <Col N="886" /> strike out. However, Deputies will appreciate the difficulty faced by the director where somebody has gone to a different address and cannot be located or has left the jurisdiction. It is unreasonable to expect him to act in such circumstances.</P>

    <P>(i) in subsections (1)(<i>a</i>) and (2) by the deletion of &lsquo;in employment',</P>

    <P>The intention of the amendment is to ensure that the powers of the authority under the 1998 Act are properly carried through to this Act. Section 69 relates to action plans and in its present form does not apply to equal status type activities because it is limited to employment. The case is similar with section 73, which deals with review of enactments, and section 103, which relates to compensation. The purpose is to ensure that the Equal Status Bill and the Employment Equality Act are compliant with each other and have the same powers.</P>

      <P>The amendment fails to take into account amendments I have already made on Committee Stage on the question of equality reviews. In those circumstances I assume the Deputy will wish to withdraw the amendments she proposes to the proposed paragraph (<i>h</i>) of section 69.</P>
      <P>The proposed insertion of paragraph (<i>i</i>) to section 73 is an amendment to the Employment Equality Act, in that section 73 provides that the equality authority may undertake a review of certain items of legislation listed in section 17 of the 1998 Act. However, it is a different matter to give an open-ended function to the equality authority's review in respect of all possible legislation impinging on the Equal Status Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the proposed paragraph (<i>j</i>) is to insert after a reference to the Employment Equality Act in section 103 of that Act a reference to the Equal Status Bill. There are references to the Employment Equality Act, 1998, in subsections (5) and (6) of section 103. The sub<Col N="889" /> sections are concerned with employees in the context of employer's insolvency. They amend the protection of employees in the Employer's Insolvency Act, 1984, and are not related to equal status matters. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to accept these proposed amendments.</P>

We made progress in some areas but there are others, especially where we called votes, where we are dissatisfied and where we consider the Bill is not as strong as it should be and not as strong as the previous Bill, which was subjected to constitutional examination.</P>
      <P>With regard to people with disabilities, there is a need to produce more effective legislation. While a disabilities Bill has been promised, it will not be introduced until 2001. However, it will be necessary to propose changes to the Constitution before we are in a position to guarantee the rights of people with disabilities. Nevertheless, this Bill will considerably strengthen the equality legislation on the Statute Book. I thank the Minister and his staff for the work they have done.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair and the staff of the House and of my Department who worked so hard on this legislation over the past number of years. The Bill is a milestone in the legislative history of the country as it introduces the concept of equality in terms of the provision <Col N="890" /> of services for the first time in a real and tangible way into our law. It complements the Employment Equality Act. Hopefully the House will be discussing the Human Rights Commission Bill, which is of fundamental importance in terms of the protection of human rights, in the not too distant future. These pieces of legislation will be of enormous significance in years to come. In terms of efficacy, I have no doubt that the staff who will be appointed to enforce and implement them will be up to the task.</P>
      <P>I thank the Opposition spokespersons. We have had a very informative and constructive discussion from the outset. The amendments tabled have been very carefully considered and very well crafted. I am sorry we could not accept even more amendments, but I am certain the Opposition spokespersons &ndash; Deputies O'Sullivan, Fitzgerald and Barnes &ndash; have made very serious contributions towards the development of the Bill, something I wish to acknowledge. The passage of the Bill through the House was a very pleasant experience, far more so than I normally experience.

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have an opportunity at last to comment on this Bill. Having read the media commentary and listened to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, with interest when it was first introduced I was looking foward to reading it in the hope that it would be radical. While I welcome many aspects of the Bill which take on board many of the existing anomalies in planning and housing, I do not think the Bill is as radical as initially envisaged.</P>
      <P>In his contribution my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, the party spokesperson on the Environment and Local Gvernment, correctly said that this is two Bills in one, being concerned with planning and housing. At this stage I wish to refer to the housing provisions in the Bill and see how they will help improve matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The single most important issue that we must deal with is housing. It is with a deep sense of frustration that I come to the House to make these comments, but it is necessary to make them. The housing problem, if not urgently addressed, could undermine the social fabric of society and the partnership approach which has by and large been beneficial to the country over the past 15 years or so. At a time of unparallelled buoyancy in the economy, with the Minister of Finance hav<Col N="891" /> ing a surplus in excess of £6 billion last year, we have witnessed house prices increasing by over 60%, with increases in private rented accommodation costs of over 50%. At the same time there are 40,000 applicants registered on local authority housing lists. These figures relate to the two and a half year period the Government has been in office. However, we must be grateful for small measures. The Minister of State in particular has at long last acknowledged that there is a housing crisis.</P>
    <P>In looking for a solution we must acknowledge that the crisis is multi-dimensional. We are all aware of the affordability problem which is being experienced by aspiring householders. Affordability problems in the private rented sector are resulting in insecurity, lack of maintenance and low quality accommodation. I heard a tenant in private rented accommodation stating in an interview last Monday that she had been obliged to move ten times in the past ten years. There is a crisis in the public housing sector, with 40,000 applicants on local authority housing lists compared with 27,427 when the Government came into office in June 1997, an increase of 43%. Housing associations, co-operatives and community development organisations are unable to achieve their objectives mainly due to the shortage and cost of serviced land. The Minister must acknowledge the problem of homelessness has never been so acute. One has only to look around the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick to see people sleeping on the streets every night. In the owner occupied category the escalating house prices in recent years have placed home ownership beyond the reach of a large proportion of young people. Even couples with two average incomes find they are unable to bridge the gap between what they will get under the normal formula for assessing loans and the house price. A significant factor is the price of land which affects the price of houses and their affordability. The average price of housing land in Dublin has risen by 200% since 1995 and today accounts for almost 40% of the price of a home.</P>
    <P>Another startling fact is that the average price of new houses in the Dublin area, for which loans were approved by all lending agencies in the third quarter of 1999, was £157,530. When one compares this with £76,500 in 1996, it is an increase of 106%. This is unsustainable and if it is not pulled back the bubble will burst. None of us wants the spectacle of evictions and &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; notices around our towns and estates, as happened in England in the 1980s. In this regard I have outlined the extent of the problem and how this Bill will deal with it.</P>
    <P>The new definition of eligible persons will not resolve the problem or make it easier for applicants to secure a home of their own. In certain cases it will discriminate against them. There are two main categories of applicants for local authority housing &ndash; those applying for local authority houses and those who may have the means to <Col N="892" /> apply for a shared ownership loan. From reading the legislation I do not see any reference to a shared ownership loan. There are applicants for shared ownership loans who are not eligible for local authority houses. There is a problem on the difference between eligibility for local authority housing and for the shared ownership loan. I will discuss the affordability element later.</P>
    <P>As we know, the eligibility limit is £37,500 for local authority housing but there is flexibility. The cost of rented accommodation and, perhaps, the number of children can be taken into consideration. The limit on the shared ownership loan relates specifically to the formula of assessing gross income up to £50,000. If applicants, whether single or couples, breach that formula or income limit, they are not eligible for a shared ownership loan. I have come across many people who could not get to the counter or inside the door of a bank or a financial institution to try to acquire a loan for a house because they had not the means but they were not eligible for a shared ownership loan by virtue of the fact that over the two years since they submitted their application &ndash; in other cases people are waiting for houses to be built under a co-op scheme &ndash; they had exceeded the limit of £50,000, by approximately £1,000, due to national increases in their salaries and in other cases because they had worked overtime.</P>
    <P>In this context will the Minister look at how that anomaly can resolved? We must consider the couples or individuals who are eligible for the new scheme referred to in the Bill. Since the scheme came into operation the local authorities are using the same formula used for eligibility for shared ownership loans. In the context of the housing supply element of the Bill, there is no reference, good, bad or indifferent on the income limit, to the price of the house or to houses that may come on stream. The modifications to the Bill by the Seanad will not improve the situation for the vast majority of people. Will the Minister consider the fact that there is no flexibility?</P>
    <P>I welcome the planning aspect of the Bill. I read with interest the proposals by the Minister to tackle what I classify as &ldquo;rogue developers&rdquo; and &ldquo;unfinished estates&rdquo;. There was a comment in the media recently that this was an innovative proposal and they did not know from where it came.    By and large, however, the Bill is similar to the Private Members' Bill I introduced in the Seanad on 17 November 1998 and in the Dáil on 17 May 1999. Last May the Minister stated that this much needed legislation could not be taken on board for constitutional reasons. However, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <P>A small group of rogue or cowboy builders consistently flout planning regulations, ignore their obligations to finish housing estates to the required standard and give the construction industry a bad name. Children in one estate in my constituency grew up without access to a green area for more than 20 years, yet during that time the developer involved applied for planning per<Col N="893" /> mission for other estates in the area. I have pursued this issue vigorously at local authority and national level since I took up public office, and the proposals I put forward in my Private Members' Bills have been vindicated. I am delighted the Minister will implement them. At the end of the day, people who mortgage themselves to the hilt must be reassured about their futures and that they and their children will have a proper environment in which to live.</P>
    <P>It appears that, if requested, an individual may be obliged to provide further information to a local authority to pursue a planning application. If an application is submitted and an official questions the bona fides of the applicant, there is a further delay. A simple way to deal with this would be to provide that planning authorities should require applicants to provide a brief history of the planning applications submitted and, most importantly, confirm whether an enforcement action had been taken against them in respect of such applications. Alarm bells would ring on receipt of this and the application could then be dealt with swiftly.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that up to 20% of future housing developments can be allocated for social and affordable housing. However, since the Bill was published that has been watered down. My great concern is that, while the Bill provides for different types of housing, such as local authority and affordable housing, people in well-off areas still do not want local authority housing in their neighbourhoods and they will continue to object. They will combine with the developers and the local authority to ensure the affordable element is introduced in certain areas but social housing will be excluded. The Minister is concerned to ensure that there is a proper mix of housing and I hope managers and builders will not get their way when his recommendations are implemented following enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Officials outside my local authority area and builders have said local authority houses are not suitable in certain areas. We are all aware that if proposals are made for a sewage treatment plant, a halting site, local authority houses or a dump, protests will take place. I hope the Minister ensures that the broad basis of what he has in mind will be implemented. I look forward to discussing other elements of the legislation on Committee and Report Stages to strengthen the Bill so that it has a positive effect on the future development of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will comment only on a few aspects of this enormous Bill. Local authorities do a very good job in the area of planning. The economy is booming and the number of planning applications is huge. Local authority staff deserve credit. It is easy for us to complain when further information is sought on planning applications and we suspect it is a delaying tactic but, in general, the officials have done a good job. Staff are poached daily by other local authorities, An Bord Pleanála and private developers and consultants. <Col N="894" /> They work under great pressure and have done well to keep on top of their workload.</P>
      <P>Some measures in the Bill are necessary and worthwhile, but I wonder whether the right problem is being tackled. It provides that a local authority must give a decision on a planning application within eight weeks rather than two months, but the difference is only a few days. There is merit in reducing from eight to four weeks the time a local authority has to decide on an application following receipt of further information. I am not against the measures but relatively small delays are involved.</P>
      <P>The real problem in the planning process relates to An Bord Pleanála and judicial reviews. Five years ago one rarely heard of a judicial review in regard to planning and if one did it related to a major infrastructural development which people perceived would affect their quality of living. However, such reviews are rampant now. Small pressure groups frequently seek judicial reviews of planning applications for 50 houses. It is crazy. The Minister may not be able to control the courts but he can control their guidelines. It is easy to obtain a judicial review or at least play around with one for six months until such time as the local authority or the developer must buy off the objector rather than be subject to a three or four year delay. That is appalling. I am disappointed that all of these issues are ending up in the courts. I read recently about someone who had run up legal costs of £300,000 or £400,000, and I do not know the detail of the case, but the judge waived all the costs out of compassion or whatever. It is like backing a horse. If somebody engages in this process there is always the possibility of a win or of getting stung but if everyone is allowed to seek judicial review, delay matters for a couple of years and then walk away without any pain, it will encourage more and more people to do that. In most cases, these people do not have a good point.</P>
      <P>I saw a media report this morning that the Minister might make some movement on that in relation to major roadways but it should cover more than major roadways. We should try to tie down the courts or set up a special court to deal with judicial reviews on the overall planning issue. A case arose recently in a local authority in my constituency of Ballymun involving objectors, most of whom would not know where Ballymun was, who were seeking a judicial review. An out of court agreement had to be made with these people to avoid the issue being bogged down for three or four years waiting to get to court. People have a constitutional right to seek judicial review but we need to speed up the process. A special court should be assigned to deal with these cases so that they can be finalised quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Changing to eight weeks is a small point but An Bord Pleanála is not adhering to its four months requirement; it seems to be taking longer to make decisions. If there is an imposition on a local authority to make a decision by the due date, An Bord Pleanála should have some more <Col N="895" /> responsibility placed on it to respond by a due date. It is not sufficient just to have a target date and then to exceed it by a few months. I ask the Minister to concentrate more on An Bord Pleanála and the judicial review aspect to speed up this process.</P>
    <P>I agree with some of the measures the Minister is taking in relation to An Bord Pleanála. There are too many objections from third parties who live miles away and who have nothing to worry about. It may be difficult to make changes that apply to one person and not to another. That applies to having to pay a fee to make a submission or to appeal to An Bord Pleanála. I do not mind some people having to pay a fee but it should not apply to somebody who is objecting to a development next door to them, and it certainly should not apply to public representatives. I am horrified by the suggestion that public representations might have to pay a fee to make a submission to their own local authority. I do not know where that is coming from. It is most undemocratic. I do not want to start slagging the Department of the Environment and Local Government and some of the other electoral reform measures, but I do not like that measure and it should not apply to public representatives.</P>
    <P>This measure has not been thought out. What will happen in local authorities in the future? Will the management say an item cannot be discussed at a planning or a city council meeting where we currently discuss a sample of the major issues? Will we try to discuss every issue at the corporation or local authority meeting or will we be told by the manager that if we have something to say on an issue we should send in our £20 and he will read it? That measure needs to be tied down. There should be a charge for people who make spurious objections to developments they do not live near but public representatives should be excluded from any form of charge. The person living directly beside a development should be exempt also because they have a legitimate point of view.</P>
    <P>While I recognise the difficulties of being able to draw a line to leave some people in and others out, the same applies to appealing to An Bord Pleanála. Despite the fact that we all get planning lists and notices are put up, the odd planning application sneaks through without notice. I know of two in my area recently, one of which involved a public body which put in a wrong address and everybody, including ourselves, missed the planning application. Nobody copped it until permission was granted. I would like to think the Minister would have the power to allow, in very limited circumstances, third party objections when the original application was missed. That does happen on occasion but the change introduced by the Department some years ago in relation to public notices has solved many of the difficulties.</P>
    <P>I welcome many of the other changes like pre-planning discussions, etc., but I would like the <Col N="896" /> Minister to clarify one point. I would like him to explain what is meant by giving statutory recognition to people who make a submission. Does it mean a person is entitled to a reply acknowledging their letter? Does it mean that a person will get a considered reply specifically addressing the points made? Will the local authority have to go into the nitty gritty of a person's particular points or just acknowledge the letter and include a copy of the decision? I would like that spelled out in more detail. While the measures in the Bill are welcome, I hope something will be done about An Bord Pleanála and also the courts.</P>
    <P>On the question of housing, the previous speaker amused me with his contribution. My local authority is in a built up city area where there is not much land available for rezoning. In the past year I was amused by some politicians on Dublin City Council who declared a housing crisis and passed a motion to that effect. The very next month we received a report on the rezoning of one of the last tracts of land in Dublin. Major objections were made by the same people who had declared a housing crisis the previous month. That is nonsensical. I am talking mainly about people in the Labour Party and some other lefties. If there is a housing crisis, which is the case in certain quarters, and if we want to do something about it we have to realise that land will have to be rezoned and that somebody will make money out of it. That is the system and there is no point in people losing their heads because somebody else is going to make a few pounds. If rezoning provides housing and satisfies a social need, good has been done but it cannot be done without putting money into the pocket of some developer, and we might as well face up to that reality.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the 20% requirement and the changes made in the Seanad are worthwhile. Under the old system there was a danger that the main development would not correspond to the development the local authority would build subsequently, and this 20% patch might be left in estates for a number of years waiting for the local authority to move. If this means that the builder will build the affordable or social housing at the same time, or that it will be done in conjunction with the local authority programme, that is good and logical. It is a sensible change. I am not concerned about the developers. The zoning system gives the land its value and we are only taking back a portion of that value. If the construction industry will not agree to the spirit of the legislation, we should change the Constitution and take the builders on in a full frontal attack. We can introduce a land authority and let it take over the land and zone it as it sees fit.</P>
    <P>The developers are doing well; they are ripping off the system. With the introduction of increased density, they are in no danger of having a poor day. They are getting far more apartments or houses on a site than they did previously. There are no houses built in Dublin any more, only duplexes or apartments. The builders are cram<Col N="897" /> ming more housing units onto the same patch of ground so I have no concern that they will have a hungry day.</P>
    <P>There is one concern about this provision. The idea behind it is to have social integration. Some of my colleagues on the city council might think I am a new convert to this concept. The local authority some years ago started buying &ndash; it still is &ndash; secondhand houses in residential areas. This was a cause of much concern and fear for residents who felt the policy was not proper. I did not exactly lead the charge against them. However, things have moved on. It is different when people know from day one that when an estate is built there will be a certain number of private houses and a certain number of affordable and social units. They know what they are buying. It is fairer to do it that way than to buy privately built houses later and use them for social housing.</P>
    <P>However, there is a huge problem with rented accommodation, regardless of whether the tenants are in social housing or are the sons and daughters of well to do people from the country, possibly students, as is the case in my constituency. Nobody looks after a rented house the same way as a house they own. If one is putting social or rented housing into a private estate, there must be tighter rules regarding estate management and how people look after those houses.</P>
    <P>The local authorities have made huge strides in estate management in recent years and that is welcome. However, the message must be conveyed that if a person ignores the house or the gardens or allows their appearance to become run down, action will be taken against them. If we are opting for inclusive estates and avoiding the old system of segregation, it must be on condition that there will be proper estate management and that if tenants step out of line, they will be dealt with. Everybody, regardless of whether they are in the social or private houses, must be obliged to look after them.</P>
    <P>There is a danger, as the last speaker said, that if a builder is building an estate of £300,000 houses, the affordable houses will be located there while the social housing will be located in an estate of £150,000 houses. We must avoid that. Every estate will have to do its share. Some of the comments made by Deputy Ryan were amusing. He criticised the Minister and the Government for failing to provide houses. However, the party he represents and Fingal County Council, of which he is a member, have done precious little to provide social or affordable housing. There are great plans to provide it but in recent years the council has not even filled its quota of social housing.</P>
    <P>From my point of view, as a member of the neighbouring authority, its attitude has been that it does not want any social tenants. Many of the homeless people to whom Deputy Ryan referred have come onto the streets of Dublin from Blanchardstown and other such areas because the surrounding local authorities, including Fingal, did not want to do their bit. They let the homeless go <Col N="898" /> into the city and expect the corporation or somebody else to look after them. There is a great deal of messing going on among the local authorities. They are dumping on each other. There is too much playing politics. If they are trying to solve a problem, it would be better to work together and stop declaring a crisis one week and blocking development the next.</P>
    <P>Enforcement has been practically non-existent. I welcome the measures in this regard in the Bill and I hope the local authorities will be given the resources to follow up on it. Again, this goes back to the courts. I remember following up small enforcement issues in Dublin. The case comes before the court and the judge imposes a £20 fine or something similar. It might have taken the planning official weeks or months to prepare the case. The next time he goes to the principal officer or the manager with a similar case, he will be told to dump it: &ldquo;We cannot go to huge lengths, spending hours preparing a case, for the judge to impose a £20 fine&rdquo;. If there is a system, the courts must support it. Planning people must make decisions but that is what has been happening. People drag out the case and after five years or so the attitude is that no court will listen to it. Passing legislation is one thing but we must get the courts to adhere to the spirit as well as the letter of the law.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in relation to the strategic development zones, compulsory purchase orders and other matters. Planning compensation is referred to but that is the only type of compensation mentioned. The Department of the Environment and Local Government should bring forward a scheme for individual or community compensation. Developments such as the port tunnel are of great benefit to hundreds of thousands of people but the location of these developments mean that a certain number of people, perhaps 50 or 60, will suffer. There should be some form of community, if not individual, compensation for when something enormous is located in an area. It might be for the greater good but it might not benefit a couple of dozen individuals living nearby. This issue was mentioned during the debate on the waste management legislation and on other occasions. It is regularly mentioned but it is always put off for another day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I have been a member of a local authority for over 20 years. I was a member of both the urban and county councils and it has never been as hard as in the last two years for people in rural areas to secure planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government says it wants to see more development on smaller sites and it has made many new rules and regulations. However, there is a difficulty. The planners think they are above the Government. Look at the provision in the Bill under which members will have to pay to make a submission to the county council. That is an <Col N="899" /> attack on democracy and on local representatives. However, there are people in the public service who think the local authorities should not exist, that there should be a dictatorship and that they know better than the people, the councils and the Minister. The Minister introduces the rules and regulations but these people believe the planners have the vision.</P>
    <P>I can offer two examples. In every town and village there are islands or ramps to slow down traffic. They are disasters. The person who was paid to design them should be sacked. The planners decided, probably at a meeting in Dublin, this was the way every town and village should look. They decided they should all look the same and that the traffic should be slowed down. As a result they made a mess of many of the towns and villages</P>
    <P>The second example relates to the National Roads Authority. That authority has caused more accidents and deaths than speeding drivers, again because of their placing its islands in the middle of national roads. Yellow lines are now painted on both sides of the road, with the result that inexperienced drivers, of which there are many on the roads, will not pull in to let faster traffic pass. This delays traffic and people become frustrated, with the result that they overtake dangerously and cause accidents. It seems that this decision was made in Dublin or elsewhere and was communicated to the local authorities who implemented it.</P>
    <P>At the past four meetings of Mayo County Council, there has been an average of 35 refusals of planning applications per month, a total of 140 refusals in the past four months. This is crazy. The applicants are not non-nationals or holidaymakers but ordinary, decent people who want to live in their own area of the county but cannot obtain planning permission from the local authority. That should be compared with my home town of Westport where another housing estate with more than 120 houses was built. About 12 local people live in these houses and the rest are from Cork, Dublin and elsewhere. Not only were they able to obtain planning permission, the Government gave them a tax break. They are being rewarded for increasing property prices in Westport. More people from Westport live in Castlebar than Westport. That is a serious situation which was created by central Government through the Planning Acts. I hope whatever measures the Minister introduces under the Bill will be implemented by the planners and that they will not do it their way. If we enact laws in this House, they should be implemented by the people who are paid by the taxpayers, rate payers and the State to do so. It should not be the case that the Government enacts legislation which is not implemented by the planners. Something is wrong when there are 140 refusals for planning permission in four months. The applicants are young couples who are trying to build their own homes. They do not ask the State for anything <Col N="900" /> except planning permission so that they can build their houses.</P>
    <P>It has been common policy in recent months for a letter to be sent by the council within three or four days of the two months deadline for dealing with planning applications, usually to the agent, requesting a time extension under threat of a refusal of planning permission. Sometimes the agent is not able to contact the person on whose behalf he is dealing. It is wrong that this happens. If the council needs further information, it should seek it within two weeks of receipt of the planning application and not within three days of the deadline. I want to see that dealt with in the Bill and I hope the Minister does something about it. I will try to have my party table amendments to the Bill on this matter. People make every effort to build their own home, often under a time factor. They obtain a quotation for the house and seek planning permission, but by the time they obtain it they find the costs have increased.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noel Ahern said that builders have had a good time of it, and that has been the case for a long time. We can see that from the amount of money they have been able to give people over the past 20 years. If it was good times for them then, what must it be like for them now? There is no shortage of money and builders cannot be hired to do work, nor will they apply for local authority work. Health boards are experiencing difficulty in hiring people to carry out essential repairs for the elderly. There is not enough money in that work. Builders want to be involved in largescale developments on greenfield sites.</P>
    <P>Regarding the proposal to allocate up to 20% of development sites for social housing, the Government has never had as much money as now and revenues are pouring in daily. Perhaps it is time the Government gave local authorities money to buy land. This would mean that, instead of taking 20% of builders' land, the authorities would buy land and rezone it, which would eliminate any accusations of rezoning for a certain individual. The land would be developed for sewerage and water, the authorities would take whatever they needed and the remainder would be sold to developers who should be charged a high price for it. This would help in two ways, to fund the purchase of the land and to fund social housing. There is a major demand for housing. Young couples in my town cannot buy a site on which to build. My suggestion should be implemented so that the council could buy and develop land and sell some of it to developers. Furthermore, there is nothing wrong with local authorities selling sites to young couples at a reasonable price, even if local authorities or the Government lose money on it.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate if the Minister of State would bring to the attention of the Minister the following problem. Local authority tenants can buy their houses after 12 months, and there is nothing wrong with that. Tenants receive a 3% discount for every year of occupancy up to a <Col N="901" /> maximum of 15% in addition to the £3,000 first time buyer's grant. The problem arises when people buy local authority housing, build their own house within two years and sell the local authority house at a substantial profit. That is wrong and should be dealt with. I have made the point before in the Dáil that if a person buys a local authority house, they should live in it for ten years before they can sell it. If they want to move out before the ten year limit, the house should be given back to the local authority at the price for which it was bought plus inflation. If people can build their own house, their local authority house should return to the housing stock.</P>
    <P>What is happening at present is outrageous. I was fooled as a public representative by a person on whose behalf I made strong representations but who I did not know had a planning application to the council. That person is now trying to buy a local authority house from the council before they move into their own house. This means the taxpayer has subsidised their house and now they want to make a profit to pay for their new house. That cannot continue and my request in this regard is reasonable. Some people in local authority housing may not like it, but it is wrong that a person who buys a council house at a 15% discount and receiving a £3,000 first time buyer's grant is allowed sell that house at a substantial profit within two or three years. That should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>People who await decisions on their cases from An Bord Pleanála are outraged. The staff are not in place and something is wrong. The board always requests further information to stall the situation. That must be dealt with in terms of staffing. Some people have waited four months for permission from the local authority and they must wait another four months for a decision from An Bord Pleanála. That is wrong and must be dealt with. It is also wrong that, as a public representative, I cannot make a submission to An Bord Pleanála about any major development in my town or area without paying £50. That should be waived in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The public think that I, as a Deputy and councillor, have some say in the planning process but, as the House will be aware, we do not have such a say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy does not tell them that he has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I tell them that the chief planning officer and the manager have the overall responsibility. It is wrong that public representatives are not allowed to make a submission to An Bord Pleanála. I am not saying that the board will listen to us, but at least we should be able to make a submission and receive a response which deals with the points raised. The same applies in the case of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I will ask my party to seek the following on Committee Stage. If I, as a public representative, write to the chief planning officer of my county to support or oppose a planning <Col N="902" /> application, I should receive a detailed reply within two weeks. It is wrong that these people will reply to a public representative stating that they have noted the contents of the letter and that is the last one ever hears of it.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister should deal with the situation regarding replies from local authorities to the public and public representatives. If a member of the public or an elected representative writes a letter, he or she is at least entitled to a detailed response. It is common courtesy and it is only right.</P>
    <P>One can see from the Bill that departmental and planning officialdom does not want public representatives to have anything to do with planning. I am aware that Ireland has a poor record on planning and zoning despite the fact that there are planning committees, but when planning permission for a controversial local application is refused I would see nothing wrong with a committee comprised of perhaps two public representatives, the manager, the planner and maybe an outsider which would make the overall decision. If planning permission is granted on the other hand, the people may appeal to An Bord Pleanála. I would see nothing wrong with that because it is wrong that we have no direct say in the granting or refusal of planning permission, and yet we are the ones to which people come. For example, my attention has been drawn in the past four months to 140 cases in my county where people cannot understand the reasons given for refusal.</P>
    <P>Planning permission is refused for two new reasons, septic tanks and scenic views. I have never met anybody who could make a living out of a scenic view. I would rather people were allowed build than be told this. It is something which should be considered.</P>
    <P>Recently I spoke to a politician from Northern Ireland about the Bill and he told me that planning permission is never refused there on the grounds of septic tanks because of the puraflow system and other methods which are available at a cost of £4,000 or £5,000. On the basis of the amount of rainfall in the west in the past three years, if one put out a bucket tonight it would be full in the morning. There is no point in people using trial holes. There is no way that the trial holes would be empty, they would be full. The land is not able to take the amount of rain water there has been in the past three years. It is outrageous that the planners state that there will be trouble with water quality because of a septic tank since that is the purpose of the puraflow system. The least which should be done is that these people should get a grant in that regard. It is not right that people should have to wait so long and it is wrong that they are refused for that reason.</P>
    <P>The Bill was introduced to address the housing problem. There are serious problems in the area of housing and people are finding it increasingly difficult to get housing. A considerable number of people with good jobs are on housing lists who would not have been on them six or seven years ago because the green areas are not being <Col N="903" /> developed and the infrastructure is not in place. The problem was created because there is a shortage of houses to cope with the demand. The Government should be making it easier for local authorities to develop green areas and make as much housing as possible available at the cheapest possible price. That would deal with the problem in the market where exorbitant prices are being paid for houses.</P>
    <P>It embarrasses me, as an auctioneer, to see young couples who are trying to build their own homes come into my office because they have trouble with planning and getting a mortgage. A nurse and a garda on a reasonable salary will not get a mortgage that is adequate to cover the price of a house, and there is something very wrong in that.</P>
    <P>The imbalance which is evident in my area must be addressed. It is creating problems and will create problems down the road for the churches, schools and post offices. People want to live in their own area and commute to work, but the planners want them all to live in towns and built up areas and to forget about rural Ireland. It is time the Minister introduced a strong measure. He should summon the chief planning officers from the 26 counties and state that their job is to implement Government policy. That is not happening at present. If it was happening, An Bord Pleanála would not be tied up with appeals on a daily basis. Many of these appeals arise because people have been refused planning permission for reasons relating to a septic tank or because there is no proper water supply in the area. That is the responsibility of the local authorities. If they were doing their job, there would not be as many refusals.</P>
    <P>Many people who bought local authority houses are finding it difficult to pay their mortgages and they have nothing extra to spare. I am talking about people who would have bought their homes in recent years and whose homes now need new windows and doors. There are no grants available for people in that category. I am not suggesting that the Government introduce a grant scheme, such as that which existed previously which was open to doctors, solicitors and&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I know this is a planning Bill. This is all about bad planning which has happened over recent years. I ask the Minister to introduce a grant scheme. Otherwise there will be further people on the housing lists and there will be further problems with planning in the future because these people's houses will fall into disrepair, they will not be able to remain in their houses and there will be more pressure on the local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened attentively to Deputy Ring and I would agree with much of what he had to say, particularly about the difficulties in rural Ireland. He was going extremely well, I am sure you would agree, Acting Chairman, until, in reference to the home improvement grants, he tried to incriminate solicitors and doctors.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is possibly the most important legislation to pass through the House in the lifetime of this Dáil. Certainly the interest in it by Members of the Seanad and Members who wish to contribute to it in this House is an indication of how important it is. The Bill introduces many reforms. Indeed, it is a tribute to the Minister and his officials that the Bill consolidates nine Acts from 1963 to 1999, as well as including many reforms. I fully support the ethos underpinning the Bill, the need for sustainable development, taking account of the necessary environmental legislation, and the Minister's desire to ensure that a high quality service is delivered by the planning authorities.</P>
      <P>We all accept the need for planning legislation. One has only to visit countries where there is no such legislation to see the type of higgledy-piggledy development which takes place. Planning legislation has a major impact on social and economic development. If one looks at the national development plan, £40 billion is being provided by the Government over the next seven years. Unless the planning legislation is effectively implemented and works efficiently, it will be the greatest threat to the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The planning legislation is the first point of contact most people have with the State service when they want to build a private house, a housing development or a commercial development. It should be much more user-friendly than it is at present. The delays in processing are a major concern to many of the applicants and, indeed, to many public representatives at national and local levels. There are many reasons for refusals &ndash; Deputy Ring referred to the 140 refusals in his area in recent months. Many of these could be dealt with in a more user-friendly way.</P>
      <P>There should be a positive policy towards the applicant in the county development plan. I would like to see more consultation with the applicant. One often sees a refusal because the opening onto a road is in the wrong place. Consultation with the applicant to suggest they move the entrance away from a dangerous bend or whatever might suffice. In planning legislation, it should be possible to try to facilitate the applicant rather than to create unnecessary obstacles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the local development plan and said that was the cornerstone of planning within the local authority area. He also referred to the importance of the input from local authority members. I agree with him on that because there is nothing more frustrating than to see refusal of a planning application on the basis of something which was left in the local development plan by local authority members when they <Col N="905" /> approved the plan put to them by the county management.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out to streamline the production of the development plan, which I welcome. There are five local authorities in my county and some are still working on a plan which is nine years old. That is too long given the changes which have taken place.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the guidelines for local authorities in preparing the development plan and the regional guidelines. He might consider circulating those guidelines to the members of the local authority as well as to the management team because the members have a major responsibility in adopting a county development plan or a local authority development plan. It is important they are well briefed on that responsibility. It is particularly important that they do not allow the inclusion of conditions in the plan which would impede planning development which they would support and that because of their acceptance of the plan, planning applications, in certain circumstances, cannot be approved.</P>
    <P>The regional guidelines are welcome because it is important there is co-ordination in the preparation of development plans. This Bill provides for the preparation of a development plan every six years. Under the legislation, the local authority can only be in place for five years. If there is a plan every six years, it will mean that every now and again one local authority will not produce a plan in its five year term of office. Is there any reason for this? Could a case be made to have a plan every five years to coincide with the lifetime of a local authority so that each local authority would have some input into the initiation and implementation of the plan?</P>
    <P>Obviously, the consultation process is very important in the preparation of the development plan. If consultation between the county manager, local authority members and the public takes place, it should be well advertised and everybody should have an opportunity to study the draft plan and to suggest whatever amendments they might wish to see.</P>
    <P>There are many areas which need guidelines. One which springs to mind, because it can be very topical in some local authority areas although not in others, is the provision of mobile telephone masts. There should be clearer guidelines than are available at present. For whatever reason, some people's fears about these masts being a health hazard have been raised by pressure groups. It is unfair that somebody may be denied a mobile telephone service because of fears which do not stand up in the light of the scientific knowledge available. If I was primarily concerned about my health, I would prefer to live in an area where mobile telephone masts were available rather than in one where there was no such service.</P>
    <P>On the guidelines and the need for a co-ordinated plan between local authorities, there are <Col N="906" /> many small local authority areas within the county local authority and it is important there is a co-ordinated plan for these areas. The development plan in each county should take account of Government policy on rural development. It is interesting that on the day this Bill was introduced in this House, 3 February, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Davern, initiated a debate on the White Paper on Rural Development. In the context of the Planning and Development Bill, it is no harm to quote from what he said. He stated:</P>
    <P>The rural policy agenda is defined in the White Paper as all Government policies and interventions directed towards improving the physical, economic and social conditions of people living in the open countryside, coastal areas, towns and villages and in smaller urban centres outside the five major urban areas. The agenda will, at the same time, facilitate balanced and sustainable regional development while tackling issues of poverty and social inclusion.</P>
    <P>The overall strategy decided by the Government provides for balanced regional development to ensure that the benefits of economic and social progress are distributed throughout rural areas; investment in services and infrastructure; sustainable economic development; human resources development; and a determined focus on poverty and social exclusion.</P>
    <P>The reason I quote that is that I have a serious concern about the inconsistencies in different planning areas in regard to what is allowed in a rural area, particularly in relation to housing development. I strongly believe that if a couple wish to build a house near their parents in a rural area, they should be allowed to do so unless there is some very important health or safety reason or an environmental or heritage issue. I am concerned about the large number of planning applicants who are refused permission to build in certain rural areas. Where people, for their own reasons, want to live close to their extended family, they should be allowed to do so and should be supported. If a young couple want to live beside one or other of their parents, it is beneficial for them to do so, particularly if they have children. In that case one of the couple's parents can assist them in looking after their young family, particularly when both partners are working. Such an arrangement is also beneficial to the elderly. Everyone in this House is aware of the demands on State services to provide for the needs of the elderly, particularly in terms of accommodation. It is important that we support young people who wish to live near their families. They will look after their elderly parents as the need arises. It is socially desirable that we should have a positive policy towards allowing people to build houses in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring referred to some reasons applicants are refused planning permission. They may <Col N="907" /> be refused permission because an area is scenic. I was told that an applicant had been refused permission to build a house in a remote rural area because it would block a cyclist's view of a mountain. That is an unacceptable reason for refusing planning permission.</P>
    <P>The delays in processing applications are a matter of concern. Some of them are due to the shortage of staff in local authorities. The Minister said he would talk to UCD about the need to increase the number of planning officers who are coming through. When he talks to the people in UCD, he should also talk about the need for consistency in decisions made by planning officers. Planning officers have different views. In my county where there is a good deal of red clay, many people are refused permission to build red brick houses. The colour of brick used is an issue in terms of the planning conditions. There is a need for consistency and common sense to prevail in the application of the planning legislation.</P>
    <P>I support fully what the Minister is trying to do in the section dealing with housing. He pointed out what is underpinning the section, the need for people to have the opportunity to own their homes if that is what they want and the need to provide social and affordable housing for applicants who need it. He referred to the need for joint strategies between local authorities within county boundaries, county councils and urban district councils in terms of ensuring that a sustainable housing strategy is put in place. Some local authorities are only interested in greenfield sites. The legislation and regulations in place provide that they have the right to consider landfill sites, vacant houses and other forms of vacant accommodation to ascertain how they can best be used to address the housing need. Local authorities should consider such possibilities. If the Minister issues guidelines in this area, he should send them to local authority members because they are not always as well informed as they might be on what is in place and what is available to them.</P>
    <P>Section 84 deals with controls on the resale of certain houses before the expiry of 20 years, with some alleviation if one has a house for more than 20 years. I agree with that provision in principle, but the Minister should be able to allow a derogation in respect of that requirement in specific circumstances. He should have that power under the legislation. I can think of cases &ndash; I am sure other Members can think of others &ndash; where such a facility should be available. In circumstances where a couple had lived in a house for only three or four years, one partner died suddenly and the other partner had to sell the house because he or she wanted to move to live in another part of the country and buy a house there, a derogation in respect of that requirement should be available.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in respect of An Bord Pleanála, particularly that it will be obliged to give the reason it refused an applicant planning permission. In the main, it has done a good job. <Col N="908" /> While none of us is happy about the length of time it takes to decide on an application, its decisions are broadly in line with the views of local authorities. However, its decisions in respect of some applications are difficult to understand. Up to now we had no way of finding out how it arrived at its decision in respect of an application. I welcome the Minister's decision to ensure that in future its reason for refusing an applicant planning permission is given.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála will assume authority for compulsory purchase orders and EIAs by local authorities. The Minister referred to a period of 18 weeks and it is important that it makes its decisions within that timeframe as the delay in planning decisions is one of the major difficulties with planning legislation at all levels. Such delays cause other problems, to which previous speakers referred. One such problem is that some people do not have proper living accommodation. Another problem is that it is an obstacle to economic development where developers want to establish an industry as quickly as possible. In those circumstances, it is important that there is no unnecessary delay in planning decisions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It is a good one. I compliment the Minister and his officials on the work they have done on producing this mammoth Bill. I look forward to it passing through this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. As I did not expect to speak on it at this time, I do not have precise notes on it. As a member of Cork County Council, I am sure I share with every councillor and every local public representative a great interest in this legislation. I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, on introducing the Bill. I am sure many amendments will be made to it on Committee Stage and the Minister indicated a willingness to accept what he described as positive amendments. I am sure amendments will be tabled by Members on all sides of the House and that the Minister will look on them in a fair and favourable manner.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced at a time of unprecedented economic growth. Stemming directly from that, there has been a great boom in construction. The Bill is timely in that regard. When we talk about planning we are not talking about a particularly precise science. We are not talking about something that is black or white but about dozens of planners who have their own views on a particular planning permission and on housing policy. That is part of the reason An Bord Pleanála is so busy dealing with appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Ring, made a valid point when he suggested that the Minister, the Department and the people in charge of preparing this Bill should sit down with the main planners throughout the country to formulate a single planning strategy. This reminds me to a degree of the debate taking place in virtually every local authority area in respect of waste management. Many local authorities are developing different <Col N="909" /> solutions to waste management. The waste management problems experienced in County Donegal should be similar to those in counties Cork, Kerry, Limerick and Clare. However, virtually every local authority has developed a different solution. In a sense, the position which obtains in respect of planning policy is similar. Each local authority formulates its county development plan but a national guiding light, be he or she from among the ranks of politicians or planners, has not emerged.</P>
    <P>As we set out on a new course with the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, it is important that a clear national planning strategy is seen to be put in place. I am sure the Bill is concerned with this but its success will be dependent on the individual viewpoints of the two dozen or so planners throughout the country. We are dealing not with a precise science but, in a sense, with a philosophical topic. Planning is quite a philosophical occupation because while one planner might like a design or building, another may look differently on it. We must aim at developing a national strategy.</P>
    <P>We have discussed the housing shortage on many occasions. We are advised that part of the Minister's proposal is to deal, through the planning process, with housing supply. In the notes he supplied with the Bill, the Minister indicated that housing supply is at the core of the legislation, and I am sure that is the case. However, a great deal of debate has arisen in respect of what I term the &ldquo;20% solution&rdquo;, namely, that an obligation will be placed on developers to allocate a certain amount of land for social housing. I do not have any particular ideological hang-ups in that regard but I believe the Minister's proposal will not work. It is an artificial solution to economic and social problems and such solutions have no history of success anywhere in the world. The greatest attempt at finding an artificial solution was the former Soviet Union which inevitably collapsed.</P>
    <P>Using the planning process to offer artificial solutions to housing problems will not prove effective in the long-term. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has at his disposal a much easier way to solve the housing supply problem, namely, by using the housing section of his Department.</P>
    <P>Different local authorities appear to be operating different strategies in this area. However, I must commend what is happening in Cork County Council, or part of it at least, where a positive policy on social housing is in operation, where attempts are being made to provide and build affordable housing for direct sale to the public, where encouragement is given in respect of the development and sale of private housing sites, where there is a strong belief in the concept of shared ownership loans and where there is a programme of building local authority housing. I see such mechanisms as the solution to the wider problem of housing supply throughout the country, not the forced, artificial 20% solution the Minister is attempting to put in place. I do not <Col N="910" /> believe the Minister's proposal will work. As already stated, he has at his disposal the requisite mechanism and funding to solve the housing supply problem, particularly at local authority level, in a different fashion and I hope he will proceed to do so.</P>
    <P>Cork County Council is currently debating its four year housing budget. I am disappointed provisions in this regard are not sufficient from a financial perspective. If the Minister wants to ease the housing supply problem in Cork and elsewhere he should provide local authorities with increased funding to supply more houses, provide additional private housing sites, build affordable houses and sell them directly to the public.</P>

      <P>I remind Deputy Bradford that this is the Planning and Development Bill and he should confine his remarks to planning matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am keenly aware of that. However, given the Minister's remarks that housing supply is at the core of the Bill, I am merely suggesting that the best way to deal with the housing crisis is by providing direct financial assistance to local authorities. I will leave further comments on that matter to a later date.</P>
      <P>I wish to briefly address the section of the Bill which deals with enforcement. As a member of one of the largest local authorities in the country, Cork County Council, I must admit that planning enforcement is a joke. Thousands of planning applications are made each year in County Cork but the planning enforcement office is hopelessly understaffed. There are barely enough personnel to answer telephone calls and take details of queries or complaints. The office does not have enough staff to allow it to send people out to investigate complaints.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of planning enforcement provisions in the Bill is fine. I am sure that the provisions put in place in the 1963 Act seemed quite strong, but unless the requisite staff are available to follow up on and deal with queries and complaints, there will be no progress in this area. I hope the Minister will make provision with regard to local authority staffing levels in the relevant sections of the Bill. I am not sure what is the current position concerning the embargo on recruitment to the public service, but I am sure local authorities do not have adequate numbers of staff, be they planners or enforcement personnel. That matter must be addressed.</P>
      <P>With regard to enforcement, I support Deputy Ring's comments about certain developers who have gotten away with shoddy work practices and have left estates unfinished. These individuals appear to be able to move on by changing their company name. However, under the terms of the Bill, I hope we will be able to pursue these builders and ensure that they put their houses in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When major planning decisions are being made, particularly those which relate to estates involving the construction of between 300 and <Col N="911" /> 500 houses, the case history and track record of the applicants should be taken into account. Those of us who are members of local authorities are only too well aware of the fact that people who have a poor track record have been able to obtain permission for large new developments because their past performance has not been taken into account. I hope there is some mechanism whereby the position can be reversed.</P>
    <P>Part Vl of the Bill makes provision in respect of An Bord Pleanála, an organisation which is overworked. At any given time, there are many hundreds of appeals before the board. The position which obtains at local authority level, where people are at least guaranteed that a decision will issue within two months, does not apply to An Bord Pleanála. Approximately 12 months or two years ago, people who appealed to An Bord Pleanála received a decision, whether they liked it or not, within a reasonable period. However, that is no longer the position and, again, inadequate staffing is to blame. I hope the new provisions which apply to the board will ensure that it is allocated sufficient staff to enable it to deal with the growing number of appeals.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough that people are given the minimum amount of information regarding An Bord Pleanála's decision to refuse or grant planning permission. In the majority of cases, the information given is a repetition of what the planners said at council level. That may not be a bad thing but we should be able to obtain more information as to why an individual decision was reached. I know of a number of cases in which the inspector gave a strong recommendation which was overturned by the board, as it is entitled to do. However, when this happens there should be access to a fairly detailed transcript of the board's discussions.</P>
    <P>Under the Freedom of Information Act the public is entitled to know almost everything about every Department. People are also entitled to know about the interests, worth and financial dealings of Members of the Oireachtas. However, the details of a decision made by An Bord Pleanála seem beyond the scope of that Act. This may not be relevant in most cases but it is not good enough that people are not given the reasons an inspector's decision is overturned by the board. There should be greater access to meetings where such decisions are made. We hear lectures about transparency, accountability and openness, but An Bord Pleanála remains too much of a closed shop. The shutters need to come down and if there is to be transparency across the planning process it must also apply to An Bord Pleanála. I hope we will make progress in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have referred to decisions made by planners and how planning is not a precise science which leads to some confusion. Clear advice should be given by the Department to local authorities when drawing up their county development plans so that they all sing from the same hymn sheet. I am not advocating that a bureaucrat in Dublin <Col N="912" /> should decide which areas of Cork are zoned for housing, agriculture or amenities. However, we need clear guidelines and that is not the case at present. This is making matters difficult for local representatives because various case histories are being cited to us. We are trying to defend the planning process in local authorities but various examples are then presented to us which show how one county is handling matters differently from another. The quicker we move away from this scenario the better.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring referred to planning refusals in rural areas. The Bill places much emphasis on sustainable development and environmental protection. Deputy Ring referred to refusals for planning permission for housing based on septic tanks and so on. We cannot argue with such decisions as problems with septic tanks cannot be ignored. However, we should be advocating systems such as the puraflow system and the Department should consider grant aiding such developments. Unfortunately, many septic tank systems developed in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s are no longer environmentally defensible. We must protect our water supply and we will have to move to a situation where every rural dwelling is provided with a modern septic tank system. However, these systems are expensive. There is a new housing grant and the Minister should consider a grant aid scheme for the provision of septic tank systems. It will be too late in five, ten or 15 years when we realise that our present systems have damaged our water supply. Modern systems are expensive but this problem can be overcome by the provision of grant aid.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker spoke about the compensation provisions of the Bill where certain proposals are refused. I concur with Deputy Noel Ahern's comments that there are occasions when local communities should be considered for compensation for allowing particular developments to go ahead. In my constituency and parish there are major planning controversies involving quarries and landfill sites. Such projects will involve a significant encumbrance on the local community. It is not for me to judge whether they should go ahead, but if they do, there will have to be some provision for compensating the local community where a facility being built is of value to a much wider community. I hope this issue will be considered.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this substantial legislation which will, perhaps, be a monument to Deputy Dempsey's tenure in office. I am sure there will be many amendments on Committee Stage to which I hope he will give favourable consideration. Planning is not a party political issue and we should all approach it from the position of trying to ensure proper and sustainable development. I look forward to the rest of Second Stage and Committee Stage when, I hope, the Minister will take on board some of my comments and those of colleagues.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. Many <Col N="913" /> important issues are dealt with in this legislation, the most important of which are the involvement of local public representatives in the planning process, the issues raised by delays in the system, staffing requirements and social housing.</P>
      <P>Wherever public representatives are gathered the main focus of attention and debate is their role in the planning system. Members would agree that reform is long overdue. I thank the Minister for responding to many years of representations concerning planning and the involvement of public representatives.</P>
      <P>We all recognise that confidence has been eroded in the planning system for a long time. It is time to deal with this issue and the need for transparency in the system. Public perception of the political and planning systems demands that reforms are implemented as soon as possible. Over the years planning applicants have concluded that they will not receive approval unless they enlist the support of their local politician. A typical response to a planning refusal is that it is a question of who one knows. However, the blame for this lack of trust and confidence cannot be laid solely at the door of politicians.</P>
      <P>Because of its shortcoming and delays, the planning system obliges people to seek the support of members of the political establishment, be they local or national politicians. Usually the request is to arrange a pre-planning meeting with planners or to speed up a planning decision.</P>

    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;recognising the uniqueness of the credit union movement;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;acknowledging its work in fostering thrift and providing advice to persons on low incomes in both rural parishes and in urban disadvantaged areas;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;appreciative of the efforts of so many volunteers who give freely of their time to the service of credit unions;</P>

    <P Just="Center">&ndash;deplores the refusal of the Minister for Finance to meet representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions, and calls on the Government to amend the Finance Bill, 2000, so that returns on credit union savings are taxed in accordance with the recommendations made by the <Col N="914" /> Chairman of the working group which examined this issue.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Moynihan-Cronin and Rabbitte.</P>
      <P>In the brief time available to me last night I suggested there was a qualitative difference between those who placed their money with credit unions and those who placed their money, often for speculative benefit, with banks. The history of the two institutions of saving are totally different. To argue that a complaint was lodged by competitors of the credit union for deposits was a total fig leaf. It is unacceptable that a meeting, which has been delayed for two years, will now take place between those who sought it and someone standing in for the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The competition regime is entirely the wrong framework for evaluating what is appropriate for credit unions. They have since their inception and will continue to be judged on their social role and the services they provide.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to contribute to this debate and to acknowledge the important role credit unions play in communities throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us have a positive experience of credit unions. However, a number of Members in this House do not attach the same importance to the function and role of the credit unions. It was almost galling to hear Independent supporters of the Government tell tales of their relentless <Col N="915" /> efforts to meet the Taoiseach in recent days. The credit unions have looked for this meeting for two years. It is impossible to accept that the efforts of the Independents are heartfelt. If the Independents had an interest in the credit unions they would have secured a meeting some time ago and there would have been no necessity to debate this motion or to put the people in the Gallery to the expense of travelling to Dublin and staying overnight. It appears that nothing less than a hard hitting motion from the Opposition will spur the Independent Deputies into action. Their race to the media at the eleventh hour to assure the electorate that they will ensure the credit unions demand is facilitated is not enough.</P>
    <P>Credit unions have been fundamentally important to families in recent decades. A recent exposé by the Director of Consumer Affairs on the excessive interest rates charged by legal moneylenders to low income families highlighted the need to increase access to small amounts of credit for those on lower incomes. The banks are not interested in giving a loan to a family to purchase a new fridge or to pay for a funeral. As a result, low income families in need of credit have two options. They can either establish a record in their local credit union and advance a loan or they can go to a loan shark and pay exorbitant rates of interest. Families in the grip of loan sharks who seek the assistance of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service will normally be given advice on budgeting and will open a credit union account to assist them with their credit needs in the future. This is a vindication of the important role credit unions play.</P>
    <P>The snub by the Minister for Finance to the credit unions is an indication that his interests lie with the big banks which make huge profits. His behaviour in refusing a meeting with the credit unions shows he does not wish to acknowledge the important work they do in some of the most excluded and disadvantaged communities.</P>
    <P>Credit unions are people based and are found in small villages and in parts of our cities where any bank would fear to tread. I come from the constituency of Kerry South and I know the important role full-time credit union offices have played in towns such as Rathmore. Older people who do not have transport to get to their nearest bank, which could be eight or ten miles away, can access credit and savings facilities in their credit union. I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a novelty that Deputy Noonan has to table a motion requiring any Fianna Fáil Minister to meet an organisation which represents 1.5 million people. That is eccentric behaviour in the extreme. The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, and the excellent officials from the Department of Finance should ensure the Minister for Finance is given a check-up. It is unusual, as I am sure you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, would agree, that <Col N="916" /> Fianna Fáil would want to spurn such an organisation.</P>
      <P>I am amazed that the Finance Bill was published this year without taking on board the reforms recommended by the working group which the Minister set up. It agreed proposals to bring the law into line and to deal with the fact that some credit union members are penalised by the application of the law.</P>
      <P>I support this motion. When I was Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment in 1997 I introduced a Bill to provide a modern framework for the credit union movement to realise its potential on behalf of the type of people Deputy Moynihan-Cronin mentioned. I am saddened that the movement's potential is being constrained by the refusal of the Minister to give expression in the Finance Bill to what everyone knows is necessary.</P>
      <P>Some credit union members are treated inequitably as a result of the law as it stands at present. There was broad consensus for the reforms put forward. Corporation profits tax does not arise because credit unions are not corporations in that sense. They are mutual not-for-profit organisations, so the question of corporation profits tax is a red herring.</P>
      <P>It appears the Minister, in a fit of pique, is anxious to leave the credit union movement exposed to scrutiny or threatened scrutiny from Brussels because of what Sam Smyth wrote in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 22 October 1998. Under the large headline, &ldquo;McCreevy exacts sweet revenge for humiliation&rdquo;, he stated: &ldquo;It's not so much a case of getting over his anger, the finance minister is getting even with the credit unions&rdquo;. I am sure there are many more newspaper cuttings from that time.</P>
      <P>I cannot pretend it was a bed of roses when I dealt with the Irish League of Credit Unions over a prolonged period. However, I could not afford to go off in a huff. The nature of this business is that if you cannot take the heat, then you should leave the kitchen. Two years is a long time for the Minister to be in a sulk. He should be examined because two years is a long time for him to have his finger in his mouth and to refuse to come out of the corner and talk to the credit unions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moynihan-Cronin drew attention to the Independents. They come out occasionally and put their finger up to see which way the wind is blowing so they can decide which way to go. They are usually orchestrated by Deputy Healy-Rae who came on radio yesterday, after Deputy Noonan's motion had forced the Taoiseach to do what the Minister would not do and meet the credit unions, and said he would do the devil and all if someone did not meet someone soon. It is extraordinary that the Minister for Finance even refused the importuning of the Taoiseach to meet the representatives of 1.5 million people. The Taoiseach himself now has to do it. I hope we can agree to bring forward an amendment to this year's Finance Bill to give expression to what the credit union movement deserves and requires.</P>

      <P>One could characterise the Minister's position as 'once bitten, twice shy'. Unfortunately there has been a <i>contretemps</i> and a failure of communication between the Minister and the representatives of the credit union movement. That is a matter for regret because all of us, particularly those of us in Fianna Fáil, share a great affinity with and confidence in the work done by the credit unions. They are an essential part of our social fabric, performing an enormous task in areas where people would not even think of seeking a loan and would not get it from a regular banking institution. That is the value of the role of the credit unions in our economy or, more accurately, in our society.</P>
      <P>Many people have said we do not live in an economy, we live in a society where people have different needs. In that respect the credit unions complement and develop the work which has already been done by commercial banks. Some people predict that there will be only 12 large banks in all Europe within 15 years. Deregulation and greater use of technology mean there will be a significant shake up of the European banking industry. That will mean fewer banks and retail branches. We already saw the decisions First Active had to make because of the intervention of the Bank of Scotland into the mortgage market. We will see more and more of that as the shake up on a European level reaches the local level in this State. I fear we may start to see areas without banks in suburban and rural districts. We all know areas without banks or commercial centres rapidly become disadvantaged, 'no go' areas in terms of investment and financial and commercial choice.</P>
      <P>It is important that those on the Government side make it clear that the Government is committed to developing the credit union sector. It is regrettable that the relationship with the Minister broke down because of a miscommunication but it is more important that the relationship with the credit unions is now being dealt with by the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach will meet the representatives of the credit unions and will look at how the area can be developed in the context of the failure of the banking sector to lend to people below a certain income threshold. That is not acceptable in societal terms.</P>
      <P>In the years ahead we will depend on the credit unions not only to sustain the customer base it now maintains but to develop an even wider remit. The credit union movement should be given a greater role in lending to small business, another area from which the commercial banks have withdrawn. Perhaps it is not profitable but the Government should examine how the credit union sector could develop in relation to the specific needs of start up or small businesses, micro-enterprises.</P>

      <P>The Minister is acutely conscious, as we all are, that the development of the sector is predicated by two factors: European regulations and technology. The credit unions are spending £40 million on computer technology to allow branches from all over the country access to money at the same time. This is a competitive challenge to the banks and they will be worried about it. This increased use of technology will make the credit union movement into, as the Labour Party used to say, a third force in banking. We now have as many as seven forces in banking but the credit unions will be a force when their investment in technology is complete and they offer more products to their customer base. When they can centralise functions they will improve.</P>
      <P>A complaint has been made at European level by the Irish Mortgage Brokers Association in relation to EU competition law. The complaint is not justified and I do not think it will succeed. Other, similar complaints made against the credit union movement have failed in the past, as will this one. I agree with the credit unions &ndash; DG4 and the Government should impress upon the European Commission that we need a decision quickly so we can clear this up and get down to the business of seeing how the credit unions can fit into the evolving financial sector.</P>
      <P>The financial sector is also threatened by European and global developments. The development of electronic commerce in the banking system will have enormous consequences for the financial sector. It is imperative that there are institutions which will lend to a customer base that other institutions will not touch. We know that 41% of the customer base of the credit unions are in receipt of social welfare payments of one sort or another. These are the people whom the banks will not consider. The average savings are £1,400, the average deposit is £300 and the average loan is £2,400. Many banks will not even consider lending an amount that small.</P>

    <P>The credit unions have a huge role to play and the Opposition parties are playing politics with the issue. The Taoiseach is taking the lead and his presence is good news and a positive signal about how seriously the credit unions' case is <Col N="919" /> taken. It is also a sign that the Government is committed to developing the credit unions.</P>

      <P>There is an important principle at stake. The Department of Finance is not an ideal setting in which to discuss issues relating to the credit unions, or an ideal vehicle to make proposals for the movement's development. Given that the credit union is part of the social economy, it should be directed, run and legislated for by the Department of the Taoiseach. That is the proper way to do it. The Department of Finance is conservative and is happier regulating large commercial banks and being part of the &ldquo;real economy&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1, which we on this side of the House will support, calls on the House to support &ldquo;the Government's policy on exempting the income of credit unions from corporation tax;&rdquo; and &ldquo;notes that, as already indicated, the Government will meet without delay the credit union movement&rdquo; at a date and time to be set. It goes on to call on &ldquo;the Minister for Finance to take account of these factors in his ongoing consideration of the Report of the Working Group on the Taxation of Returns on Credit Union Savings which was established by him in this regard.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There has been substantial progress on what has been a difficult issue over the last two years. The Taoiseach has given a commitment to meet with the representatives of the credit union. In consequence, this side of the House will call on the Minister to take full account of that meeting and of the deliberations at EU level and to proceed accordingly.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service I was pleased to meet with the Irish League of Credit Unions on 2 February. I was very impressed with its presentation to the committee. It highlighted the social class breakdown of its members as follows: 35% are in the C2 class, 35% are in the DE class and approximately 10% are in the F class. This gives a clear indication of the make-up of the people who deal with credit unions on a daily basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately 40% of those who deal with credit unions are in receipt of some kind of social welfare payment. That is the group about whom I am most concerned. I am not so concerned about the people on the high tax rates who can afford to pay any deposit interest retention tax <Col N="920" /> that is due and income tax on any dividends they may earn. I am concerned with those on social welfare and on low incomes who are not in a taxable position. We will do a good day's work if we focus this debate on the rank and file members of the trade union movement for whom the credit unions were established.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the role of the credit unions. There is hardly a family in the country that has not had some direct personal experience with them. They have provided assistance when credit was impossible to obtain elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The large number of voluntary workers in addition to the full-time officers in the credit union movement is impressive, whether they are operating in branches at Doonan, Mountrath, Rathdowney, Portlaoise, Clonaslee, Mountmellick or wherever. Speaking to those involved in the movement in County Laois it is clear that while senior members and officers may understand the intricacies of this debate, ordinary members do not. That is why I disagree with sloganising; the detail of what needs to be said is more important than highlighting a few catchphrases.</P>
    <P>Credit unions are not included in the deposit interest retention tax scheme. As a result they are not obliged to deduct the tax from interest or dividends accruing in respect of the savings of their members. However, this does not mean that income tax is not due on them. Given that the tax code should treat everybody equally, credit union members, like other members of society, are obliged to report interest or dividends on savings as part of their income tax returns. While this applies to those who are liable for income tax, it must be pointed out that a large proportion of the population is not liable because they do not have a sufficiently high income to bring them into the tax net. They have been left behind in this debate.</P>
    <P>In the new tax year commencing on 6 April next, there will be three groups of taxpayers &ndash; those on the top rate who will pay at a rate of 44%, those who will pay at the standard rate of 22% and those &ndash; a large number of people &ndash; who will pay no income tax because they do not have sufficient income to bring them into the tax net. This debate has been geared towards those on the top income tax rate at the expense of people who do not have a taxable income.</P>
    <P>The motion proposes that an across the board deposit interest retention tax of 20% be applied to all savings and dividends on shares held in credit unions. That is an outrageous attack on people on social welfare and low incomes who are dealing with credit unions and who do not have a taxable income. It is proposed that income tax at a rate of 20% should be deducted from them at source, even though they are not, and would not be, in the tax net. This will take money out of the pockets of those people who should not be in the tax net. The same rate will apply to and will meet all the tax liabilities of those who are on the top rate of tax, which will be 44% in the new tax year. <Col N="921" /> It is not right that people who are not in the tax net should have to subsidise the income tax payments of those who are in the higher income tax bracket.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to the debate. Deputy Noonan and Fine Gael have tabled this motion on taxation matters relating to credit unions not because they believe the Minister is doing anything wrong from a tax point of view, but to embarrass the Minister and the Government for not meeting the Irish League of Credit Unions in recent months. It is well known that the Fine Gael Members who attended the meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on 6 February were advised and warned to be very careful in their utterances and not to commit themselves in relation to tax matters.</P>
      <P>The motion has some very laudable propositions, including asking Dáil Éireann to recognise the uniqueness of the credit union movement; acknowledge its work in fostering thrift and providing advice to persons on low incomes in both rural parishes and urban disadvantaged areas and appreciate the efforts of so many volunteers who give freely of their time to the service of credit unions. The Government amendment covers the fourth proposition by stating:</P>
      <P>as already indicated, the Government will meet without delay with the credit union movement and that a date is being set, and calls on the Minister for Finance to take account of these factors in his ongoing consideration of the report of the Working Group on the Taxation of Returns on Credit Union Savings which was established by him in this regard.</P>
      <P>We are all very aware of and appreciate the very important role the credit union has played and continues to play in society since its foundation in 1958. It is a countrywide union covering the 32 counties, with 430 credit unions in the South and 1.8 million members. Without the voluntary work of up to 16,000 people the movement would not be able to perform its laudable work, and I take this opportunity to congratulate and thank those volunteers who have given freely of their time in serving on the boards of directors and the supervisory committees which oversee the activities of credit unions in respect of risk management. First communions, confirmations, weddings, funerals and many other occasions could not have been properly celebrated by thousands of people down through the years without the credit union movement. Also, without the credit unions many people would not have been able to buy cars, carry out house repairs or continue their children's education. Therefore, the movement has been of tremendous benefit to society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 2 February the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service had a frank and fruitful meeting with the Irish League of Credit Unions. In attendance were the president, Mr. Lynch, the <Col N="923" /> vice-president, Mr. McMahon, Mr. Tony Smyth and some other representatives. In their presentation they outlined the history and development of the credit union movement and made it quite clear that credit unions exist to give a service to members and not to make profit as such. This is what differentiates credit unions from other financial institutions. The success of credit unions has been seen by other financial institutions as a threat. Some years ago a complaint was made to the European Commission by the banks, which was rejected. A further complaint has been made which is still unresolved.</P>
    <P>In 1998 there as an unfortunate mix-up between the Minister for Finance and the credit union movement. I will not say who was to blame, but it resulted in withdrawal of the Minister's tax proposals from the Finance Act, 1998. However, the Minister still held the line on corporation tax and the exemption of credit unions and introduced an amendment which meant credit unions were not liable to report interest on deposits. In addition, the Minister established a working group to report to him with proposals. This resulted in the chairman of the working group making a minority report, and the Minister feels he cannot proceed with the recommendations because of the formal complaint made to the European Commission.</P>
    <P>From my inquiries today I understand the Commission will write to the complainant and the Department of Finance as soon as a decision is made on the complaint. To date neither body has received correspondence from Brussels. I know Deputy Noonan for the best part of 18 years and would not accuse him of knowingly misleading the House last night when he stated the EU had ruled on the complaint. He may have been referring to the first complaint and not the one which is stopping the Minister from progressing with the recommendations of the working group.</P>
    <P>On 3 February I received a letter from Mr. Lynch, president of the Irish League of Credit Unions, saying that even a written assurance that the Government would implement the proposals of the working group as soon as DGIV makes its findings would suffice. At that stage DGIV had not issued its findings. I believe the Minister will proceed when a decision is forthcoming from the Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Séan Ryan spoke on this issue last night and also attended the meeting of the joint committee where he raised the issue of the Irish League of Credit Unions putting forward candidates in the next general election. He expressed concern that this might happen on the basis that, as a member of a credit union, he always considered credit unions to be non-political. In response to Deputy Ryan the vice-president said at the joint committee meeting:</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Ryan that he knows as much about the campaign to put forward credit union candidates in certain constituencies as I do. I went home having spent the weekend in Dub<Col N="924" /> lin at a league board meeting. I picked up <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and.discovered that in the west people were thinking about putting forward candidates.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that the matter had not been discussed at the ILCU meeting and that he would not be in favour of the movement being politicised. It was with dismay the following week that I read in the newspapers that the president of the ILCU, who was also present at the joint committee meeting, was going to stand in the Dáil elections under the credit union banner. This is not the way forward for a movement which is of tremendous benefit to all sectors of society. I hope that following the meeting with the Taoiseach and when the Minister for Finance receives a response from Europe it will be possible to bring forward proposals agreeable to the credit union movement allowing it go forward and continue the excellent work it has done since 1958.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, with the agreement of the House. Time is brief but I will get straight to the point. Credit unions are entirely different to any other financial institution because they are non-profit making. They have a different culture and ethos to every other person who lends money and takes in deposits. That factor has not been recognised by Minister McCreevy in his churlish behaviour in refusing to meet them for two years. It is fundamentally unfair that as I deposit money into a bank or building society I pay DIRT at 20%, yet if I invest in a credit union I will pay interest income on my credit union dividend of 44p in the pound. That is manifestly unfair and unjust. Those are the two central factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's dispute has led to a situation where there has been non-reporting for the past two years and we have a non-compliance factor. From anyone's point of view it is in everybody's interest to get this settled. One political point I will make is that there was never as good an opportunity for our four missing Independent friends to have a Government over a barrel where it is so completely out of line. This debate has shown there is not one scintilla of testosterone between them, apart from Deputy Fox. They have acted like wimps because they could have ensured the Finance Bill was rewritten. If the Minister was told, as he was told on the plinth by all backbenchers when it came to the stay at home wives, that this was not acceptable, he would not be so slow about moving &ndash; his boss certainly moves with alacrity. The Independent TDs have missed a huge opportunity to force an amendment to the Finance Bill 2000 to ensure equity and justice. If a person is in financial difficulties he or she should not go to a bank. Who do MABS or anybody go to? They go to what is called the poor man's bank, the bank which takes <Col N="925" /> an interest in people, in the community ethos. Those are the people with whom this Government is openly prepared to have a dispute. It is unfair and this issue will not go away.</P>
    <P>The working party report should be implemented in full. When it was recommended that there should be exemption for the first £375 of dividend income deposit, rates returned to 6% &ndash; they are now 3%, half the value. One would have to have double the money to what they were at the time. The Minister should stop his churlish and childish behaviour, meet them and amend the Finance Bill accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to declare a personal interest in this debate. When the Gweedore credit union was established in 1972 I served for some years as secretary and am still a member with a small savings account.</P>
      <P>Since 1972 the Gweedore credit union has developed and expanded. There are 5,900 members who have total shares of £8 million which works out at an average of approximately £1,200 per member. During those years Comhar Creidmheasa Ghaoth Dobhair has become a focal point of the community. It employs five full-time people, but like all credit unions, much of the work is done by dozens of voluntary workers.</P>
      <P>What has happened in Gweedore since 1972 is just a reflection of what has happened throughout Ireland since the first credit union was established in 1958. Today there are 530 credit unions in Ireland and 120 in Northern Ireland. In County Donegal alone there are 14 credit unions with a total membership of almost 54,000. Eight of the credit unions are in Donegal south-west &ndash; Ballybofey, Stranorlar, Ballyshannon, Gweedore, Donegal town, Killybegs, Pettigo, Sheephaven and Rosses, with a combined membership of almost 25,000 people and average savings of approximately £1,200 per member.</P>
      <P>In many cases credit unions have flourished due to the loyalty, pride and commitment to excellence displayed by many members. Volunteers and staff have built up credit unions into institutions which may sometimes rival other financial institutions. However, an important point is that credit unions have never been and never will be mere financial institutions. They do not facilitate offshore accounts nor would one expect members to have Ansbacher holdings. Unlike some of our major financial institutions, credit unions are not engaged in widespread tax avoidance. Their aim is to serve their members and locality.</P>
      <P>Savings in credit unions are called shares thus denoting that the savers are the owners of the credit unions. Savers in other financial institutions are not the owners. Credit union shareholders are the owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point was made by Deputy Yates that their motive is profit. The motive of the credit union is service to its members and the community. The savings in credit unions are loaned to members in time of need. The surplus of income over the <Col N="926" /> operational expenditure of the credit union is distributed to members in the form of a dividend and in many cases as an interest rebate on members' loans. Credit unions are providing essential services for people who are usually living on low or middle incomes. They allow people in the aforementioned income bracket an opportunity to save money and also to receive credit. There are countless families throughout the country who have money to purchase a car, loans to send a son or daughter to college, cash for the occasional holiday or home improvement and the source of these essential loans is the local credit union.</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable that the Minister has consistently refused to meet the Irish League of Credit Unions to discuss the report of the working group established to consider the issue of taxation on credit union savings and dividends. In a belated gesture, obviously in response to this Private Members' motion, the Government has now relented and is at long last willing to meet the league. Is there any other national organisation that has been treated in such a cavalier fashion by the Government and, indeed, the Minister? The 1.7 million members of the Irish credit unions will not easily forget how they have been treated by this Government and particularly by the Minister for Finance who has not yet indicated whether he is willing to meet the league.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Independents, particularly the two from my county, Deputies Blaney and Gildea, to join us in supporting the case of the credit unions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>As a representative of Cork North-West any debate on the credit union is obviously close to my heart. The village of Ballydesmond was the home of Nora Herlihy who was one of the leading lights in the late 1950s in establishing the credit union movement. I am pleased to report that the credit union movement in Cork North-West is alive and well. My constituency office is located in what was the former credit union building on Main Street, Macroom. The credit union moved to a new premises two years ago due to an increase in membership and business transactions. Some months ago I attended an opening of a very significant extension to the Charleville credit union office which I believe is among the busiest and biggest credit union branches. Likewise in towns such as Millstreet and Kanturk the credit unions are alive and well and there are numerous sub-offices in places such as Coachford and Donoughmore. It is obvious that, from the late 1950s, the credit union movement has boomed. In the late 1950s there were three credit unions; now there are more than 400. There are more than 1.8 million account holders and more than £2.2 billion on deposit. By any yardstick it is an enormously successful financial institution and it must be said that credit unions are big business, not in a corporate sense but in terms of the community they serve and the number of members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> It is beyond belief that such an organisation cannot secure a meeting with the Minister for Finance. The trade union movement and the employers who do not have as many members as the credit union movement do not have any difficulty getting a meeting with him. I have listened to practically all the contributions in this debate and the terms used across the Chamber to describe the credit union movement have been &ldquo;the poor man's bank&rdquo;, &ldquo;tackling moneylenders&rdquo;, &ldquo;not for profit&rdquo;, &ldquo;community based&rdquo;, &ldquo;15,000 voluntary directors&rdquo;, &ldquo;1,500 employees&rdquo; and &ldquo;an organisation of integrity&rdquo;. Compare and contrast that with the terms used by much of the media to describe the activities of other financial institutions, such as &ldquo;High Court inspectors&rdquo;, &ldquo;tribunals&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ansbacher Cayman Ltd.&rdquo;, &ldquo;evasion&rdquo;, &ldquo;illegal&rdquo;, &ldquo;immoral&rdquo;. The credit union movement has made life bearable for many of its members. Many of them have been able to afford weddings, wakes, funerals, first holy communions, confirmations, foreign holidays, new cars, house extensions, and higher education costs while also adding some dignity to their lives.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that, in the context of its enormous number of members, the Minister for Finance refuses to meet the ILCU. The subtext of the debate relates to the credit union movement on the one hand and other financial institutions on the other. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. The Finance Bill has been published and other financial institutions are escaping scot free despite their involvement in evasion, illegality and immoral behaviour, yet the ILCU, which basically wants to sit down with the Minister to discuss an agenda that has been proposed by the working group, cannot secure such a meeting. That speaks volumes about where the Minister's heart lies in regard to this debate.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment refers to the Taoiseach meeting the credit union movement, which is unacceptable. Effectively, the Minister for Finance is giving two fingers to the Taoiseach and telling him that he will not sit down and discuss this matter. It is an affront to the Taoiseach's authority. Are we to expect a merry go round of talks involving the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and their officials with no progress made on the outstanding issues? The Finance Bill, which will pass through the House in the coming weeks, is the vehicle through which the working group's recommendations can be implemented. Unless the Minister irons out in the near future what is acceptable in terms on the ILCU's shopping list, none of the recommendations will be given legal effect in the Finance Bill. That is unacceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael motion is the only reason a meeting has been arranged by the Taoiseach. I am shocked at Fianna Fáil Members <Col N="928" /> who said this is a political motion. I recall that when they were in Opposition, they raised many issues which were much less important than this. Deputy Healy-Rae has not arranged the meeting with the Taoiseach. However, the Government has shown poor leadership in failing to meet the biggest and most important community group in Ireland. The Taoiseach is involved in trying to get people to meet and discuss issues in Northern Ireland. We must put our own house in order first and the Minister for Finance, who is normally a nice fellow, should let bygones be bygones and meet the ILCU. He must deal with financial issues under the Taoiseach's leadership, but he should conduct the meeting.</P>
      <P>The big bad wolf that is the EU has once again reared its head. I wonder who organised the big bad wolf's appearance. The EU was blamed for the end of the urban renewal scheme but when I and other Members visited Brussels we discovered that it resulted from a lack of effort on the part of the Government. If the Minister had acted on the working group's proposals, there would not have been a need for EU involvement, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
      <P>The ILCU is a unique organisation. Previous speakers have referred to what credit unions have done for small people, including small farmers whom I have represented for many years. Clones Credit Union members donated £100,000 to the local development association to allow it to draw down up to £1.7 million in cross-Border and other funds. No other statutory body would have allowed that to happen in one of the most devastated towns in Ireland. When Ballybay Credit Union built a new office, it also built a health centre. Cootehill and Monaghan Credit Unions supported urban renewal. The credit union movement is unique. It is impossible to understand why the Minister has not met the ILCU.</P>

      <P>What has the Government got against credit unions? Why does it and the Minister for Finance go out of their way to lock horns with one of the most financially beneficial organisations ever founded? It is a hallmark of the Government to try to be as difficult as it can when dealing with credit unions. I and 1.9 million account holders wonder why. There is a degree of begrudgery involved. Is it because the credit union movement is so successful, highly organised, true to its core principles and objectives and deals with ordinary people with ordinary problems? It seems that the Government is more interested in the world of big business and banking, shareholdings, and ever increasing share prices while ignoring the small people at the bottom of the pile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to equity in dealing with taxation and investment issues during his contribution. Does he really believe there is a similarity between the mother of a young family on a low <Col N="929" /> income trying to kit out her children for their first holy communion and a large shareholder or executive in the banking world who can easily earn £500,000 per annum? The Government continually misunderstands the philosophy of the credit union movement. Its core principle is that all its members must save before they can seek a loan. It encourages thrift and introduces many families to the concept of budgeting for the first time.</P>
    <P>The movement, like the co-operative movement, works on the premise that individuals on their own have little power but when they combine with clear objectives few obstacles cannot be overcome. For young and old in urban and rural Ireland the credit union has become an indispensable part of people's lives. I am proud to be a member of my local credit union as are the other members of my family. I see at first hand small extensions to dwellings and the young people who use the credit union to financially aid them while studying at third level institutions and I know many farmers who bought a few extra cows, built slatted houses or purchased a tractor through the credit union.</P>
    <P>The credit union has one other great strength. It has one of the best supervisory and managerial control systems. This Government will only make its peace with the credit unions once it accepts that they are unique in many ways. Government members have not got that into their heads yet.</P>

      <P>This issue is not about taxation, it is about Charlie's pride. I am talking about Charlie, the Minister for Finance and not Charlie Pride, the singer. He had to do a U-turn on the budget and we want him to do another in regard to the credit unions. Every speaker has outlined what credit unions have done for small people. The Government has proved one thing since it took up office. It is there for the big man and the big banks and we saw what the big man did for Governments over the years. A constituent who was in difficulty called into my office two weeks ago. His family had debts and he had to pay a little loan that he owed. I wrote to the three banks and building societies in the town and they refused to help because he did not have the means to pay it back. I rang the manager of the credit union and explained the problem to him. I asked him not to put the same pressure on my constituent that the banks had and explained that he just needed a few pound to alleviate his problems. He delivered the money to him and now the man is paying back that money out of his social welfare benefit. The Minister should realise that this is not about pride, it is about fair play. However, the Government has not shown fair play in respect of the people on hospital waiting lists or farmers, but it has shown fair play in respect of the banks. Enough is enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to deal with the problems highlighted by credit unions. If the members of the credit unions wanted to make a donation to the Progressive Democrats or to Fianna Fáil, they would be met in any hotel in Dublin or in Mayo, the cheque <Col N="930" /> would be taken off them and they would be thanked very much.</P>
    <P>We live in a democracy and there is no reason the Minister should not meet representatives of the credit union movement. It boils down to Charlie's pride. Charlie's pride is coming to Castlebar and I want him to come for the credit unions.</P>

      <P>This important motion concerns the refusal of the Minister for Finance to meet representatives of the credit union movement, and amending the Finance Bill. The Minister's refusal to meet the credit unions is an outrage. If the Taoiseach is not happy with the job the Minister for Finance is doing, the honourable thing would be to move him but not leave him in the job where he and the Department of Finance will be humiliated. The Taoiseach will meet the credit unions but on a previous occasion, the Fianna Fáil backbenchers were able to have the Finance Bill changed. In this instance, the Minister for Finance should have met the credit unions. The Taoiseach should not have to do that. Even at this late stage I appeal to the Minister to do so because what is happening is wrong.</P>
      <P>The credit union movement over the years through its own enterprise and initiative is working on behalf of the communities in which its branches are located. In the vast majority of cases its members are doing this work on a voluntary basis. The major banks and building societies are closing down their branches in the villages and smaller towns. They take this action in low income areas. The credit union movement is serving those people and the Government should actively support credit unions rather than come down on them with a hammer.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the working party, which were simple and straightforward, were supported by the Registrar of Friendly Societies, the chairman of the working group and officials of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The working party recommended that the first £375 of credit union dividends paid to members be exempt from tax &ndash; that is fair and reasonable; that between £375 and up to £750 should be subject to 20% tax and, if the dividend is above that figure, it should all be subject to 20%. That is fair and reasonable.  The Government is failing to recognise the hard work and initiative of the people in credit unions who have done such a service for this country. These people will still be around when, in years to come, our major financial institutions, some of which may have been taken over by foreign banks, will be gone. The credit union movement should be supported rather it being threatened with a heavy hammer.</P>

      <P>The credit union movement has played a key and unique role in Irish society, both rural and urban. Those who have been involved in community development have witnessed at first hand the contribution it has made. It has <Col N="931" /> helped countless families and is available to assist people at times of major crisis and it has encouraged people to save. It is a disgrace that the Government has refused to recognise this and has snubbed the movement by refusing to meet the Irish League of Credit Unions for over two years. Why is the league singled out for this treatment? Does the Minister for Finance not recognise the work of the credit union movement in fostering thrift and providing advice to persons on low income in both rural parishes and in urban disadvantaged areas?</P>
      <P>The Minister should recognise that there are some 1.9 million credit union members, and I must declare that I am a member of Cushana credit union which has its headquarters in Askeaton, County Limerick. I have seen at first hand the excellent voluntary work done by the directors of the credit union. The League of Credit Unions is looking for a fair and equitable taxation system for its members. The Minister should introduce an amendment to the Finance Bill which would tax credit unions in accordance with the recommendations made by the chairman of the working group on taxation of credit union returns.</P>
      <P>The current approach is unfair and inequitable. Credit unions are non-profit organisations. Last evening, the Minister for Finance trotted out the excuse for inaction that an objection was submitted to the European Commission. It is clear from the debate last evening that that is not the case. Deputy Michael Noonan, introducing the motion, pointed out that he had been in contact with Brussels yesterday and he learned that that was not the case.

      <P>The history of credit unions in Ireland is synonymous with the history of community development and for this reason, it is <Col N="932" /> important to the Green Party. Like almost every other Deputy in the debate, I am a longstanding member of my local credit union in Balbriggan. I compliment Balbriggan credit union and the other credit unions I visited as a guest in Skerries, Donabate, Swords and Malahide for being there to help people with whom the financial institutions often refuse to do business. I have attended a number of events organised by the MABS, and I support its work, but the credit unions were doing this work for years before MABS came on the scene. Credit unions have saved many people from the clutches of moneylenders, even paying off moneylenders to break the cycle of debt eating away at a family.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, it infuriates me to hear of the pressure being exerted by the 14 members of the Irish Mortgage and Savers Association on Brussels and on the Government to drop the unique deserved recognition of credit unions. Credit unions hold a distinct community development remit and reinvest their surplus in their own communities. How many members of the Irish Mortgage and Savers Association have such a community remit? Looking at the DIRT inquiry, it is clear that community remit is not an issue for the profit-driven financial institutions.</P>
      <P>Last December, <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> referred to this distinct aspect of credit union activity in referring to Tullamore credit union funding local charities. It must also be noted that Balbriggan credit union has chosen to be the first credit union in Ireland to have direct debit and other facilities and associated computer training. It also gives tens of thousands of pounds to local schools, sports organisations and charities. Tallow credit union has funded a business centre and paid for street sides in its town. Oldcastle credit union has funded a local sports centre. Clones credit union has funded local good causes. Kilrush credit union has built a local hospital and leisure centre, and Blessington credit union has built a business park.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance should examine his conscience on this issue and ask himself if he is blinded by the prejudice of the financial institutions against credit unions. His current intransigence is indefensible and arrogant, and I join the other Opposition Members in asking him to meet the credit unions on this issue.</P>

      <P>I am glad to be able to respond to this motion on behalf of the Government and to put this issue into proper context. This is what the Government's amending motion does and I look forward to the House agreeing to support it.</P>
      <P>As the House will know, the Taoiseach will meet the credit unions next week and will have the opportunity to outline their current thinking on this matter. I thank all those who have spoken on this issue for their general endeavours to give this matter a full airing in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All who have made contributions to this debate are in agreement on the valuable and important <Col N="933" /> role that the credit union movement has played and continues to play in the life of so many communities throughout this country. Deputies have also drawn attention to the free time given by the many volunteers to their local credit unions. These are sentiments that I fully share.</P>
    <P>On the subject of EU complaints, some confusion appears to have crept into the discussion of this matter in the House. It is the case that the EU Commission dealt with a complaint in 1998 but a further, more detailed and wider complaint was made to the Commission last year by a financial sector representative body. That complaint is still live. I am not aware that the Commission has come to a decision on it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan last night dismissed the EU angle as a bogus concern and Deputy McDowell said it was nonsense. I am surprised at both Deputies who are well aware from debates in the House that the EU is keeping a close watch on everything happening in this country. I have no reason to treat the EU dimension as bogus or nonsensical and I would be alarmed by such an approach. The Commission has been granted a formal role by the Treaty in these matters. It has also made clear that it regards such issues as coming within the Commission's guidelines on the application of State aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation. Paragraph 25 of the communication from the Commission of 11 November 1998 &ndash; Sec (1998) 1800 final &ndash; on tax competition and State aid rules reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Obviously, profit tax cannot be levied if no profit is earned. It may thus be justified by the nature of the tax system that non-profit making undertakings, such as foundations or associations, are specifically exempt from the taxes on profits if they cannot actually earn any profits.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it may also be justified by the nature of the tax system that co-operatives which distribute all their profits to their members are not taxed at the level of the co-operative when tax is levied at the level of their members.</P>
    <P>It is not a social affairs directorate matter, as Deputy Michael Higgins suggested last night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it was more appropriately a social affairs matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Commission replied to the previous complaint about the corporation tax treatment of credit unions on 9 November 1998, it followed this logic pointing out that profits of credit unions are distributed to the members and are subject to tax in the hands of members. That is why the corporation tax exemption for the credit unions is not a &ldquo;final exemption but only transfers the point of taxation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, the reason the Commission took no action at that time is clear. The exemption of credit unions from corporation tax is acceptable to the Commission once the dividend distribution is subject to income tax in the <Col N="934" /> hands of the individual members. If we were to exempt both the credit union and its members from taxation, for which the league campaigns, such a proposal would have to be referred to the Commission for clearance. The issue of corporation tax does not fall or stand on its own merits as Deputy McDowell believes. The corporation tax and savings tax aspects are not separate and distinct as he claimed.</P>
    <P>The EU element is not a bogeyman. It is real. As the Minister pointed out, any legislative change to the situation as proposed by the Opposition would only serve to aggravate matters. With regard to what Deputy Noonan said last night about the EU position regarding the taxation treatment of credit unions, I am informed that an official in the Department of Finance had an informal conversation on the matter today&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Noonan said that the manner in which credit union members are taxed is unfair and inequitable. Credit union members' savings are exempt from DIRT and members' interest and their dividends are not reportable to Revenue by the credit union. If anybody should feel unfairly treated it is other savers who have DIRT deducted irrespective of whether they are liable to pay income tax. Credit unions have an exemption from corporation tax. This is not the case with other mutual bodies such as building societies&mdash;</P>

      <P>I acknowledge that I am a member of a credit union. If the Minister clarified a few points, it would take the tension out of the debate. The Minister said in his amendment that he &ldquo;supports the Government's policy of exempting the income of credit unions from corporation tax&rdquo;. I do not know why that is included because credit unions are not liable for corporation tax. It is only included to confuse. Later in the amendment, he says he &ldquo;calls on the Minister for Finance [that is himself] to take account of these factors in his ongoing consideration of the Report of the Working Group.&rdquo;. Does he mean he will take account or that he will call on himself to take account? I wish he would take account. The Government amendment is only juggling with words to enable the now five Independent Members to vote against the Fine Gael motion. Our motion asks Dáil Éireann to instruct the Minister to table an amendment to the Finance Bill which would tax credit unions in accordance with the recommendations of the working group on taxation.</P>
      <P>It would not be too much to ask the Independent Members to support this motion. Credit unions are not profit making organisations. Other financial institutions deduct 24% DIRT tax which covers the liability of savers. Credit unions seek the same treatment for their savers except that sums up to £375 would be exempt. The Minister must recognise the voluntary efforts of the 15,000 members and directors of credit unions throughout the country, the efforts of the 1,500 people employed in them and the valuable service given by credit unions as a substitute for moneylenders which has affected a vulnerable section of our community.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the work done <Col N="938" /> by the thousands of volunteers who give their time free of charge in the interests of their neighbours and community and who, over the years, have built up the credit union movement. Many families would have had a bleak Christmas and a hungry start to this new millennium without the help of their local credit union. Without such a facility what would families on social welfare and low incomes do for First Communion, Confirmation and funeral expenses? They would be a long time waiting for the Minister for Finance to help them. The banks and building societies would not let many of these people inside the door and would force them into the claws of the moneylenders. By providing advice to people on low incomes in both rural parishes and urban disadvantaged areas, places where one would have to travel a long way to find a bank, credit unions are valuable in social terms.</P>
      <P>For the past two years the credit unions have sought a meeting with the Minister for Finance to seek an amendment to the Finance Bill so that returns on credit union savings are taxed in accordance with the recommendations of the working group. His refusal to meet with the Irish League of Credit Unions over the past two years is unprecedented in the history of this House. After two years, the league eventually secured a meeting with the Taoiseach, but only since this motion has been tabled. The Minister for Finance has delivered a budget for the well off and he is willing to meet their representatives, but he is unwilling to meet the organisation which is helping the less well off in society. He is truly Champagne Charlie. The credit unions seek a fair and equitable taxation system for their members who are being discriminated against at present.</P>

      <P>I appreciate and support the credit union movement. In my lifetime, and I am one of the senior Members of the House, I have seen a tremendous increase in living standards in this country. The significant factor has not been political developments but the development of the credit union movement, which is a movement for the people by the people and which benefits the entire country. We all know the tremendous assistance it gives to thousands of families, especially in providing money for education grants and university loans. This movement should be appreciated by the political world and should be developed and nurtured.</P>

    <P>I am loth to criticise my friend and punting pal, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. I would tell him if he were in the House that many Irish punters have been assisted on their way to Cheltenham by the credit unions and, when they lost their shirts there, the credit unions provided a net when they returned; in some cases, they sent money to Cheltenham to get them home on boats. I join with my colleagues in calling on the Minister and the Fianna Fáil backbenchers, who proved some months ago that they have balls, in demanding that the Government do a U-turn in the interests not only of their party but also of <Col N="939" /> the people and amend the Finance Bill which will be shortly before the House. I hope this will happen.</P>

I also compliment the courage of the spokespersons on the Government benches who, either out of mistaken loyalty, foolhardiness or a wish for preferment, spoke on behalf of the illogicality of the Minister's case.</P>
      <P>There are a number of facts which should be reasserted. It is a fact that credit union members are discriminated against. If one puts money in a building society or bank, it will be taxed at 20%. If one puts it in a credit union, it could be taxed at 44%, the highest marginal rate.</P>

      <P>It is a fact that the Minister for Finance has refused to meet the credit union movement for two years and that he continues to refuse to meet it despite the motion before the House. It is a fact that the European Commission examined a complaint more than one year ago and found there was no merit in its allegation that the credit union movement was in receipt of preferential treatment under tax law in this country. It is a fact that the Minister's amendment before the House reaffirms that his position on the taxation of credit unions is that which he published in the Finance Bill, 1998, which was rejected by the credit union movement at that stage and which the Minister was forced to withdraw. It is also a fact that the complaint which is now before the European Commission is exactly the same complaint as was already adjudicated upon, that the Commission has not even commenced to <Col N="940" /> investigate it for that reason and that, unless the complainant brings forward new information within the next ten days, it will be rejected without investigation.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that, if there were a free vote, this motion would be passed almost unanimously and the Minister would find himself in a very lonesome position. His backbenchers, who have privately agreed with the delegations from the credit unions who have met them, are publicly forced into a position of again defending the indefensible. They should have taken to the plinth. They would have had more success for their efforts if they were on the plinth during the week like they were when the Minister previously put them in an indefensible position on budget day before Christmas.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that the Independent Deputies have not spoken in this debate and that the four of them have not come into the House in the course of the debate. It is fact that they have not boxed to their weight in this debate and that they have settled for a meeting when we demand a fair and equitable tax regime for the credit union movement. Increasingly, the four Independents who support the Government remind me of the dog which used to play poker. They won a great deal of money at the start and were very effective, but the public realised after a while that, whenever the dog had a good hand, he began to wag his tail and give the game away. There is a touch of this about the four Independents. They huff and they puff on issues, but they have settled softly tonight. They have let down the credit union movement. However, I still have hope that at least one or maybe two of them will join the Opposition in the lobby tonight when the Minister's amendment is put. If they do not, I promise them another chance within the next three weeks because we will be moving an amendment to the Finance Bill to introduce a fair and equitable tax regime for the credit union movement. If they fail to jump the fence tonight, they will get another chance to jump it in the next few weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU fishing policy, which was negotiated in 1983, was a disaster for fishermen and women along the coastline. The implications are still being felt daily. The harbours in Balbriggan, Skerries and Lough Shinny were deemed to be surplus to requirements as far as Government national fishing policy was concerned. As a consequence, they were not upgraded and maintained. Today, the fishing industry in north Dublin consists of 19 small boats of an average size of 50 feet fishing for prawns and 11 fishing for razors. That contrasts with a thriving industry in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should put himself in the shoes of the fishermen. Last Friday evening they were <Col N="943" /> informed by one of the officials in his Department that on the following Monday, as a consequence of Commission regulation EC304/2000, they would be prohibited from fishing for prawns in their traditional area, which stretches from north of Bray to south of Dundalk. That was to take effect from 14 February until 30 April 2000. At the same time they were informed that, by way of derogation, provided they adhered to certain mesh sizes and other requirements, they could fish at a location some 2.5 hours journey time north east of Skerries. That is unrealistic. Having regard to the size of their boats, the journey time and the weather conditions, the boats and their crews would be at risk given the severe weather in that part of the Irish Sea at this time of the year. This news devastated the fishermen and their families, who in any event were finding it extremely difficult to earn a living. Many of them have young families and large mortgages on their homes and boats.</P>
    <P>The future of these few prawn fishermen lies in the balance due to circumstances outside their control, the need for the conservation of cod in the Irish Sea. People affected in other harbours may be able to pursue alternatives for the ten week period, given the size of their fleet, but the fishermen and women of Skerries, Lough Shinny and Balbriggan have no alternative to pursue during this period and such a prohibition from fishing may recur during the next four or five years.</P>
    <P>I accept that this deal, unacceptable as it for the fishermen in question, has been signed off at national and EU level. However, I appeal to the Minister, in the context of justice and inclusiveness, to arrange a meeting between his officials, himself and the representatives of the fishermen concerned to agree a formula to compensate this small sector of the fishing industry which has got such a raw deal over the years. Given what they have endured down through the years, they deserve nothing less. They look forward to the Minister and the Deputies in their constituency supporting what I have said and what my colleague, Deputy Sargent, will say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a ban on all fishing from 14 February to 30 April this year off the coast of Dublin, Meath and Louth to allow cod stocks to recover, fishermen in the tidal ports, like Balbriggan, Skerries and Lough Shinny must now steam at least two hours instead of the usual 35 minutes before they can shoot their nets. Without some financial assistance over the period of the ban, the Minister is forcing fishermen to make an impossible choice. They must either go fishing and compromise normal safety standards by going so far out to fish or tie up boats and forfeit their income for ten weeks, risking the permanent loss of crews who will be forced to find alternative employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apportioning compensation using log book returns would acknowledge in a fair way the hardship being caused by the Irish Sea cod recov<Col N="944" /> ery plan. However, observers and prawn fishermen and women continue to wonder why this cod conservation plan is affecting small prawn boats even worse than cod trawlers. Ninety foot to 100 foot pelagic trawlers can travel further and can continue fishing for cod outside the exclusion zone. Some of these bigger pelagic boats are changing their gear and using prawn nets. This will drive down the price of prawns, making a bad situation worse for the small prawn boats.</P>
    <P>Having met 25 of the 170 families affected outside the Dáil yesterday, I raised this matter on the Order of Business and with the Minister. I hope he has reflected overnight on the need to answer the concerns of these prawn fishermen and women who believe in conservation, as I and the Minister do, but who cannot live without any income for ten weeks. If the Minister is determined, as it appeared yesterday, to act like Margaret Thatcher by saying compensation is out, a meeting is out and even fishing for prawns is out, then the game plan in the Department is even more serious than the cod stock recovery plan alone. Unless the Minister is prepared to meet the fishermen and respond to their concerns, in effect, he is saying he wants to end fishing by 50 foot to 65 foot single riggers in the Irish Sea. The choice then for fishermen is to leave fishing or go into more debt by buying bigger boats to catch more fish by night as well as by day. How will this help the conservation of fish stocks?</P>
    <P>Last Friday the Minister launched a mega trawler for Mr. McHugh while his officials were on the docks in Balbriggan and Skerries delivering the devastating news that the ten week ban would come into operation with effect from last Monday. If Mr. McHugh wants to fish all year round off the coast of Africa, good luck to him, but the Minister's job is to protect the livelihoods of all fishermen, not to discriminate against smaller boats in favour of larger trawlers.</P>
    <P>This in-shore fishery is as important as a mountainside is to a farmer. Whereas on land there is &lsquo;set aside', headage payments and any manner of assistance, which is expected and normal, on the sea it seems the Minister is happy to throw these seafaring men and women to the proverbial sharks. I ask him to think twice about this, as this plan discriminates against smaller boats in favour of larger boats. In engaging in conservation, which I and all Members support, the Minister should not discriminate in that way. I ask him to meet the fishermen to redress their concerns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past decade the cod and whiting stocks in the Irish Sea have declined significantly and this has impacted negatively on east coast fishing communities. The situation has been getting progressively worse and the time has come to address it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest scientific assessment on the cod stock, which became available last November, indicated that the stock had declined dramatically and was in danger of total collapse. The cod stock <Col N="945" /> is now one quarter of what it was 20 years ago. Recruitment of young fish to the adult stock failed in 1997 and 1998 and the existing adult stock is almost entirely made up of fish spawned in 1996. Because there are very few young fish coming through, any fishing on the existing adult stock will further reduce the number of fish in Irish waters left to spawn in future years. There is now a real danger that this once valuable fishery will be totally wiped out.</P>
    <P>Given the drastic scientific advice and the need for responsible action to try to conserve and replenish this fishery, the December Fisheries Council decided that an Irish Sea cod recovery plan would have to be put in place early in the new year. The Council also agreed not to close the fishery totally and instead to put in place a reduced total allowable catch of 2,100 tonnes this year. The Commission also indicated that it would act independently, under its emergency powers, to introduce measures to protect adult spawning cod in the spring of this year. The objective of the Commission initiative would be to get as many eggs as possible from the existing adult cod stock so as to maximise the number of young fish for future years.</P>
    <P>To present a persuasive Irish position to the Commission before it acted, my Department issued a discussion paper to the Irish fishing industry in early January. This paper was subsequently discussed with east coast fishermen and following that meeting an Irish position paper was submitted to the Commission. A delegation, incorporating six Irish fishermen and their representatives, together with my Department, BIM and the Marine Institute met the Commission and other member states on 21 February to discuss the Commission proposals. At that meeting there was broad agreement on the areas which had to be closed to protect adult spawning cod. The Commission expressed strong concern about high by-catches of cod in the prawn fisheries where spawning cod are congregating. It proposed closing a large area of the western Irish Sea for prawn fishing during the cod spawning season. Given the dependence of many east coast Irish fishermen on prawn fishing, the Irish delegation sought to keep as much as possible of the prawn fishery open. The delegation pressed this issue and the Commission eventually conceded to keep the bulk of the prawn grounds open. A small area of prawn ground overlapped with the biggest concentration of spawning cod in the Irish Sea and the Commission insisted on closing this for the ten week period.</P>
    <P>The Commission legislation closing the cod fishery was published last Friday. My Department immediately informed the industry and BIM is circulating an explanatory laminated map to fishermen on the new provisions. The Commission proposal will not have an undue impact on the east coast fishermen overall and should help to secure a future cod fishery for these fishermen.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the prawn grounds in the Irish Sea <Col N="946" /> will remain open to the prawn fishermen. I met the Balbriggan and Skerries prawn fishermen and I accept that in order to protect spawning cod, prawn fishermen in Balbriggan and Skerries will, for the next ten weeks, have to steam for an extra half hour to get to the prawn grounds. However, they are free to continue prawn fishing and this was our objective in these discussions. The new arrangements will, in the interests of conservation, cause these fishermen some limited disturbance. These measures help to secure a future for these fishermen, whereas inaction would only lead to the continued decline of fishing communities.</P>
    <P>Discussions on the measures which the Commission will seek to apply following the conclusion of the spawning season are about to commence. I have assured the prawn fishermen that they will have a place at the table in these discussions and have invited them to a meeting in my Department next week. I hope these conservation measures can be built on in partnership with the industry to secure a brighter future for east coast fishermen.</P>
    <P>I wish to inform Deputy Sargent that I, along with Deputy Wright, met fishermen yesterday and we had a full and frank discussion. I explained to them the difficulties with which I am faced, namely, that the Commission had already taken its decision and we were left with no choice in respect of implementing it. I assured them that in terms of future conservation measures we will try to take on board their requirements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent informed me how I should go about doing my job. I have no difficulty with that but it is the highest level of hypocrisy for the Deputy, who represents the Green Party which supposedly stands for conservation&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday, at the launch of Daffodil Day, Dr. Michael Moriarty, who is consultant radiotherapist at St. Luke's Hospital, painted a grim picture <Col N="947" /> regarding the availability of radiotherapy services in Ireland. During his presentation he said that on average only 16% of cancer patients are receiving radiotherapy, despite the fact that up to 50% of patients could benefit from it.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time in recent months that the inadequacy of our radiotherapy facilities has been raised. The consultant radiotherapist at Cork University Hospital, Seamus Cathil, also recently drew attention to inadequate treatment facilities. He went so far as to state that up to 1,000 people are dying because of inadequate treatment.</P>
    <P>While I accept that considerable progress has been made since 1996 with the launch of the national cancer strategy, the issues that have been raised by these eminent consultants who work specifically in the areas of cancer treatment should be taken seriously. Compared with the 16% of Irish cancer patients who receive radiotherapy, an average of 66% of patients receive such treatment in the EU. This gulf is an indication of the long way we have to go before we even approach the EU treatment average.</P>
    <P>In raising the inadequacy of radiotherapy services in Ireland, I do not wish to cause alarm. Indeed, Dr. Moriarty acknowledged that plans to develop radiotherapy services in Cork, Galway and Dublin are welcome. Nevertheless, he warned that there is a need for better planning in the provision of radiological services to ensure that treatments are not disrupted because of machine depreciation or breakdowns. Not alone would better planning contribute to an increase in capacity of existing facilities, but disruptions in treatment can be extremely distressful for patients.</P>
    <P>Right across our health services there are inadequacies and shortcomings. Hospital waiting lists for vital operations are now at crisis levels. However, most patients with cancer simply cannot wait. The stress and worry which is brought on by a cancer diagnostic must be minimised at every level. Waiting lists for cancer treatments in the Southern Health Board are now down to six weeks, but six weeks is too long for a cancer patient. Our objective in developing our cancer services should be zero waiting times. We should be in a position to offer cancer patients all treatment options which may benefit them in the shortest possible timeframe.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer in general to the other cancer treatments on which Dr. Moriarty commented yesterday. For example, let us take bowel cancer. Irish men have the highest rate of bowel cancer in the EU, yet we do not operate a structured screening programme to ensure early detection and treatment. Screening is a vital process in tackling cancer. Early detection results in better treatments and this message must be brought home to every member of our adult population. However, until we offer nationwide screening services which are accessible to everyone, the importance of screening will continue to be over<Col N="948" /> looked. While I welcome the commencement of the national breast screening programme in the Eastern, Midland and North Eastern Health Board areas, I believe it should be mainstreamed and extended to all health boards.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute everyone working in the delivery of cancer treatments and support services. In particular, Dr. Moriarty at St. Luke's has a tremendous record of patient care and the inadequacies he highlighted in our cancer care services should be taken very seriously. I also take this opportunity to wish the Irish Cancer Society every success with Daffodil Day on 24 March. The quality and availability of the services established under the Daffodil Day initiative are greatly valuable and have provided great comfort and relief to those who have used them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I spoke with Dr. Moriarty yesterday at the press launch for Daffodil Day and we had a good discussion in respect of the progress that has been made and in terms of our future plans.</P>
      <P>This debate affords me an opportunity to outline the major investment the Government is making in the development of radiotherapy services in the context of an agreed strategy based on a firm assessment of need. Against the background of some recent critical comment, it is important to reassure patients, potential patients and their families of the capacity of radiotherapy services here to respond to their needs and of the Government's continuing efforts to ensure that the development of services keeps pace with demand.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a number of important points regarding cancer treatment services in this country. The national cancer strategy, which was published in November 1996 and followed in March 1997 by a three year action plan for its implementation, identified two principle objectives &ndash; to take all measures possible to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer in line with the targets established in the health strategy &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo; and to ensure that those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment and that their quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible. Underlying these objectives is the need for a high quality, patient-focused service. One of the specific objectives of the strategy is to ensure that all patients have access to an equitable effective service with a uniformly high quality of care wherever they live.</P>
      <P>Since the commencement of the implementation of the strategy in 1997, £40 million of dedicated funding has been allocated to the development of cancer services nationally. This investment has resulted in additional consultant appointments in the areas of medical oncology, haematology, histopathology and palliative care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Radiotherapy is a highly specialised and capital intensive service requiring specialist personnel, including, for example, therapeutic radiogra<Col N="949" /> phers, nurses with training in oncology and technical and engineering support staff. A minimum throughput of patients is required in order to maintain and develop the specialist skills required for the service. Because of these considerations and the complexity of radiotherapy services, the national cancer strategy recommended that radiotherapy services should be provided from two supra-regional centres. The two centres currently providing radiotherapy services to cancer patients are St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin, and Cork University Hospital. The strategy recommended that the case for providing a radiotherapy service from a third supra-regional centre at Galway should be kept under review. I am pleased to report that the Government acted quickly in accessing that case and took the decision to provide the service at Galway at an estimated cost of £10 million. The radiotherapy services in Galway will be provided as part of the overall phase two development at the hospital. This is currently out to tender with a view to construction work commencing in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>In addition to this major investment in new radiotherapy facilities, existing services have also been benefiting from a major injection of resources. I recently announced an important investment in radiotherapy and other cancer services in Cork University Hospital with the allocation of £12.5 million for this purpose. The development will include a chemotherapy day unit, two state of the art linear accelerators and advanced CT simulation facilities. Together with approval for the appointment of two consultant medical oncologists, the improvements will ensure that the service for cancer patients in this area is in line with the best available internationally.</P>
    <P>The State's largest radiotherapy centre at St. Luke's and St. Anne's hospital opened in June 1998 having undergone a major redevelopment funded by capital investment of over £20 million. Last year two additional consultant radiotherapists were appointed to the hospital as part of the ongoing process of developing services.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the need for further investment in cancer services and will continue to identify this as a priority for my tenure in office. To date the national cancer strategy has achieved the widespread enhancement of the range and quality of cancer services available, and a major improvement in equity of access to these services. We must continue to look ahead and to examine ways of building on the success to date by continual improvement and investment. In this regard I have received a proposal from the National Cancer Forum to establish an expert review group to examine the appropriate further development of radiotherapy services. It is my intention to act on this proposal and to quickly put arrangements in place for the establishment of such an expert group.</P>
    <P>I cannot over-emphasise my commitment to the further development of cancer services. Cancer is a scourge on this society as on all others. While it must be recognised that significant pro<Col N="950" /> gress has been made in the development of our infrastructure and services for the treatment and prevention of the disease, I am equally aware of the need for a continued concerted effort in this area. It is my intention to work with the National Cancer Forum which is the correct vehicle to further develop cancer services. A structure is in place to deal with the assessment of need and the proper logical development of facilities, infrastructures and services. Great progress has been made and we will continue to ensure that people requiring cancer treatment services will have a high quality, equitable service available to them which matches the best available anywhere in the world.</P>

      <P>The bridge which crosses the River Feale at Finuge, north Kerry, has shown signs of structural distress for a number of years and its condition has become critical. Last October a preliminary report by Malone, Regan, McGillicuddy concluded that the bridge deck and abutments have extensively deteriorated leading to the reduction in the load capacity. A weight restriction of 1.5 tonnes has been imposed for a number of years and the bridge has recently been physically restricted in width to 2.3 metres.</P>
      <P>The bridge is located on the northern side of Finuge village on the L6050, about four kilometres west of Listowel. Its location is extremely strategic as it is an alternative access and exit point to Listowel from Tralee, and <i>vice versa.</i> A considerable amount of the housing development in Listowel is occurring on the western side and traffic from these developments, if travelling towards Tralee or south Kerry, avoids the traffic problems in Listowel by travelling the four kilometres to cross the River Feale at Finuge and joining to R557 leading to Tralee at the village, about one kilometre south of the bridge.</P>
      <P>There is also significant development in the townlands of Killocrim, Coolagowan, Ennismore, Gortnaminch and the village of Finuge adjacent to the bridge and people use the bridge to get to Tralee and south Kerry. The alternative is to travel through Listowel which adds about ten kilometres to the journey, taking an additional 30 to 60 minutes depending on the time of year. During the tourism season it can take up to 60 minutes or more to make a round trip. This is disastrous for the ten to 15 farmers with land on both sides of the river. A diversion through Listowel would be a financial burden on these farmers in terms of time lost and so on. A number of people also draw turf over the bridge from Ennismore bog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two recent traffic counts indicated that about 300 vehicles cross the bridge each day, about 25% of which are light goods vehicles or agricultural machinery. In the event of the bridge closing, these vehicles would have to travel through Listowel, adding to existing traffic problems in the town. Even if the bridge was restricted to cars only, the 70 or so goods or agricultural vehicles <Col N="951" /> would cause additional traffic congestion in Listowel.</P>
    <P>The recent development of a relief road along a disused railway track skirting the northern edge of Listowel and terminating at the Listowel-Ballybunion road, west of the town, has given traffic travelling from Limerick along the N69 the option of bypassing the town by continuing west along the Greenville Road and crossing the Finuge bridge to travel to Tralee <i>via</i> the R557.</P>
    <P>The Finuge bridge is one of only four bridges crossing the River Feale in County Kerry and its location and proximity to Listowel mean that it contributes significantly to reducing the volume of traffic travelling through the town and crossing the big bridge, reducing traffic congestion and tailbacks. The cost of the reinstatement of the bridge is estimated at about £500,000 and I urge the Minister to convey my request to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to provide this funding as a matter of urgency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall grant allocation to Kerry County Council for non-national roads in 2000 is £10.5 million which represents an increase of 7% on the initial 1999 allocation of £9.8 million. These grants are made available in a number of categories, namely, discretionary grants, restoration grants and specific improvement grants. Furthermore, Kerry County Council has estimated that it <Col N="952" /> should have in the region of £1.8 million available this year from its own resources. This would mean that almost £12 million would be available to the council for non-national roads in 2000.</P>
    <P>Kerry County Council's application for funding in 2000 under the specific improvement grants scheme included an application for funding of £250,000 for Finuge bridge. This application, together with all others under the specific improvements scheme, was considered in the Department having regard to their compliance eligibility criteria, the need to prioritise projects, competing demands from other local authorities and funds available for the scheme in 2000. In the event, this project was not among the projects selected for funding. However, Kerry County Council has received an allocation of £2.4 million in 2000 for 12 of the 14 non-national road projects for which it sought funding under the specific improvement grant scheme.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree that these arrangements represent a reasonable approach in 2000 with significantly increased grants being made available to Kerry County Council. The Minister is satisfied that the increased resources available this year will equip all local authorities, including Kerry County Council, to deal satisfactorily with their ongoing and special needs.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the case made by Deputy Deenihan about the strategic importance of this bridge for the town of Listowel. I am happy to bring the points he made to the attention of the Minister with a view to action being taken next year.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.22 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 17 February 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The creation of the institutions in December was not only a major step forward in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, it also brought immediate and tangible benefits to the people of Northern Ireland and the island as a whole.</P>
      <P>For the first time, an Executive in Northern Ireland, fully representative of both communities, has been taking decisions and implementing policy on behalf of people to whom it is directly accountable. The Assembly has been working well, debating issues, scrutinising the work of Ministers, and fulfilling its role as a legislative body. Through the North-South Ministerial Council, and building on the success of its inaugural meeting in Armagh on 13 December, Ministers from North and South have been carrying forward important work in their meetings in sectoral format, four of which have now taken place. The Implementation Bodies have made an impressive start to tackling their areas of responsibility. The British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference have identified and agreed key areas which will constitute their initial programmes of work.</P>
      <P>Given this rapid and encouraging start, it is particularly disappointing and frustrating that the operation of the Assembly and the Executive has been suspended, and the IRA representative has withdrawn from engagement with the International Commission on Decommissioning.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that the Taoiseach and I, together with our officials, did all in our power to avoid suspension. Following receipt of the progress report of the commission on 31 January, we engaged in an intensive series of meetings and contacts with the British Government and with all of the relevant parties, beginning with my meeting in Dublin with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 1 February.</P>
      <P>As a result of those discussions, and in particular those between the Government and Sinn Féin, the international commission was able to make a positive and significant report to the two Governments on 11 February. However, as the House will be aware, the presentation of that report coincided with the suspension of the Executive and Assembly.</P>
      <P>This is undoubtedly a grave setback but, rather than spending valuable time seeking to apportion blame, we must continue to channel all of our energies into securing the earliest possible restoration of the operation of the institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This afternoon the Taoiseach is meeting Prime Minister Blair in London, and they will both meet representatives of the SDLP, the UUP and Sinn <Col N="954" /> Féin. On Monday I had two meetings with the Secretary of State in Belfast in which we took stock of the present situation and agreed the necessity to move forward as quickly as possible. Since the start of the week I have also met all of the pro-Agreement parties in the Assembly &ndash; Sinn Féin, the UUP, the Alliance Party, the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition and the Progressive Unionist Party and, together with the Taoiseach, the SDLP. In all of these meetings I have been struck by the clear determination on all sides to find a speedy resolution to our current difficulties.</P>
    <P>That is the positive side. However, it is clear to me that there is a continuing and large deficit of trust. All parties will need assurance that the Agreement, in all of its aspects, is going to be implemented in full.</P>
    <P>As we work to secure progress, it is worth recalling the words of Senator Mitchell on publication of his final report in November when he stated that the one thing which is certain is that, without the institutions, there will be no decommissioning. The fact that the IRA representative will not for now engage further with the commission is deeply regrettable and disappointing. Senator Mitchell also observed that prolonging the stalemate will leave society in the North uncertain and vulnerable. That remains the case. The recent bomb in Irvinestown is a stark reminder that there are still those who would seek to bring down the Agreement and who stand ready to fill any political vacuum that we allow develop.</P>
    <P>We urgently need to bring the institutions back into operation &ndash; they are central to the Agreement &ndash; and the IRA must also re-engage with the international commission. The operation of the institutions has been an unqualified success. They make many things, including decommissioning, possible. I know that all of the parties are genuine and sincere in their wish to make early progress, but they, with the Governments, must now redouble their efforts and stretch their respective constituencies to the maximum.</P>

      <P>I understand this question refers to reports by Amnesty International of the detention by the authorities in Ecuador last month of a number of political and trade union figures who had reportedly called for the resignation of the then President of Ecuador, Jamil Mahuad. These detentions took place against a background of the reimposition of a general state of emergency by President Mahuad on 5 January 2000 following demonstrations by trade unions and indigenous groups against his Government's economic poli<Col N="955" /> cies and the acute distress affecting so many people as a result of the economic crisis in Ecuador.</P>
      <P>The owners of taxis, buses and trucks called a strike to press the Government to take on some of their obligations under hire purchase contracts, which had become unsustainable as a result of exchange rate changes arising from the complex role of the dollar in the Ecuadorian economy. The strike took place only in the province of Guayas where a state of emergency was actually already in place because of a sharp rise in crimes of assault and robbery. The strike was accompanied by unrest in the streets of Guayaquil. During the disturbances, a number of the strike leaders were detained. My information is that they were released unharmed a few days later.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 25, 28, 36, 41, 43, 56 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>The formation of a coalition Government in Austria which includes the far-right Freedom Party has given rise to a great deal of concern not only within the European Union but also more widely. The Government shares that concern.</P>
      <P>We regret that the efforts which were made in the period following the Austrian general election on 3 October to form a Government that did not include the Freedom Party were unsuccessful. In support of these efforts, and after full consultation with other EU partners at prime ministerial level, the Portuguese Presidency issued a statement on 31 January on behalf of the 14 setting out clearly the joint action that would be taken by all those member states in the event that an Austrian coalition Government including the far-right Freedom Party would be formed. The measures outlined were that the 14 would not promote or accept any ministerial contacts with a Government which included the Freedom Party, that there would be no support for Austrian candidates seeking positions in international organisations and that Austrian ambassadors in EU capitals would be received at official but not ministerial level.</P>
      <P>Following the formation of the new Government on 4 February, the agreed measures relating to the bilateral relations between each member state and Austria came into effect. They do not touch on the conduct of EU business, nor on the standing of Austria as a member state of the European Union. The European Union, as such, has not taken any action against Austria &ndash; nor, indeed, would it have been empowered to do so. The EU Commission has made its concerns known but, as the measures affect only bilateral relations with Austria, there is no question of asking the Commission to subscribe to the measures taken by the 14 member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was incumbent on the other EU member states to set out clearly their views in advance to the Austrian political parties concerned of what the consequences of their action would be. The EU is more than an economic or political community &ndash; it is bound together by shared values of democracy, human rights, rule of law and tolerance. The reaction of the 14 member states of the <Col N="957" /> EU was measured, it reflected the strong commitment to fundamental values and norms which underpin the social and political fabric of Europe today.</P>
    <P>Prior to the formation of the new coalition Government on 4 February the Government here conveyed to the Austrian authorities the importance we attach to the common European values of democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. At the same time we have stressed the importance we attach to our relations with Austria and its people. We have kept in touch with the Austrian authorities at official level and with the Portuguese Presidency of the EU at both ministerial and official level. On 4 February, the day the new Government was formed, acting in my capacity as chairman in office of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, I joined with Lord Russell-Johnston, the President of the Parliamentary Assembly, and Walter Schwimmer, the Secretary General, to issue a statement stressing that the new Austrian Government would be judged on its policies, declarations and actions. These will be carefully scrutinised by the organs of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>The new Austrian Foreign Minister, Dr. Benita Ferrero-Waldner, attended the EU General Affairs Council in Brussels last Monday. Although I was unable to attend the discussions which took place over lunch, as I had to fly to Belfast for an urgent meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, I understand that Dr. Ferrero-Waldner stressed her Government's commitment to the terms of a joint declaration signed by Mr. Schussel, leader of the Peoples Party and Mr. Haider, leader of the Freedom Party. This declaration, the terms of which I warmly welcome, reaffirms the adherence of the Austrian Government to the values that underpin the common European heritage including individual freedom, political liberty and the rule of law. Dr. Ferrero-Waldner asked that the new Government should be judged by its policies and actions.</P>
    <P>On the question of EU enlargement, I am aware of the position taken by the Freedom Party when in Opposition. However, I note that the new Administration, in its programme for government, committed itself to the European Union, the deepening of its integration and its enlargement. The new Chancellor, Mr. Schussel, was as the outgoing Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister closely involved in the enlargement process. In this area, too, we will judge the new Government by both its policies and its actions.</P>

Schengen is a separate intergovernmental framework of co-operation which has developed outside the EC-EU Treaty framework and began in 1985 when a group of European countries decided to shift the emphasis from internal border controls to external border controls, so as to create an area of free movement within a single secure external border.</P>
      <P>Agreement to incorporate Schengen into the European Union framework was reached at the intergovernmental conference which culminated in the signing of the Amsterdam Treaty on 2 October 1997. Incorporation of the Schengen Agreements into the EU framework took place on entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May 1999.</P>
      <P>By virtue of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Schengen Protocol, Ireland is not subject to the automatic application of the Schengen <i>acquis</i> post its incorporation into the EU framework. However, the Treaty of Amsterdam provides that Ireland and the UK will be able to take part in Schengen co-operation if they wish. Ireland submitted a declaration at the time of signature of the Treaty that it intended to participate to the maximum possible extent in these provisions, subject to the requirements of the common travel area with the UK.</P>
      <P>A formal written application from the United Kingdom to opt into certain sections of Schengen was submitted on 20 May 1999 and it is now under consideration within the JHA Council framework.  Ireland has indicated that it proposed to opt in to similar provisions to the UK, although not necessarily the same ones. Our application to participate in Schengen has not yet been tabled; it is currently under consideration in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 81 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" /> Recent allegations that there has been widespread and systematic interception of Irish telecommunications have been raised with the British authorities on a number of occasions at both official and ministerial level. I refer Deputies to replies to previous questions on this subject answered on 29 September and 2 November last.</P>
    <P>The ambassador in London has had three meetings to discuss these allegations with the most senior Foreign Office official responsible for defence and security matters. These took place on 26 July, 12 October and 10 January. The ambassador expressed the concern of the Government, the Oireachtas and the public at the allegations, and received considerable clarification of the legal regime under which interception of communications is carried out.</P>
    <P>On 24 January, my predecessor as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, met the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Robin Cook MP, in Brussels to discuss this matter. The allegation of widespread interception was the single item on the agenda.</P>
    <P>The Minister conveyed the concern of the Government and the Oireachtas. He asked for assurances that no blanket interception was taking place and that no interception was taking place for purely commercial reasons or reasons of economic advantage.</P>
    <P>The Foreign Secretary said that, because of security considerations, it was British policy never to confirm or deny any specific allegation. However, huge misconceptions existed about the scope of British interception activity generally. The area was tightly regulated and was controlled by Ministers personally through issuing warrants in accordance with the criteria laid down by statute. The particular focus of interception was the threat of terrorism.</P>
    <P>Following discussion between both Ministers on the scope of the Act, the Foreign Secretary said the Minister could be assured that there was no question of the law permitting indiscriminate interception.</P>
    <P>In a statement to the press following the meeting, the Minister indicated that he had no reason to believe, on the basis of his discussions with the Foreign Secretary, that the allegations relating to blanket interception and to interception for commercial advantages were well founded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's total opposition to the use of the death <Col N="960" /> penalty is well known. The Government is committed to availing of every suitable opportunity to press for the abolition of capital punishment. It is our view that the abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights.</P>
      <P>The decision by Turkey's appeals court on 25 November 1999 to uphold the death sentence against Abdullah Öcalan led to widespread international appeals, including by the European Union, to spare Mr. Öcalan's life. The Turkish Government decided on 12 January to postpone the transmission of Mr. Öcalan's case to the Turkish Parliament until the European Court of Human Rights had completed its consideration of the case. It is understood that this process may take up to 18 months.</P>
      <P>Ireland strongly supports the appeals to Turkey not to execute Mr. Öcalan, and our view has been put to the Turkish authorities on numerous occasions, both bilaterally and on the occasion of EU &ndash; Turkey contacts. My predecessor, Deputy Andrews, communicated our views against the death penalty directly to the then Speaker of the Turkish Grand National Assembly during his visit to Dublin last March. He responded to our concerns positively.</P>
      <P>I will continue to follow proceedings in the Öcalan case with the closest attention, and will avail of an early opportunity to reiterate Ireland's opposition to the use of the death penalty, in this and in all other cases, to the Turkish authorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 86 and 94 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> The situation in Burma is a matter of profound concern to the Government and to the EU. The military regime has failed to respect the results of the last elections which were held there. It has since imposed measures to hinder the activities of political parties and the development of a civil society, and is doing nothing to ease these measures.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the findings of various UN inquiries, including those to which the Deputy refers, which describe the unacceptable situation. The Burmese military regime has failed to act on the recommendations of subsequent resolutions in both the Commission of Human Rights and the General Assembly of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>How can this situation be changed? The European Union remains convinced that a solution will be found only when the military regime decides to enter into meaningful dialogue with Madam Aung San Suu Kyi and other leaders of the National League for Democracy.</P>
    <P>This is the background to the common position which the European Union first defined on Burma in October 1996. The terms of the common position contain a number of sanctions against the regime and its members. In view of the failure of the Burmese regime to respond constructively to its terms, the common position has been extended repeatedly for a number of six month periods, with the most recent extension dating from October 1999.</P>
    <P>The EU has also sought to persuade the Burmese military regime to engage in dialogue with the National League for Democracy by suggesting to it various practical steps and confidence building measures which could start this process. An evaluation of the response of the regime &ndash; which so far has been disappointing &ndash; will take place when the common position is reviewed in April. In the light of the situation, I shall urge that the next review should be comprehensive.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 31, 44, 46, 102, 105 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the recent survey and of its verification of the strong popular support for development aid. I am aware too of The Reality of Aid report referred to.</P>
      <P>The position on the question of aid allocations is that we have for many years accepted the United Nations target for aid volumes of 0.7% of gross national product. We accept too that, despite very high annual cash growth in the programme, the rate of increase in GNP since 1996 and the mathematical impact of introducing a new method for calculating GNP have effectively slowed progress to the UN target. However, it is undeniable that official development assistance has grown hugely in volume terms, from £40 million in 1992 to £178 million in 1999, a fact that has been acknowledged by our donor peers and our partner countries in Africa. In addition, a review of the aid programme carried out in 1999 verified the Irish commitment to quality and sustainability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, nevertheless, concerned at the slowdown in momentum to the UN target. I am determined that at this time of the greatest economic growth <Col N="963" /> in our history we should not allow the aid programme to diminish as a proportion of our wealth. We must not forget our shared obligation as a wealthy nation to those whose poverty has no parallel in Ireland.</P>
    <P>To address the issue of aid allocations, a review has been carried out in my Department and proposals have been prepared for Cabinet consideration with a view to establishing an acceptable trajectory to the UN goal. I would hope to have a decision on the matter in a month or two.</P>
    <P>With regard to the questions seeking geographic information on the programme and on the channels through which spending is directed, I would point out that the latest information available was given in detail in a reply to a number of questions on 2 December last. These are available in the Official Report as well as in the annual reports of Irish aid, which were placed in the Library of the House.</P>
    <P>On the question of a legislative basis for aid allocations, while not rejecting the idea, I would question its need. The purpose of such a move would be to guarantee increased allocations, but since the Government is committed to substantial increases that purpose is achieved.</P>

      <P>As of 31 January 2000, Ireland was owed IR£9,338,858 for the cost of providing Irish personnel to United Nations peacekeeping missions abroad. The only missions for which Ireland is currently entitled to reimbursement of troop costs by the UN are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, and the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, UNFICYP. During 1999, the UN repaid arrears of approximately £5.5 million to Ireland, almost entirely in respect of UNIFIL.</P>
      <P>Continuous efforts are made by the Department of Foreign Affairs to recover moneys owed from the United Nations. The Department, through the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations, makes ongoing representations to the United Nations headquarters in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial crisis which hinders the UN from paying outstanding moneys is a direct result of the failure by many member states, in particular the US, to pay their assessed contributions to the <Col N="964" /> UN regular and peacekeeping budgets in full and on time. This situation has resulted in a serious day-to-day UN cash flow problem. Ireland and its EU partners have strenuously argued that all UN member states must honour their financial obligations.</P>
    <P>The US is the major debtor and any improvement in its arrears would ease the situation considerably. The United States Administration has now tabled a plan agreed with Congress to deal with the arrears problem which also contains proposals for reform of the UN financing system. Detailed negotiations on these matters are due to commence at the United Nations in mid-March and Ireland, together with our EU partners, will participate constructively in the process.</P>
    <P>A successful outcome to the UN financial crisis will lead to a reduction and eventual clearance of debts owing to Ireland and other troop contributing countries. In the meantime Ireland's permanent mission to the UN in New York will continue to actively pursue the outstanding amounts of arrears.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the current accession process was launched by the 15 EU member states, the ten central and eastern European states and Cyprus on 30 March 1998. The following day, actual negotiations were inaugurated with the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Cyprus. These countries are often referred to as the &ldquo;ins or 5+1&rdquo;. Negotiations have continued with these countries since then on a policy chapter basis.</P>
      <P>At the same time, a preparatory process for negotiations continued with the other original applicants, the so-called &ldquo;pre-ins&rdquo;&ndash; Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia. Malta joined this group in 1999.</P>
      <P>Based upon recommendations from the Commission, the Helsinki European Council on 10 December 1999 decided that the &ldquo;pre-ins&rdquo;, including Malta, had reached such a level of preparation that accession negotiations could be opened in 2000. These negotiations began formally in Brussels on 15 February 2000. Actual substantive negotiations will start in March. The European Council also decided that the accession negotiation process for all 12 accession countries should be on an equal footing and that each should proceed on the basis of its own merits and level of preparedness.</P>
      <P>Importantly, the Helsinki European Council affirmed that the European Union should be in a position to welcome new member states from the end of 2002, as soon as they have demonstrated their ability to assume the obligations of membership and once the negotiating process has been successfully completed.</P>
      <P>The Helsinki European Council granted candidate status and an intensified pre-negotiation relationship with the EU to Turkey. Turkey will now benefit from a pre-accession strategy to stimulate and support its reforms. Significantly, this will entail a political dialogue with a particular emphasis on human rights. Actual accession negotiations cannot begin with Turkey until that country fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria. These rigorous criteria of democracy, human rights, protection of minorities and the rule of law are the same for Turkey as for all other applicant countries.</P>

      <P>The Government is totally opposed to the use of the <Col N="967" /> death penalty. We believe its abolition contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights. I will, therefore, avail of every suitable opportunity to press for this.</P>
      <P>In June 1998, common guidelines for EU initiatives on the issue of the death penalty were agreed and adopted by EU Foreign Ministers. These guidelines state that, where the death penalty still exists, the EU will continue to press for its use to be progressively restricted and for moratoria to be introduced. A declaration by the Presidency on behalf of the European Union welcoming the introduction of a moratorium on executions in the US state of Illinois was recently issued. In addition to interventions on the use of the death penalty in principle, it has also been agreed that, where individual cases violate basic minimum standards, the Union will consider making a specific intervention. It is our strongly held belief that an EU intervention carries greater force than individual bilateral approaches by national Governments.</P>
      <P>Following the adoption of these guidelines, the EU's collective efforts have continued to focus on promoting universal abolition of the death penalty. We have pressed for abolition and have issued <i>démarches</i> on the use of the death penalty in a number of countries, including the United States.</P>
      <P>The EU, with the full support of Ireland, recently made humanitarian appeals for the commutation of the death sentences of a number of individuals in the US, including on behalf of Mr. Douglas C. Thomas who was executed on 10 January, and Mr. Steve Roach, who was executed on 15 January. Consideration is currently being given within the EU to ways in which the EU approach to the death penalty in the US might be more effective. Ireland is playing a full part in these considerations.</P>
      <P>Discussion is at an advanced stage within the EU on tabling a resolution on the question of the death penalty at the forthcoming 56th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. Ireland will work to ensure maximum support for this resolution.</P>

      <P>The stability pact for South East Europe, an initiative of the European Union, was formally launched at a meeting of heads of Government in Sarajevo in July last. It represents the collective effort of the European Union, the G8 countries, the countries of the region and key international organisations to address the challenges of south eastern Europe in a co-ordinated and strategic manner.</P>
      <P>The pact aims at strengthening the countries in south eastern Europe in their efforts to foster peace, democracy, respect for human rights and economic prosperity in order to achieve stability in the whole region.</P>
      <P>The pact works through a regional table, chaired by a special co-ordinator, currently Mr. Bodo Hombach of Germany, and three working tables. These are table 1 which deals with issues of democratisation and human rights; table 2 which deals with economic reconstruction, developments and co-operation and table 3 which deals with security issues.</P>
      <P>The regional table and all three working tables met during last autumn and agreed the outlines of a work programme in their specialised areas. Work on these programmes with a view to identifying suitable projects for implementation under the pact has been going on in various task forces and other specialised groups over the last few months and it is expected that the second round of meetings of the working tables which are being held this month will further refine the work programmes and agree a number of projects which will receive the support of the stability pact. A financing conference is due to be held at the end of March to raise financial support of the approved projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is represented on the regional table and is participating in the work of the three working tables. We believe that it is important that significant progress be made at the current round of working table meetings and in this context we believe that it is preferable at this early stage of a programme that is likely to run for many years to concentrate on a small number of projects which can be implemented quickly. While we are under no illusions about the difficulties and extent of the tasks which still lie ahead to reconstruct and rehabilitate the territory and give it a stable future we hope that the stability pact is set<Col N="969" /> ting this process in train and on an irreversible course. Ireland will contribute fully to this process as it develops both in terms of personnel and finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>My predecessor, Deputy Andrews, visited the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on 19 and 20 January. During his visit Deputy Andrews had a meeting with the Macedonian Foreign Minister Aleksandar Dimitrov and paid courtesy calls on the Prime Minister, the Vice-President of the National Assembly and the President. The visit by Deputy Andrews was the first official visit by an Irish Foreign Minister to FYROM.</P>
      <P>The visit took place at the end of an extensive visit by Deputy Andrews to the region and provided an opportunity for an exchange of views on developments in the Balkans generally, including in Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina and progress in the implementation of the stability pact. They also discussed enhancement of bilateral relations particularly in the economic area and the overall relationship between the EU and FYROM. Deputy Andrews also raised with his counterpart Ireland's candidacy for the UN Security Council and was gratified by the public statement of support for our candidacy made to the press following the meeting by Mr. Dimitrov.</P>
      <P>The major issue of concern to the Macedonian side at the time of the visit was agreement in Brussels on the mandate for the negotiation of a stability and association agreement between the EU and Macedonia. This was raised by all four interlocutors and the Minister assured his hosts of Ireland's support for Macedonia. I am pleased to be able to report that the mandate was subsequently agreed at the General Affairs Council on 24 January and Deputy Andrews phoned Foreign Minister Dimitrov to convey this information to him. This will be the first such agreement to be concluded with a former Yugoslav state and will provide the basis for a programme of assistance from the EU to Macedonia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Andrew's Macedonian counterparts particularly emphasised the economic impact which the war in Kosovo and the continuing instability in the region generally is having on FYROM. The war and its aftermath was estimated to have damaged the Macedonian economy to the extent of $650 million. They were disappointed at the response of the international community to date in spite of the many promises made during the Kosovo war. They expressed concern at the delays as they saw it in the implementation of the stability pact and sought <Col N="970" /> Ireland's support for urgent progress to be made in the next round of meetings of the stability pact being held this month.</P>
    <P>The Macedonian side expressed considerable interest in learning from Ireland's experience of economic development. They were interested in attracting foreign investment to their country, including from Ireland. Reviewing bilateral relations, it was noted that while the overall balance of trade was in Ireland's favour, total trade was at such a low level as to be insignificant. They proposed the negotiation of an investment protection agreement and a double taxation agreement with Ireland and this proposal is now being examined at official level. The possibility of sending a number of civil servants from FYROM to Ireland for training in the economic area was mentioned and this will be followed up by the Macedonian ambassador in London.</P>
    <P>Both sides agreed that there should be an intensification of relations between our two countries and in this context, Deputy Andrews invited his counterpart to visit Ireland at an early date. At the meeting with the Vice-President of the National Assembly, the possibility of an exchange of visits by parliamentary delegations was mentioned and this is a proposal I would encourage the Oireachtas to consider. The possibility of visits by the Prime Minister and President of Macedonia in due course was also mentioned.</P>
    <P>Macedonia is a beacon of light in the Balkan region. It is the only republic to successfully detach itself from the former Yugoslavia without bloodshed. In that sense it provides a positive example to its neighbours and is in my view deserving of the full support from the international community.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 51 and 72 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> I am deeply concerned at developments in Chechnya and the failure of the Russian authorities to bring the conflict to a peaceful end.</P>
    <P>Since early September last year Russian forces have been carrying out a military campaign in Chechnya, following incursions by Chechen rebels into neighbouring Dagestan and a spate of bomb attacks in Russia blamed on the rebels. The mountainous terrain of southern Chechnya is now under Russian air attack, as a prelude to a ground offensive there against Chechen rebels. The capital city, Grozny, has been in Russian hands since 6 February, and Russia has said that military operations in Chechnya will end within a month. Heavy casualties have been suffered by both sides, but independently verified figures are not available. According to the UNHCR, 170,000 displaced people are still in the neighbouring Russian Republic of Ingushetia. Russia has said that 150,000 people have returned to Chechnya, since Russia took control of the northern territories and that about 500 people are returning daily.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation and the need to deal with terrorism. However, the loss of civilian life, reported human rights abuses and the plight of internally displaced persons are matters of the utmost concern. The Government has allocated £220,000 in humanitarian assistance to Chechen internally displaced persons. This allocation will augment Ireland's share of the European Union aid package of 1.2 million. The EU remains ready to intensify its relief efforts as soon as the obstacles to a speedy, efficient and safe delivery of aid to civilians are removed.</P>
    <P>Ireland's concerns about the situation in Chechnya have been made known to the Russian authorities on numerous occasions and at the highest level. The Taoiseach expressed our views directly to President Yeltsin on the occasion of the OSCE summit in Istanbul in November. On 8 December my predecessor, Deputy Andrews, called in the Russian ambassador. On 14 January, Deputy Andrews went to Moscow to meet Foreign Minister Ivanov. Minister Ivanov agreed that there had been human rights abuses on both sides and that Russia would have to do everything possible to correct this situation.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about recent reports of summary executions by Russian soldiers, and the reported handing over of Russian journalist, Andrei Babitsky, supposedly with his consent, to alleged Chechen rebels in exchange for Russian soldiers. Today in my capacity as chairman of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, I have issued a statement expressing the Council's profound concern and urging the Russian authorities to investigate immediately these disturbing reports.</P>
    <P>Since the outbreak of the conflict, the international organisations have been actively trying to promote a peaceful settlement. In the context of Ireland's chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, Ireland is <Col N="972" /> working actively to promote proposals for a human rights ombudsman and a conference on democratic infrastructure in Chechnya. In January this year, the Council's Parliamentary Assembly voted to postpone until April consideration of a motion to suspend Russia. A series of fact finding and monitoring visits by the Parliamentary Assembly is in preparation to take place before the next part session of the Assembly in April. The OSCE has deployed monitors on the border between Georgia and Chechnya, with the aim of preventing any conflict spillover.  On 28 January UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, travelled to Moscow for a meeting with Acting President Putin, to stress the need for peace talks.</P>
    <P>The European Union has also been active in trying to press Russia to move towards a political solution. Since the Helsinki European Council, the EU has applied the following measures: (i) the suspension of the signature of the EU &ndash; Russia Science and Technology Agreement; (ii) the redrafting and reducing of presidency planned activities under the Russia Common Strategy; (iii) preliminary moves towards imposing quotas on steel imports where Russia is viewed to be in breach of existing agreements; (iv) the slowing down of internal preparations of the TACIS aid programme for Russia, and, (v) the Commission's decision not to carry over unspent Russia food aid funds of 30 million euros from 1999 to 2000.</P>
    <P>EU Foreign Ministers meeting on 24 January instructed the Commission to re-focus the TACIS 2000 aid programme towards programmes for democracy and the rule of law and transfer uncommitted balances to humanitarian aid. In addition, Ministers agreed to suspend consideration of extending additional trade preferences to Russia under the Generalised System of Preferences &ndash; GSP. The question of additional measures is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>The General Affairs Council on 14 February re-iterated its call on Russia to take immediate steps towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict. It reminded Russia of the importance of avoiding any spill-over of the conflict and of its heavy responsibility for addressing the deteriorating humanitarian situation. It stressed the importance of freedom of information and the media and expressed its profound concern regarding the fate of the missing Russian journalist Andrei Babitsky.</P>
    <P>The Government continues to work actively, both bilaterally and with EU partners, to try to persuade Russia to use the OSCE and the Council of Europe to bring about a political resolution of the conflict and establish lasting democratic structures in Chechnya.</P>

      <P>The Government remains deeply concerned at the slow pace of implementation of the 1999 Lusaka Agreement, as well as the serious outbreaks of violence reported in the country. Together with our EU partners, we continue to bring our concerns about these issues to the attention of the authorities concerned.</P>
      <P>The Lusaka Agreement was signed by the Governments of the six countries involved in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, including Uganda, Angola, Namibia, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo itself and by two rebel groups, the MLC, Movement for the Liberation of Congo, and the RDC, Congolese Rally for Democracy. Together with our EU partners, we consider the agreement continues to offer the only realistic prospect of lasting peace and security in the region.</P>
      <P>We have urged all parties to fully abide by the agreement, and we continue to encourage the UN and the OAU to make all necessary efforts to support its implementation. We have underlined our readiness to provide full political, diplomatic and resource support for the process, provided that the parties show the necessary political will. The Irish Government has also given financial assistance through a donation of £40,000 to the joint military commission, established under the terms of the agreement.</P>
      <P>We will continue to support the work of the EU Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Region, Mr. Aldo Ajello, who is actively pursuing the Union's objectives through his direct contacts with the UN, the Organisation of African Unity, regional leaders and other key figures. The EU also supports the holding, at an appropriate time, of an international conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes Region as a means of ensuring lasting stability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government continues to be concerned at the situation in Belarus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since Alexander Lukashenka took office as President of Belarus in 1994 a strong, authoritarian regime has been established. Referendums in May 1995 and November 1996, the legitimacy of which are contested, were used to dismiss Parliament, extend the powers and term of office of the President, and place restrictions on the media <Col N="974" /> and political parties. The present Parliament in Belarus is composed exclusively of supporters of Lukashenka. The latter's democratic mandate as President, although extended by himself to 2001, ran out on 20 July 1999. However, there is little alternative in trying to promote democratic reform in Belarus, other than to continue to deal with Lukashenka.</P>
    <P>From the outset, the international community made clear its rejection of a non-democratic Belarus, while continuing to make every effort to encourage the reform process. In January 1997, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe suspended the special guest status of Belarus. In January this year, it was decided to maintain the exclusion of Belarus from the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, because of its serious shortcomings concerning democratic pluralism and its continued use of the death penalty. As chair of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, Ireland continues to urge Belarus to avail of the resources of the Council of Europe to promote democratisation.</P>
    <P>The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe has also been involved in efforts to promote democracy in Belarus. As in the case of the Council of Europe, the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE does not recognise the current Parliament in Belarus, but the organisation continues its efforts to encourage reform there. In 1998 an OSCE advisory and monitoring group was established in Minsk with the aim of resolving differences between the Lukashenka Administration and opposition elements. The group has been active in organising seminars and workshops on democracy issues, which have been attended by Government, opposition and media representatives.</P>
    <P>The European Union strongly desires a close and co-operative relationship with Belarus. The Union's readiness to provide all practical assistance to Belarus in implementing political and economic reform, has been made clear. However, it has also been emphasised that it is essential for Belarus to demonstrate its commitment to democratic principles and parliamentary democracy. Until steps in this direction are taken, measures adopted by the Union to limit ministerial contact with Belarus and put on hold the development of contractual relations with the Union remain in place.</P>
    <P>In the second half of 1999, there were some improvements in the situation in Belarus. There was agreement in July on political dialogue between the Government and opposition. Agreement was also reached before the November OSCE summit on opposition access to the media. Another welcome move was the release from detention of former Prime Minister Chigir in November. However, the dialogue process has not materialised. In addition, an electoral code, which grants the ruling party a monopoly on all election commissions, the bodies which select candidates, was passed by Parliament on 24 January. The campaign regulation contained in this <Col N="975" /> code is contrary to democratic principles and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, and does not augur well for the holding of free and fair democratic elections.</P>
    <P>The Government continues to work actively both bilaterally and with colleagues in the Union, the Council of Europe and the OSCE to encourage the Belarus authorities to resolve their outstanding human rights and democratisation issues and in particular to take steps to ensure that the parliamentary elections to be held next autumn are free and fair.</P>

The election, which will take place in October 2000, is being contested by two other candidates: Norway and Italy. Turkey withdrew its candidacy on 10 February. Successful candidates will require the support of two-thirds of those states present and voting. In effect, this means that the support of around 125 states will be needed to secure election.

      <P>The Government, together with our EU partners, continues to follow the situation in Angola closely, including the significant developments registered on the military front in recent months. We remain convinced that there is no alternative to a political settlement in bringing peace and <Col N="976" /> stability to the country and people of Angola. Together with our EU partners, the Government has reiterated that UNITA bears the prime responsibility for the war in Angola. We have expressed concern about UNITA's persistent defiance of UN Security Council resolutions, and its failure to comply with key provisions of the Lusaka Protocol. We have urged UNITA to cease military activities and enter into a meaningful dialogue with the Government as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The EU continues to encourage the Angolan Government to create a political, social and economic environment for democracy which will foster respect for the rule of law in Angola. In this regard, we have reiterated that the Government has a special responsibility for the promotion of human rights, democratic principles, good governance and the strengthening of a free civil society, including in areas controlled by UNITA. Ireland and the European Union have also called on the Government of Angola, as a signatory of the Ottawa Convention, and on UNITA, to immediately cease mine-laying activities in the country. In addition, we have expressed concern at the recent fighting between Angolan armed forces and UNITA across international borders in the area, and have stressed the importance of stability and inter-state co-operation in the region. Together with our European partners, we will be ready to consider how to assist the Government of Angola in facing the challenges of rebuilding and reconstructing the country within a democratic environment, and will continue to give particular attention to the alleviation of the suffering of the Angolan population affected by the conflict.</P>

      <Quest>the current state of relations between Ireland and Mexico and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to report an intensification of the relations between Ireland and Mexico against the background of a number of bilateral visits and new developments in our formal diplomatic relations. Bilateral contacts saw the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Rosario Green, visit Ireland in March 1999. During her visit, she met the President, the Taoiseach and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews. This was followed in April by President McAleese's highly successful State visit to Mexico. During this State visit, two memoranda of understanding, on cultural and educational exchanges, were signed in the presence of the presidents of both countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 1 April 1999 the Government announced its decision to establish an embassy in Mexico city. In September 1999, Minister Andrews main<Col N="977" /> tained the momentum of Ireland's new relationship with Mexico when he met Foreign Minister Green in the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York. Again, only last month in Strasbourg, one of his final engagements as Foreign Minister was a meeting with Minister Green, when, in his capacity as Chairman of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, he welcomed Mexico's new status as an observer to that body.</P>
    <P>Mexico in recent years has become an increasingly major economic and political force in Latin America. The importance of the role Mexico plays in that rapidly changing region has been reflected in its active leadership as President of the Rio Group of Latin American countries and in its very effective co-chairmanship of the summit between the EU and the Latin American and Caribbean countries in Rio de Janeiro in June 1999.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has recently completed a series of negotiations on trade and economic relations with Mexico. These negotiations were undertaken on foot of the Interim Agreement on Trade and Trade Related Matters, which had been signed on 8 December 1997. The interim agreement is one of community competence and is separate from the Global Agreement on Economic Partnership, Political Co-ordination and Co-operation, which is of mixed competence, and which was signed on the same date. The global agreement was approved by Dáil Éireann on 23 June 1999. The global agreement has consequently been ratified by Ireland.</P>
    <P>The results of the trade negotiations conducted by the commission with Mexico are comprehensive in scope and cover the broad range of economic and trade relations between the EU and Mexico, including market access, services, capital movements, public procurement, dispute settlement procedures, rules of origin, anti-dumping safeguards, agriculture, fisheries and customs co-operation. This should result in increased trade and investment flows between the EU and Mexico.</P>
    <P>The results were discussed at the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 14 February 2000. The council noted that examination of the results was still continuing. It reaffirmed the political and economic importance of the entry into force of the results by way of a decision of the EU-Mexico Joint Council as soon as possible. It is expected that a meeting of the joint council will be held in Lisbon on 23 March next, <i>en marge</i> of the special European Summit on Employment and that Mexico's President, Sr. Zedillo, will attend.</P>
    <P>Mexico is Ireland's most important trading partner in Latin America, accounting for more than 30% of our trade in the Latin American and Caribbean region, and a growing volume of Irish investment. Ireland has been able to accept the results of the negotiations without any difficulty. Ireland fully endorses the global agreement and the interim agreement with Mexico, which are expected to benefit both Mexico and the EU and <Col N="978" /> the member states. The agreements should also assist Ireland to develop its bilateral political and trade relations with Mexico.</P>
    <P>Mexico's influence is also felt outside its own region, not least at the United Nations where it is one of Ireland's partners in the new agenda initiative on nuclear disarmament, and in the course of the preparatory work on the convention to ban landmines, Ireland and Mexico worked closely together as members of the central core group which led the negotiations. Human rights is a central element in the dialogue between the EU and Mexico. Ireland, together with its EU partners has welcomed the Mexican Government's increasing willingness to discuss human rights issues with friendly countries and to adopt measures to tackle the systemic human rights deficiencies which exist not only in the state of Chiapas but throughout the country. That the Mexican Government invited the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, to visit Mexico, and that the visit successfully took place last October, is an indication of the constructive attitude of the Mexican authorities to this grave problem. A similarly constructive initiative for observer status was undertaken at the Council of Europe, a body with a particular human rights remit, and it was for this reason that my predecessor was particularly happy that Mexico was able to assume that status during Ireland's Presidency of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent developments in relations between Ireland and Mexico and see these as a sound basis for the construction of closer links between the two countries, both bilaterally and in an EU context, and as co-operating partners on matters of international concern in multilateral fora. The planned visit of the Taoiseach to Mexico in September of this year will provide a timely opportunity to review the progress of these relations, and to set them on a productive path for the future.</P>

      <P>The Government has provided more than £700,000 in humanitarian assistance to relieve the suffering of the Timorese people. At least a further £1.3 million will be spent in humanitarian and reconstruction assistance this year. In recognition of the importance of human resource development, APSO is committed to making a contribution in this area in collaboration with UN agencies such as the United Nations volunteers.</P>
      <P>While it is difficult to know exactly how many refugees remain in West Timor and other parts of Indonesia, the UNHCR estimates the number to be about 120,000. It is also now widely accepted that up to 60,000 of these may not want to return. The pace of returns has slowed with the number of ex-army, police and militia among the returnees increasing. UNHCR reports that although access to the refugees in West Timor has improved, it is not regular, free and unhindered. There are concerns about the conditions in the camps. The international community is working to improve this situation. The United Nations Secretary General, Mr Kofi Annan, will raise the issue of the refugees at his meeting with the Indonesian President today.</P>
      <P>The humanitarian situation in East Timor has stabilised. The main concern now is to provide shelter, basic health and education and to resume agricultural production. The Government is committed to playing its part with the rest of the international community in supporting the people of East Timor to recover from the terrible events of the past and to make a successful transition to full independence. An assessment team visited East Timor in late November last year. Work is currently under way on a strategy which will provide carefully targeted assistance to the people of East Timor in developing their self-reliance and building their new nation. Representatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs will travel there again in the very near future to continue consultations with the authorities and agencies on the ground.</P>

      <P>The Government remains extremely concerned at the failure to resolve the ongoing conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea and at the continued delay in the implementation of the Organisation of African Unity framework agreement, approved by the OAU Summit in Algiers in July 1999. The Government has conveyed its views about the need for an immediate cessation of hostilities under OAU mediation to both the Ethiopian and Eritrean authorities on every possible occasion. With our EU partners, we continue to urge Ethiopia and Eritrea to end all hostilities and fully implement the OAU framework agreement. We also support the work of the EU Presidency's special representative for the Ethiopia-Eritrea Conflict, Senator Rino Serri, who is actively pursuing the Union's objectives through his direct contacts with the OAU and leading regional figures.</P>
      <P>We will continue to support all international efforts, notably those of the OAU and the UN, to vigorously pursue the peace process and to achieve a comprehensive settlement to this futile conflict, the political and economic costs of which neither country can afford. The current situation is destabilising for both countries and for the wider region of East Africa and is having an unacceptable impact on the civilian population.</P>

      <Col N="981" /> Mr. Creed asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the plans, if any, he has to provide a specific budget allocation for non-governmental organisations to allow for greater efficiency and speed of response to humanitarian crises. [4352/00]</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has a specific budget allocation as part of its overseas development assistance which enables speedy and effective provision of assistance to the people most affected in humanitarian emergencies. The allocation for 2000 is £7 million. Ireland works closely with other like-minded countries and humanitarian organisations to develop and implement good practice in this area. Humanitarian interventions must, in so far as is possible, be in line with the highest humanitarian principles, be co-ordinated, based on a proper assessment of needs and monitored to ensure relief reaches those most in need. It is essential that all those involved work together to save and protect lives and to make best use of the resources available.</P>
      <P>The Government's main aim in emergency situations is to get the right sort of assistance to the victims as speedily and as effectively as possible. This is the main determinant in choosing the channel of assistance. Ireland Aid responds to emergencies on three levels. We respond through non-governmental organisations which are established in the affected country or region and therefore have the local knowledge, expertise and capacity to react speedily and effectively to emergencies. We respond through multilateral organisations, such as the UN agencies and the Red Cross family which have a presence in most countries and are most often in a position to move immediately to help local efforts. We also respond through the European Commission Humanitarian Office, which was specifically set up to allow a unified EU response to humanitarian emergencies. In 1999, ECHO's funding amounted to almost 810 million.</P>
      <P>ECHO and, to a growing extent, the UN agencies also channel their funds through non-governmental organisations. The United Nations office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs has the role of co-ordinating the overall international response so as to avoid duplication and unnecessary competition among aid agencies which, unfortunately, still occurs all too frequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland Aid has guidelines and procedures in place for the disbursement of emergency funding. These have been developed in line with international norms and in consultation with non-governmental organisations. In the case of rapid-onset emergencies, there is an urgency procedure in place which enables the Minister to approve funding to facilitate a quick, efficient and effective response to humanitarian emergencies <Col N="982" /> through the organisations most qualified to react in the particular circumstances. This response is co-ordinated with other donors through the EU and the UN where policy and procedures have been developed and are subject to continuing review.</P>

      <P>I represented Ireland at the General Affairs Council in Brussels for the first time on 14 February.</P>
      <P>The council had a brief exchange of views on preparations for the Lisbon Special European Council, which will be held on 23-24 March. The presidency developed its ideas for establishing in Lisbon a European strategy for growth, competitiveness and employment, with social cohesion. Ministers emphasised the need for operational conclusions from Lisbon, including precise follow-up mechanisms to measure progress. The House will be aware that the Lisbon meeting is the centre piece of the Presidency's programme on the economic policy side. Besides the General Affairs Council, other formations of the council, notably ECOFIN and the Social Affairs Council, are involved in the preparatory work.</P>
      <P>The council also considered follow-up to the Helsinki European Council in relation to European security and defence policy. As an interim measure with the aim of improving the EU's ability to take decisions on Petersberg Tasks, the council took decisions enabling the establishment, as of 1 March, of an interim political and security committee within the council, together with an interim body to give necessary military advice. Arrangements were also agreed to allow the EU Council secretariat to be augmented by a small number of military experts seconded from the member states.</P>
      <P>Vice-President Kinnock outlined the main elements of the consultative document on commission reform published last month, emphasising the importance of the involvement and support of the GAC. The council adopted conclusions calling for rapid implementation of the administrative reforms proposed, noting that the modernisation of the European public service should provide equal opportunities of access to it for citizens of all member states and pledging to play a full and active role in the reform process.</P>
      <P>The council expressed its deepest concern over recent events in Lebanon and appealed to all parties to exercise restraint. It asserted its hope that a return to the April 1996 ceasefire understanding might be achieved and that a further de-escalation might be a first step towards progress in the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> The council regretted that the framework agreement on permanent status between Israel and the Palestinian Authority had not been completed by its target date. In response to a letter to the presidency from Chairman Arafat, it requested that the presidency reaffirm the EU's commitment to the peace process and urge the parties to resume permanent status negotiations without further delay. The council also invited the presidency to advance work on the multilateral negotiations after the positive outcome of the ministerial meeting of the steering committee in Moscow on 1 February.</P>
    <P>The council adopted conclusions welcoming the results of trade negotiations with Mexico which are currently being examined within the council. It reaffirmed the economic and political importance of their entry into force through decisions of the EC-Mexico Joint Council, envisaged for 23 March 2000.</P>
    <P>In the context of the EU-South Africa trade and development co-operation agreement which is being provisionally applied, the council reached agreement on elements to be presented to the South African authorities with a view to securing a final agreement on the question of the protection of specific EU denominations in the field of wine and spirits.</P>
    <P>The Austrian Foreign Minister made a presentation to her colleagues setting out the commitment of her Government to the terms of the declaration signed by the People's Freedom Party. She stressed that the policies of her Government in relation to the European Union would be clear, predictable and marked by continuity.</P>
    <P>The council also discussed the charter of fundamental rights, the Western Balkans, Russia, Indonesia and the Stockholm International Forum on the Holocaust.</P>
    <P>The inaugural meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference was convened on the morning of 14 February, in the margins of the GAC. Essentially a formal event, it was preceded, in keeping with agreed consultations arrangements, by a meeting with the president of the European Parliament. The current, previous and future presidencies made brief statements. The meeting considered the work programme of the Intergovernmental Conference, including the question of a presidency report to the Lisbon Special European Council.</P>

      <P>The Government is concerned at the extent of the challenges facing Indonesia, and its ability to meet them effectively and with full respect for democracy and human rights. These challenges range from economic and social reform, to the consolidation of democracy, the construction of civil society and the reform of the military. They are compounded by the tensions and conflicts which have also recently arisen for sectarian or separatist reasons, notably in Aceh, Ambon and Irian Jaya.</P>
      <P>With the successful holding of the first democratic elections last June, the election of President Wahid last October and the subsequent appointment by him of his government, Indonesia is now the world's third largest democracy. It is, however, facing a series of problems, some of which arise from the legacy and abuses of the Suharto regime and some which result more directly from the Asian 1997 financial crisis.</P>
      <P>This is the background against which the EU has made known its willingness to support and assist a strong, united and democratic Indonesia, once its international obligations in respect of the people of East Timor had been met.</P>
      <P>While Indonesia has now accepted the result of the East Timorese referendum, there are still issues to be fully resolved in respect of East Timor such as the return of all refugees who wish to do so, the dismantling of the remaining militia elements and the follow-up to human rights violations. The EU will monitor carefully progress on these issues. At the same time, and in the expectation that these questions will be satisfactorily addressed, the EU has now started to consider how it can assist Indonesia to address the problems and challenges which I have outlined above. To this end the EU Commission has prepared a comprehensive strategy document which it presented to me and my colleagues at the General Affairs Council on Monday. This paper will now be the subject of further detailed work in the relevant bodies over coming weeks.</P>
      <P>The international community is conscious of the dangers of tensions which could provoke further violence within Indonesia, and even lead to the fragmentation of that country, threatening the stability of the region as a whole. We are conscious, too, of the efforts which President Wahid and his Government are making to defuse tensions and address grievances. At the same time, it is essential for the credibility of these policies and for the safeguarding of Indonesia's fledgling democracy, that every effort be made to bring to justice those responsible for human rights abuses, including the perpetrators of atrocities in East Timor last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the early 1980s the HIV-AIDS epidemic has spread across the world. In 1999 more than two and a half million people died of AIDS; in addition more than 33 million people are thought to be infected with the virus. More than 90% of these infections occur in poorer, developing countries. In these situations AIDS is making poor people poorer and is contributing to a reversal of many earlier development gains.</P>
      <P>HIV-AIDS is now a major public health problem in all of the countries benefiting from the support of Ireland Aid on the African continent. It is imperative in these situations that there is a sustained and coherent effort to prevent further spread of the disease and to contain its impact. Many lessons have been learnt over the last 15 years of implementing HIV-AIDS projects. Ireland Aid is responding to the challenges presented by HIV-AIDS and has drawn from these experiences in developing, in collaboration with the Irish Aid Advisory Committee, its new HIV-AIDS strategy &lsquo;An HIV-AIDS Strategy for the Ireland Aid Programme'.</P>
      <P>It is my view that this is an excellent document. It recognises that the effects of HIV-AIDS go far beyond those of poor health and that the disease is having a negative impact on development progress and on poverty. Consequently the strategy recommends that Ireland Aid needs to address the problem of AIDS at all levels,  international, national and community and through all sectors, health, education, industry and rural development.</P>
      <P>Clearly any strategy needs to be backed up by plans to put it into effect. A growing aid budget affords many opportunities for Ireland Aid to increase the level of support for HIV-AIDS activities. A commitment has been given to increase the level of funding for specific HIV-AIDS activities from IR£1.5 million in 1999 to more than IR£2.5 million in 2000. This amount is additional to the already considerable volume of funds allocated by Ireland Aid in support of health programmes in developing countries. The strategy recommends that any response to HIV-AIDS by Ireland Aid be integrated into other sectors supported, such as education, health and rural development. In addition the strategy provides for an intensification of Ireland's responsibility in advocating improvements in international co-operation in the search for effective vaccines and affordable treatments.</P>
      <P>In this context the Taoiseach recently wrote to the President of the European Commission stressing the need for the EU and its member states urgently to explore the level of resources devoted to the fight against HIV-AIDS and the need for greater international co-operation. The Taoiseach also called for consideration of how best to procure affordable treatment for AIDS for poor countries and the EU's role in supporting the search for a vaccine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will pursue with the Commission and the member states in the coming months the issue of <Col N="986" /> the EU's role in the fight against HIV-AIDS. As the world's largest aid donor, the EU and its member states must increase their collective efforts and give a strong lead if we are to deal effectively with the spread of the epidemic.</P>

      <P>The Communicating Europe Task Force work programme for 1999 included support for the research and development of a CD-ROM on the structures and functions of the European Union for distribution to secondary schools; support for information programmes undertaken by the European Parliament Office in Dublin and the European movement related to the European elections; support for Europe Week, a weekly news feed on EU issues provided to Irish local radio stations; and support for training courses on EU issues organised by the European Movement and by the Irish Countrywomen's Association.</P>
      <P>The task force met on six occasions during 1999: 1 February, 30 March, 15 July, 13 October, 12 November and 1 December. Expenditure by the task force amounted to IR£100,036 in 1999.</P>
      <P>At its first meeting of 2000, the task force agreed its strategy for the year's work. Raising the profile of European issues in the current affairs arena was the key goal. Projects supported by the task forces should reach a mass audience, and the material or outcome should be readily understood by an audience with little familiarity with European matters. Projects should have some element of added value, should have a measurable impact and be relatively modest in scale.</P>
      <P>Ongoing commitments carried forward into 2000 include the CD-ROM project for schools, and support for the Europe week radio news feed, and the Eurolink provincial newspaper column. The task force has a budget of IR£113,000 for 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The ending of the Cold War, and the consequent dismantling of communist regimes in eastern Europe created both challenges and opportunities for Albania. Internally there have been far-reaching changes. Albania has also been affected by the consequences of the break up of the former Yugoslavia, especially the crisis in Kosovo last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="988" /> Since the collapse of communism in 1990 Albania has been prone to widespread civil disturbance. The immediate trigger of most of the recent disturbances was the collapse of fraudulent pyramid investment schemes run under the Government of Sali Berisha in 1997. However the causes lay in Albania's decades of isolation, to problems in rebuilding its political system and economic structures and extreme poverty. Albania is the poorest country in Europe. GDP per capita averages around 765 euro. According to the World Bank some 30% of its population live under the poverty line.</P>
    <P>There has been very substantial EU assistance in Albania since the end of communism in 1991. The EU aids Albania within the OSCE framework and co-ordinates its action with both the Western European Union and the Council of Europe. Albania receives support under the EU PHARE programme and a trade and co-operation agreement has been in place since 1992. The European Community Monitor Mission, is present on the Albania-Kosovo border as well as in other parts of the country. Owing to their geographical proximity Greece and Italy, both of which have large numbers of economic refugees from Albania, are the EU member states most to the fore in providing bilateral aid for the country. Since 1991 Albania has received a proportionally greater amount of aid per capita than any post-communist country.</P>
    <P>Further EU efforts will be channelled through the Friends of Albania group of which Ireland, and all other EU member states, are members. Since 1997 the OSCE mission in Albania has been involved in political mediation and specific activities in the field of democratisation, media and judiciary. The OSCE mission is conceived as an overall co-ordinating framework for Albania. In September 1998 the Friends of Albania group was formed in order to provide political coherence for assistance to the country. The group is co-chaired by the OSCE chairman-in-office and the EU presidency. The next meeting of the group is to take place on 28 February in Vienna.</P>
    <P>Ireland and its EU partners are concerned by potential instability in the country caused in part by the economic situation, in part by confrontation between the main Government and Opposition parties and the ongoing consequences of the widespread civil disturbance in 1997 and 1998. More than half a million weapons looted from army barracks during the periods of civil disturbance are in private hands. As a response to this the EU supports financially a moderately successful weapons for development programme, administered by the UN development programme, by which local areas will get increased financial support in return for a surrender of all privately held weapons.</P>
    <P>There is also concern among EU partners, however, about the level of organised crime which thrives in the unstable economic and political environment. The consequences of this for Kosovo, which Albanian criminal gangs view as <Col N="989" /> an area ripe for exploitation is a matter of special concern for all EU partners which have committed international personnel in Kosovo, including Ireland. The Friends of Albania group has called on the Government to restructure and professionalise the police forces as a response to this problem. The Western European Union is engaged in a programme of advice and training for police at district and police unit levels as part of an international effort to enhance the capability of the forces of law and order to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>Since the resignation of Fatos Nano as Prime Minister in October 1998 his successors Pandeli Majko and, from October 1999, the current Prime Minister Illir Meta, have pursued a course of constructive reform and economic regeneration which has the broad support of international financial institutions, the IMF and World Bank, the EU and the international community in general. Although the Opposition DP has ended its boycott of Parliament which it maintained from 1998-99 there is concern that the continued confrontation between Government and Opposition will perpetuate the climate of political instability which could threaten this economic reform programme. EU representatives have attempted to persuade the leader of the Democratic Party, Sali Berisha, to accept the role of main Opposition party in a constitutional democracy, so far without success.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission recently made an assessment of the feasibility of negotiating a stabilisation and association agreement with Albania. The Commission's view, expressed in the conclusions of the General Affairs Council of 24 January, is that while progress has been made, a number of issues, in particular consolidation of the rule of law and acceleration of structural reforms will have to be addressed for a successful participation by the country in the stabilisation and association process. Further technical talks are being carried out with Albania on the extension of the ongoing EU assistance for the country. Ireland supports the continuation of EU aid for Albania and welcomes the commitment of the Government of Prime Minister Meta to bring about progress and economic development of the country.</P>

      <P>The Government is very concerned at the current situation in Kosovo. Although the humanitarian needs of most of the population are now being met, the security situation is deteriorating and violence between the ethnic communities is continuing, including attacks by the majority Kosovo-Albanian community on the minority Serb and Roma communities. All this is undermining the efforts of the international community to achieve <Col N="990" /> democratic and multiethnic self-government for Kosovo.</P>
      <P>Following the ending of the Kosovo conflict last year, Resolution 1244 of the UN Security Council effectively put Kosovo under a UN administration. The mandate of UNMIK &ndash; United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo &ndash; is to restore a high degree of democratic self-government to Kosovo involving all ethnic groups. With the aid of international organisations such as the OSCE and the Council of Europe it has made some progress towards this end, in particular through the setting up in January of the joint interim administrative structure as a means of involving the local population in their own government. Unfortunately, the Serbian community is currently boycotting these arrangements. They have indicated that they will continue to do so until the security situation for their community is improved.</P>
      <P>Recent reports record a sharp deterioration in the security situation, particularly in the Mitrovica area. These reports have detailed a number of incidents of attacks against Kosovo Serbs &ndash; including a rocket attack on a UNHCR bus transporting Kosovo Serbs &ndash; and revenge attacks against the Kosovo Albanian community. At the beginning of February there were several days of rioting in Mitrovica, which is divided between Serb and Albanian areas. Several civilians were killed or injured and 11 KFOR personnel were hurt by rioting Albanians.</P>
      <P>UNMIK continues to be critically short of financial resources to pay for the restoration of local services, including basic utilities, and the salaries of local employees to run them. In addition, the UNMIK police mission is still at less than 50% of its authorised strength. This is having a negative effect on the political situation as it weakens the confidence of the local population in the UNMIK administration. The EU Commission has recently disbursed 35 million euro in favour of the Kosovo consolidated budget to fund local services and has promised further funds for this purpose especially the restoration of electricity supplies.</P>
      <P>The Government is working within international bodies &ndash; United Nations, EU, OSCE and the Council of Europe &ndash; to secure an improvement in the situation. My predecessor, as chairman of the committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, visited Pristina last month to assess the contribution of the council. Mr Andrews reported to the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe at its session in Strasbourg on 24 January, and I will follow up on his activities on this important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the contribution of the EU, the situation in Kosovo was discussed at the most recent meeting of the General Affairs Council on 14 February. We reiterated our condemnation of all acts of violence and particularly the outbreak of ethnic violence in Mitrrovica. We called on all political leaders to firmly condemn all violence and use their influence to stop it. EU assistance to Kosovo is also dependent on progress in inter-<Col N="991" /> ethnic reconciliation and on the implementation of Resolution 1244 in all its aspects.</P>

      <P>The strategy statement, published on 22 December 1999, outlined what has been achieved to date and, in general terms, the further steps to be undertaken by the British Government. Since the publication, my Department has continued to maintain close contact with the British authorities, the parties and other groups on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Government strongly believes that, in the light of the sustained peace, a real opportunity now exists for significant moves on security normalisation. In this regard, we welcomed the announcement in December 1999 by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland of a review of specific security arrangements. This includes installations throughout Northern Ireland. The Government's views on the review have been conveyed to the British authorities.</P>
      <P>Officials from my Department remain in regular contact with individuals and groups in the areas affected by the issue. I firmly believe that, in line with the Good Friday Agreement, the current review should facilitate the earliest possible announcement of further specific action on normalisation.</P>

      <P>Last October, the President of Colombia, Mr. Andrés Pastrana travelled to Europe to explain his country's peace process and to outline his intentions for the Plan Colombia, which will be designed to provide the economic and social underpinning for the peace process. When he addressed the European Parliament, and again when he met with Commissioner Chris Patten, President Pastrana indicated that once the peace process had got successfully under way, he would spell out the details of the kind of support Colombia would wish the European Union to provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> Since President Pastrana's European visit, the peace process has suffered some setbacks but there have been hopeful signs also, including a temporary ceasefire in December by the main guerilla group, FARC and continued contacts since between the two sides.</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped that these contacts will shortly bear fruit, ending the plight of the people of Colombia who have been the long-suffering victims of violence inflicted by all sides. The violence of the left-wing insurgents in Colombia is matched by that of the right-wing paramilitaries &ndash; often associated with the official security forces. Both sides seem to be equally indifferent to the plight of the civilian population, to whom no immunity is extended.</P>
    <P>As President Pastrana himself acknowledged in his speech to the European Parliament, breaches of human rights by agents of the state are especially abhorrent. The Colombian Government is aware of the particular concern expressed by the Irish government and its EU partners on that score. President Pastrana has established a special committee to expedite investigations into human rights violations as part of a new, integrated human rights strategy. He has also accepted the help of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, in establishing a national plan for human rights.</P>
    <P>Ireland and her European partners are fully engaged with the situation in Colombia. The embassies of the EU member states in Bogota are in close and constant contact with the Colombian authorities, and report regularly on the developing peace process. The EU and its member states are already Colombia's largest single aid donor. When the terms of the new Plan Colombia are announced, I am sure that the EU will be responsive. Ireland and her European partners will play a full part in supporting the peace process which is designed to build a better future for the long suffering people of Colombia, based on human rights, democracy and equitable social and economic development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Human rights are a priority of this Government and a central element of our foreign policy. In co-operation with our EU partners and other concerned states, the Government continually monitors the human rights situation in many countries throughout the world. We believe that the international community has an obligation to act when it has concerns, and that these concerns should be pursued whenever possible in a constructive spirit <Col N="993" /> of co-operation and dialogue, conscious of the responsibility which devolves on all Governments to promote and protect human rights.</P>
      <P>This Government has commented publicly on many occasions on those situations which give rise to grave concern, in a national capacity and as a member of the EU and the Council of Europe. These concerns have also been raised on a consistent basis by this country's representatives at the UN General Assembly and at the UN Commission on Human Rights. During our term as Chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Ireland sought to facilitate progress on a wide range of human rights issues. The Irish delegation will be active at the next session of the commission, which will take place from 20 March until 28 April 2000.</P>
      <P>Applying concentrated international pressure through multilateral organisations such as the EU, UN and the Council of Europe is one of the most effective means of combating human rights abuses. Throughout Ireland's chairmanship of the committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe we have focused attention on the role of that institution in upholding human rights standards. A visit by my predecessor to Moscow highlighted the international community's concern at events in Chechnya. I also support fully Mr. Alvaro Gil-Robles in his efforts to develop his mandate as commissioner for human rights at the Council of Europe.</P>
      <P>However, despite the efforts of the global community in international and regional fora such as those I have mentioned, it has to be acknowledged that the systems in place for preventing and tackling flagrant human rights abuses do not always prove adequate. Reasons for this range from the failure of states to ratify relevant international instruments to a lack of resources and even political will to focus on these problems. The Secretary General of the UN Mr. Kofi Annan has initiated a debate on how the international community can react most effectively to crisis situations and humanitarian disasters, such as those that occurred in East Timor and Kosovo.</P>
      <P>This debate is focusing on the need for clarification of the principles and the establishment of agreed criteria for external intervention. In this regard, there is an evident need to reconcile the requirements of international human rights provisions with other principles such as national sovereignty or non-intervention as established by the UN Charter. Ireland is actively involved in this debate and is currently engaged in discussions on the specific issues arising, with like-minded countries, notably in a group known as the Human Security Network. This initiative of the Canadian and Norwegian Governments is aimed at establishing the principle of human security as a central element in the international community's approach to situations of conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland will continue to fulfil our obligation to promote the observance of universal human rights standards. We will continue to voice our concerns, wherever possible in partnership with <Col N="994" /> other like-minded countries, in international fora such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE.</P>

      <P>The British-Irish Council established under the Good Friday Agreement brings together the Irish and British Governments, with the Scottish, Welsh, Northern Ireland, Isle of Man and Channel Island administrations. The council is a forum where members can exchange information, discuss, consult and endeavour to reach agreement on co-operation on matters of mutual interest within their respective competencies. At the opening summit of the council in London on 17 December last, an indicative list of issues suitable for its future work was agreed. In this regard five priority areas &ndash; drugs, transport, social exclusion, the environment and the knowledge economy &ndash; were selected as matters for early discussion in the council.

However, this is a matter for the Oireachtas and the other elected institutions concerned. In this regard, I am aware that the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body has begun to consider the question, and I look forward with interest to the outcome of its deliberations.</P>
      <P>Finally, Deputies will be acutely aware of the difficulties that have arisen with the implementation of aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, and I know that they will fully share the Government's determination that these should be resolved at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <Quest>the representations, if any, made to the US authorities regarding the case of a six year old Cuban boy, Elian Gonzales, who is being prevented from returning to Cuba to be reunited with his father; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The case of Elian Gonzalez was the subject of a number of written parliamentary questions on Wednesday, 26 January.</P>
      <P>Replying to questions about the case on that date, my predecessor as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, noted that on 5 January, the US immigration and naturalisation service, determined that Juan Gonzalez, the father of Elian Gonzalez, has the sole legal authority to speak for his son on immigration issues and that Elian should be reunited with his father. Before the decision was made, US officials met twice in Cuba with Juan Gonzalez and satisfied themselves that he had &ldquo;a close and continuing relationship with his son&rdquo; and that he was &ldquo;expressing his true wishes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On 19 January federal district court action was filed by the Miami-based relatives of Elian in respect of the decision of the Immigration and Naturalisation Service. On 26 January, the administration responded to the court action filing a lengthy motion to dismiss the law suit. I understand that the judge has now scheduled a hearing for the week of 22 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> Prior to the filing of the motion for dismissal, both Attorney General Janet Reno and INS Commissioner Doris Meissner met on 22 January in Washington with Elian's two grandmothers, together with a delegation from the US and Cuban Council of Churches, following which Ms Reno and Ms Meissner issued the following statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ms. Quintana and Ms. Rodriguez (<i>the grandmothers</i>) made a very compassionate and heartfelt plea to be reunited with their grandson. They asked when Elian could return to his father and the rest of his family in Cuba. We explained that this matter is now in federal court but that we will seek resolution as expeditiously as possible. We accepted a letter from Ms. Quintana and Ms. Rodriguez which reiterated the issues raised in today's meeting.</P>
    <P>We maintain that the law recognises the unique relationship between parent and child and that family reunification has long been a cornerstone of both American immigration law and INS practice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Attorney General Reno has clearly and publicly supported Commissioner Meissner in this matter, stating that &ldquo;she fully agrees with her determination that the father has the legal right and the legal authority to speak for his child in immigration matters&rdquo; adding &ldquo;the father has evidenced a real relationship with his son&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For my part, I fully share the view of those who, like Attorney General Reno, believe this matter should be resolved as expeditiously as possible in the interests of the welfare of this young child.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, the Government has to promote reform of the United Nations, particularly in regard to the composition of the Security Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government strongly supports reform of the United Nations, in line with the commitment to this end in An Action Programme for the Millennium. In the recent review of the action programme, the Government committed itself to support the strengthening of the capacity of the international community, in particular through the UN and the renewal process that will follow the millennium assembly, to make effective humanitarian interventions to halt conflict and suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reform issue has been pursued vigorously by the Government and was raised again in my predecessor's address to the UN General Assembly on 25 September. While a number of important reforms have taken place, particularly in the re-organisation of the UN's role in the delivery of development and humanitarian assist<Col N="997" /> ance, the overall pace of reform has not, unfortunately, been as we would wish. We hope the millennium summit and assembly later this year will provide fresh impetus in the reform process. We look forward to an action-oriented outcome which will strengthen the organisation as it enters the new century.</P>
    <P>In March 1997, the Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan, presented a reform agenda for the United Nations to be implemented on the basis of a two-track process. The first track related to managerial initiatives and decisions falling within his authority. The second track involved a longer-term programme of reform to include fundamental proposals that could only be decided intergovernmentally, that is, by the representatives of the member states meeting in the General Assembly.</P>
    <P>The Track I proposals have been substantially agreed and are being implemented. They include the establishment and implementation of the UN Development Assistance Framework under which UN agencies involved in development assistance will co-operate more closely at country level in an effort to avoid duplication. The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs replaced the Department of Humanitarian Affairs. Ireland, with other donor countries, actively supported the setting up of this new UN office.</P>
    <P>The Track II reform proposals on which progress has been made include the establishment of a senior management group under the chairmanship of the Secretary-General and the creation of a new post of Deputy Secretary-General with important responsibilities in the development field. Ms Louise Frechette of Canada was appointed to this position in January 1998. A substantial number of reform proposals requiring General Assembly approval have not yet been endorsed. These include important proposals in the development area.</P>
    <P>Ireland fully supports the UN Secretary-General in his efforts to bring about a renewed, reformed and more vigorous UN. This is essential to ensure the UN's continued capacity to contribute effectively to conflict prevention and to social and economic development. Ireland and its EU partners have sought to stress that the reform process is not simply a cost-cutting exercise but one which is aimed at strengthening and renewing the UN system.</P>
    <P>One of the most difficult issues is the question of Security Council reform. The Charter of the United Nations provides, in order to ensure prompt and effective action by the organisation, that its member states confer on the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, and agree that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility the Security Council acts on their behalf. The General Assembly decided in 1993 to establish a working group, open to all UN member states, to consider all aspects of the question of an increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the council. The issues involved are enlargement of Security Council membership, the council's working <Col N="998" /> methods and its decision-making procedures including, crucially, the use of the veto.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports a small, regionally balanced increase in both permanent and non-permanent seats to create an enlarged council of between 20 and 25 members. We strongly believe that any agreement on enlargement should not diminish the possibility for smaller UN member states to serve on the council as non-permanent members. As the Deputies are aware, Ireland is a candidate for membership of the council for 2001-02.</P>
    <P>On Security Council working methods, there appears to be fairly wide consensus that these should be more formalised and transparent, involving greater consultation by the council with other UN organs, including the General Assembly and Secretary-General, and, in peacekeeping matters, with troop contributing countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland would like to see the veto eliminated altogether but, recognising the strong opposition of the permanent five, has proposed that they be invited to accept a limitation of the veto, and to exercise it only when they consider the question of vital national importance, taking into account the interests of the United Nations as a whole. At the same time any new permanent members of the council would declare that they would never exercise the veto.</P>
    <P>I regret that the working group has not yet been unable to report any consensual progress to the General Assembly. I assure the House that Ireland will continue to play an active and constructive role in these negotiations.</P>

      <P>The question of European security and defence policy was considered at the Helsinki European Council in December on the basis of the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam. Both the Taoiseach and my predecessor, Deputy Andrews, made detailed statements in this House on 15 December concerning the outcome of Helsinki.</P>
      <P>I recall that the issue of EU discussions is Petersberg Tasks, and not mutual defence commitments. In seeking to ensure that the EU has the capabilities required for Petersberg Tasks, the Helsinki European Council made clear that this process is not about creating a European army. I also recall the importance of civilian crisis management, including the civilian dimensions of conflict prevention, which was fully recognised by the Helsinki European Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Final decisions in this area are not foreseen until the end of this year at the earliest. As an interim measure with the aim of improving the EU's ability to take decisions on Petersberg Tasks, the General Affairs Council yesterday took decisions enabling the establishment, as of 1 March, of an interim political and security committee within the council, together with an <Col N="999" /> interim body to give necessary military advice. Arrangements were also agreed to allow the EU Council Secretariat to be augmented by a small number of military experts seconded from the member states.</P>
    <P>The Helsinki European Council also agreed on a voluntary target for establishing capabilities. This target, which member states aim to meet by the year 2003, is to be able to deploy between 50,000 and 60,000 personnel within 60 days and to be able to sustain this deployment for one year. This would equate roughly to a mission of a scale comparable to that of KFOR in Kosovo. Consideration is also being given to the appropriate arrangements that would allow interested non-EU states to contribute to the Petersberg Tasks, and also to the appropriate consultation arrangements to be worked out between the EU and NATO for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The Presidency will present an interim progress report on this issue to the Lisbon European Council on 23-24 March, and a fuller progress report to the European Council in June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of advanced information communications technologies, has become the most significant driver of world economic growth. ICTs are the catalysts through which enterprise, whether traditional or new, can create sustained competitive advantage for its products and services on world markets; ICTs are also the catalysts through which enterprise can create quality and sustainable employment.</P>
      <P>The Government has recognised the need for a broad based, multi-disciplinary approach to the new challenges presented by the Information Society. Five priority areas have been identified which must be developed to ensure our global competitiveness in the new digital economy: telecommunications infrastructure and costs; education in the use of ICTs; upskilling the existing business sector; effective regulation; and research and development. Decisive action is being taken in these priority areas.</P>
      <P>The recent agreement with Global Crossing providing Ireland with international broadband connectivity will enable us to provide up to 15 times the current international capacity out of Ireland at one-tenth of the existing unit costs levels. It will mean that we will become an integral part of a world class communications chain running from the US to Ireland and onwards to 24 European cities. Allied to this is the roll-out of broadband infrastructure to over 120 centres throughout the country, and the launch of Ireland's first digital park in CityWest. In addition, the national development plan sets aside £120 million to promote investment in advanced telecommunications and to develop e-commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the expert group on future skills needs, the Government has allocated more than IR£400 million to various educational initiatives <Col N="1001" /> designed to develop appropriate skills, to promote innovation, and to provide an additional 5,400 new third level college places in high technology courses over the next four years.</P>
    <P>E-business initiatives are being launched by the development agencies so as to encourage firms to connect to the Internet, to develop strategy, to help with business re-engineering process and to build a critical mass of skilled ICTs users.</P>
    <P>This Department, in conjunction with the Department of Public Enterprise, is working to finalise a draft Bill that will give the same legal effect to electronic signatures, electronic writing and electronic contracts as paper based counterparts. The Bill will also provide legal certainty for the conclusion of contracts electronically and the admissibility in court of electronic evidence in civil cases.</P>
    <P>Investment in research, related human resources and the application of enabling technologies will allow us to attract new generations of foreign investment and create indigenous firms which are globally competitive. The Government's national development plan provided an overall allocation of almost £2 billion in funding for research, technological development and innovation over the next seven years.</P>
    <P>The Forfás report on e-commerce &ndash; the policy requirements, which was drafted at my request, was published in August 1999 and serves as a medium term compass for action by Government and businesses alike across a broad range of sectors so as to maximise the potential for the Irish economy in the area of e-business.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to his priority question about the humanitarian situation in Iraq which responds to these questions also.</P>
      <P>The Government remains deeply concerned about the suffering being endured by the Iraqi people. While the oil for food programme in operation since 1996 has resulted in the stabilisation of malnutrition rates, it has not halted the collapse of the health system and the deterioration in water supplies. The Government made an emergency humanitarian grant of £100,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1999 to assist its relief work in areas such as medical support for the victims of war, prisoners' welfare and water and sanitation. The ICRC has been present in Iraq since the early 1980s and is working to restore a level of basic health care to the country.</P>
      <P>The Government has also been providing support to the Iraqi Marsh Arabs who are currently seeking refuge in Iran. The Marsh Arabs are Shia Muslims whose traditional homes in the Iraqi wetlands have been destroyed as a result of a massive drainage programme carried out by the Iraqi Government. The majority of the refugees live in camps which depend on assistance provided by the Iranian authorities and the international donor community. In the past three years Ireland Aid granted a total of £358,000 to AMAR, the only NGO operating in this area of southern Iran, to fund basic health care, water and sanitation facilities and to organise supplementary feeding centres.</P>
      <P>The European Union has been consistent in its response to the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people over recent years. Since 1997, almost 19 million euros have been disbursed by the European Community Humanitarian Office. This programme acts as a complement to the humanitarian aid allowed under the oil for food arrangement. ECHO has focused on the most vulnerable and on areas where it would be most useful and cost-effective, such as the renovation of water supplies, support for malnourished children and the rehabilitation of hospitals.</P>
      <P>Iraq is a party to the International Covenants on Human Rights, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and has observed the reporting requirements under this convention. However, it has consistently argued in these reports that the sanctions imposed by the Security Council have been responsible for the deterioration in, and lack of protection of, economic and social rights in Iraq. The Government believes that, in line with the requirements of the covenants, there should be no discrimination of any kind in the observance of international human rights standards and would call on the Government of Iraq to abide by its obligations under international human rights treaties and international humanitarian law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1006" /> The systematic, widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law by the Government of Iraq were condemned in a resolution sponsored by the EU at the UN Commission on Human Rights in 1999. The human rights situation in Iraq continues to be grave and is expected to be the subject of a resolution tabled by the EU at the forthcoming session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>Following the ending of the Kosovo conflict last year, Resolution 1244 of the UN Security Council effectively put Kosovo under a UN administration. The mandate of UNMIK, United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, is to restore a high degree of democratic self-government to Kosovo involving all ethnic groups. With the aid of international organisations such as the OSCE and the Council of Europe, UNMIK has made some progress towards this end, in particular through the setting up in January of the joint interim administrative structure as a means of involving the local population in their own government. Unfortunately, the Serbian community is currently boycotting these arrangements and has indicated that it will continue to do so until the security situation for its community is improved.</P>
      <P>Recent reports record a sharp deterioration in the security situation, particularly in the Mitrovica area. These reports have detailed a number of incidents of attacks against Kosovo Serbs, including a rocket attack on a UNHCR bus transporting Kosovo Serbs, and revenge attacks against the Kosovo Albanian community. At the beginning of February there were several days of rioting in Mitrovica, which is divided between Serb and Albanian areas. Several civilians were killed or injured and 11 KFOR personnel were hurt by rioting Albanians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, together with its European partners, is making a contribution towards the resolution of the problems in Kosovo both directly and within <Col N="1007" /> international bodies &ndash; United Nations, EU, OSCE and the Council of Europe. Ireland has also contributed a transport company from the Defence Forces to KFOR and Irish civilian personnel recruited under the aegis of my Department are working with the OSCE Mission in Kosovo. This is in addition to the Irish contribution to the humanitarian relief effort there.</P>
    <P>As regards humanitarian aid and aid for reconstruction, directly and through the EU, substantial assistance has already been provided and will continue throughout this year. In 1999 the Government provided £6 million in humanitarian assistance for Kosovo and Kosovar refugees. At the Second Donors' Conference for Kosovo in November, Ireland pledged to provide at least £1 million to aid rehabilitation and reconstruction during 2000. In addition, the European Commission has made 360 million euros, £283 million, available for assistance within Kosovo this year. This package is part of a much larger programme covering the whole western Balkans region.</P>
    <P>In spite of the security situation, which has been and will remain a major concern, I consider that political progress has been made with the setting up of the interim administrative council and the JIAS and substantial steps towards involving the local population in their own government. The local political party centres opened by the OSCE last year to help local politicians prepare to operate democratic structures are successful. It is hoped, when electoral registration currently under way is complete, to hold elections later this year. This will be major step towards setting up democratic governmental structures in Kosovo.</P>
    <P>It would be premature, however, to speak of a settlement. The Serb community remains to be convinced that its interests are best served by participating in the JIAS. Some Kosovo Albanian political leaders show signs of being willing to take the lead in responding to calls by UNMIK to dissociate themselves from attacks on the Serb community, but it may be some time before the Serb community will feel confident enough to play a full role in the political life of the province. Once Serb participation is achieved the task of setting up agreed governmental structures following elections will have to be completed. Further down the road decisions will have to be made as to the eventual status of Kosovo.</P>
    <P>Human rights is a major concern of UNMIK. It has set up an ombudsman's office to act as an agency guaranteeing human rights and to deal with complaints against the civil administration of Kosovo. It is working with the International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to resolve questions concerning persons who have been missing since the conflict. I consider that the best way in which Ireland can assist in addressing human rights abuses in Kosovo is in assisting UNMIK and supporting its work in international fora, such as the UN General <Col N="1008" /> Assembly, the OSCE and the Council of Europe, and practically on the ground.</P>

      <P>Since 1997, a total of £134,777 has been provided in support of projects in East Timor from Ireland aids, human rights and democratisation scheme. This scheme aims to contribute to capacity-building in relation to democratic processes and institutions and the promotion and protection of human rights in developing countries.</P>
      <P>In the case of East Timor, the projects and groups supported have included a training programme on conflict resolution, developed by Trócaire and an East Timorese NGO &ndash; this project included workshops and consultations leading to a feasibility study on a programme on conflict resolution training appropriate to the context, culture and capacity of the people of East Timor; a project run by the East Timor Human Rights Centre, Melbourne, Australia &ndash; ETHRC &ndash; on the protection and promotion of human rights in East Timor &ndash; the project documented human rights violations and provided training and education in human rights for East Timorese people, with a view to building a human rights culture for the future; a human rights training and documentation programme run by the East Timor International Support Centre, Darwin, Australia, which included human rights training and the publication of a brochure on human rights violations in East Timor; and a local Timorese NGO, confidentiality requested on identity, working on increasing international awareness of the human rights situation in East Timor and promoting a just settlement of the conflict there.</P>
      <P>In addition, a contribution of £50,000 was made to the UN trust fund for East Timor, which was established to provide the funding necessary for the ballot on the future of East Timor. Funding was also provided in support of the former Minister, Deputy Andrews' role as EU Presidency personal representative to the East Timor consultation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since September 1999, Ireland Aid has allocated £700,000 in humanitarian assistance to East and West Timor. The Government is committed to spending at least a further £1.3 million. Work is currently under way on a continued strategy which will provide carefully targeted assistance to the East Timorese people in developing their self reliance and building their new nation. This task of nation building, along with reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts, will be crucial to their future. Ireland Aid plans to target its contribution in this field at initiatives developing local capacity to work towards the successful establishment of democratic processes and institutions, which will <Col N="1009" /> integrate respect for human rights into the official structures of the new nation.</P>

      <P>As member states of both the European Union and the Council of Europe, each country within the EU has undertaken to accept the standards of these organisations, in particular, democratic values, the principles of the rule of law and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The promotion and protection of human rights is an essential prerequisite to membership of either organisation.</P>
      <P>Each EU member state is party to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which is the most advanced regional provision for the protection and promotion of human rights. Full respect for human rights is part of the Copenhagen criteria which Ireland together with its EU partners considers to be an essential political qualification for EU accession.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the institutions of the EU and national parliaments are currently working on the elaboration of a charter that will contain the fundamental rights and freedoms as well as basic procedural rights guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and derived from the constitutional traditions common to the member states, as general principles of Community law. This is an unequivocal reaffirmation by the EU of the central position of human rights among its guiding principles both now and in the future.</P>
      <P>Each Council of Europe member state is responsible for upholding the standards and values of the Council, as embodied in the convention and with other instruments, with the assistance of the relevant bodies of the organisation &ndash; in particular the Committee of Ministers, the Parliamentary Assembly, the European Court of Human Rights and the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture. These bodies monitor developments and assist member states in fulfilling their obligations with regard to the commitments they entered into on joining the Council of Europe. Ireland in its chairmanship, from November 1999 to May of this year, of the Committee of Ministers has sought to promote the standards of the organisation and to encourage it to facilitate actively the democratisation process in its newer member states.</P>

      <P>Public transport investment requirements for the period 2000 to 2006 are set out in detail in the national development plan and can be summarised as follows: railway safety programme 2000-2003, £350 million; mainline rail upgrading/renewal, £150 million; short-term suburban rail development, £185 million; surface element of Luas, £430 million; and Dublin bus network development, £120 million. As regards railway safety, the national plan states that before the end of the railway safety programme in 2003, the Government will reconstitute the railway safety task force to prepare recommendations for a second five year programme.</P>
      <P>The geotechnical study of the underground element of Luas has been completed and estimates the cost of the preferred technical route alignment at about £300 million. The strategic rail study is nearing completion and I expect to receive the report shortly. It will set out recommendations, including costings, for the longer term development of the suburban rail network. The national plan includes a £500 million contingency provision for both these items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public transport investment provisions for the greater Dublin area are in accordance with the recommendations of the DTO's Dublin Transportation Blueprint 2000-2006. The DTO is currently working on an updated transportation <Col N="1011" /> strategy for the period 2000-2016 and this will identify the implications, if any, for the investment strategy set out in the blueprint.</P>
    <P>The principal funding sources for the investment programme are set out in the national development plan. They are the Exchequer, EU, PPPs and CIE internal resources. The level of Exchequer funding will be determined annually as part of the Estimates process. The Estimates provision for 2000 is £236 million, comprising £100 million for railway safety, £90 million for Luas and £46 million for other public transport investment.</P>
    <P>I have already made it clear that if further funding beyond that identified in the national development plan is required, it will be provided. The capital investment outlined above is additional to the annual Exchequer subvention to CIE, which in 2000 amounts to £115 million.</P>

For this reason initiatives to improve the level of trust Irish businesses have in the Internet are an important element in the Government's overall policy of making Ireland a first choice location for e-commerce in Europe.</P>
      <P>There are many different technological solutions to providing e-commerce security. It is important, however, to have a legal framework in place in order to ensure these solutions are recognised in law. Recently I announced that the Government was giving priority to an electronic commerce Bill which is currently being drafted. This Bill will propose a light and flexible legal framework for the use of these technologies. A consultation paper containing the outline of the legislative proposals was published on the Internet at www.ecommercegov.ie.</P>

      <P>I expect Clancy Barracks to be vacated this year and arrangements will be made for its disposal following its evacuation.</P>
      <P>At present, a board consisting of officers of the Defence Forces and departmental personnel is examining all matters arising from the proposed closure of Clancy Barracks. Among the issues to be reported on by the board is the future location of personnel and facilities. The functions of the Ordnance Corps located at Clancy Barracks will be transferred to the Curragh and the planning and design of the new facilities in this regard is at an advanced stage. Provision has also been made in the estimates for the year 2000 for the relocation of corps of engineer personnel to McKee Barracks.</P>
      <P>There are 105 civilian personnel in Clancy Barracks and officials from my Department have recently met with the closure committee in the barracks and presented a menu of options for consideration by civilian staff. These options include transfer to the Curragh, redeployment to other military barracks, redeployment to other departments which have vacancies for State industrial employees and I have recently obtained sanction from the Minister for Finance to offer the civilian employees at Clancy Barracks an enhanced redundancy package. The civilian staff have undertaken, through their closure committee, to respond to the offer in due course at which point the matter will be processed further.</P>

      <P>Under the Dúchas compensation scheme for ewes culled under the 1998 ewe supplementary measure the rates of payment were fixed at £25 for the loss of each premium under the 1999 ewe premium scheme, £11 for the loss of each grant under the 1999 sheep headage scheme and £2 for each ewe culled. The maximum payable on any ewe was therefore £38.</P>

      <P>In 1999 the person named included 44.61 hectares in his area aid application. He did not initially supply the maps <Col N="1018" /> necessary to process his 1999 area aid application. The area aid unit issued maps to the person named to enable him to outline the boundaries of the land claimed by him. These maps have not yet been returned to the area aid unit.</P>
      <P>In addition the person named also included commonage in his 1999 area aid application, but did not provide proof of his entitlement to claim this commonage. The herdowner has also been contacted in this regard, but the documentation he forwarded was not sufficient. His adviser was contacted and informed of this. No payments can issue in respect of the 1999 cattle headage and suckler cow premium schemes until all these outstanding issues have been resolved.</P>
      <P>In 1998, the person included 21.06 hectares in his area aid application. He has been paid 1998 cattle headage, suckler cow premium and special beef premium but was not eligible for any 1998 extensification premium as his stocking density was greater than 1.40 livestock units per hectare.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the person included 44.11 hectares in his area aid application. Again the area aid unit does not have the maps necessary to process his 1997 area aid application. The area aid unit has now issued maps to the person named to enable him to outline the boundaries of the land claimed by him, and a response is awaited. Cattle headage, suckler cow, special beef and extensification premiums for 1997 have been paid on the basis of the person named having a forage area of 44.11 hectares. Those payments will be reviewed when problems with the 1997 area aid application are resolved.</P>

      <P>The deadline for the completion of the Leader II programme has been extended to 31 December 2000.</P>
      <P>Following the conclusion of consultation with member states, the European Commission has indicated that it intends to finalise the guidelines for its new rural development initiative, Leader +, when European Parliament observations are received later this month.</P>
      <P>Member states will then draw up operational programmes for Leader+ for forwarding to the Commission for approval with a view to commencement of the Leader+ programme as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Additionally, a Leader mainstream programme is being funded under the national development plan. As with other measures provided for in the national development plan, approval by the European Commission is necessary to enable commencement of arrangements for the establishment of Leader mainstream activity.</P>
      <P>Pending EU clearance for Leader+ activity and mainstream activity under the NDP, it is not possible to define the precise arrangements for delivery. It is clear, however, that the Commission's intention is that funding will be confined to a limited number of rural areas and that the essential aim of the Leader+ measure will be to encourage the emergence and testing of new approaches to integrated and sustainable development.</P>
      <P>The report of the task force on the integration of local government and local development systems requires that attention be given to the avoidance of overlap between agencies including Leader groups and to explore mechanisms capable of combining rural development and rural partnership activities in rural disadvantaged areas specifically.</P>
      <P>I recognise the importance of continuity in the delivery of Leader and Leader-type rural development programmes. In this context, every effort will be made to establish the earliest implementation of the two new Leader measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided that the State Laboratory, which is under the aegis of my Department, and the other laboratories under the aegis of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, should be relocated from Abbotstown to Backweston Farm, which is situated between Lucan and Celbridge, County Kildare. The Marine Institute is being relocated to Galway.</P>
      <P>There is a need to upgrade the various State laboratories to bring them into line with best modern practice. There will be a new up to date complex of laboratories established at Backweston. This will include, as part of the State Laboratory, new and improved laboratory facilities which are needed to ensure food safety.</P>
      <P>High technology facilities of this kind are expensive. The cost of relocating all of the laboratories, including that of the Marine Institute, and of financing new scientific and laboratory equipment, is estimated by my Department, in consultation with the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Department of the Marine and National Resources as being of the order of £90 million. This estimate does not include the cost of relocating the farm at Abbotstown. This matter will be examined over the next few months by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. The estimated cost is separate from the costs of the national sports stadium. Detailed planning for the relocation of the facilities referred to by the Deputies has already commenced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, in Ireland mammography is used primarily as a diagnostic tool for symptomatic or concerned women on referral from their GPs and in some cases for women at particular risk of developing the disease. Breast cancer screening involves the carrying out of mammography on a mass population basis. The aim is to lead to earlier detection and treatment of breast cancer in asymptomatic women.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in March 1997, my predecessor gave the go ahead for the introduction of Phase 1 of the National Breast Screening Programme for the target population of women aged 50-64, in the Eastern, North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas. There will be two central units located at St. Vincent's Hospital and at the Mater Hospital, where the screening, assessment and treatment of women will be carried out using a multi-disciplinary approach. In addition, the use of mobile units by BreastCheck, the National Breast Screening Board, will ensure that the screening service is accessible to all women in the target age group in these areas. Phase 1 of the programme is under way and currently has three mobile units. The number of mobile screening units will be increased in number as required to deliver an optimal local service. My intention is to provide a top quality service which meets best international standards. I am satisfied that the careful planning and deliberation by the National Breast Screening Committee over the past two years in relation to all aspects of the programme will ensure that we can offer a service which is underpinned by standards of excellence and one which will ultimately pay dividends in terms of reductions in mortality among women in the target population. Decisions in relation to subsequent phases of the programme will be guided by the experience gained from putting Phase 1 of the programme in place. The steering committee has recommended that Phase 11 of the programme should follow Phase 1 as soon as is practicable.</P>
      <P>My Department is very conscious of the importance of early access to symptomatic mammography services and of the provision of an equivalent standard of excellence in both symptomatic and screening mammography services. For this reason, I have requested the National Cancer Forum to undertake a review of symptomatic breast cancer services at national level and it will report back to my Department shortly.</P>

      <P>The provision of drug treatment services in the Dublin area is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>According to a recent report which reviewed drug services in the Eastern Health Board area the authors found that there has been a remarkable degree of activity and expansion within the drug treatment services in the area over the past five years. A programme of service expansion was embarked on that is probably one of the more innovative community drug service programmes in Europe. The drug services have expanded from three locations to over 50 locations in the space of these five years.</P>
      <P>The board's policy is to provide locally based community services in areas of identified need and it provides a range of treatment services including counselling, maintenance, rehabilitation and prevention services.</P>
      <P>Currently, the drug treatment centre at Trinity Court provides services to drug misusers who are unstable or who have no service provision in their local areas. I understand from the board that the waiting time for services in Trinity Court is varied but the average waiting time is three months. However, clients identified as being in special risk categories, such as pregnant women are given immediate priority.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has identified a need for a further five treatment locations to be established in the year 2000 which will facilitate the movement of clients from Trinity Court back to their local community. When these centres are established the waiting times for the drug treatment centre at Trinity Court should be considerably reduced. Significant progress has already been achieved in relation to the establishment of three of these centres.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the organisation and management of the national blood transfusion service rests with the Blood Transfusion Service Board. It is a key priority of the BTSB to develop a modern transfusion service in line with current and emerging international standards. Transfusion <Col N="1028" /> medicine is undergoing rapid change. Significant changes are taking place internationally in relation to the collection, processing, testing and use of blood. The level of activity at the BTSB is dictated to a significant degree by the demands of hospitals for blood components and by the rapid pace of developments in transfusion medicine. The volume of whole blood necessary to meet hospital demands continues to decrease nationally. In 1999 a reduction of approximately 5% took place. The BTSB considers that further decreases in blood requirements will continue as a result of more efficient management of the blood supply involving the BTSB and hospitals. In addition, hospital based surgical transfusion support programmes are also available which reduce the need for blood transfusions. Significant developments are also taking place within the pharmaceutical industry in developing haemoglobin solutions as substitutes for human blood. In parallel, the BTSB is also required to meet more demanding regulatory requirements as specified by the Irish Medicines Board. It is also required to introduce proven technologies and new screening tests in line with international practice. These requirements also impact on the current and future level of activity at the BTSB.</P>
      <P>For my part, I will ensure that the board is adequately resourced so that it continues to meet international standards effectively and expeditiously. In that regard, resources are available to the board to recruit on a joint basis with the Southern Health Board, an additional consultant haematologist who will be based at the Cork centre. This appointment has significant potential to enhance and develop existing services at the Cork centre and in the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>As regards capital developments at the Cork centre, I outlined the current position on this matter in my parliamentary reply to the Deputy on 8 February, 2000. The position is that my Department will consider an application from the BTSB for further capital investment in the Cork centre as a matter of priority. A detailed planning brief is currently being prepared and a project team has been appointed within the BTSB. It is not possible at this stage to assess the likely costs involved. As the Cork centre is located on the campus of St. Finnbarr's Hospital, the BTSB has also written to the Southern Health Board seeking discussions in relation to its leasehold interest in the site.</P>

      <P>As already advised to the House on 27 January and 1 February last, the Adoption Board is an independent statutory body with primary responsibility for matters related to adoption. Its experience and expertise in this area is well established. The reasoning behind the Adoption <Col N="1030" /> Board's decision has already been outlined in detail. I am satisfied that this important issue was given very careful consideration by the board before any decision was made and my predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Fahey, was informed in advance of the board's intention to issue this guidance.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that the board is obliged to consider the welfare of the child as of paramount importance in all decisions it makes. In this context, it has allowed exceptions to age limits in cases where prospective adoptive parents have a pre-existing relationship with the child or where a sibling becomes available for adoption. I also note that the Adoption Board have pointed out that approximately 90% of couples who have applied to have their inter-country adoptions recognised under Irish law or to have Irish adoption orders made where the board was not in a position to recognise their inter-country adoptions, have come within the board's guidelines on age.</P>

      <P>Before funding was agreed to the voluntary driving instructor register in 1996, the register had to satisfy my Department that its organisation and structures would be capable of achieving and maintaining a high standard of driving instruction among its members. In order to become a qualified instructor under the scheme, it is necessary to pass a three-part examination and be subject to regular review. The DIR also had to demonstrate that it had wide acceptance among driving instructors by showing that it had at least 300 members.</P>
      <P>These conditions were met and the DIR has received funding amounting to £120,000 from my Department to date. Financial support has also been provided by the Irish Insurance Federation.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 the financial assistance provided in 1999 included an amount which enabled the DIR to obtain ISO 9002 quality certification.</P>

      <P>Contributions paid prior to 1953 are already taken into account in assessing title to the old age (contributory) pension to the extent that they can be used to satisfy the &lsquo;total contributions paid' requirement. However, certain people who paid contributions prior to 1953 under the National Health Insurance Acts have failed to qualify for an old age (contributory) pension. As I indicated in my budget speech, the Department has been examining ways in which further recognition can be given to pre-1953 contributions.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I have made provision, in the Social Welfare Bill, 2000, to introduce a special pension which will take account of contributions paid prior to 1953. Any person insured prior to 1953 with at least five years paid insurance which may comprise national health insurance or a combination of such insurance and social insurance since 1953 may now qualify for a special rate pension.</P>
      <P>This will be paid at the special rate of 50%  &ndash; i.e. £48 &ndash; of the maximum weekly personal rate. Equivalent increases for adult and child dependents will be paid, where applicable. Entitlement under the new pension arrangements will commence from May 2000.</P>
      <P>The entitlement of the person concerned will be examined as soon as possible and he will, of course, be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <P>A range of further significant improvements to these tapering arrangements were announced in the recent budget.

Most notably, these changes include: an adjustment in the income range over which the tapering arrangements apply from the current £60 to £105, to £70 to £135; an improvement in the withdrawal rate of the QAA; the deferral of the reduction of 50% in the level of child dependant allowances, which currently takes effect when the income of the spouse exceeds £60, until such income exceeds £135.</P>
      <P>I am also providing for the extension of tapering arrangements to long-term welfare payments such as invalidity pension, retirement pension and old age (contributory) pension with effect from April 2000.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 171, 172 and 173 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a member of the International Whaling Commission &ndash; IWC  &ndash; which has primary responsibility for the management and conservation of whale stocks. In recent years, the IWC has devoted considerable resources to the consideration of all threats to the conservation of whales. In addition to the more historical threat posed by hunting and over-exploitation of whale stocks, threats posed by pollution, climate change, habitat loss, ship strikes etc. have all received critical attention by the IWC and have been subject to considerable discussion and investigation by the scientific committee. I am pleased to note that at the 51st meeting of the IWC held in May 1999 two specific resolutions on related topics were adopted by the commission with the support of the delegation from Ireland. IWC resolution 1999-5 on the funding of high priority scientific research made available additional funds from the commission's reserves for research on environmental threats to cetaceans while IWC resolution 1999-4 on health effects from the consumption of cetaceans called on relevant countries to take measures to reduce pollution that may cause negative health effects from the consumption of cetacean products. It is a matter for each Member of Government to evaluate the threat to human health and take appropriate measures. As you are aware, whalemeat is not for sale in Ireland. This resolution also provided for a continuous review by the commission of this issue. The scientific committee has also been requested to ensure that pollution effects on endangered whale species are taken into account in calculating quotas under the revised management scheme &ndash; RMS.</P>
      <P>Also at the 51st meeting of the IWC, Resolution No: 1999-6 was adopted, with strong support from Ireland. This resolution called upon CITES (convention on international trade in endangered species) to reaffirm at its forthcoming meeting in April 2000 the continued co-operation between CITES and the IWC. It also advised the conference that zero catch limits are still in force for species of whales which are managed by the international whaling commission. While the IWC has competence in relation to conservation and management of whale stocks, CITES has competence in relation to the trade in endangered species including whales and whale products. Ireland strongly supports the continuation of the existing ban on international trade in whales currently in place for whale stocks by the IWC. We have already put this view forward strongly both in IWC and at EU meetings and will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The compromise proposals put forward by Ireland for consideration by the IWC in 1997 provided, <i>inter alia,</i> that any quotas arising would be <Col N="1040" /> for local consumption only with no provision for international trade. On this basis, the proposals put forward by Ireland in no way compromise any deliberations at the CITES conference. Indeed, I would suggest that the Irish proposals would reinforce the position of seeking a continuing restriction on international trade in whale products at CITES at this time and in the longer term, if adopted, would strengthen the restriction of international trade as all parties in IWC, including those now proposing to lift the trade ban, would have voluntarily accepted as part of the agreement that there would be no international trade for whales.</P>
    <P>The proposals put forward for consideration by Ireland, as well as a ban on international trade, also included: (a) completion of the revised management scheme, (b) where quotas are justified under the RMS, these should be restricted to coastal areas only, (c) lethal scientific whaling should be phased out over a period, and (d) regulations on whale watching should be prepared. I would like to remind the Deputy of the context in which the package of proposals were put forward by Ireland where there was continuing concern among many member states of the IWC regarding the serious impasse reached in relation to fundamental issues on whaling. Despite the moratorium on commercial whaling, Ireland noted that whaling was continuing to take place within the terms of the convention under objection to the moratorium or under Article VIII (scientific whaling). The trend in the number of whales taken has continued to increase with 383 whales taken in 1992 increasing to 1,114 in 1998. This trend is still continuing and it would be remiss of Ireland to withdraw our proposals for tighter controls on whaling unless our proposals are replaced by credible alternative proposals for better control measures. Ireland's objective has been and continues to be that of reaching consensus within the IWC on a package of measures for the control and regulation of whaling, including scientific whaling and whaling carried out under objection, to ensure that the conservation status of any whale population is not compromised.</P>

      <P>In general, my Department does not directly provide financial support for the restoration of buildings in private ownership. However, one source of public funds for such projects is the Heritage Council, which has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage. It should be noted that, although my Department funds the Heritage Council, it is an independent statutory body established under the Heritage Act, 1995 and I have no function in relation to any decisions by it regarding the disbursal of grants.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that in May 1998, together with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I launched the package of proposals for strengthening the protection of the architectural heritage. That package, which is being progressively implemented by both Departments, adopts a comprehensive approach to the protection of our architectural heritage in its many and varied forms, rather than singling out individual aspects of that heritage. As part of the package, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government recently launched a grant scheme for the conservation of protected buildings, which is being administered by local authorities with funding in the order of £4 million per annum. All inquiries relating to this scheme should be directed to the relevant local authority.</P>
      <P>Finally, the owner or occupier of a building which is determined by me to be a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, and which is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to be a building to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, can apply under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for relief in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of the building. Ultimately, the decision to allow tax relief in respect of an approved building is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 353 convicted sex offenders in custody in Irish prisons on Wednesday, 9 February 2000. Ten of these offenders are currently undertaking the specialised sex offender group treatment programme in Arbour Hill prison. A further 13 have undertaken the programme in previous years.</P>
      <P>Public discussion and commentary about this issue frequently implies there is only one form of rehabilitation programme in place for sex offenders in Irish prisons and that it reaches a very limited number of prisoners annually. This is incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are actually four forms of direct therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders within the Irish prison system at present. All four are aimed at enabling such offenders gain some measure of control over their personal tendencies towards offending behaviour. The first intervention method is individual counselling from my Department's psychology service and from the probation and welfare service. This is a largely demand led service to individual prisoners who ask for help. The second intervention is a multi-disciplinary thinking skills group work programme which focuses on issues such as anger management, evasion of personal responsibility and relapse prevention. This programme is in place in Cork Prison and Arbour Hill Prison since 1998. The third programme which tends to receive most media coverage is an extremely intensive offence focused group work programme which is available in Arbour Hill Prison and which is delivered by officers of the probation and welfare and psychology services of my Department. The fourth intervention which perhaps deserves greater acknowledgement involves the psychiatric service which provides extensive <Col N="1043" /> support to prisoners in this category. This is done on a sessional basis, and a call-out basis as well as in response to particular individual crises.</P>
    <P>I have asked the director general of the Prisons Service to ensure that the treatment of sex offenders throughout the prison system is given priority attention. I have since been assured by him that this matter is being given personal attention by him. Given that there are more sex offenders in custody in the Curragh than any other prison &ndash; 90 plus &ndash; except Arbour Hill, efforts are being concentrated there at present.</P>
    <P>A working group chaired by the Prisons Service director general and comprising representatives of all the relevant agencies and prison disciplines is currently overseeing the introduction of a number of interventions for sex offenders in the Curragh. Prisoners and staff at the Curragh have all now been notified of the inception of the new prisoner programmes there, one exclusively involving specialist staff as in the intensive Arbour Hill programme and the other programme on the same pattern as the thinking skills programmes in Cork and Arbour Hill which are delivered by multi-disciplinary teams, including especially selected and trained prison officers.</P>
    <P>The first step being taken involves the expansion of generic therapeutic services in the Curragh. The probation and welfare service and the psychology service of the Department are recruiting extra staff at present and it is intended that the Curragh will have priority in the allocation of resources. Already a member of the psychology service has taken up an assignment to the Curragh in recent days. He will be joining a probation officer who has also been assigned to duties there in recent months. They will be joined in their work with offenders at the Curragh by further members of their services as the &ldquo;roll out&rdquo; of support services for sex offenders at the prison continues.</P>
    <P>The sequence which will be followed at the Curragh will be as follows; analysis of response by individual prisoners and staff to circular from governor as to their willingness to participate in the new   programme &ndash; February 2000; selection and training of local staff in all disciplines and services in thinking skills programme and selection of first prisoner participants, and; delivery of first modules of thinking skills programme, late Summer 2000; roll-out of intensive sex offenders treatment programme later in the year 2000 drawing particularly on successful offender participants in the thinking skills programme at the Curragh.</P>
    <P>The thinking skills course referred to above was introduced in Arbour Hill and Cork prison early in 1998. It is designed to target a range of offenders including sex offenders, particularly with a view to motivating the latter group to engage in the most intensive programmes. The <Col N="1044" /> course is run by multi-disciplinary teams, including prison officers, probation and welfare staff and teaching staff under the guidance of my Department's psychology service. The skills taught in this programme include general strategies for recognising problems, analysing them and considering non-criminal alternatives, how to consider the consequences of their behaviour &ndash; to think before they act, how to go beyond their own view of the world and consider the thoughts and feelings of other people and how to develop the ability to control their own behaviour and avoid acting impulsively. This programme is considered by the director general and his advisers to be the preferred first line of approach to rehabilitating sex offenders in custody as in many cases it builds up their frequently low personal motivation to address offending behaviour in depth.</P>
    <P>When the intensive sex offenders treatment programme is introduced in the Curragh during the current year it will be operated by the probation and welfare service and psychology service in the same mode as the current Arbour Hill programme.</P>
    <P>I have also been advised by the director general that he has deputed a senior member of his transition team at prison governor level and another colleague to investigate the possibility of extending the range of multi-disciplinary group work programmes with sex offenders here based on successful interventions which have been developed in prisons in Scotland and England in recent years. This particular study is not expected to be completed until early next year.</P>
    <P>The ultimate objective for the Prisons Service is to develop and put in place a wider range of rehabilitation programmes for sex offenders than are currently available, to ensure they operate on independently accredited selection, training and service methods and that they reach every sex offender in custody who is willing to participate at some level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention. The latter point about willingness by prisoners convicted of sex offences to co-operate in personal rehabilitation programmes is significant because it is the experience in many prison jurisdictions including Ireland that a significant percentage of prisoners decline the opportunity to partake in this work. Compulsion is not a realistic or indeed legal option in such cases.</P>
    <P>Finally I would like to make it known that a major review of the effectiveness of the intensive Arbour Hill sex offender programme is currently under way between the psychology service of this Department and the Department of Psychology, University College, Dublin.</P>

    <P>*Cloverhill Prison was not open at this stage.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>There were 220 prisoners on temporary release on 1 February 2000 of whom 181 were male offenders and 39 were female. This represents 7% of the total number of prisoners serving a sentence on that day and also, incidentally, represents a considerable reduction over the past two years in the proportion of prisoners on temporary release &ndash; in February 1998 the figure stood at 506 which represented 17% of the total prison population.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the levels of overcrowding experienced in the last number of years are expected to diminish as the current prison building programme progresses. The population of Cloverhill Prison will continue to increase in a controlled fashion by transferring groups of prisoners from Mountjoy. When fully operational, all remand prisoners will be committed directly to this prison. In addition, the new women's prison, known as &ldquo;The Dóchas Centre&rdquo;, is now fully operational. This has created a further 60 spaces which have reverted to St. Patrick's Institution. A further 515 places will also become available in the near future with the opening of the new midlands prison at Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>In addition, planning for the refurbishment of Mountjoy prison is under way, with the intention of providing single-cell accommodation for all prisoners. The provision of a new range of work training, education and recreational facilities is also included in the refurbishment.</P>

      <P>My Department has been allocated £250 million under the national development plan for the next seven years to fund the development of child care under a range of initiatives over the course of the plan.</P>
      <P>The initiatives that will be funded include the expansion of the equal opportunities child care programme as well as provision of funding towards the development of local child care network initiatives to provide mutual support for providers and facilitate the dissemination of information and learning materials thereby assisting the provision of a high quality service to parents and children. A further element will be the provision of a new capital grant scheme for child care providers caring for up to 20 child care places to assist in upgrading their facilities thus helping them to provide a better quality environment for children under their care.</P>
      <P>The criteria and the eligibility requirements for each of the measures are being developed at present and it is intended to promote the various initiatives in the coming weeks, at which stage information leaflets and application forms will be available from the equal opportunities child care section of my Department.</P>
      <P>The taxation measures in place concerning child care facilities may be of interest to the Deputy. These measures include an accelerated capital allowance at the rate of up to 100% on expenditure incurred in the construction, refurbishment or extension of premises to be used for child care purposes. In addition, the provision of free or subsidised child care facilities by employers, whether in-house or in premises made available by the employer in another location, is exempt from a benefit-in-kind charge on employees benefiting from the facilities.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to provide a caretaker and secretarial service for Scoil Áine senior national school, Raheny, Dublin 5.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This scheme is, however, being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress &ndash; PESP &ndash; a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil, based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grant.</P>
      <P>With effect from January of this year, all primary schools with 100 or more pupils have become eligible for a grant towards secretarial and caretaking services under this scheme. Costing £2.7 million, this improvement of the scheme will benefit approximately 650 schools serving 90,000 pupils. My Department is currently making arrangements for the issuing of these grants to schools and it is expected that they will issue in March of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that an additional £9 million was provided for in the recent budget, over the next two years, which will enable me to extend and improve the supports available to all primary schools. Details of the implementation of this will be worked out in the near future following consultations and will, when <Col N="1049" /> taken together with the earlier move, make a major contribution to assisting schools.</P>
    <P>The position regarding the school referred to by the Deputy is that it is currently involved in a secretarial sharing arrangement with another school under the 1978 scheme. In addition to the shared secretary arrangement, the school also currently receives £15 per pupil, towards the cost of caretaking services, under the PESP scheme.</P>
    <P>I recently met with the principal of this school to discuss this and other issues of concern to the school authorities. I am having the matter examined in my Department in the context of the working out of the details of the improvements in the scheme outlined above.</P>

      <P>The needs of pupils such as those referred to by the Deputy are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the support where necessary, of the remedial or resource teacher service. Both of these services have been significantly expanded in the current school year. The remedial service is now available in all schools with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or more. The resource teacher service is now available on an automatic basis to any child in the primary system who has been assessed as requiring such support.</P>
      <P>For some children, the severity of their condition can be such that placement in a special school or in a special class attached to an ordinary school is the required response. At present, there are four such special schools and 16 special classes catering for children with specific learning disability, including dyslexia. All these facilities operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 11:1 and pupils attending these facilities attract an enhanced level of capitation funding.</P>
      <P>Children with special needs, including those with dyslexia, can also qualify for funding for special equipment where the need for such support has been established.</P>
      <P>My Department does not provide direct funding to individual parents to assist them in learning teaching methods to enable them to assist their children at home. The resources available to my Department are generally targeted towards school based supports for children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia.</P>
      <P>However, in addition to the range of in-school supports made available to children with dyslexia, my Department supports the out of school programmes which the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities provides for children with dyslexia and their parents. In the current year, my Department is allocating £50,000 to support the work of the association.</P>
      <P>I will arrange to have my Department's inspectorate examine the needs of the children to which the Deputy refers to ensure that adequate educational provision is made available to them.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case made by the school in question for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach recently launched a major £194 million plan to tackle educational disadvantage at all levels. A key objective of this plan is to ensure that support services for disadvantaged pupils are properly targeted at those most in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traditional approaches to addressing the problem of educational disadvantage have lacked the <Col N="1053" /> necessary flexibility to target individual and small groups of pupils suffering educational disadvantage. The system has tended to concentrate resources on schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantaged pupils, while failing to give adequate support to other schools with smaller but nonetheless serious pockets of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Under the New Deal &ndash; A Plan for Educational Opportunity it is intended that all primary schools, including the school to which the Deputy refers, will be surveyed to identify the precise distribution of disadvantaged pupils across the system. It is intended that this survey will be carried out during the current school term.</P>
    <P>In response to the levels of disadvantage identified through the survey, additional supports will be made available to schools to meet the needs of their pupils. The level and nature of the support services made available will vary depending on the level of need identified.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that it is my intention to attach particular priority to the issue of educational disadvantage and to ensure that an efficient and effective system of support for disadvantaged pupils is put in place by my Department.</P>
