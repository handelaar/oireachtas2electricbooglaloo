      <P>This package of taxation measures, this considerable transfer of the burden of taxation from the direct to the indirect sector, is clearly an application of monetarist doctrine.  Apart from the specific measures of taxation now being imposed, there were a number of references and suggestions throughout the budget speech yesterday which clearly indicate a monetarist approach by the Government.  There are references to savings by Government Departments, hospital and prescription charges, the drug refund scheme, the public service, pay and recruitment in the public service, social welfare benefits acting as disincentives, and over a wide area there are <Col N="717" /> ominous indications that a deflationary philosophy now rules.  Let all those supporting the Government be warned and clearly understand that this penal budget in all its implications for the poorer and weaker sections of the community is only the start.  It is a pointer to the uncaring, harsh monetarist road we will follow unless something happens to bring about a change of course.</P>
      <P>This budget will reduce growth, increase unemployment and inflation and lead to a significant drop in living standards for the working family, especially the lower paid, while doing very little to reduce borrowing or the current budget deficit which it is supposed to achieve.  It is clearly deflationary.  Lest anyone think that my claim that the budget is deflationary in its impact is not well founded, let me refer such a person to the clear statement in the budget arithmetic which takes £20 million off revenue buoyancy to cater for the impact of the budgetary measures.  In other words on its own face and its own arithmetic, the budget clearly implies that it is defaltionary in its overall impact.</P>
      <P>Let me remind the House that the Labour Party promised in their programme that &ldquo;a policy of deflation must be resisted as it will simply lead to more unemployment&rdquo;.  Where are the authors of that Labour Party document today? They are presiding over and taking responsibility for the introduction of deflationary monetarist policies for Ireland which will affect almost all working people.  The same document stated that &ldquo;social welfare recipients must be guaranteed real increases in incomes&rdquo;. Those on unemployment and disability benefit will suffer a guaranteed real drop in incomes as a result of the budget.  I hope we will hear from those Labour Party spokesmen who were so eloquent in the past at pleading the case of social welfare recipients and lower paid families during the course of the debate and that they will be able to reconcile for us the clear unequivocal statement in their election manifesto with what they introduced and supported here yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government have no mandate to <Col N="718" /> establish such monetarist policies as they embarked on.  We made it clear through our election campaign that we rejected monetarism and deflationary policies as inappropriate to our circumstances.  We emerged from the election as the largest single party with the endorsement of nearly half the electorate.  Our policy of productive investment had by far the greatest volume of support from the electorate. No substantial segment of the electorate voted for the sort of policies these far-reaching proposals introduced yesterday represent.  There is no electoral mandate for them.  In imposing these measures the Government are acting in an authoritarian manner and against the general view of the electorate fully and clearly expressed in the election last month.</P>
    <P>Apart from the election verdict, anyone taking an interest in politics would have been entitled to assume that what happened here yesterday could not possibly have occurred under a Government led by Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  As late as April 1981 when he was asked about taxation he said, as reported in a magazine article, that he would hope that increases in taxation would be limited to the purposes of helping agriculture and industry and some other areas which involve relatively minor sums of money rather than using increases in taxation as a means of reducing the budget deficit. That, the Taoiseach said, would be a last resort to be used only after we had failed to achieve buoyancy and then failed to cut expense.  There is nothing in that about the books being in a worse condition than the people on the opposite side expected them to be.</P>

      <P>At the time in April 1981 Fine Gael and their friendly commentators were preaching the message of gloom and doom, that message that we had so much of yesterday and also all last week.  Monetarism is a harsh, uncaring economic policy.  It puts book-keeping before people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Monetarism takes no account of the social degradation, of the waste of human talent and potential, of the hardship and misery that unemployment involves.  On the contrary &mdash; and I hope this message will be accepted by those on the Labour benches &mdash; monetarism uses unemployment as a weapon of economic management.  In its operation monetarism can have the most serious consequences.  We have seen this happen elsewhere.  It alienates people from Government and Government from people, leading to widespread social unrest, riots and disruption.  I have heard it said that on any occasion when the policies of that American economist who was the high priest of monetarism were actually put into effect, the troops were on the streets within a very short time.  I used to think that was humorous exaggeration but looking at what is happening across the water, I am not so sure.</P>
      <P>We have had a massive campaign in the media for the purpose of conditioning the public into accepting these deflationary monetarist policies.  The great lie is now being disseminated that there is a budget deficit of £950 million.  There is nothing of the sort.  I was particularly distressed for the sake of Deputy Sherlock who, when taking part with me in a television programme, allowed himself to fall publicly for this piece of deceptive propaganda.  The budget deficit for the first six months of this year is £457 million. That is the only definite figure available to us at this time of the year.  All the rest is projection and conjecture.  It is dishonest and misleading to put forward this figure of £950 million at this stage in the year as if it were a realised fact.  The deficit is described in the recent Government White Paper only as something which is emerging.  I should like to draw the attention of Deputies to the tables that have been issued in connection with the budget and where for the first time an exotic type of column of figures appears which is headed &ldquo;Emerging Position&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I have been in this House for a considerable time and I have studied many budgetary tables pertaining to budgetary statements but this is the first time that I have ever found a budgetary table headed, &ldquo;Emerging Position&rdquo;. There is something new all the time.  That particular Government White Paper needs to be carefully scrutinised and assessed.  One leader writer raised the question recently of an apparent change of heart by the Department of Finance.  I submit that he or she was right to do so but the explanation is to be found in the nature of the White Paper as published. On previous occasions a White Paper of that sort would have represented an objective and impartial assessment of a given situation by experts in the Department of Finance.  On this occasion it is clear that the White Paper is no such document, that on the contrary it has a high input of a political nature which could have emanated only from the Government.</P>
      <P>This current spate of criticism of our handling of the nation's finance is both reckless and unjustified.  It is reckless because charges of serious disorder in our finances and an accusation of economic chaos seriously undermines confidence in our economy, damages our prospects and discourages investment and enterprise. All of this criticism is clearly directed towards giving some credibility to the Government's extraordinary decision to transfer a major share of the tax burden from direct to indirect taxes.  The propaganda campaign in the media has been at an unprecedented level.  There have been sensational headlines, reports of roundthe-clock Cabinet meetings, state of the nation broadcasts and so on.  All these and more have been availed of to stampede public opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is this a good approach to Government? Is it honest Government? I never have denied the seriousness of our economic difficulties and the depth of the economic recession which prevails throughout the world and in which we have had to conduct our affairs.  I continually stressed this in many of my speeches as Taoiseach.  For the Government to <Col N="721" /> pretend now after the election that they were not aware of the economic situation is simply not credible.  In speech after speech they claimed to know that our economic and financial difficulties were much greater than they appeared.  Long before the election campaign was announced the Taoiseach made a number of speeches attacking our public finances, attacking even our credit rating in the financial markets and claiming that it was only a matter of time before the IMF would have to intervene in our affairs. How can he claim now that he did not know how bad the situation was?  According to his speeches of the last 12 months matters could not have been worse.</P>
    <P>We disagree fundamentally with this Government not only in their assessment of the present state of the economy but, even more important, on the course of action they are now undertaking.  We have claimed consistently and we still claim that during the past 18 months we succeeded in bringing this small economy of ours through the worst international recession of modern times relatively safely and in far better shape than most of our European neighbours.  Do none of these commentators ever look around the world outside when they complain about the state of our economy and try to make some comparisons?  Do they ever look at the situation in Northern Ireland, in Great Britain or on the European mainland and see the levels of unemployment prevailing in such places combined with the absence of any form of growth?  I reject completely the charge that the economy has been mismanaged.  That charge has been made for political motives but unfortunately it carries the risk of jeopardising confidence in our economy.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the facts about the present state of our economy.  Despite the depth and the intensity of the current world recession our economy is basically in good shape and well poised to take advantage of an upturn in the world economy. This year in Ireland, alone among the countries of Europe, we will achieve a growth rate of approximately 2 per cent.  Even the Government in their White Paper and all the commentators <Col N="722" /> agree on that.  Our currency has maintained its position in the EMS.  Inflation was coming down.  Unemployment had stabilised and the figures were showing signs of decreasing as a result of the record number of jobs that were being created.</P>
    <P>We have protected the living standards of our people to the greatest possible extent and we have managed to give a real improvement to those in receipt of social welfare benefits.  Our job creation programme was proceeding at a highly satisfactory rate and we were creating about 40,000 new jobs this year.  Agriculture was recovering.  Our massive investment plan of £1.7 billion was proceeding on target.  Already the results of that investment programme were beginning to appear in an improving infrastructure, better energy and telecommunications facilities, roads, transport and more schools, hospitals and housing. Industrial relations have been very good this year.  There was no major disruption of the public services.  Does all that represent a picture of an economy in chaos as we are now told?</P>
    <P>We are criticised principally for the size of the budget deficit.  All those Coalition commentators who are busy decrying the size of the current deficit seem to have forgotten completely that the biggest ever budget deficit as a percentage of GNP was in 1975 under the last Coalition Government.  While borrowing should, of course, be concentrated in the greatest possible extent of productive investment, the need to counteract a savage recession and to maintain employment and public services required us as a Government to tolerate a deficit if serious disruption of the economy and hardship to ordinary men and women were to be avoided.  The time to reduce the budget deficit is when the economy improves so that it can be done smoothly and gradually without causing undue hardship.  The reaction of the present Government at this stage, half-way through the year, is a premature panic reaction which will undermine confidence and set back seriously the recovery which was just beginning to emerge.</P>
    <P>In our view, the most serious omission <Col N="723" /> in the Government's proposals is the absence of any action or proposal for action in regard to unemployment or provision for unemployment.  The opposite is the case and the whole thrust of the measures is towards unemployment.  Let us look first of all at the world prospects with regard to employment.  According to the <i>OECD Economic Outlook</i> for July 1981 the unemployment rate for the OECD area has increased to 6.6 per cent of its labour force in the second half of 1980.  The total number of unemployed in the area in 1980 was 21.5 million people and that is expected to increase to 24.5 million in 1981 and to not less than 26 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>It is hardly the right time for us to bring in measures which can only damage employment prospects here further.  I advise the Government before going too far down this monetarist road to look at the situation in the UK.  Unemployment there is reaching crisis proportions as reflected in social unrest all over the country.  It is approaching the 3 million mark &mdash; I believe 2.8 million is the latest figure.  The prospects are for a total of 3.5 to 4 million within the next 12 months. So much for the deployment of deflationary monetarist policies when an international economic recession is in force. To what purpose is all that unemployment and all that incredible waste of resources taking place in the UK?  The ostensible reason was to cut the public sector borrowing requirements.  That is what they call it over there.  Of course, what has happened is that with the additional cost of all the unemployment benefits they had to pay and all the other social benefits added to the cost the whole monetary strategy in the last few years in the UK has been an abject, total failure.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the only final and real result of deflationary policies is that people are put out of jobs.  In a word, this new monetarist approach which we are adopting here will have disastrous implications for employment, particularly for youth employment.  Government policies should be judged on their impact on employment and I believe that in that regard monetarism contains <Col N="724" /> within itself the seed of its own destruction.</P>
    <P>Our approach to our economic management at this time as we emerge from the recession is completely different from that which this Government have chosen. In this connection I would like to direct the attention of Deputies to two independent assessments of our economy. The first is that contained in the recent <i>OECD Economic Outlook</i> report which I have just referred to.  In that report it is stated &mdash; and I acknowledge that there is some implied criticism of our Government in this &mdash; that much of the recent inflation is accounted for by recent indirect tax increases.  Now the Government are determined to exacerbate this not merely by putting up indirect taxes for a second time this year but by putting them up sharply again next January to implement their income tax package.  The report states on page 107 that on the basis of an assumed neutral budgetary stance through to 1982 the OECD expect GNP growth of 1¾ per cent this year and 2½ per cent next year.  We now know that the Government's budgetary position is not going to be neutral but will be deflationary so that progress of the sort envisaged in that OECD report is just not going to happen.</P>
    <P>With regard to our balance of payments deficit, which apparently is engendering such alarm on the opposite benches, the report says, and I quote from page 107:</P>
    <P>In view of the prospective revival in external markets from mid-1981 onwards, exports should increase strongly next year and, with lower inflation, household incomes may permit resumed growth in consumption outlays.</P>
    <P>They predict that inflation would increase to 13 per cent next year and exports recover to reduce the external deficit to 10.5 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>That, perhaps, is not the most optimistic economic scenario one could think of, nevertheless it is a clear indication that we are emerging from the recession according to the OECD experts and this certainly is not the time to set us back <Col N="725" /> again by the introduction of deflationary economic policies.  When we were in Government investment was a key, central element of our economic policy because investment today means jobs tomorrow.  Our Government stressed repeatedly the need for more investment given the present stage of development of the Irish economy.  In the section in that report headed &ldquo;Raising potential and reducing unemployment&rdquo; the OECD said and I quote from page 11:</P>
    <P>Boosting investment in physical and human capital must be a key incentive of economic policy in most countries to assure both the more vigorous expansion of productive potential and the creation of adequate new employment opportunities.  Such an expansion may however be difficult to achieve in circumstances of relatively weak demand growth and hence limited pressure on existing productive capacity.</P>
    <P>That is what we in Fianna Fáil believe and that is what we tried to put into practice.  In that OECD report is a clear affirmation of the policies we were following. Our aim was to increase our productive investment so as to be in a position to profit from the cyclical recovery in world markets and to get on to the growth path again.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to see that from Ottawa has emerged a communication which now, at last, puts the achievement of growth and employment on a par with the need to reduce inflation.  For some of the participants in that conference that is a major turn-around and something which we must all welcome.  That is the sort of situation, the pursuance of a policy of productive investment, that would have obtained assuming that our Fianna Fáil policies had been continued.  There is no hint from the OECD economic experts that drastic budgetary action is called for, rather the contrary.  The general optimistic view of our shorter and longer term prospects is taken and it is taken also in another economic comment. The US business outlook which was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 16 July last foresees rapid economic growth <Col N="726" /> in Ireland in the mid-eighties and a decline in inflation to under 10 per cent. It foresees even more dramatic improvements than the OECD experts in our balance of payments with the deficit dropping from 13 to 7 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>None of these had suggested that drastic Government action was either necessary or desirable to achieve these aims.  We do not dispute the need for prudent management of the economy.  We do not see the need for this major political manoeuvre which was engaged in yesterday. In every financial year of course there are some budget over-runs.  One could say it is an inevitable element in Government finances.  As far as I can remember, it has happened under every Government.  It is not possible to declare some established Government service bankrupt half way through the year because the Estimate has been exceeded.  That is never the way things are managed.</P>
    <P>Our view is that it will take time to tackle the problem of these budgetary excesses and make the necessary adjustments in the annual budget so as not to upset confidence.  We do not accept the needs for the burdens which were placed on our citizens yesterday.  It is no consolation for taxpayers to be told that the cost of living increases now will be compensated for next April by the Government's income tax plan.  In the meantime their standards of living are going to be clearly and positively reduced.  I want to pose this question to the Deputies and to the public &mdash; what guarantee have we that they will be able to make these changes even next April without further impositions of indirect taxation?  If they do introduce the income tax package, and that is becoming increasingly doubtful, they will need further indirect taxes to pay for the changes in income tax. What is really happening is that there is a levy on incomes, a cut in incomes and not, as we were led to believe throughout the general election campaign, a cut in income tax.</P>
    <P>It is legitimate to ask the Government about capital taxation.  The Minister for Finance, in reply to Deputy Sherlock yesterday, said that changes in capital taxation <Col N="727" /> were a very serious matter, very complex and would need great and careful preparation and would take some time to introduce.  Why could the changes in indirect taxation, changes which social welfare recipients in the lower paid worker families will have to bear, not have been delayed until this complex measure of capital taxation was introduced? In the interests of fair play, why could the two measures not have been brought in at the same time?  It is somewhat surprising that the Government now state that they have to give a lot of thought, care and preparation to the changes in capital taxation when we were led to believe, before and during the election campaign and leading up to the performance in the Gaiety Theatre, that it was all cut and dried.  The Government, particularly the Fine Gael Party and the Taoiseach, knew exactly what they were going to do when it came to increasing VAT on the necessities of life for social welfare recipients and working class people. They did it immediately.  Now, apparently, they do not know what they are going to do about capital taxes.</P>
    <P>This Government should be ashamed of what they are doing in regard to social welfare.  The increase of 5 per cent in the case of old age pensioners will, I am certain, not be sufficient to keep pace with the increase in the cost of living which is going to follow inevitably, from yesterday's taxation.  Even the most optimistic of us does not think that ultimately the increase in the cost of living index is going to settle at anywhere near 5 per cent.  Whatever about the old age pensioner and the 5 per cent, what are we to think of this miserable, derisory 3 per cent they are giving to the rest of the social welfare classes?  I remember very clearly when I was over there different Ministers being berated, especially from the Labour Party benches, because I brought in increases of 12½ per cent and 15 per cent from time to time.  I was accused of being miserly and making inadequate provision for the poor and weaker sections of the community.  Now the Government, on their own figures and their own estimates, are going to <Col N="728" /> shove up the cost of living by something in the region of 5 per cent, giving 3 per cent to the broad mass of social welfare recipients.  It has a tinge of the old Paddy McGilligan taking a shilling off the old age pensioners.  That sort of mentality is beginning to emerge tentatively from the Government.  Could they not even have given the 5 per cent across the board? What sort of book-keeping economics is this, cutting social welfare recipients from 5 per cent to 3 per cent?</P>
    <P>What are we to say about the £9.60 for the housewife in the home?  If there was one predominant feature about the election campaign it was the fact that Fine Gael canvassers and after Mass speakers made it crystal clear to the public and to the housewife that it was a simple matter of returning Fine Gael to government and the following Monday the envelopes would start popping in through the letterboxes. That was in the official literature, in advertisments and the manifesto. There was no provision made about when this £9.60 was to be paid.  When you took the combined effect of the Fine Gael canvassers on the doorsteps and the after Mass speakers&mdash;I think the Minister, Deputy Cooney, was one of them whom I would quote if I could get the record right&mdash;every housewife was led to believe if she voted in a certain way and returned Fine Gael to government, the following week, not next April, not next December or Christmas, but the following week, the £9.60 in little envelopes would start arriving in.  What has happened?  Not alone does the little envelope with the £9.60 not arrive on the Monday but we have this serious fraud perpetrated by the Government.  These same housewives are going to have considerable increases in household items inflicted upon them from now until next April.  All they are told at this stage is&mdash;live horse and you will get grass, do not mind these price impositions for the moment, bear with them, put up with the decline in your standard of living.  Next April all will be well.  We will see.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the Minister's statement yesterday that the House should take very careful note of, that is the reference to the public service.  It <Col N="729" /> seems that the public service is being singled out for special criticism and contumely. We had indications yesterday that the Government have accepted the argument put forward that the source of all our economic ills is the public service and the remuneration of the public service. I want to assure the Government that we will resist, with every means in our power, any attack upon our public service.</P>

      <P>It is all very well to talk in vague, general terms about the public service.  However, Deputies should understand about whom they are talking when they talk about the public service. They are talking about the Garda who have to go out, very often in dangerous, difficult circumstances, and protect and look after us.  They are talking about the Army, the soldiers to whom we must turn from time to time to rescue us from some difficult situation.  They are talking about the teachers who look after the youngsters in our schools.  These are all public servants.  Are they to be singled out for some special income regime which will not be applicable to the rest of the community?</P>
      <P>I want to mention two sectors of the public service of which I have particular recent knowledge and they are both perhaps, at different ends of the scale.  I refer to the experts at the higher levels of the public service who work unremittingly, day in day out&mdash;a seven day week, if necessary&mdash;to whom time means nothing, to supply us politicians, us Government Ministers with the material we need, the facts and figures and briefs.  I do not think that anybody in that catagory in the public service could possibly be regarded as being overpaid for the dedicated, devoted work which they do now and always have done and the high standards of integrity which they have always maintained.</P>

      <P>I want now to mention another sector of the public service. When I was Minister for Social Welfare, I had special knowledge of the younger, lower echelon of that Department, young people responsible for the very complex difficult administration of our social welfare services.  Through no fault of theirs there were considerable complications in the administration of that Department and serious backlogs and delays.  Those young civil servants can not be regarded by anybody as highly paid.  They work with dedication and commitment, week in week out, overtime all through the week, very often working at week-ends to try to make sure that the work of the Department is effectively discharged. When people talk about the public service and when this Government are directing their attention with particular malevolence to the public service, they should keep those two sectors in mind, because they are the only two which come to my mind immediately.  However, they are typical of the general level of service, commitment, and dedication which we are lucky enough to have prevailing throughout our public service.</P>
      <P>All our economists are agreed that income restraint and industrial peace are essential for economic development and sustained economic growth.  Yesterday's measures will certainly not help to create the right climate for either of those two objectives.  They will have the opposite effect: they will deliberately add to inflation and in that way make no economic sense at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the balance of payments point of view the competitiveness of our exports is all-important.  The budgetary policies of yesterday will certainly lead to higher production costs and this is going to impair our ability to export.  When we were in office we were constantly attacked about the CPI.  We strove to the best of our ability to keep down the prices of goods and services&mdash;not just the price of goods in the shops but the price of the essential services, the public services, which the ordinary man and woman have to have resort to.  We succeeded to some extent in maintaining some stability over the broad spectrum of prices through <Col N="731" /> food subsidies and other methods.  The Government have made a serious strategic economic mistake in abandoning that policy of ours and on the other hand, clearly introducing measures which are going to shove up prices and have the effect of triggering wage and salary demands, with very serious implications for industrial relations, and which are undoubtedly in the long term going to have serious implications for our competitiveness and capacity to export.</P>
    <P>We are broadly opposing the measures which the Government are bringing forward and in particular are we opposing the approach and philosophy which lie behind them.  Had we remained in office expenditure would have been carefully and prudently monitored and restrained for the rest of this year, but there would have been no budget until January and we would already be preparing a way for a new national understanding.  Precisely because we recognised the seriousness of the recession, we believe that this is the wrong moment to cut back investment, increase indirect taxation and to trigger off inflation.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to our present problems must be regarded as being dictated by political motives and certainly cannot inspire anybody with confidence in the integrity of their approach to our economic affairs.  I do not wish to be uncharitable to a new Government, but it would not be unfair to say that their performance so far has been erratic.  I hope, for the country's sake, that a better performance or, failing that, a better Government will not be too long delayed.</P>
    <P>I would now like to look at some of the arithmetic of this budget.  First of all there is the whole question of the budget deficit and the impact that these measures are supposed to have on it.  I suggest to the House that there is a great credibility gap opening up here.  Persistent attempts were made to condition us to accept that there was a major crisis in our public finances.  If that were so, might we not have expected some major radical attempt to reduce the deficit?  If the Government were serious in the propaganda <Col N="732" /> attempt which they undertook to condition us to these measures, I do not think we could have expected the Government to undertake additional optional expenditures. If the public finances were in such a serious state, would we have expected the Government to undertake additional expenditures on the current side?</P>
    <P>I suggest also that when one takes the pluses and the minuses into account, the overall impact on the budget deficit does not justify all the paraphernalia of a supplementary budget.  It certainly does not justify the serious dislocation and hardship which it will cause on such a widespread scale throughout our community. I cannot see that the actual final residual effect on the budgetary finances this year will impress any of those institutions for the benefit of whom our economy is apparently going to be managed in the future.</P>
    <P>Now, I want to try to analyse some of the budgetary arithmetic to the best of my ability and would hope that the Minister would take particular account of the sums which I am going to do and, if possible, reply to them at some stage during this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to suggest that the net effect on the current side of everything which was done yesterday, all the crushing imposition on the motorist, all the increase in VAT for the ordinary family and housewife, all the price increases which will come, was to reduce the budget deficit by £12 million only when at the same time the Government were trying to create a scare and panic about some alleged budget deficit of £950 million.  If my figures are right &mdash; and I challenge the Government in due course to contradict them &mdash; all that exercise gone through yesterday will make a minimal change of £12 million on the current side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I arrive at that £12 million in the following way.  Extra tax levied in yesterday's budget came to £77 million.  From that the Government deducted the £20 million to which I have already referred <Col N="733" /> as arising from the deflationary effects of their budgetary measures, and they took off another £10 million for a shortfall in Post Office receipts.  From the £77 million we deduct £30 million, leaving net extra revenue of £47 million.  Immediately they undertook £35 million of extra current expenditure.  From the £47 million of additional taxation which is coming in on the current side we take off £35 million extra expenditure and we are left with this minimal figure of £12 million.  I hope the motorists and housewives will be duly elated at the fact that all these impositions which were put on them yesterday resulted in a budget deficit for the rest of this year being reduced by £12 million.</P>
    <P>I could give similar figures on the capital side but I do not think in a debate of this kind it is advisable to go into too many details.  I hope the figures I have given have been understood and I would be grateful if somebody on the Government benches could prove I am wrong.  If I am not wrong, despite all the panicmongering and the scare-mongering about this budget deficit of £915 million we are facing and all the conjecture and projections for 1982, all that emerges from yesterday's budget is a reduction in the current budget deficit of £12 million. There is some evidence available that this Government are going to play favourites in their approach to our economic affairs. There are a number of little indicators emerging to that effect and my colleagues will elaborate on them as this debate unfolds.  At this stage I would like to draw attention to one thing which strikes me as being peculiar.</P>
    <P>There was a fair amount of pressure from the farming organisations for a reduction in the VAT levied on the contracts of agricultural contractors.  The Government have decided to reduce VAT on agricultural contractor work to 3 per cent.  Far be it from me to oppose that or to decry that in any way.  If the farming community and agricultural contractors can succeed in having their VAT reduced by 3 per cent by this Government the best of luck to them.  We are not going to make a song or dance about it or oppose it in any way, we will just note it carefully.  We also note carefully that on <Col N="734" /> the other side of the coin school books are going to have a 50 per cent increase in VAT.  I ask the House to decide between these two proposals for which the Labour Party and the Independent Deputy, Deputy Kemmy, voted.  They voted to reduce the VAT payable by agricultural contractors to 3 per cent and, at the same time, to increase the VAT on schoolbooks, newspapers and periodicals by 50 per cent.  That is just one indicator.</P>
    <P>I am not taking sides in this matter nor am I opposing or criticising the farming community and the agricultural contractors who serve them for achieving this easement in their position.  I merely wanted to point out that anomaly in the proposals that came before us yesterday and to ask if it does not indicate in some way that this Government have their own particular preferences and that the financial and economic affairs of the country will not always be administered on the basis of some objective standard of fair play and a balance of interest.</P>
    <P>At no time in the circumstances of any nation will you ever get a professional economist who will not prophesy disaster and demand deflationary measures being introduced.  I do not think I have ever yet come across a professional economist who, given an analysis of a situation said: &ldquo;All is well.  There is no need for deflationary measures.  There is no need for income restraint.  There is no need to cut back investment.  Proceed.  Carry on.&rdquo; Economics is a dismal science.</P>

      <P>Advice from economists is nearly always the same.  May I interject here for a moment?  Before we left office Deputy Wilson and I met the presidents of the universities who complained about the disastrous state of their financial affairs and, of course, they were looking for more money.  I do not know how they are going to fare under this Government and the cutbacks in public expenditure which will be inflicted all round.  We discussed the matter with them.  I felt like asking them why they did not get the trained, professional, academic economists <Col N="735" /> on their staff &mdash; who can tell us how to run the country &mdash; to tell them how to run their universities so that they would not have to come to the Government looking for more money from the hardpressed taxpayer, but I did not.  Better, wiser and more humane counsel prevailed. Neither Deputy Wilson nor I made that suggestion.</P>
      <P>Both professional economists and the Government are ignoring two crucial central facts in our economic and social situation which do not apply to practically any other country in Europe.  This budget makes the tragic mistake of applying to our country remedies which might be appropriate in economies which have reached a much higher level of economic development than we have and have a much different economic structure because we are not a fully developed economy.  We have a second factor of importance in our situation &mdash; we have a young, growing, expanding population. These two factors make us a different case.  These two factors mean that orthodox, economic remedies which can, and perhaps should, be applied in other cases are not appropriate to our circumstances. That is the main central criticism I make of yesterday's budget.</P>
      <P>Policies which might be appropriate to the highly developed economies of the golden triangle of Europe are not appropriate in our circumstances.  They have no relevance here.  We need economic growth.  Our young population have to be provided for.  Our young population need jobs, schools, houses, hospitals, all the social amenities and facilities that other European economies are already oversupplied with.  We still have to provide them in increasing measure for our young population.  Ours is an underdeveloped economy and the standard of our infrastructure is below European levels. If we are to compete with our partners in the EEC we must build up our economic infrastructure.  We need productive investment.  Deflation, cut-backs and reductions in Government expenditure are not appropriate in our present circumstances, no matter what the economic advisers may suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> Economic growth is a tender plant; it is not something which is easily come by. It needs encouragement and planning and can very easily be impeded and set back.  My assessment of the economy is that we were just beginning to emerge from the recession, that there were here and there some not very significant but positive indications that we were getting back to growth and development and that the recession was beginning to fade.  If this is the case the last things we need at this stage are deflationary policies or monetarism.  In this budget we may be making a very serious mistake from which it will take us a long time to recover, if we ever do so.  Our circumstances dictate that we should have growth and development, production and investment.  Whatever about any other period in our economic history, this is not the time to undertake deflationary monetarist policies.</P>
    <P>I regret that we were not able yesterday to mobilise enough parliamentary support to reject this budget and the measures brought forward by the Minister for Finance because I believe they represent a serious set-back for economic growth and development and social progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="The Tánaiste Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess to being somewhat puzzled by the contribution of the former Taoiseach, now Leader of the Opposition.  What is this debate about? It is the analysis of the former Taoiseach that the measures we decided to undertake were not necessary or were premature. It is his view that the economy was on the mend and recovery was in sight. Is it credible that a Government such as this with a very small majority would embark on unpopular measures if we did not believe in their necessity?  We are politicians who rely on the popular mandate. We are not motivated by malice but, having looked at the situation, we felt that these were the minimum measures necessary.  The former Taoiseach says they were not necessary, that the timing was all wrong, that the economy was on the mend.  If we are to believe his account, there was wise and sagacious leadership over the past four years, certainly over the past 18 months, which <Col N="737" /> meant that we were in sight, if not of the promised land, certainly of the turn about in the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>If the rescue was in sight and recovery on the way, why did the former Taoiseach leave these benches?  Why did he leave the mandate given to him?  It was not the strength of Opposition rhetoric.  It was not the case put here day after day that some measures were necessary.  He had a majority almost larger than the Labour Party at its present strength.  Why then did he leave a full 12 months before the expiration of his term of office, when all the encouraging signs he now sees were before his eyes?  That is the mystery and the real credibility gap in this debate. There is no answer to it.  On the evidence of his contribution there was no need for him to scuttle to the country.  I hope that mystery will be cleared up during the course of this debate.  To paraphrase a colleague of Deputy Haughey, there was no problem, the economy was on the mend, it was a good Government with a secure majority and there would not be an election until June of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons for the Government's decision to take action have already been explained.  We found public finances in a shambles and it was clear that if we did not take corrective action external agents would act for us.  There is a determination on the part of the Government to take the necessary decisions to put our affairs in order and to create a framework for all our citizens&mdash;workers, farmers and taxpayers&mdash;to make their contribution to getting the economy underway again. This supposedly erratic Government have been criticised with an air of authority by the former Taoiseach.  But, despite such criticism, it is a clear indication of the determination of the Government that within three weeks of taking office we have reached a wide range of decisions on essential expenditure cuts, on tax changes and policy modifications.  These decisions had been avoided and postponed by the previous Government.  If such measures had been taken in good time and if that Government had acted with the full strength which their mandate allowed, the economy would not now be <Col N="738" /> in such a precarious situation.</P>
    <P>It is normal for any Government to have expectations of putting their own programme into effect at the first opportunity. When we took stock of our position, however, it became clear that fundamental and effective actions were immediately called for to bring public finances under control, to halt the catastrophic decline in our balance of payments and restore public confidence in the Government's ability to govern.  Outside the ranks of the Opposition, nobody seriously doubts that our economy is in serious difficulties.  No one seriously questions the fact that corrective action must be taken in relation to our public finances.  The incontestable figures published last week support this view.  The former Taoiseach unworthily impugned the accuracy of those figures yesterday, suggesting that they were perhaps less than neutral in the calculations they were based on.  I give an undertaking that during the lifetime of this Government there will be no fiddling with official reports and when a White Paper is issued it will be an impartial assessment of the situation. There will be no doctoring of the books.  Both the Opposition and the Government could begin to realise that this will be the state of affairs from now on.</P>
    <P>The conclusions drawn by the Government are reflected in the budget proposals. The difficulties facing the economy did not arise overnight.  Ever since the rapid build-up of oil prices in 1979 triggered off a world-wide recession, it was evident that our economy, being particularly open to international trends, would be seriously affected and measures would have to be taken to mitigate the blow.</P>
    <P>The signs of trouble have been there for some time.  Unemployment has increased sharply, the rate of inflation has remained persistently high, the level of Government financial deficits and the balance of payments has worsened at a rate which would quickly bring about a total loss of confidence in the economic future of the country.  Remedial action to deal with these problems either was not taken, was too timid to achieve positive results or was offset by other decisions <Col N="739" /> aimed at softening the impact of worsening economic circumstances on particular sectors.  This was the situation we inherited.</P>
    <P>While it is necessary to avoid measures with a harsh deflationary effect which would sharply reduce living standards and economic activity and bring about short-term job losses, it is extremely risky to defer action or not to take any action at all until the point was reached where the fundamental soundness of the economy was called into question.  This would be a catastrophic situation where unemployment, inflation and exchange values would get totally out of control and in the longer term the damage to the economy, to employment and living standards would be far worse than anything we have experienced so far.</P>
    <P>These measures were undertaken in the belief that it was better for this Government to take remedial action than that foreigners or lending institutions outside of our country should take much rougher action at a time not of our choosing. While there are some indications of a modest recovery in international economies taking place in the near future, it is not possible to see any sustainable improvement in Ireland's economic performance until we have brought about a significant improvement in the balance of payments, in the current budget deficit and public sector borrowing requirements and in the international competitiveness of Irish products.  Our measures are aimed primarily at rectifying the imbalances in public finances and external payments and paving the way for improved performance in the industrial sector of the economy which is the key to our future prospects in terms of creating and maintaining jobs and earning exports at a level that will sustain our currency value and maintain and improve our standard of living.</P>
    <P>It has been said before, and no one acted on it, that if we are to survive as stable society we have to end our excessive dependence on borrowing for meeting everyday expenditure.  We have to become more competitive and we have to be able to exploit market opportunities <Col N="740" /> for goods and services abroad in an expanding international economy and to withstand competition from imports on our own markets.  We cannot achieve this on the basis of an imbalance in our public finances and external payments, with borrowing being misapplied for longterm productive investment projects.  It will not be possible to achieve a balance in our payments overnight but a start has to be made in this budget.  The longer term steps necessary are spelled out in the Government's programme and will form the basis of future policy and action. No new Government would have chosen these steps as the first decisive steps in dealing with the economy but the choice is not ours and these remedial steps are necessary.</P>
    <P>The need for this budget stems directly from the lack of action by the last Government to control our public finances. These criteria determined the kind of action we took.  In our examination of the decisions on public expenditure our essential objective at all times was to reduce day-to-day expenditure and capital spending on non-productive purposes so that it would be possible to achieve the maximum sustainable increase in the funds available for investment in the preservation of existing jobs and the creation of new jobs.</P>
    <P>Our first priority then is action which will mean more jobs, especially for young people.  This clearly means making more funds available for productive investment. It also means achieving improved levels of competitiveness and new arrangements especially those associated with the Youth Employment Agency necessary to ensure that new jobs go to young people.  When I talk about improved competitiveness it is not simply in terms of pay increases although they are a part of it.  Many other factors are generally ignored by people who talk of the necessity of keeping our competitiveness to a standard so that our goods can be sold on export markets.  They concentrate solely on the pay element.  They ignore such factors as general management, marketing strategy, financial control and industrial relations within firms so as to avoid industrial disputes which <Col N="741" /> benefit no one.  These factors are germane to the question of preserving our competitiveness in products on which future job opportunities depend.</P>
    <P>The Government's joint programme makes clear our belief in planning in a longer term context.  As the programme states, the main objective of planning must be the achievement of such economic expansion as will ensure our employment needs.  Central to that planning process will be positive help from the Government to improve our general managerial capacity, to ensure that we have the marketing ability to seek out the new sales opportunities that will enable Irish firms to return to operating at their full potential, to streamline private financial structures so that their funds are channelled into new investment and to bring about an industrial relations system where employers and workers know clearly and accept current economic reality and avoid wasteful and costly industrial disputes that serve nobody's best interests.  These so-called non-pay aspects of overall competitiveness are, on the basis of recent studies, just as important as the pay aspects.  Improvements in this area must go hand in hand if we are to protect existing jobs and create new jobs for the numbers of young people looking for these jobs.</P>
    <P>The Government are especially conscious of the need to ensure that public as well as private enterprises play their full role in creating jobs.  My party, by policy and otherwise, are committed to expanding the State sector.  We made no secret of our belief that there must be creative use of the State sector in developing the economy, because we believe that that system is the best from the point of view of the community and also because a properly running State sector is a bulwark against growing foreign intervention and control of the Irish economy.  But in this Government we say also that there must be a full role for private enterprise in developing the economy.  We see a partnership between private and State enterprise, all devoted to the primary national economic objective of providing the maximum number <Col N="742" /> of jobs for our young people in the future.</P>
    <P>The Government's joint programme provides for the setting up of a National Development Corporation to hold the State's shares in existing commercial public enterprises and to engage in new projects to provide productive employment. That National Development Corporation will aim at stimulating and mobilising enterprise in the public sector, at eliminating inefficiency where it exists and at restructuring where justified public firms, all in the interests of providing more jobs.</P>
    <P>The basic purpose of the corporation will be to stimulate and mobilise entrepreneurial capacity in State enterprises, to eliminate inefficiencies, to re-structure commercial enterprises where justified and to provide access to funds on a basis that ensures fair and equal competition with the private sector; to hold the State's shares in existing public enterprises which have commercial objectives; to engage in new projects with the objective of productive employment creation particularly in potential growth sectors of the economy either on its own or in joint ventures with other public, private or co-operative enterprises.  The corporation will act as the commercial vehicle, where appropriate, for projects involving productive employment originating inside the public sector.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the initial equity capital for restructuring and new projects will amount to £200 million to be taken up over a period of years and that a borrowing limitation of £500 million will apply.  The wide range of functions envisaged for this National Development Corporation and the level of Exchequer finance proposed mean that the most appropriate way to provide for its establishment will be through legislation.  It is my intention to have the necessary preparatory work completed as soon as possible to be ready for the Dáil to pass the necessary legislation on resumption later this year.</P>
    <P>This Government are especially conscious of the need to supplement existing jobs and they propose new general job creation measures with a special programme aimed specifically at the acute problem of youth unemployment.  The <Col N="743" /> Youth Employment Agency we promised will therefore be established immediately to integrate existing schemes and radically extend them to provide up to 20,000 young people who have been without employment for at least six months with employment in environmental improvement schemes, in community youth work or in voluntary social or community organisational work.  I do not pretend, nor do the Government, that the best efforts of the Youth Employment Agency will be adequate to meet the size of the challenge before us in providing our young people with jobs.  The surest way of providing a sufficiency of jobs in the future is to bring our public finances into order, ensuring that we protect our currency against the danger of deflation &mdash;and that danger would have been there had we not taken action &mdash; and generally to put our economic house in order so that a climate of enterprise, a partnership between the State and private areas, can be created, with the entire community united in making that national economic objective of maximising employment opportunity.  It is a large challenge, a very difficult one to meet.  It will not be overcome in the next year or the year after but we must make the necessary start.</P>
    <P>It was timely that the Central Statistics Office published recently the first of a new series of analyses of the live register which showed that in mid-April of last year the total numbers on the register for a continuous period of over six months, aged up to 24, was almost 7,000, when we remember that many young unemployed people do not register, that the total number on the register increased by over 31,000 between end April 1980 and end June 1981 and when we remember also the number of young people who leave school.</P>
    <P>In this budget we have had to increase taxes.  To fund the Youth Employment Agency a levy of 1 per cent on incomes will be necessary.  I believe that all will accept that as a national priority we owe it to our young, growing population to provide the funds necessary to finance job creation and training for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> In the budget a range of indirect taxes was necessary.  The joint programme of the Government made it clear that the increases in these taxes and charges would be introduced.  The fact that the position of our public finances was undermining the stability of the economy at an alarming rate meant that taxes had to be increased now to avoid enforced deflation of the economy at a later stage.  I believe that the vast majority of our people will understand that firm and timely action now is far preferable to an uncontrolled drift into a situation in which Ireland's future as an independent economy would be threatened.  That reality must be underlined, that there was such a threat, that that action has not been taken by our predecessors, though they had ample political muscle to take that action.  That is in stark contrast with their recognition now, from the convenience of the Opposition benches, that economic recovery was under way.  As announced here this morning by the former Taoiseach, there was no problem, the economy was on the mend, within months complete recovery would have taken place, the action being taken by us was over hasty; I think &ldquo;premature&rdquo; was the label the former Taoiseach put on it yesterday evening.  He does not believe the overturn on our public finances would have been as large as the people on the dismal side, the economists, had predicted. For all these reasons we hope in the course of this debate to hear why the former Taoiseach and Government deserted these benches a full 12 months before their term of office had expired. If all those encouraging signs were there and evident to them this week presumably the same signs were evident to them in May when they decided to go to the country seeking a renewal of their mandate. Why they did that when the political situation in this House did not so require them to do so, when those encouraging economic signs were there, we hope to learn in this debate.</P>
    <P>We do not deny that the measures we have taken will have an adverse effect on the price index &mdash; in the short-term that will be the case &mdash; but I believe the real courage of this Government will be justified <Col N="745" /> by the restoration of the overall economic strength of this country, by the return to production at near or normal levels of capacity, that improved competitiveness will come about, that jobs will be saved, that the economy being put on a sounder footing gives us a better platform from which to advance into the future.</P>
    <P>We have also taken measures to ensure that the welfare sections in our community will be protected against any indirect tax charges that have occurred.  The former Taoiseach made great play of the fact that these are very small increases but they are October increases.  We are committed as a Government to proceeding on a real improvement over the years ahead for all in the welfare category in our community, for the less privileged, for the poor in our society who unfortunately are with us in very large numbers. One of the actions of this Government will be &mdash; the previous Government had decided to abandon them &mdash; to reinstall the poverty committees, to admit, and there is no shame in admitting, that Irish society has not solved the problem of poverty, admit that it is another challenge that must be faced.  We will have restored this autumn the twice yearly treatment of the welfare problem in our community. It was abandoned by the previous Government and restored by us this year.  In the January budget of next year we will continue on the real improvement of the welfare groups in our community.</P>
    <P>In our joint programme we are committed to returning to the path we followed between 1973 and 1977.  We are committed to reducing the old age pension qualifying age in our period in office. We have had a lot of lip service paid to the question of the less privileged in our community by the people opposite this morning and probably will have throughout this debate.  But this Government, in which the Labour Party are sharing with Fine Gael, are committed to continuing the advance, interrupted in recent years, in removing the sore of poverty from our society.</P>
    <P>It will not be accomplished overnight, but at least it is a good beginning that as a Government we are not ashamed to <Col N="746" /> admit there is poverty in Irish society, not ashamed to admit that it will need conscious political treatment to rule out the inequalities responsible for that poverty in Irish society and to realise that it will not be settled on the basis of yearly handouts, with politicians expecting praise simply because they have done the right thing, based on the consumer price index, for a particular needy group at a particular point of the year.  We must tackle this matter scientifically.  We must go to the root causes of poverty in Irish society.  That will be the programme that the Labour Party in Government will be committed to in our period in office.  It is in the joint programme and both parties are determined that we will do all we can to eliminate poverty in the years ahead. We do not adhere to the philosophy that the elimination of poverty must await the achievement of economic prosperity.  We do not go for that kind of pacing in Irish society.  As far as we are concerned, hand in hand, with an improvement in our material prospects, month by month, year by year, there must be a parallel advance in the elimination of poverty from Irish society.</P>
    <P>It is not easy for any Government, least of all a Government with a majority as slender as this one and so short a period in office, to impose the kind of measures we felt were necessary.  I hope our example will be noted and that even our opponents in their heart of hearts &mdash; Deputy McCreevy already has done so publicly and perhaps others also&mdash;will agree with us.  I am prepared to think there are many responsible Deputies in the Opposition party who were in the last Government, who know the facts, who may play at rhetoric in this debate and say this measure was not necessary, but who in fact agree that it is necessary.  We know that you spent many long months looking at the mess in our public finances.  We do not know the reason you did not take any action.  We do not know if there is an association between your calling an early election and some political problems in your own party.  We do not know the reason for this, but we know you spent many months looking at this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="The Tánaiste Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking in the biblical fashion.  There are many Deputies opposite who know that the facts of the situation merited serious action.  I understand the dialectic of opposition and Government in this House, that there is the necessity to oppose all the way.  That is the philosophy in which the House conducts its affairs.  I leave it to others to know if it is the wisest method of conducting the national affairs at this time, but that has been the tradition in this House and, from what we heard this morning, will continue to be the tradition as long as the present Leader of the Opposition retains that office in the party opposite.  There are many Deputies in the Opposition party who know that our national situation required this corrective action.  Many of them are perhaps relieved that they did not have to take that action but recognise that it had to be taken.</P>
      <P>It was not easy for us.  I hope some example will be taken from this.  I hope that the Deputies opposite will be big enough to admit in public&mdash;perhaps not in this debate but as the months go on&mdash;that this measure was necessary and that, even though they may have done it this way or that way, in general the thrust of these measures was necessary.  I am convinced that, when the outcome in terms of control of our public finances, restoration of strength to our economy and the creation of new jobs becomes clearer, the Irish people, and especially those without jobs, will appreciate the need for the kind of measures we were forced to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industrial sector will continue to be the mainspring for growth in the economy&mdash;it is the area where there is most scope and where our hopes for the future <Col N="748" /> really lie.  Despite a tremendous effort to expand industry, through financial and fiscal incentives, education and training courses to provide skilled labour and management, the performance of industry as a whole has tapered off in 1980 and actually fell for the first time in many years.  The growth in output of new industries has been more than offset by declining production in traditional industries. This is shown up in our external trading figures.</P>
    <P>Despite the best efforts of the IDA, the contraction in labour and the growing redundancies in traditional industries have more than cancelled the gains we have made in grant-aided industry over the last few years.  The volume of imports has grown over the past five years at a more rapid rate and from a much higher base than the volume of exports.  Import prices have run well ahead of export prices.  The fact of the import prices running well ahead of export prices is illustrative of the tremendous pressure on Irish manufactured industry from foreign competition and the adverse effect it is having on our economic performance and employment prospects.</P>
    <P>The measures taken by the Government to alleviate some of the pressures on industry are intended to provide a breathing space for industry to come to grips with these immediate problems. The other measures affecting industry in the Government's programme will be brought into effect as soon as possible and will help to bring about an improvement in the competitive position of industry. The anti-inflation programme, personal taxation proposals and improvements in industrial relations are all relevant in this context.  Beyond this, it is necessary for industry itself to see that, through investment, up-to-date technology, efficient management and work practices, competition, foreign competition especially, can be withstood and market opportunities exploited.</P>
    <P>In broad terms and looking to the future, I am confident that industry once more can be made an aggressive dynamic sector of our economy.  The new industry sector is growing and becoming a dominant <Col N="749" /> part of overall performance.  This is despite the poor performance of traditional industry.  Special measures will have to be taken to look at that situation. The new sector of industry which gives us great confidence for the future is in chemicals, engineering and electronics.  All these areas give us hope of a better technological and secure base for improving employment in the future.</P>
    <P>In looking at the financial demands facing this Government, particularly large provisions are being sought for large capital investments by the Exchequer in State companies not only in the industrial sector but also in transport and agriculture.  These industries are among the biggest enterprises in our economy. Many of these are under severe financial pressure arising out of the economic situation, but also arising from a lack of capitalisation stretching back over many years.  The Government will take the necessary measures to meet absolutely essential financial needs and a provision of £12 million has been made for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The cost of energy to manufacturing industry will be alleviated by the reduction of 2½ per gallon in fuel oil excise duty from next December and there is provision in the Vote for Energy for financial aid to industries which have suffered from particularly severe cost increases arising from the fuel oil excise duty.</P>
    <P>In the short period since I assumed responsibility for energy I have been reviewing the progress made towards achievement of energy policies and considering how these relate to the objectives which this Government consider appropriate in the field of energy.</P>
    <P>There is very little argument about the broad thrust of energy policy.  The rapid escalation in oil prices, which arose from the change of regime in Iran and the subsequent outbreak of war between that country and Iraq, imposed severe strains on the economies of all oil importing countries.  Since we have been so heavily dependent on imported oil for a large part of our energy requirements, this impact has been particularly severe on us in relation to costs for industry, transportation, <Col N="750" /> the domestic sector, commerce and so forth but also in relation to our balance of payments.  It is therefore a matter of national prudence, which in my view properly transcends political divisions, that policy should be pursued which would mitigate to the extent possible the adverse effects of these external influences.</P>
    <P>I will be particulary concerned with efforts to ensure the most effective use of energy supplies available; to promote the maximum production and the use of indigenous energy resources; to encourage diversification of fuel use so as to be less dependent on a single imported commodity, oil; and to take the initial steps in securing a greater degree of control and security as regards oil procurement on a national basis.  In the coming months I will be reviewing these measures in considerable detail in consultation with the State bodies operating in the energy sector and I will be introducing such new initiatives as appear to me to be appropriate and necessary.</P>
    <P>I will be seeking a wider and more effective utilisation of our natural gas reserves which represent an increasingly valuable national resource.  I am in the course of reviewing the progress made in relation to the construction of a pipeline from Cork to the Dublin area and also as regards the preparations necessary in Dublin to take delivery of this gas.  This is a major project.  It is of the greatest importance not simply in relation to the supply of gas to Dublin but because it has much wider national implications.  The very size and importance of this project will impose on me the obligation to study it very thoroughly, to satisfy myself that the progress achieved to date is compatible with my objectives and to see what new measures may be necessary to ensure the maximisation of the potential which this resource has in relation to national economic and social development.</P>
    <P>I have been able to have only a general briefing on the very important area of offshore exploration and minerals.  This, too, is an area to which I intend to devote very particular attention.  It looks as if it will be a very busy and very interesting drilling season.  I expect to see eight wells <Col N="751" /> drilled in offshore Ireland this year.  Five of these wells will be drilled in the Porcupine Basin.  While it has already been established that the Porcupine is an oilbearing basin, further drilling is necessary to determine whether the basin contains commercial accumulations of hydrocarbons.  The wells being drilled there this year should enable us to build up considerably our picture of the basin's potential.  The Slyne Trough will be drilled for the first time and drilling is resumed in the Fasnet and the Celtic Sea. There is also a very high level of seismic activity this year in preparation for the new licensing round which is planned for later this year.</P>
    <P>I have not yet had the chance to study in precise detail the matters which this will entail but I can say that it will be one of my primary objectives to secure the most effective and rapid exploration of our offshore prospects that may prove practicable.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the frequent and sharp increases which trebled oil prices in 1979 and 1980 contributed in large part to the downturn in international economic activity.  Although there has been a welcome respite in the ability of oil-producing countries to increase oil prices we have to contend with another factor which is now pushing up oil prices.  That is the improving value of the dollar against other currencies.  As a result, oil prices are now costing this country one-third more than they were in the early autumn of last year.  As a result of increased producer prices and exchange rate changes our energy import bill which has gone up from under £380 million in 1978 to over £800 million in 1980 is likely to reach £1 billion in 1981.</P>
    <P>The oil supply situation is not at present unsatisfactory but, nevertheless, the future has many problems in store.  In particular there is the problem of renewed hostilities between Iran and Iraq; the question of Saudi Arabia's long-term production policy which remains uncertain; and estimates of oil demand may turn out to have been under-estimated.  Consequently a return <Col N="752" /> to difficult market conditions cannot be ruled out.</P>
    <P>The situation we are in is very serious and that explains why the Government were forced to take these measures.  Had we not taken them the future of our economy would have been that much more bleak and precarious, and the employment of all would be at risk.  The Government believe that the measures now being taken and the further measures outlined in their programme which will be implemented in due course will bring back a sound basis for future development. The next two years will be difficult years but we believe if a government are to be identified by giving leadership to face problems as they are recognised, the problems of those years will be successfully overcome.</P>
    <P>There are hopes of some recovery in the major industrial economies.  An easing of international interest rates and monetary policies could lead to more stability in exchange rates and an expansion of international trade.  For the time being the availability of oil seems fairly certain and the level of prices reasonably stable as long as stocks remain high and demand depressed.</P>
    <P>Overcoming our domestic economic obstacles so as to resume a healthy and balanced growth pattern will be a slow process and must be carefully phased over the next two or three years.  During that period it is important to get our primary producers, whether farmers or industrialists, managers or workers to a point where confidence is restored and the level of investment is increased once more and a sustained growth in employment, particularly for our growing young population, is being achieved.</P>
    <P>We have attempted in this budget, which is the start of a phased programme to improve public finances, to gradually eliminate, not in a sudden or deflationary manner which would precipitate more unemployment but in a planned way, Government borrowing for current purposes. We have begun on a phased basis to wind down our dangerous balance of payments deficit and the extremely high level of foreign borrowing.  The purpose of this and other measures is to protect <Col N="753" /> employment.  When the former Taoiseach castigates these measures as monetarist, one wonders &mdash; we have it on his own word that he does not listen to economists because he regards them as too gloomy, whereas he, like the late Hubert Humphrey, apparently pursues the politics of happiness &mdash; whether he wants to know the true meaning of monetarism, because by no stretch of the imagination could our measures be accurately described as coming under the label monetarism, that weapon used by the Prime Minister of the neighbouring island on the backs of the unemployed, attempting to bring the cost of labour down and limiting the supply of money and by such means hoping that constraints will be introduced in the economy. That has not been our objective in these measures which were forced on us by the state in which we found public finances.</P>
    <P>The current deficit would have been £950 million by the end of this year, with the opening deficit for next year being at £1,500 million, had we taken no corrective action, had we taken the implicit advice of the former Taoiseach here this morning, who said there was no need for any action to be taken until next January. I am proud that we took our decision however unpopular it was.  Was there not a choice &mdash; if one could call it that &mdash; for this Government to sit here mute of malice, take our summer holidays and come back in the late autumn with a worsening economic situation?  We could have waited like lambs for the slaughter until we faced the £1,500 million opening deficit next year.  We had that &ldquo;choice&rdquo;, if that is the choice the former Taoiseach suggests we should have made.</P>
    <P>The former Taoiseach shows great cynicism about the public memory.  He aspired to the mantle of a senior economic statesman here today &mdash; the leader of his people cast out by their ingratitude, but here he was still gallantly giving advice in opposition.  He was declaring that there was no problem.  What an inconsistency it was.  He says we acted prematurely, that we had got it wrong.</P>

      <P>When the former Taoiseach attempts to don the mantle of senior economic statesman he is forgetting, or is hoping we will forget, his own real life role quite recently as Taoiseach when he presided over a Government for 18 months that permitted our public finances to fall apart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No Member of this House has had longer experience than Deputy Haughey of the management of our economic affairs.  No Member came to the office of Taoiseach with greater experience of different ministries or with a more carefully prepared apprenticeship for the highest office.  Yet, for whatever reason &mdash; time alone will tell &mdash; from the moment he assumed the office of Taoiseach his management of our economic affairs was marked by uncertainty, indecision and hesitation.  The Leader of the Opposition has many friends in the public relations world.  He may not like economists but apparently he finds the company of advertising agents and PRO experts more invigorating &mdash; certainly not as dismal as economists.  This man in the Lemass mould was a veritable Hamlet, incapable of taking any decisions.  With all the power a 20-seat majority gave him, he resorted to slogans to defend his failure to act.  He said he was not a Thatcherite, he was not a monetarist, but all the time <Col N="755" /> the problems of growing disorder in our public finances became worse until finally he scuttled to the country to look for a mandate because he did not have the guts to deal with the problems facing him and his 20-seat majority Government.</P>
    <P>We come to the point where a Government with a tiny majority have moved to take action.  We know that the Leader of the Opposition and his party were aware of the facts of the situation.  We have been looking at the books for more than ten days and what we know now was known also to the party opposite but so great was the fear of the Leader of the Opposition to take the necessary measures that he ran to the country for a mandate 12 months before his Government's term of office expired.</P>
    <P>I mention the motes in the eye of the Leader of the Opposition not to discredit him but to point out that his record when on these benches deprives him of the necessary credentials to criticise any action taken by this Government.  His cynicism for the public memory is so great he could speak without the slighest recognition of any inconsistency on his part when making his speech in this debate. Obviously he believes what the public relations experts tell him is reality.  Our actions are designed to salvage a desperate situation.  They were made necessary by the facts of that situation inherited by us.  Our public finances would remain the shambles we found them if we did not take action.  The people opposite claim to be republicans.  Apparently for them being a republican simply has political connotations.  In fact, classical republicanism always had a very strong economic side but apparently there is scant sympathy by the people opposite for the philosophy of republicanism in its economic manifestation.</P>
    <P>At any rate, we acted.  Whatever the unpopularity we believe our actions were necessary in the situation inherited by us. Since the current budget deficit has risen to unprecedented levels it was necessary to take action.  We believe that in so acting we have secured a base for better progress in the future.  Of course, any Government taking action will need as <Col N="756" /> much co-operation as possible to ensure there is a united effort in the country.  We were anxious to ensure that the burden of paying for clearing up the financial mess we inherited should be shared as equitably as possible.  That is why social welfare benefits are being increased by 3 per cent and why the price of basic food items has been frozen through additional subsidies.</P>
    <P>A subsidy of £5 million has been given in respect of bread.  The Minister acted earlier this month to provide a further subsidy to ensure there was no increase in the price of bread following the recommendation made by the National Prices Commission to grant an increase.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has announced an additional levy of £5 million on bank profits.  We believe the banks have suffered less from the recession than other areas of the corporate sector.  With the Government committed to maintaining corporation tax in the manufacturing sector at the existing rate, we felt an additional levy on the profits of the banks was justified.  In addition, certain charges on the use of cheques have been increased and a charge has been introduced on the use of credit cards.  As the Minister said yesterday, measures to increase the yield of capital taxes are being considered.  Legislation in this area is complex and we want to take wise steps.</P>
    <P>We face a few difficult years.  However, yesterday's measures are the first step on the road to regaining control over critical areas of the economy.  This is a two-party Government.  The Labour Party are an integral part of the Government in carrying out the joint programme agreed by the two parties.  That programme can give us in the full period of the life of this Parliament a Government responsible in dealing with the economic problems but also reflecting the traditional and social commitment of the Labour Party towards the working people.  We do not need any sermons on social morality from the people opposite.  We do not need any lectures on why more capital taxation was not introduced.</P>
    <P>When the people opposite were in Government they thought they would <Col N="757" /> gain the respect of the country by avoiding all measures that smacked of responsible management of our economic affairs.  They lacked the traditional excuse of a Government who shirk action in such an area in that they had a very strong majority.  They went to the country before their term in office had expired.  The conclusion is inescapable that they lacked the courage to take the action which they knew was necessary. Now we have the paradox of a Government with a very small majority taking the necessary action.  We are not under any illusion that our measures in the short-term will be popular but we are confident that what we have done will put the economy on a strong footing.  The Labour Party are strongly committed to Irishmen and women managing the affairs of the country.  If the verbal republicanism of the people opposite brought about a situation where in our economic affairs we were being put in hock to an increasing extent to foreign bankers, the Labour Party in Government were anxious to wind down that process.  Today we are taking the steps to show our seriousness in that regard.</P>

      <P>It is evident from the last speech why a substantial minority of the Labour Party voted against participation in a Coalition Government.

The speech we <Col N="758" /> have just heard from Deputy O'Leary is typical of the opportunist attitude that prevailed against the strong minority advice of the Irish trade union movement, with which we had the pleasure as a Government to co-operate on many planes in the formulation of the successful national understanding that has stood us in excellent stead in the past two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>One sees in the statement of the Minister for Finance yesterday the monetarist policy that has pervaded the policy of Fine Gael before and since the election.  Deputy O'Leary may talk at length about the importance of the public sector, of youth employment, of capital expenditure, but when I look through the speech of the Minister for Finance relating to capital expenditure, unemployment and the public sector and the numbers employed there, I see that public sector employment is to be cut.  It is spelled out in the Minister's speech that the numbers are to be frozen at the level obtaining on 21 July 1981.  That is a positive, definite Government decision written into the document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How, therefore, can Deputy O'Leary with forked tongue, speaking as Tánaiste, come in here and commit himself <Col N="759" /> publicly to a policy of expansion in capital investment in State and semi-State organisations? Only a few minutes ago he made a specific commitment to a National Development Corporation.  He spoke in terms of investing £200 million immediately, with a borrowing commitment of £500 million in a National Development Corporation.  Is there any mention of it in the document read to us yesterday by the Minister for Finance?  Yesterday the Minister for Finance made a specific commitment to freeze the numbers employed in the public service.</P>
    <P>Yet Deputy O'Leary today spoke gaily about giving a major State corporation nearly £1,000 million to expand.  How, whom to employ, where to employ them? The fact is there is a real dichotomy between the deflationary monetarist policies adumbrated in this document published by the Fine Gael Minister for Finance yesterday and the sort of loose rhetoric we heard here this morning from the Tánaiste when he was paying lip service to some of the elements of the Labour Party.  In practical terms there was no real philosophical input from Deputy O'Leary, though he made the ritual obesance to some of the sacred cows of the Left, one of which is a National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>There is no mention of the National Development Corporation in the hard-faced document issued by the Minister for Finance.  There is no mention in it of the £200 million which Deputy O'Leary wants immediately for the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would Deputy Lenihan refer to him as the Tánaiste?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no mention in yesterday's document of the £200 million to be made available immediately for a National Development Corporation or of the £500 million for a loan capital structure for it.  The Tánaiste also paid homage to job creation, particularly among young people.  That is desirable objective to which we all subscribe.  I fully agree with the Tánaiste and everybody here who <Col N="760" /> appreciates the importance of job creation for young people.  The fact of our expanding young population with 50 per cent of our people.  under 25 years, should propel us and motivate us to introduce policies of job creation among our youth.</P>
      <P>Indeed this is precisely the area in which Fianna Fáil invested the major share of public capital.  The IDA were fully financed and were on a steady track of creating 40,000 new jobs this year, as they did last year and which they hoped to provide next year.  They were on a two-year planning track ahead, geared to provide 40,000 new jobs in each succeeding year.</P>
      <P>Yet the Minister for Finance has decided, as his contribution to the Tánaiste's welcome endeavour in terms of lip contribution to job creation, that the one positive contribution in this field will be that the numbers employed in the public service will be frozen at the level of employment that existed there yesterday. That is the only reference to employment in the public service in the document of the Minister for Finance.  The Tánaiste today spoke of the need to continue capital expenditure, but the Minister for Finance yesterday was entirely negative in that area.  There is this reference to capital expenditure in the speech of the Minister for Finance:</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, during this year there is evidence that, if nothing is done, the amount actually spent will in many areas be much more than was provided for in the 1981 Public Capital Programme. The Government have therefore taken steps to ensure that the Exchequer commitments will be maintained at or around the level provided for in the January budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, capital expenditure is to be frozen as well as employment in the public sector.  Our capital expenditure commitments were running ahead of what we provided for in the January budget this year.  That was a welcome development because it is only by the expansion of capital investment, public and private, that one can absorb the employment that is so essential, particularly <Col N="761" /> for the well-being of our young people.</P>
    <P>The expansion of investment and investment growth are essential for the provision of employment.  That is basic, real economics.  As the Government we did not in any way restrain or hold back in regard to the expansion of the public programme.</P>
    <P>The document issued by the Minister for Finance yesterday criticises us by implication in that respect.  It states:</P>
    <P>A contingency provision of £70 million was made in the January budget for the additional requirements outside of the Public Capital Programme for loans and share capital for certain semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>This is an area dear to the heart of the Minister for Energy and dear to the ethos of the Labour Party: the importance of providing capital for semi-State bodies like the National Development Corporation. The document goes on:</P>
    <P>Potential demands on this provision could amount to about £217 million.</P>
    <P>This was an excess but it was a desirable excess in areas which required expansion: Aer Lingus, CIE, the ESB and any of the semi-State corporations we want to see expanding and making an input into Irish society, investing and providing growth and employment.  Because the potential demands would be about £217 million instead of £70 million, this is regarded as negative rather than positive.  In their latest Victorian draconian language, which is far removed from the windy rhetoric of the Tánaiste the document went on to say:</P>
    <P>The Government have reviewed these demands carefully and have concluded that, in present financial circumstances, these demands must be confined within a total of £82 million;</P>
    <P>In other words, where the semi-State sector required investment funds, not for current expenditure but for capital purposes, where the best of our semi-State companies require £217 million, they will be confined to £82 million.</P>

      <P>The £135 million which is required urgently by the elite of the investors in our society and in our economy to expand and provide employment and to gear up their enterprises and their operations will not be made available to them.  They will be confined to £82 million as spelled out in the final paragraph on page 17 of this document.  That is all there is in regard to employment for young people or older people, for investment, or growth, or expansion.  That is all there is in relation to employment and capital investment to provide for growth in the public and the semi-public sectors.</P>
      <P>There is to be a freeze in the numbers employed in the public service.  No more are to be taken on.  That is the type of situation we faced when we came back to office after the last Coalition Government. The then draconian Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, also imposed a freeze on recruitment to the public service prior to 1977.  Our first act as a government to which I was proud to belong was to thaw that freeze and to allow recruitment to the public service and the semi-State sector.  We are back to this draconian, Victorian philosophy again, and the numbers to be employed are to be frozen as of July of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not just a freeze in regard to capital expenditure, but there is also to be a positive curtailment on capital expenditure in the semi-State service.  A virtue is made of this.  That is all there is in this document about employment and capital investment: a freeze on the numbers to be employed and a curtailment on capital expenditure.  That is the contribution to employment in this document. There is no point in the Tánaiste coming in here with his rhetoric this morning as if this document did not exist, and as if the Minister for Finance did not read out this document in this House.  This is the policy document we are considering.  We are not considering the Tánaiste talking off the top of his head.  We will be voting on this document and the proposals in it relating to our economy, the proposals <Col N="763" /> spelled out in the Financial Statement of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Energy came in here with a forked tongue presentation totally unrelated to the realities as spelled out here yesterday by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste waxed eloquent in paying tribute to another of the gods, or idols, or totem poles of the Labour party: how they feel about social welfare and the need to improve social welfare payments. We are the party of social welfare in this House.  We have always gone way ahead of the cost of living index figure in our assessment and preparation of increases under the various social welfare headings.</P>

      <P>Recent Fianna Fáil budgets showed a consistent 25 per cent annual rise in social welfare payments, particularly for old people and widows. In this document a 5 per cent increase is proposed for old age pensioners and a miserly 3 per cent increase under other headings to operate from 1 October. Some of the figures would make one weep.  The blue document we received yesterday sets out the various increases in weekly rates of social insurance.  In 1981 would you believe that there are increases from October amounting to .05p?  That is one shilling in old money. On page 3 of the blue document it is stated that the supplementary allowance payable to blind persons over 21 who are in receipt of a blind pension will be .05p for each of the first two dependent children, and for each subsequent child the increase will be .05p.</P>
      <P>In this day and age it is a rather sad commentary that anybody would write that into a document.  Apart from the morality of it and the gross lack of charity, the very fact of going through the whole administrative rigmarole of administering an increase of one shilling under any social welfare heading today defies description.  A virtue is made of that by the Tánaiste here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> I am not being selective because I will take another heading under which .15p is given.  That is a little better.  It is still 15p and no means substantial in respect of unemployment assistance and supplementary allowance recipients for their children.  Children appear to get a bad hammering under these proposals because they get only 15p each.  It is not as bad as .05p.  There is an elaborate table with increases of 5p, 10p or 15p.  The overall average is 3 per cent for everything except old age pensions.  That is supposed to cope with the inflation which is written into the document by the increase in VAT on a whole range of items.  There is the audacious claim that the CPI will be contained within 3 per cent.  Every item which is in the area of VAT is going up by five percentage points and with that percolating across the whole spectrum of the economy how can it be contained in a CPI increase of three points?  That is apart from the increases in the financial resolutions on beer, spirits, cigarettes and petrol.  The 3 per cent figure must be fraudulent.  On any casual assessment one is talking about 5 per cent or 6 per cent at a minimum.  Old age pensioners and other social welfare recipients will be contained within 3 to 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Government have embarked on a very dangerous economic policy because it is deflationary in the sense of capital investment and employment and inflationary by imposing regressive tax across the board which hits the cost of living. The Minister for Finance and the Government have managed to contrive to have the worst of both worlds.  The economic package is also deflationary in the sense of curtailment of public investment and freezing jobs in the public service and inflationary by jacking up the cost of living particularly in regard to VAT.  That is a regressive form of taxation and a levy which hits everything with no regard for a person's income or social position.  The Government are heading for disaster. The package is negative on two accounts and they have contrived to be both deflationary and inflationary at once.</P>

      <P>The Government have moved along the wrong road.  It is basically a curtailment of the capital programme <Col N="766" /> which will lead to unemployment, freezing of the numbers employed in the public service which will be deflationary and lead to reduction in employment. On the other hand the increase in VAT coupled with the other increases in the Financial Resolutions will increase the CPI by 5 per cent or 6 per cent.  This is the worst of both worlds where the Government are deflationary on the capital side and inflationary on the tax side. That is my thesis and it is water-tight in respect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish mentioned the question of having an election. In all democracies elections have taken place every four years.  Five years is the statutory maximum but four years is the normal.  The previous Coalition did a four-year stint and Deputy Cosgrave decided to have an election.  Deputy Haughey did the same thing.  It is a Taoiseach's privilege and it is sensible.  Otherwise one walks into all kinds of pressures coming up to the last day on which a Government can continue in office.  I cannot understand the brouhaha made about it by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>There is an important aspect which concerns the future development of our economy and society and that is keeping industrial and labour relations on an even keel.  One of the real successes of the last Government under Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach &mdash; he made it an issue within days of becoming Taoiseach &mdash; was the handling of the whole area of industrial relations.  The co-operation that existed between the last Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the framing of the two national understandings and the framing of the next one which we would have done successfully, has meant that this year has been the most trouble free as far as industrial action was concerned.  The only serious strike we had happened within days of the Coalition coming into power and they have refrained from handling it in any way.  They have run away from it.  I refer to the bus dispute in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> Our thrust in Government was to recognise that we could have all the plans and development corporations in the world but unless there is co-operation between the social partners and the Government, one will not have success in economic expansion and social progress. That is a basic thesis which we made a policy priority.  In the past few years we moved from a confrontation position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the trade union movement to one of co-operation.  National understandings were introduced and a wider perspective given to talks other than the normal pay dimension which traditionally had been the basis for talks.  We brought in employment policies, tax policies and social welfare policies.  There were fruitful exchanges between the Government and the unions and we had considerable success in that endeavour.</P>
    <P>Now we have an inequitable form of tax measures that will jeopardise that national understanding. The negotiations in respect of a new national understanding will have to be conducted during the next few months but we have the Government telling the trade union movement that the cost of living is being jacked up by direct Government action. I estimate that the increase at the end of the day will be of the order of 5 to 6 per cent.  That will have to be taken into account, as will the cost of living index, in the preparation of any new national understanding.  What the Government are doing in jeopardising the national understanding is the most sinister part of the package we are discussing here today. There is no hope of achieving the progress we all wish for unless there is co-operation with the social partners &mdash; the employers, the workers and, in particular, the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>One example of the credibility of the Government in this respect is the Employment Guarantee Fund.  I note that there are a number of questions tabled to the Minister for Finance in this regard.  Last week we passed the legislation covering this fund.  Legislation was prepared by us on foot of the second last national understanding.  Last year the <Col N="768" /> employers, the trade unions and the Government set up a tripartite fund whereby £20 million was made available and distributed throughout the country for agreed employment projects and for agreed community developments such as the erection of sports and recreational complexes.  As a Government we showed our bona fides in that respect by allocating £10 million, on foot of the last national understanding, to the Employment Guarantee Fund.  The new Government introduced the Bill establishing the fund for this year and the legislation has been put through.  Now there are questions on the Order Paper asking if the money is being spent, asking what is happening in regard to the £10 million that we decided would be the Government's input into the fund.</P>
    <P>There is no point in talking here, as the Minister for Energy talked, in high flowing rhetoric about the need to enhance job creation projects and to develop them if the one positive job-creation project that emerged from the first of the national understandings &mdash; the establishment of this tripartite fund in which employers, Government and trade unions would make their contribution &mdash; is not being put into effect.  We allocated our share of the fund &mdash; £10 million, which represented 50 per cent of the total &mdash; long before the election.  In that way we were keeping our word to the trade union movement.  We await the replies to the questions tabled for today in regard to this fund.</P>
    <P>What is happening in relation to this fund will be evidence of the reality of the bona fides of the Government in this whole area of employment.  Already there is curtailment in terms of capital investment and a freeze in the area of employment in the public service but what is happening in regard to the Employment Guarantee Fund will indicate whether the Government are cooperating with the trade unions and with the employers regarding the implementation of the fund for this year.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to use my full time during this debate.  The points are self-evident <Col N="769" /> and patent.  The Government are travelling along a negative road that will lead to unemployment and to a national recession on top of an international recession. They will compound and worsen the situation by adopting the kind of measures that are being put forward in this financial package.</P>
    <P>There is a world recession and there has been one for the past two years.  We have no control over such a situation but our policy in regard to that recession was adumbrated by our Leader at various summit meetings within the Community, and this policy is, as he said this morning, being adopted at last by the major industrialised nations at the Ottawa conference. That is a policy which does not pursue restriction in a period of recession, which is not negative during such a time but positive and expansionist.  In order to be positive and expansionist in a period of recession certain decisions have to be taken in regard to balance of payments and to budgetary deficits.  One must live with these matters.  In a democracy a society should not be run on the basis of accountancy criteria or of strict banking criteria, nor should a recession be made worse by pursuing negative monetarist policies.  Instead an economy should expand at such a time and should provide the infrastructure to prepare itself for coming out of recession and into a period, we hope, of expansion and stability.</P>
    <P>The policies being pursued by the Government, particularly those policies outlined yesterday by the Minister for Finance, will only compound and worsen the problem.  There is a very clear distinction to be made between the approach which we consistently adopted and the approach being adopted now by the Government parties.</P>
    <P>Our policy was positive, deliberate and planned, there was no question of drifting into a balance-of-payments deficit or into budgetary deficits.  This distinguishes us from Fine Gael who are a party of conservative reactionists, and the Labour Party have walked into it by joining with them on this occasion.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister made that point.  We refused to follow the negative restrictive policies being pursued by the British Prime Minister, policies which she claimed to be following as a matter of virtue.  We decided that in the Irish situation a different and more positive remedy was required and that remedy was to maintain a rate of expansion and to build up our infrastructure so as to be ready to move forward at the end of the recession.  As our Leader said this morning that decision was based on one consideration that distinguishes us from any other nation within the Community. That is our expanding population.  We are the only country within the Community to have such a preponderance of young people within an expanding population, and that very factor made our position totally different, totally <i>sui generis</i> and gave us a case to be examined on its own merits.  Our point of view was seen by the bankers and by the economists of Europe and we had no difficulty whatever about raising the necessary funds, not only from the European Investment Bank but from other sources <Col N="771" /> available to Community institutions, for expansion and development.  That very problem of having such a large proportion of the population made up of young people is our strength as a country.  Any positive economist will recognise that.  It would be only a negative accountancy economist who would see the situation otherwise.  It is to our positive advantage that we have this reservoir of talent and ability in our young people.  It is a challenge to us to raise the necessary funds to expand training and educational facilities so as to enable these young people to make a worthwhile contribution to Irish society.</P>
      <P>In this document there is talk about curtailment of public expenditure to which I referred earlier and the Department of Education is one of the Departments singled out and specified in this document as an appropriate area for curtailing public expenditure.  We do not have half enough money for our education and training requirements and we were enabled to get some moneys from the EEC by way of direct grants from some of the institutions and by way of loan from other institutions.  We had no difficulty during our tenure of office in obtaining these moneys for the very reasons I have mentioned and the arguments I have advanced: that they recognised that Ireland had a particular case by reason of this enriching element of young people in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people in the EEC and its institutions looked at this in a positive way because they and any positive economist could see that one of the weaknesses in many of our EEC partner countries is this very strength of ours.  They have a declining population, reducing birth figures and a preponderance of older people and, therefore, inevitably in time there will be less productivity, less creativity, less expansion in Community countries going in that direction.  This great asset of ours is there to be tapped and it can be tapped only by expanding State investment, by providing an environment for the expansion of private investment and by a positive policy of growth.  That policy, if pursued, can sometimes run <Col N="772" /> counter to the sacred cows of balance of payments and budgetary accounting.  If one has to make the choice between having a budget deficit on the one hand and expansion in the area that I have mentioned on the other hand, I will all the time in Government &mdash; I hope to be back again &mdash; opt for investment in expansion and development as against some sacred adherence to balancing payments or budget accounts.</P>

I salute the substantial minority in the Labour Party who refused at their post-election conference to go along with this Coalition nonsense.

      <P>They participated with us in the formulation of national understandings. They saw that we understood their problem on the level of concluding national understandings and that we had a positive approach to the overall economic development and investment growth that they saw as essential for the future of this country.  The partnership between the last Government and the Irish trade union movement was the most fulfilling and rewarding from the national point of view of any such partnership between Government and non-governmental agencies in the history of this State and will be seen to have been such. I hope from the point of view of the <Col N="773" /> country that that policy is pursued with vigour and that they do not stand away from problems in this area.  It is difficult, thorny, sensitive and delicate but it is a long policy of co-operation and partnership and it shows the social partners in our community that Governments can make progress in the future.</P>
      <P>To the majority in this House it does not matter a tráithnín, as the former Deputy Dillon used to say, because the majority in this House can get you nothing and nowhere unless you find an acceptance and acceptability from the various social partners in our community. That is the essence of modern democracy. It is shared responsibility.  It is not just a majority who may reside in this House who provide the Government. That is not the end of the story.  The responsibility for problems and their solutions must be shared with other people who have a contribution to make in our community, particularly in terms of our society and modern society generally.

      <P>We are taking note of who are offering in the debate and I am sure you will get an opportunity of coming in on it at some stage.  I am not the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I will be here for just a short period.  I am sure that you will be facilitated.  If the Minister is giving way to Deputy Kemmy we will continue with the debate.</P>

      <P>You came under fire on this as you have just stepped into the Chair and I am sorry that the Ceann Comhairle or Leas-Cheann Comhairle did not take the brunt of the fire.  We will have to examine some of these precedents in the House because in the cause of commonsense and practicality they will have to be discarded as far as I am concerned.</P>
      <P>As an Independent Deputy I was invited by Deputy Haughey, the former Taoiseach, to justify my support for the Government's budget in divisions last night.  I was taunted repeatedly by another Member of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, to give my reasons for supporting the Government's budget.  Deputy Fitzgerald has left the chamber but I have no fears in responding to his challenge and giving my reasons for supporting the budget at divisions last night.  The choice which confronted all Deputies in this House, and especially the Independent Deputies, was to support the Coalition Government in their dealing with the economic crisis before the country or to return to Fianna Fáil's economic policies which were responsible for creating the present economic crisis in the first place. The cupboard is bare.  A vote for Fianna Fáil at present would be a vote of approval for the present economic mess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see that in simple terms; I have no reason to revise it, there is no third choice for me as a socialist Deputy.  I regret this, but there is nothing I can do about it. <Col N="776" /> Given the political realities I have outlined, while I have reservations about the budget, which is far from ideal, I have decided to support the Coalition budget on this occasion.  I have no illusions about why my vote has been given, nor have I any illusions about the nature of this budget.  I have no apologies to make for my voting decision last night.  I have no intention of allowing myself to be cast in the role of apologist for the Coalition in giving my support for the budget on these votes.  I did not come to the House to abstain or to sit on the fence.  It would be easy to do this but I intend to vote and to speak on every possible occasion.  As someone who holds the balance of power, I do not intend to hold the Government to ransom.  I do not intend to cry wolf on every division.  I am very familiar with the parable about the boy and the wolf and how nobody took him seriously when he called wolf too often.  The support I give to the Government will be conditional.  If a time comes when I must withdraw that support I will tell the Taoiseach openly my reason for doing so.  I will also tell him in private if necessary. I do not intend to be mealy-mouthed about my support for the Government's budget.  I have no intention of wringing my hands in horror in public and having a public crisis of conscience on any occasion when there is a vote.  We had enough histrionics and theatricals from the Fianna Fáil benches last night.  They are a luxury I cannot afford.</P>
    <P>There are some features of the budget which I find unwelcome.  Indirect taxation is a speedy means of bringing money to the Exchequer.  However, it is basically an indiscriminate and blunt instrument for achieving this objective and hits hardest at the lower income sections of the community.  The 50 per cent increase in VAT is going to make life even more difficult for those sections of the public to which I have referred.  We heard a good deal this morning about the implications of VAT on school books.  If Deputy Haughey and the Fianna Fáil Government were so concerned about VAT on school books why did they not take it off in the last four years?  Why come along now and throw their hands in the air in <Col N="777" /> horror at this increase?  The increase is distasteful and unwelcome but Deputy Haughey had ample opportunity for removing that VAT when he had a majority of 20 Deputies in the House and was in a strong position to do so.  He was the Napoleon of Irish politics.  I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, did not show some ingenuity in going after both forms of taxation and that he had to rely on the old reliable standby of indirect taxation.  I hope the 50 per cent increase in VAT is an emergency measure designed to correct the present economic decline and that it will be abolished when the economy is again in good shape.  I am also disappointed that the Minister did not use his powers to go after tax evaders and the hidden wealth in our society.</P>
    <P>The £5 million taxation on the banks is welcome but this figure could be multiplied ten times over.  Any one of the major banking chains could have given £5 million and not have missed it from their profits.  I see no reason why the banks should not contribute to job creation by channelling some of their vast profits into job creation programmes. The leaders of our main political parties have close liaison with the banks; they are not going to bite the hand that feeds them.  Nevertheless, the £5 million is a welcome innovation.  It is the thin end of the wedge and I intend to push that wedge as far as possible because, in my talks with the three party leaders, I mentioned this as being a positive way forward. It shows some indication of the will of the Government to go after these profits.</P>
    <P>We have a lot of wealthy bloodstock breeders in the area I come from, the Golden Vale.  I do not know how much it takes to keep a race horse but I am sure it costs as much as to keep a family. Racing is called the sport of kings.  I do not know much about it as I have never been to a race meeting in my life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The racing industry keeps 9,000 people at work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>It does, but the people <Col N="778" /> who own race horses should contribute on the same lines as PAYE workers who cannot afford to keep a pigeon, a cat or a dog.  The PAYE workers are paying through the nose and carrying the whole economy on their backs.  There is no reason why a person paying PAYE should be crippled by taxation while a bloodstock breeder can get off scot-free.</P>
      <P>I regret the reintroduction of car tax and the increase in the price of petrol. These measures will cause hardship and distress to many people.  The tax evasions I have mentioned must be tackled by the Government.  Wealthy farmers, professional and business people have all kinds of loopholes and devices for avoiding taxation.</P>
      <P>The increases in the costs of beer and spirits will also prove unpopular and will bring the price of alcohol here out of line with the prices in many other countries. We heard a great deal from Deputy Lenihan about industrial relations under the last Government.  He did not refer to the Post Office strike in 1979, which dragged on for a very long time.  It had disastrous effects on the economy and also on the workers in the Post Office. He had very selective views on industrial relations.  I urge the Government to continue consultations with the trade union movement.  Unless they have their backing and support there is no future for any Government.  It is important to preserve whatever relationship exists, to build on it and to consult at all levels with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment figures under the last Government were the highest in the history of the State.  No Fianna Fáil speaker mentioned that.  I am somewhat disappointed that the youth employment scheme is not being brought in immediately. I would like to see it starting tomorrow to offset whatever losses will occur in the public sector.  I agree with one thing Deputy Lenihan said.  I do not regard the teeming population of intelligent, articulate young people coming on to the labour market from schools and colleges as being a problem.  It is a challenge because they represent great potential in our society, if their industry and energy can be channelled into something <Col N="779" /> positive.  It is good that we have so many young, idealistic people.  We must have work for them because, unless we industrialise with foreign and native industry, there is no future for us.  People have been leaving the land since 1840.  There is no way they will go back to the land. We must have industry on two levels, to take people who are leaving the land now and also to cater for a growing population. We must have full employment. Otherwise the country will sink.  We have also seen that, while Mrs. Margaret Thatcher did manage to control the British economy and found some economic solutions to her problems, in terms of human solutions her policies were disastrous. Her chickens are now coming home to roost.  There is now civil disorder, violence and vandalism in British society which up to then had been regarded as one of the most undisturbed and placid societies in the world.  There will be a similar risk of violence in our society if thousands of young people are thrown on to the dole queue, as Mrs. Thatcher did in the United Kingdom.  We should learn from her mistake.</P>
    <P>I want to give the House my impressions, as a new Deputy, on certain procedures which I have seen in operation. The voting procedure here is outmoded, cumbersome and inefficient.  It does not make sense and is a throwback to some other time.  It could be streamlined and improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Griffin) Acting Chairman (Mr. Griffin)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Griffin)</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It is not a matter for this debate.  I would ask the Deputy to confine himself to the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that there were so many divisions brought that to my mind.  I am glad your friend in front of you is prompting you in this area but I will leave the subject now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Excuse me, Deputy. We all have a job to do here.  It is this man's job to inform me on procedure. This is my first time taking the Chair and I resent the Deputy's references to prompting.  I do the job which I am asked <Col N="780" /> to do.  I have been quite liberal with the Deputy.  Since the Deputy stood up to speak he has dealt with matters which are completely irrelevant as far as the present debate is concerned.  I have not interfered. I would ask the Deputy to keep to the resolution which is before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall make no more references to that.  Cliches have a place in Irish politics and we heard lots of cliches here last night about penal and draconian measures.  We need a new set of cliches in terms of budgetary matters. I watched the performance of the front bench members of Fianna Fáil last night during the divisions.  It appeared to me some sort of Greek chorus of moaning and groaning, a ritualistic reaction to the budget debate.  It was a pity that the Opposition members had to respond to budget proposals without having time to peruse them.  An adjournment at a time like that would be a good thing, to enable the members of the Opposition to have an opportunity of studying the document and so speaking in a more precise way on the resumption of business.  I had great sympathy with Deputy Gene Fitzgerald when he attempted to speak last night without having had an opportunity of perusing the documents before the House.  He was endeavouring to anticipate what would emerge in the budget proposals.  His speech was vacuous and long-winded and served no useful purpose. There is a case for a reform of Dáil procedures in that regard, to have an hour's adjournment to give all Deputies a chance of studying the budget proposals more precisely.</P>
      <P>In this Greek chorus Deputy Gene Fitzgerald was cast in a mock heroic role for which he was totally unsuited.  He would have been more suited to a melodramatic, murder in the Red Barn type of play, bordering on the farcical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem that the Red Barn would suit the Deputy speaking a lot better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>It had no place in this House.  The court jester's role was played <Col N="781" /> by Deputy Flor Crowley, who came to the House for that purpose.  It was not a useful debate on an important national item like the budget.  Certainly nobody in the public gallery could have been impressed by that performance.  We owe it to our people to have a more positive and meaningful Opposition to speak about details which are real, not imaginary, and not to indulge in long-winded waffle, as occurred last night.  A lot of time was wasted in this ritualistic, Pavlovian response.  There was no real debate last night, it was more of a conditioned response from the people on the Fianna Fáil side of the House.  If there are to be real budget debates in the future, the Estimates should be taken first.  Some sort of debate would develop from that.  I hope the Minister is listening to this because at the moment the cart is being put before the horse in terms of voting first and having the debate afterwards.</P>

      <P>I do not want to make a fuss, but the Acting Chairman has just come in to replace another temporary Chairman.  The latter told me that I could give way to an Independent Member because he was here longer than I was.  However, I think I was next on the list, with respect to the Deputies opposite. No member of the Fine Gael Party has spoken here yet this morning and it is now 25 minutes to two.</P>

      <P>I agree.  The Minister did concede to Deputy Kemmy at that time.  I made the point that I have been sitting here since 10.30 a.m.  I would ask that the Minister be given a chance to speak now.  I make the point, also, that my speech will be very short, ten to 15 minutes long.</P>

If any Minister or Deputy <Col N="782" /> on the Government benches decides to give way to an Independent Member, I presume he also loses his place in the queue and the next speaker should be an Opposition Deputy.

The situation now is that, assuming that Deputy Flynn were to speak for, say, 25 minutes or some other length of time, by two o'clock no one from my party would yet have spoken.</P>

Deputy Power has just arrived on the Opposition benches and I do not accept that he should speak.  As a public representative and a Deputy for a Cork constituency, I am entitled to speak here.  I do not know why the procedure, which I understood was agreed, has not been proceeded with.  I understand the Minister, Deputy Kelly, was entitled to speak. Because the point was made that Deputy Kemmy had been here for some time, as well, the Minister gave way to him, as I understand it, for that period of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Far be it from me to interfere with the rights of any individual to address this House at any time, but it is important to point out that there is a procedure which has always been adhered to by the Fianna Fáil Party and we will continue to do so.  When we get a notice from the Whips that an Opposition speaker may make his contribution <Col N="788" /> at a certain time, say 2.30 p.m., and if he arrives at 2.25 p.m. he should then be given the opportunity to speak.  I am stating my position.</P>
      <P>This is a political budget.  In no way can it be called an economic budget. There are many inherent weaknesses in it but the most devastating is the fact that it will lead to a much higher rate of inflation. The normal result of higher inflation has always been an increase in unemployment. It appears that this Government have shown very little regard for the level of unemployment.  They spent the last 18 months to two years daily decrying the level of unemployment and now that they have what could be regarded as a reasonable opportunity to do something about this they chose to disregard it.</P>
      <P>They start out on a policy which can only lead to further escalation of unemployment figures and to total disenchantment of the younger people, whom they chose to champion during their election campaign.  During that campaign they made great play of the fact that half our population was under 25 years and they guaranteed them a place in the sun.  They guaranteed the people leaving school an opportunity to get jobs and to do something useful with their lives.  At their first oportunity to do something they embark on a policy that can only lead to increased unemployment.  That is the message coming from the country today.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt but that this can lead to further undesirable results and can give rise to great frustration among the younger people in the community.  This will inevitably lead to violence in many forms, as can be seen from the experience in other countries where similar policies have been adopted.  The blame for such a situation will be placed squarely at the feet of the Coalition Government because of their monetarist policies.  The UK Government tried to cure inflation overnight by total control of the money supply and this has resulted in enormous unemployment.  When we examine that situation we can readily understand the stresses and strains that similar policies will put on job opportunities for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> In the past those who could not obtain suitable work here could seek employment in Britain.  This opportunity has now been cut off and we must maintain our own population at home.  The policies now being followed by the Government can lead only to a severe increase in the unemployment figures.  Such is the view of commentators on the effects of this budget.  I foresee nothing but trouble.</P>
    <P>Our attitude during the past 18 months or two years was to pump the economy during the recessionary period so as to provide the necessary means for the take-off when the upturn comes in the world economy.  It was our opinion that it would be necessary to have a certain amount of pullback in the future but not now.  The result of Fianna Fáil policy was to maintain levels of employment and growth in order best to weather the economic storms and benefit from the upturn at the end of the recession, hopefully next year.</P>
    <P>This mini-budget will depress business confidence and adversely affect job creation. No further job oportunities will be available in the public service and the Government will be relying on the private sector to provide the necessary employment.  How can they expect such a policy to be a success when they have made such vicious assaults on the source of economic growth in the private sector by savage increases affecting all sectors of the community?  They have dealt a blow to the private sector in spite of the fact that it has experienced very tough conditions recently.</P>
    <P>Someone said that this budget would lead us to be a sober nation of pedestrians mostly on the dole.  I support sobriety, but if we are all drawing the dole nobody will be able to afford anything else.  This budget represents a cruel deception by Fine Gael.  They have savagely attacked the basic essentials.  Probably the budget's worst feature is the increase in VAT, which will result in a slowdown in business, especially in the private sector, and will automatically effect a reduction in living standards.  This will affect the whole community, not just those who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed. <Col N="790" /> It is not a matter of tightening one's belt for a month or two in the hope of further economic growth enabling previous standards to be retrieved.  This is just the start of the demands which will be made on the community at large.</P>
    <P>These cuts in living standards will result in disappointments and frustrations. There has always been the hope, especially among the people of the west, that young people would be able to avail of worthwhile job opportunities in the public service.  It is fair to say that the public service get their best brains from the west, but the Government are now cutting off these job opportunities.  Large numbers of young people from the west took up employment in the civil service, in the Garda and teaching and related professions.  From now on there will be no further recruitment.  This is a further indication of what the Coalition Government feel about people from the west. They showed it in no uncertain fashion in the distribution of ministerial portfolios and this is obviously a continuation in that people from the west will suffer most.  However, they are resilient and have the necessary stamina to deal with this matter.  In due course they will give their answer to the Fine Gael party.  The Labour Party do not have any Dáil representation in my area and are not expected to have such representation in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of increasing excise duty has not been adequately spelled out as far as the motor industry is concerned.  The greatest sufferers will be the car assembly industry and the motor industry generally.  Other related industries will also be badly affected.  They are in tough times at the moment but the indications are that they will immediately go on short time.  I do not see why the Labour Party, who have continually stressed the need to maintain and create jobs, can decide to put these people on short time and inevitably to put them out of work.  This policy will remove many skilled people from the Irish scene and it <Col N="792" /> removes opportunities for apprentices to gain experience in this field.  The Government's policy amounts to a vote of no confidence in the motor industry. There has been a savage attack on the motorist and on the motor industry.  The rule of thumb used in that trade is that this kind of increase in excise can be run off at about 8 per cent on the list price which means that an ordinary car costing about £5,000 will increase by about £400. That is not the end of it, because when one adds on the 5 per cent VAT increase in September, the increase will be in the region of £650 to £700 which is a total increase of about 13.2 per cent.  A car is not now regarded as a luxury.  This savage increase will have a detrimental effect on the motor industry.  Coupled with the £2.20 per gallon of petrol which the poor unfortunate motorists will have to pay, plus the road tax, it is a cruel deliberate deception by Fine Gael to draw fire on the motor industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the Minister to suggest in his budget that this industry could bear this kind of burden suggests that he is not fully aware of how people regard motor cars. The vast majority of people use their cars daily to get to and from work so these increases are a continuing burden.  A car is not a discretionary expenditure any more, it is mandatory.  To seek out this area for harsh treatment shows a lack of caring on the part of the Coalition. The half smirk with which the Minister announced this savage increase indicates a coldness towards the ordinary people. Maybe the Government are so divorced from the wishes and the needs of the people that they saw it as a fitting way to get money.  When the Minister was asked a question yesterday evening in relation to the savage attack on petrol, he said that it was a good way to get money.  Was that the way in which it was decided?  Did they just pick out a few things irrespective of who would be hurt?  Their criteria was just the quickest way to get money, which suggests a cold, calculating attitude towards a section of the community.  It is not a just way in which to provide the money for the Government.  This is a rushed budget and we know why.  They <Col N="793" /> are trying to discredit as far as possible the outgoing administration because if they waited for a while there would be no credibility to that argument and there would be revolution in the streets against this savage demand.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Coalition on a good campaign, on the effectiveness of that public relations exercise in trying to get the people to believe that there was a terrible situation to be dealt with.  Figures were picked out of the hat, no figures that could be substantiated by statistics but figures that were suggested would be the end result at the end of the year or next year some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that there was something wrong.  The truth is that things were not that bad at all so it was necessary to follow through on that policy to get this cash to pay for some of the wild schemes which they hope to provide next year, schemes which will never develop.  To get a few &ldquo;quid&rdquo; in now their policy has been live horse and get grass later on, so that they could provide a few goodies next year if at all possible and so that they could then run to the country and say: Well, we are giving you a good budget now is the time to repay us, forget what we did last July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of this country are no longer so gullible.  They recognise fully that there is no need for these drastic measures at this point in time.  I would suggest to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism sitting opposite that he take a walk home this evening &mdash; although I understand that is what he likes to do rather than use the State car &mdash; and meet some of his ordinary constituents, taxpayers, and ask them whether they think it was necessary to impose such taxes on the motor car and <Col N="794" /> that related industry at this time, when I bet he will be given the right answer.  Of course it is hoped that by doing it now quickly, going into the recess period, it will be forgotten by the end of the year. But they can rest assured that it is the intention of the Fianna Fáil Party to ensure that it is not forgotten.  We will be taking every course open to us to remind the general public that this is a far cry from what they could have expected had they continued with Fianna Fáil in government. However, that is the way it goes.</P>
    <P>One might have expected that, if they were going to savage the motor industry to the degree they have, at the same time they would have provided an adequate public transport system to facilitate those people who can no longer afford to take out their car, who can no longer afford the tax on it.  Formerly when there was tax on cars people had to find this finance every quarter or half year.  They are being asked to find that finance again.  There-fore quite a large number of them will not be able to use their motor vehicles to the extent they would like.  Quite a number may decide not to use them at all.  In those circumstances it would be the responsibility of the Government to provide an efficient transport system which, as far as city dwellers are concerned, means a reasonable bus service.  But is it not strange that nothing has been done by the Coalition Government to resolve the current drastic situation so far as the buses are concerned throughout the country?  The first day the Dáil resumed a Private Notice Question was put down to the Minister for Transport as to what he and his colleague, the Minister for Labour, were doing about it.  The Minister for Transport did not even appear to know that the Minister for Labour was sitting next to him.  Of course they are not in the same party and it is not as easy to be in communication with somebody who is of a different political persuasion. I understand that it is difficult.  It might even be difficult to know the location of that person's office, especially if they are not on talking terms.</P>
    <P>One would expect that when the Government meet, the two parties sit around <Col N="795" /> the same table; at least we hope they are all there, and that it might have been possible to arrange some kind of meeting between the Ministers for Transport and Labour and that perhaps jointly or separately they would have taken some initiative.</P>
    <P>They are being called upon by all concerned, the unions, the workers, everybody to please do something for them: there is so little between us, could we have ministerial intervention?  How can one have ministerial intervention when one Minister is not on the same political wave length as the other?  One of them should have taken the initiative.  Not one thing has been done.  Neither do we hear any public statements about what they are doing.  We are told only: do not say anything because matters are at a delicate stage of negotiation.  We know that old trick &mdash; what negotiations?  Are the people of the country not entitled to know what efforts are being made today, what efforts were made yesterday, to resolve the bus strike?  Have people become so flattened in their attitude towards this Government that they accept the leth-argy of these two Ministers?  That cannot be said of the previous Administration who made every effort, who grasped every opportunity and who dealt with any crisis flashpoint immediately.  That is why there were no stoppages.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that these things were laid down in advance.  If a flashpoint arose it was looked at, dealt with, and if there was a necessity to negotiate with somebody, whether it was unions, workers or others, that was done.  That is the way to defuse a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity the Deputy did not tell Deputy Pádraig Faulkner that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious the Government cannot maintain control.  They have thrown in the towel as far as the provision of a public transport service is concerned. That would be bad enough in normal circumstances but when they have thrown in the towel after the imposition of a savage set of increases like those imposed on the motorist, that is bordering on total irresponsibility on their part. They should take the option open to them, throw in the towel altogether, go back to the country and see what answer they will get.</P>
      <P>This is a typical example of bad administration on behalf of the Coalition Government &mdash; the way in which they are now dealing with and continuing to look at our transport system.  Then they expect the innocent people to pay these savage increases in petrol, in tax on their cars, pay 13.2 per cent extra on changing their cars, with motor industry workers being put out of employment, retailers being put out of business and skilled craftsmen also out of jobs.  Surely there were a few pounds to be got by imposing a fairly decent tax on the bicycle considering that there are now more bicycles being used in this city than at any time in the past ten years.  I understand from importers and retailers of bicycles that the industry is booming, and certainly it will continue to do so while the Coalition Government remain in office.  However, no doubt they will find tandems for their final rally. There is no doubt in my mind that inflation is self perpetuating.  What was done yesterday will add approximately 6 per cent to the inflation rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="797" /> What will the Government say to union negotiators when the truth of that statement is borne out?  Union negotiators will see it as a total erosion of the purchasing power of their members' wages.  The natural and normal thing for any union worth its salt or regarding themselves as a decent negotiating body will be to seek redress.  Therefore they will seek an extra 6 per cent to compensate their members for their loss of living standards and purchasing power imposed in one fell swoop here yesterday.  But of course they have been given due notice by the Government that their claims will not be entertained. Therefore in effect the Government are saying that they are throwing out the negotiating process, that it is not going to be on this year.  Is that not a formula for unrest?  Is that not a formula for distrust between management, unions and Government?  Is that not the way in which to create friction and division between Government and people and people and Government and the representatives of the work force?  That is a sure way of bringing about a situation of uncontrolled unrest within the trade union movement?  Who would blame them for seeking an adjustment on behalf of their members in an effort to maintain their present standard of living?</P>
    <P>Neither is it just a question of the unions.  What about the manufacturers? They were attacked on all fronts yesterday. They see rising costs now because of the VAT situation, the fuel situation and a whole range of additional costs they must bear.  It has been recognised that there are both large and small companies in this country keeping themselves barely on the margin hoping to weather the economic storm and the recessionary period. What does this measure do?  It puts them below the wave.  Now they will see their small profits being further depressed. They must seek to compensate themselves in order to stay alive.  They must increase their prices to compensate for this savage attack on them.  They must increase them to satisfy the demands which will be made on them on behalf of the union members working in their factories. The unions will get their way because that will be conceded by the <Col N="798" /> Government.  The manufacturers will have to increase their price levels and their unit costs of production to satisfy the union demands.</P>
    <P>We will see the spiral of increases again as far as manufacturers are concerned. Overall production costs will go up.  That will destroy our competitiveness as far as our export markets are concerned.  This subsequently affects the balance of payments situation so instead of the Government curing the financial situation they will worsen the balance of payments situation even further.  In the long run, increased unit costs will lead to further unemployment, they will harm our competitiveness on the export markets and will result in further closures of manufacturing industries, which have been just on the margin for the last year or two.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the small business concerns as well as the large manufacturing industries.  Some of the small businesses are not concerned with export business.  After the Fianna Fáil budget earlier this year they were able to plan their programme for 12 months ahead. They were able to plan their production levels and their employment levels.  They knew where they were going for the 12 months and it was possible for them to review their position and make the necessary financial arrangements.</P>
    <P>All that has changed now with the Fine Gael deflationary budget.  Now they have to go back again to their drawing boards. I spoke to some small business concerns engaged in service industries and manufacturing industries and they told me that they have to go back now and renegotiate with their friendly bank managers to see if they can get the necessary finance to tide them over the further interference with their businesses.  Will their bank managers be as friendly as they used to be? How can they be when this Coalition Government have decided to single them out as well for a little treatment?  What has been dreamt up for them is the start of a pattern.  It was necessary to ask the banks to put their hands in their pockets and support this ailing Government because it was part of the Labour policy enunciated during the election campaign that something would have to be done to <Col N="799" /> get their hands on the savings of the ordinary people which were lodged in the banking institutions.  As a sop to the Labour Party they decided they would start on this.  They will get a few million pounds this year but there is no problem, once the pattern is set, in raising it from £5 million to £50 million.  The banking institutions are looking very cautiously today at the package introduced yesterday because they see in it a change of attitude from traditional Government dealings with them.  They see this as the first effort in support of the smoked salmon socialists who are now part of the Coalition Government, to create a situation where in the end the financial institutions will become&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I must refer to something which affects people in the west to a great degree and for which the Coalition Government showed no regard at all yesterday. I refer to the tourist industry.  The only result of the savage attack by both VAT and motor increases in the budget is that there will have to be massive increases in hotel prices.  This will make the tourist industry very noncompetitive. The budget has done everything possible to hit any area which was bringing in money.  The tourist industry has always been of great importance to the people in the west.  Tourists need a car to get there.  The Government are making it impossible for the tourist industry to survive. <Col N="800" /> They certainly deserve the result they got in the west.  This will be renewed the first time the Government have the courage to go back and ask for a mandate.</P>
      <P>The situation in relation to the budget is like the treatment given to a patient in hospital.  The Government are killing the patient by an over-surgical desire.  This is not the way to treat the patient.  The way to treat the patient is to allow him to get a little stronger before he is given further surgery.  It is obvious to me there was certainly need to create the new post of Minister for Poverty.  I presume the terms of reference of that particular office will be to combat the Minister for Hardship in what he has been doing for the last two days and what he will do in the future.</P>
      <P>The Government have not yet stated if they will continue their commitment to the approval of the capital requirements outlined by the previous Government.  Is it true that every Department have been ringing around and giving the instruction not to sign any contract, that it is going on the long finger.  When the general public become aware of that they will give their answer to the Government.  We hope, perhaps sometime next year, that the benefits of the policy enunciated during the election compaign by the Labour Party and Fine Gael will come to pass but the people are sceptical that that will ever happen.</P>
      <P>The Coalition parties by seducing the females of the country to sell themselves for £9.60 per week and then not deliver on the goods is expecting the women of this country to take too much.  Who will benefit has not yet been spelled out but the list of those who will not benefit is so long that it appears to me that just a few females attached to some of the Members of the opposite side may be the lucky ones.  Certainly, I suppose they will support their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are disappointed that the promises regarding taxation are not being honoured. Even the simple promise of increased children's allowances that was bandied about at every hall door on the basis that it was not something in the future but something that would be done as soon as they got the opportunity &mdash;<Col N="801" /> which meant getting into the corridors of power &mdash; has not been fulfilled.  They are there now and their first act is to bring in a package that can be regarded only as the first of a number of savage blows on the people.  If they have not killed the patient they are about to do so before next April but hopefully the people will get an opportunity before then to show what they think of this first effort in deflationary monetary policy.</P>

A project team, consisting of representatives of the health board and my Department, have been working for some time on the preparation of a planning brief for the development of the hospital and the brief is expected to be completed within a few months.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>In this matter Deputy Barry is correct.  The problem is that if work were to start on the project this year it would be necessary to allocate £100,000 in the present year rising to an expenditure of about £300,000 in 1982. No provision was made in the capital programme for 1981 for this project. There is difficulty about the price tendered as a result of the advertisement and the price acceptable to the experts in my Department.  They claim it exceeds by 20 per cent what would be acceptable.  This matter is at present under negotiation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if she has received any request from the Southern Health Board to provide a major accident centre at Mallow Hospital, County Cork; and, if not, if she will direct that such a development takes place especially in view of the great services that the hospital staff have rendered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not received such a request.  I would hesitate to issue a direction on the lines suggested by the Deputy. It is primarily for the health board to define the roles of each of their hospitals in their major accident plan and the plan must take account of various possibilities as to the nature of these accidents and their location.  Hence, in the case of Cork, it is understandable that the major specialised regional hospital at Wilton is best situated to cope with the variety of conditions and circumstances for which the plan must cope.  I do not think it would be reasonable for the board to duplicate at Mallow all the facilities available at Wilton.</P>
      <P>I would make it clear that I fully recognise the role that Mallow can play, in conjunction with the regional hospital, in the major accident plan and the Mallow Hospital admirably demonstrated its ability to perform in this role on the occasion of the tragic rail crash at Buttevant in August 1980.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CareyJoyce" hpid="Mr. Joyce Mr. Joyce">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joyce</NameTxt>
      <P>Would a major accident centre be designated for the Mallow area as it is a very important area? It caters for a very large catchment area with a growing population, with increasing industrial use, being at the crossroads of a very important rail junction.  It played a very important part recently in a major accident.  The Mallow Hospital catered very well in regard to this accident. Would the Minister designate this area as a major accident centre for the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given my reply referring to it.  You have accident centres in hospitals like Tralee, Cork Regional Hospital and Bantry.  Those are the three catering for that purpose under the <Col N="805" /> Southern Health Board.  I referred to Mallow in my reply to the effect that while Mallow is a support hospital in that regard, it is not thought necessary or advisable to duplicate the services that are available at Cork Regional Hospital in Mallow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CareyJoyce" hpid="Mr. Joyce Mr. Joyce">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joyce</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the increased population there we feel aggrieved that it is not a major accident centre which is very necessary in the north Cork area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The facilities are provided in places like Cork Regional Hospital and just because of an accident in Buttevant you do not determine that the local hospital should become a major accident centre.  So, I cannot accede to the Deputy's request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CareyJoyce" hpid="Mr. Joyce Mr. Joyce">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joyce</NameTxt>
      <P>With the increased traffic on the roads it is essential that we have a major hospital nearer hand.  The Mallow area caters for 20,000 people.  We are surprised that Mallow has not been designated as a major hospital centre.  Would the Minister make a commitment that in the future this would be designated a major accident centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give that under-taking at this stage.  Mallow at present is not equipped for what the Deputy has envisaged in his question.  Considerable investment would be needed to provide facilities similar to those available in the regional hospital and I do not think it is necessary at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that Mallow should not be downgraded in any way and that it did play a very major part after the Buttevant disaster? There is no doubt that six people would certainly have died if it had not been for Mallow Hospital and the facilities it had. Will the Minister give an undertaking that these facilities will be maintained and improved where that is necessary?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">

      <P>My Department have had such a request.  The provision of a maternity unit at Mallow has been a subject of consideration by the Southern Health Board, Comhairle na nOspidéal and my Department since May 1977.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The schemes of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board are basically there to meet the needs of those who wish to opt for private care and this consideration is not affected by a change in the rate of health contributions.  In the past, the introduction of the system of health contributions, and modifications made in that system did not affect the development of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, and I do not expect that the further changes now proposed in the scheme of health contributions will result in a decline in the number of subscribers or in the income of the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board are one of our most successful semi-State bodies and that up to this point their membership and income have been increasing?  Further, will the Minister not agree that the amount of disposable income available for health insurance will be reduced for individuals because of the very large health charges being made?  For example, there will be a charge of £250 per annum for a person with an income of £10,000.  Will the Minister not agree that this curtailment of disposable income could have a serious effect on the membership and income of <Col N="809" /> the VHI?

      <P>The proposed increase in the rate of health contributions falls to be considered in association with the Government's proposals for the reform of the income tax system.

      <P>The Minister told the House the other day that the multiplier will not be increased in the present year. Does that mean that the farmer multiplier will be increased from the beginning of the next tax year to bring in the appropriate amount of tax which has been estimated for?</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that the revised health contributions will be considered in the context of income tax reform.  Is this not simply a new form of tax without any tax-free allowances, unlike the income tax code? Is it the intention that this so-called health contribution is to cover some proportion of the cost of the health services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>This is to maintain the existing health services.  With the rapid increase in costs, the Deputy will be aware the cost of the health services is increasing every year, and the great problem is that the services have run down since last year and this is an effort to maintain the services and to improve them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the figure of £87 million not an enormous one and would any portion of that not do a great deal of good for the many requirements within the health services?  Since it is not intended to apply any of this money in that direction, does the Minister not agree that Deputy O'Donoghue's analysis is the cor-correct one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy that the figure is part of an overall figure, part of a package which the Deputy seems to find great comfort in quoting.  As I have told him, he is taking the figure completely out of context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the question I asked.  I asked the Minister if she will state whether all this information could have been readily available from the Minister's office or by means of a direct inquiry to the Department of Social Welfare?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make every effort to assist a Deputy to secure information through either method of approach.

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am touched by Deputy Haughey's concern, but I had the same difficulty when he was Minister for Social <Col N="815" /> Welfare and when his successor, Deputy Woods, was Minister.  There seems to be great difficulty in the Department, which has been plagued by problems during the past couple of years.  I am asking the Minister what attempts have been made to solve these problems and if any success have been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of matters relate to that problem.  There has been a great deal of progress.  The initial problem was mainly due to the change over to computer and the connection with the Department of Finance when we moved over to pay-related benefits.  Most of the problems have been ironed out.  The difficulty which caused the Deputy's first question was an administrative error. Many of these difficulties have been looked into and have been ironed out. By the end of June all records were practically up to date but then a new industrial dispute caused further problems.  In relation to the problem about replies, obviously in the past Deputies found it necessary to seek urgent information or action in this way.  I would hope that, with increased efficiency in the Department, that need will not continue for much longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the assertion by Deputy Haughey that people should write letters and not ask questions.  This is our democratic right.  If my constituents can get results within three days by having a Dáil question asked instead of in three months, which is the normal waiting time after writing a letter, I will ask a question and so should everybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister of State if the putting down by a Deputy of a number of questions in detail of this sort takes up a great deal of administrative time and effort in the Department and, in fact, contributes to the delay and the problems to which she has adverted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The question related to one person.  I would imagine that the same administrative attention would be given to the problem whether it arose in a letter to my Department or in the form of a Dáil question.  Ultimately the same amount of investigation would go into it. It is regrettable that in the past Deputies found this necessary, and that this tradition has built up.  I would hope that a more efficient service will emerge over the next 12 months or so as the new Ministers begin to make an impact on the Department.  The problems with the changeover which caused the original delays have been cleared up and should not recur.  If we come back to this problem in ten or 12 months perhaps the need to put down this type of question will not exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State assuring the House that she is taking steps to ensure that Deputies will get information much more freely from the Department of Social Welfare than has been the practice over the past two, three or four years?  Will she assure the House that she will take steps to ensure that Deputies and members of the public will be able to get through to the Department on the telephone within a reasonable time?  I suggest that a reasonable time would be within half-a-day because very often it takes up to half-a-week to get through on the telephone to the Department.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick-East</i>): Can the Minister guarantee that if any other sections of the Department of Social Welfare are computerised in the future, she will run a parallel system until the bugs are taken out of the computer?  This is normal procedure when one changes over to a computer.  If she did that we would not have the silly situation which appertained over the past 12 months.  The computer programme failed and people were left without disability benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Deputy's comments.  The procedure he recommends would be much more desirable than the one which existed in the past.  In reply to Deputy McMahon, the Minister is committed to making the system more efficient.  Apart from replies to inquiries by Deputies, the service to the public should be more efficient and more speedy.  I hope that the problems about letters to the Department and questions in the House will become less urgent.</P>

She was paid initially at the rate appropriate to a married woman without a dependant.  On review of her claim, however, an adjusting payment issued in respect of the difference between the rate appropriate to a married woman with one child dependant who is separated from her husband and the amount already received by her.</P>

      <P>One member of the family referred to in the Deputy's question claimed unemployment assistance and in the assessment of means the circumstances of his family were fully investigated after which a deciding officer assessed means at the rate of £17.50 weekly derived from the value of board and lodging in his parents' household.</P>
      <P>The claimant was dissatisfied with the assessment of means and his case was referred to an appeals officer for determination. The appeals officer, whose decision is final and conclusive, upheld the decision of the deciding officer assessing means at £17.50 weekly.</P>

      <P>The amount is based on the general method of assessment.  There is a general question coming up later. Obviously this is a very small amount but it is what is left over when the normal adjustments are made, taking into account the whole income coming into a family.  In the case of unemployment assistance all means are taken into account.  The quality of board and lodgings is assessed and valued and taken into account as an item of means before assessing an individual for unemployment assistance.  The entitlement is £2.25.  In this case had the full value of the board and lodging been taken into account and had there been no limiting factor of 12½ per cent of the family income <Col N="821" /> being the maximum, this person would have received no money.  He benefited from one of the limitations in the scheme.</P>

      <P>The investigation revealed that the applicant resided with his parents, five sisters and one brother. His father is employed by Waterford Co-op. and his certified net earnings in the past 12 months were £7,805.39.  His brother and two sisters were also in employment.  Three other children are school going.  Since the initial report one of the girls who was in employment left work of her own accord.  She claimed unemployment benefit in June 1981 but, having signed one day, did not pursue her claim.  Inquiries also revealed that the applicant's married sister, her husband and child occassionally visit the family home but do not reside there.  They have their own home in Waterford.  There has been an appeal in the case but there could be a further application and reconsideration of the case.</P>

      <P>Obviously one would have great sympathy with an adult person who is incapable of getting employment and trying to live on an income of £2.  It could even have been less in some cases. It would be desirable to extend the benefit as far as possible.  This would be the general intention.  As things operate at present the system is constantly examined. <Col N="822" /> The appeals officer constantly reviews the situation and makes recommendations on the question of assessing board and lodgings as a genuine element in means.  In considering it in future I will take into account the fears and obvious points of value raised by Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The only area in which there were arrears of social welfare payments was that relating to payment of disability benefit and associated benefits. During recent months considerable progress had been made in reducing these arrears and it had been hoped that the situation would now have been reached <Col N="824" /> where such payments would be made as they became due.  However, since 29 June 1981, staff who are members of the Civil &amp; Public Services' Staff Association have, in pursuance of a grade claim, placed a ban on overtime working and have refused to operate certain items of computer equipment.  The effect of this action is that, while payment of disability benefit to existing claimants continues to be made reasonably promptly, new claims cannot be dealt with due to inability to obtain from the computer details of the contribution records on which entitlement is based.</P>
      <P>It is regretted that while the present impasse exists there is no prospect of an improvement in the position regarding disability benefit payments.  In fact, as already indicated, the processing of new claims is seriously affected and is likely to deteriorate if the industrial action by the staff continues.</P>

Is the Minister in a position to say what savings resulted to the Department on a monthly basis over the last year or so as a consequence of delay on the part of that Department in paying out benefits and whether, in relation to the recent calculation of the State's deficit, account is taken of the volume of arrears and considerable payments which still have to be made to those long suffering people who have not yet received payment? Can the Minister explain how in the case of an industrial accident which occured in early May the family have not yet received any payments and have had difficulty in obtaining supplementary benefit from the local authority?</P>

All credit is due to the staff involved for their efforts to improve the situation and all thanks must go to them.  The situation was a long-standing one.

Some applicants found it necessary to call at social service centres, convents and such places in order to be able to eat while that dispute was going on.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us that no new claims can be dealt with and that has been the position since 29 June. That was the time at which the industrial action was escalated, but I should like to inform the House that industrial action existed for some time before then.  It is apparent from what the Minister has said that no new claims for disability benefit have been dealt with since 29 June.  This will result in a very serious situation.  Is the same position applying also to unemployment claims?  I ask the question because a number of people have expressed to me their concern about not being able to get unemployment benefit. This week there was a very alarming situation to the extent that a large notice appeared at one of the health centres in Dublin to the effect that those being refused unemployment benefit would not be able to get supplementary welfare. Apparently, this is related to the industrial action.  In these circumstances what special measures are to be taken to deal with the situation, a situation which is extremely alarming at this stage?</P>

Because of this we are going ahead with contingency plans, but obviously we are not in a position to specify such plans at this stage.  As yet there is no full extension of the dispute to the unemployment exchanges.  A situation in which claims can not be dealt with is obviously very serious.  The supplementary welfare scheme was intended to cover emergency situations only, but that scheme is under stress.  However I assure the Deputy that the whole situation is under consideration and that plans will be ready in the event of any further breakdown to deal with cases of hardship arising out of the present circumstances.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit for the period 10 March 1980 to 10 May 1980, after which date he was certified fit to resume work.  When he first claimed benefit he was not entitled to payment as, according to the records of my Department, he was not qualified on his insurance record.  It was necessary to make inquiries regarding his employment in the contribution year 1978, the year on which his entitlement to benefit was based.  As a result of these inquiries it was established that he had sufficient weeks of insurable employment in that year to qualify him for payment <Col N="828" /> on his claim.  Arrears of contributions due were paid by the employers but owing to an oversight the section responsible for paying benefits was not notified. All benefit due from 13 March 1980, fourth day of incapacity, to 10 May 1980 has, however, now been issued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I dispute that reply. Is the Minister aware that, in a case in which the widow of a pensioner who dies has not herself reached pension age, she does not qualify for the benefits to which her husband had been entitled?  This situation constitutes an injustice and should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The benefits to which the Deputy is referring relate to free electricity, free television licence and free travel.  These facilities are available to pensioners either living alone or with certain specified categories of persons.  In relation to these allowances, widows are dealt with on the same basis as are all others who are entitled to such facilities &mdash; usually old age type pensioners.  I <Col N="830" /> appreciate that the concern of the Deputy relates to the standard of living of widows and I expect that the matter can be looked at immediately but in a wider context than in the specific context of the extension of these facilities to widows in the case the Deputy mentions where they are younger.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>While everybody would see these benefits as desirable, the cost of extending the free electricity allowance to all widows under 66 years would be £1.9 million, the cost of the free television extension would be £633,000 and the cost of the free travel would be approximately £1.7 million.  The Deputy raised rather specific matters and our Government's commitment in that matter will be clear in my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for the area of poverty. We will be looking into those areas. A lot of these extensions are piecemeal and do not examine the roots of the problem. I would see my brief as examining the problems of poverty groups and I would consider the aged and widows to be quite often in that category, but widows <Col N="831" /> are far from inevitably in that category. In that area I will be looking into the whole question of their way of living and improving their standard of living.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State accept that in the case I stated there is no actual extra expense involved to the State or to her Department?  The Department are making a saving inasmuch as they are depriving a widow of something which was available while her husband lived in taking away free television, radio and travel. In that instance is there not something which could be looked at immediately and dealt with?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">

      <P>The situation of the younger widow being deprived of such things is something we had not considered in the context of this question.

      <P>I would like to point out that at about 2 o'clock today I had to get on my feet and ask if I was going to be allowed to speak on the budget debate. I had been here since 10.30 a.m. I was informed by the Chief Whip for the Opposition that there was an understanding or an arrangement whereby a Government spokesperson will speak and then an Opposition spokesperson will speak, but it was conceded that Deputy Kemmy was allowed to speak.  Does that system apply?  Do I get a chance to speak in this debate?  I did say that I would not be speaking for very long.</P>

      <P>The reason Deputy Kemmy spoke this morning was that I let him in when I should have been speaking myself.  I do not regret having done so, because I had the benefit of listening to his remarks.  I felt a little saddened, as I have heard such remarks before, and I have even said such things myself when I was talking about the quality of the debate here on one of these stock occasions such as a set of budget resolutions. He complained, with a lot of justice, about the way he had heard Deputy Gene Fitzgerald speak.  He complained about his routine aggressiveness.  He complained also about Deputy Flor Crowley for a slightly different reason.  If Deputy Kemmy thinks he has heard the limit of Deputy Fitzgerald's range he is in for a surprise.  If Deputy Fitzgerald reverts to the form he showed in the Twentieth Dáil, he will make the acquaintance of Deputy Gene Fitzgerald's ranting and raving up and down the scale, like a coloratura foghorn, which could be heard out in the street.  No matter what the occasion or how little the excuse, it will be sufficient for that Deputy to behave in the way I have described.  However, he was quick to take the point about Deputy Flor Crowley's interventions last night.  They came as a surprise to myself.  I had lost sight somewhat of Deputy Crowley over the last few years.  He was in temporary eclipse in the Seanad; but yesterday, like a very full moon emerging from behind a bank of cloud, he was back here again with his usual jovial malignance, peppering speakers on this side of the House with what were intended to be unhelpful interruptions.  That is the form of the two gentlemen whom Deputy Kemmy heard last night.  They are not alone.  None of us is perfect in regard to decorum in debating here, but the two he mentioned are particularly obnoxious offenders. However, I am afraid the Deputy is only starting to hear what they are capable of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lenihan here this morning, followed after a short interval by Deputy Flynn, gave a marvellous impersonation of a man genuinely indignant. He was indignant, as was Deputy Flynn almost speechless with indignation, about the &ldquo;savagery&rdquo;&mdash; the word &ldquo;savage&rdquo; was the most over-worked word in his vocabulary &mdash; of our impositions and about the limited and modest scale of benefits which the budget announced here yesterday contained. Nowhere in the speeches of these two Deputies was there the slightest sign of recognition that it was their own profligacy, and that of their party, that has left us in a situation that a Government here have no option but to produce a budget which we know is going to be unpopular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn asked rhetorically if when I was walking around my constituency <Col N="842" />&mdash; I have not had much chance to do so since late last night &mdash; I ever thought of stopping ordinary voters and asking them what they thought of this budget, because if so I would get a very unpleasant answer.  I do not need Deputy Flynn to teach me that truth.  I accept that if I stop the next ten people I meet in my constituency I am going to get sour looks from seven or eight of them.  Everybody on the side of a Government who have tried to rescue this country from a swamp into which it was plunged is going to get that sort of treatment.  I have no doubt that it was in large part a similar effort which put out the first Government we had in 1932; and I have no doubt that it was an effort, very lacklustre but of a similar kind, which put Fianna Fáil out in the General Election of 1954, when they, in an attempt to uphold standards of financial probity which are now only a subject for laughter to people like Deputy Lenihan, cancelled food subsidies, took other unpopular measures and found themselves put out very soon after.</P>
    <P>I do not delude myself that the country is full of such spartan, Cincinnatus-like austerity and willingness for self-sacrifice that they are going to be cheering us on for this budget, which is certainly unpopular. I also do not deceive myself that blaming our predecessors is going to go more than a certain distance.  It certainly will not need emphasis with the more intelligent of them, but I have no illusions about the difficulties we will have in putting across a budget like this and in taking the measures which will have to be taken, not just this year but probably next year too, although I genuinely and honestly have no idea of what dimensions they may then assume.  It will depend on how we get on for the remainder of this year.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt we are going to have difficulties in selling these and in recruiting popular support behind them.  If we pay the political penalty, let it be so.  I do not think there is anything necessarily dishonourable in being on the Opposition benches, although some gentlemen over there bear it with a very poor grace. There is nothing necessarily dishonourable about being in Opposition, even for most of one's time in politics.  It is a <Col N="843" /> function upon which democrats should look with more indulgence than they look on the other side of the House.  I take all these political hazards in my stride.</P>
    <P>We have to do this job.  We asked the people for their votes.  They put us in a situation which I would have wished to be a bit stronger.  I would have liked to have a better grip of the Dáil; but we cannot choose now.  The people made their choice, which seemed to be clearly against the outgoing administration.  But, I freely admit, it is not as unambiguously in favour of the Coalition as I would have wished.  We are going to have to work very hard to make them like it and want more of it.  There is no point in being little boys about this, making vainglorious, blustering speeches about a budget of this kind, thrust upon us though it was, that, say, Deputy Flynn or Deputy Lenihan would make if they were still in Government.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I enjoyed Deputy Lenihan's speech this morning.  There are only a couple of things I want to carp at. He took up a point made by the Tánaiste at the beginning of the day in regard to the last Government having run away prematurely, having blown the whistle on itself with a good year still to go.  You know Deputy Lenihan's style, hands revolving in opposite directions and the general atmosphere of good-humoured spoof that he projects.  He said most Governments &ldquo;have tended to last about four years&rdquo;.  The Government in which he served &ldquo;was no different&rdquo;.  That is not so.</P>
    <P>The Government I worked for in the 20th Dáil had a paper thin majority.  We frequently had a majority of just one.  We stayed in for four years and three months. It is an open secret &mdash; if it is not I am going to give it that status now &mdash; that there was friendly disagreement in the Government as to whether we should go in the summer of 1977 or wait until October or thereabouts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There was disagreement all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anyone would <Col N="844" /> have expected the Government to last into the last half-year of a five-year stint. My recollection is that the Government were divided roughly half-and-half on that issue.  We could without any bother have stayed until October.  I am not trying to make out that the result would have been much different &mdash; it would probably have been a bit different, because we knew that the inflation rate was coming down steeply.  We were able to see two or three quarters ahead; and the quarterly figure next released after we were put out showed a quarter's increase of 1.1 per cent.  When did we next see that?</P>
      <P>We knew these were factors which might have justified our staying on for a while, and giving ourselves more of a chance; but I accept that we had become unpopular, for reasons some of which no doubt we were to blame for, and we went out.  The question of going at the four year mark when the legal term is five was never present in any discussions.  It turned out to be four years and three months; but it was touch and go between one or two members of the Government, who were in favour of the summer rather than the autumn, that it was not four years and seven months.  The last Government, which has just been defeated, ran for three years and ten months; and it was not running with a paper thin majority.  They did not have a Whip who tended to get palpitations every time the Division Bell rang, as it did almost 400 times in the 20th Dáil.  He was able to sit back and not worry if there was a meeting over in Government Buildings and not one of the Ministers heard the bell.  He could still win.  That is the Government which ran after three years and ten months.  Why did it run?  It ran because it could hear the cracking of the foundations and the crumbling of the masonry as the house started to fall in.  They showed a clean pair of heels while they could.  We are now in there, I will not say with the house in ruins around us, but trying to patch up a very shaky, deeply damaged and very much devalued structure.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lenihan's speech reflected no understanding of the fact that it was the profligacy of his Government that brought us to this pass, which would not have been reached if the last Government had behaved with ordinary prudence &mdash; I will not say if they had behaved with the prudence which Fine Gael would have shown with the old-fashioned button-boots conservatism and reactionary celluloid-collar frame of mind which Deputy Lenihan likes to impute to us.  They would not have reached this pass at all if they had even behaved with the prudence which Mr. de Valera or Mr. Lemass would have shown, or which Mr. Lynch in his earliest incarnation as Taoiseach would have shown. It would not have reached that pass if the standards which were still respected here until about 1971 or 1972 had been upheld. Prudence was not shown.  Instead of that, what was shown was what Deputy Lenihan described as &ldquo;their concern for people&rdquo;. It was &ldquo;the people they were interested in, not the figures&rdquo;.  He said they &ldquo;did not go in for account-book economics, that was not the game they played&rdquo;. He plays a different game altogether, it is the people he is interested in.  That is why he has unemployment 15,000 higher than it was when we left office; and even that figure was one we were not too pleased with.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why he had a trade deficit figure which is about ten times, in terms of ratio to GNP, the EEC average. It is why he has a budget deficit figure which is miles above the EEC average. Both of these deficit figures are all-time Irish records.  He has an all-time record State debt.  These are proud achievements for the Government which is &ldquo;interested in people&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also said, and before someone tries to delete it from the record, &mdash; I am not suggesting it is possible, but I know it has been tried once or twice, &mdash; somebody should excerpt and highlight what he said about his Government &ldquo;not being <Col N="846" /> obsessed by deficits&rdquo;.  They were not &ldquo;panicked by trade deficits, or by budget deficits&rdquo;.  They were &ldquo;trying to keep people in employment&rdquo;.  They failed very badly in that.  It was the larger dimensions of political philosophy that Deputy Lenihan was inspired by.  Trivial things holding him to the ground when he had his head in the stars, things like the balance of payments deficit or the budget deficit, he could not be expected to be bothered about that.  Only reactionaries are bothered by things like that.</P>
    <P>I want to remind Deputy Lenihan and his friends that Germany is governed by a coalition in which the by miles preponderant element is a socialist party.  They are not a buttoned-boot crowd at all; they do not go in for celluloid wing collars.  I have never seen Chancellor Schmidt being accused of being a stick-in-the-mud. I have never heard him compared with Ernest Blythe or anything of that kind at all.  Funnily enough, he cares about deficits, both on the trade side and on the budget side.  You will not find him running anyone into the Bundestag &mdash; unless, of course, he has a joker in the pack like Deputy Lenihan, which he well may have &mdash; you will not find him sending in someone to try to make a virtue out of recklessness, trying to form a league which would praise the behaviour of drunken sailors and hold it up as being exemplary.</P>
    <P>The Governments of Holland, Belgium and Denmark are, I think, all Coalitions, the composition of which tends to vary from time to time.  I think I am right in saying that they usually have a predominant socialist or similar element. Funnily enough, they do not share the Lenihan philosophy, either.</P>
    <P>Milton Friedman is a name which I hear being made fun of by people over there.  They seem to regard him as a joke figure, and Thatcherism as a joke word too; although I was under the impression, until a couple of months ago, that the British Prime Minister was top-cat with Deputy Haughey.  I do not quite see how her name should now come to be used as a butt for instant abuse and belittlement.</P>
    <P>If I may be permitted to do something which the Opposition have done without <Col N="847" /> asking anyone's permission, to express a view about the way the English economy is run, the English economy is not the one on which to try such radical medicine. Too much of it is too old and too sick.  They have an industrial structure and a population structure which are completely different from ours.  Problems in every dimension are different.  What is being tried there is possibly too tough a medicine.  It is like taking a man with a raging temperature and putting him outside on a snowy day in the hope that that will bring down his temperature.  It is too tough</P>
    <P>I do not think that the medicine which this Government are trying to apply &mdash; not by choice but because they have been forced into it &mdash; is too tough.  Naturally, we are taking a chance.  We must take a chance.  There is nothing for it but to take a chance.  Anyone can think of any number of similes and metaphors from all sorts of desperate situations for comparison. When the ship is sinking, swim for it; when the house is burning, jump for it.  That is our situation.  It may be that we have misjudged the jump, or have not placed the air mattress properly under the window, or have overestimated our power to reach shore.  It may be that we will flounder and be in difficulties, but we must make these efforts.  I have not heard any other suggestion made from the opposite side of the House, let alone from an independant commentator.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the independant commentators brandished around in here very often take different points of view.  I think it was Deputy Haughey who said that if there were 450 economists, they would have 450 different solutions, and I agree it may be so.  Certainly, I have often thought it strange that the science of economics is so little exact, in spite of all the brain power devoted to it.  One would think that there should be no such a thing as a recession at all in the world.  Nonetheless, what ever the mutual differences, our economists are united on one theme, and that is that the last Government were going the wrong way and have been doing so for four years, and that their failure to improve this economy, to rescue it or <Col N="848" /> protect it from the world recession, was directly attributable to their behaviour in 1977-78, at the time of the previous election and what flowed from it.</P>
    <P>That brings me to what I heard Deputy Haughey say this morning and something which Deputy Gene Fitzgerald said last night.  I see Deputy Fitzgerald there and I can tell him something to his face.</P>

      <P>I want to mention something which Deputy Haughey said this morning, that the time to reduce the budget deficit is when the economy improves.  In other words, he considered that we were bringing in this budget at the wrong time, that we should have waited for the economy to improve before trying to bring down the deficit and that these hard measures were too hard to ask the people to bear.  They may be tough, but the fault for that lies with the other side.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey this morning pinned himself to the proposition that the time to reduce budget deficits is when the economy improves.  The economy, by general consent, improved in 1977-1978; and I think I have the authority of Deputy Martin O'Donoghue, who very generously acknowledged &mdash; and I recalled this more than once &mdash; in the bulletin of the Department of Foreign Affairs that that improvement was very largely attributable to the very modest wage agreement which the last Coalition Government had succeeded in establishing in 1976 and 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It takes a bit of a lead-in for the economy to get out of a recession and by common consent, 1977-78 and, to some extent, 1979, were good years, by the standards of the seventies, strong years. These would have been years in which, on Deputy Haughey's theory, it would have been appropriate to start reducing the budget deficit but what, in fact, happened? The budget deficit for 1977 was 3.75 per cent of GNP at £201 million, in 1978 the deficit had risen to £397 million, in 1979 it had risen to £522 million and in 1980 it had risen &mdash; admittedly very slightly and very slightly down in real terms &mdash; to £547 million.  The estimate for 1981, depending upon which figure you choose, is anything between almost <Col N="850" /> £800 million and almost £1,000 million. Nobody would call this or last year good years, but certainly 1977 and 1978 &mdash; and perhaps 1979 &mdash; were good years by the standards of the seventies.  What happened under the direction of the Fianna Fáil Government was certainly the reverse of what we are now hearing should have been done.</P>
    <P>In the very same set of years, take a look at total Exchequer borrowing, which, after all, is the whole reason why one worries about a deficit.  If one could make up a deficit by mining gold out of the ground, there would be no need to worry.  However, a deficit means borrowing. In 1977 the Government borrowed &mdash; and I am speaking about the total end-of-year borrowed figure &mdash; £545 million, in 1978, £810 million, in 1979, £1,009 million.  Where is the consistency there?  I suppose I am a foolish man to look for it, when we are dealing with a former Taoiseach who told the people, shortly after his accession, that the level of deficit and borrowing simply could not be sustained.  That was absolutely the last we heard of that point of view.  It sank without trace, so far as concerns his Government's conduct of the economy.</P>
    <P>Last night, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald was thundering away.  By the way, Deputy Kemmy said this morning &mdash; which was the one good thing he had to say for Deputy Fitzgerald &mdash; that it was unfair that Deputy Fitzgerald had to respond to a budget statement at no notice.  That is a fair enough point.  We can all make a knock-about speech, but it does not give a serious spokesman a chance to respond properly to a budget speech if he has only literally read it through for the first time, distracted, no doubt, by interruptions. Deputy Kemmy suggested an hour's adjournment.  That is not a bad idea, and I would be open to that idea if anyone is interested in it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald, when responding last night, thundered away repeatedly about where was there one penny in this budget for employment?  He particularly focused, in that context, on what he took to be an embargo, &mdash; and I do not complain about that word, it is not a total embargo, but a limit &mdash; on public service <Col N="851" /> recruitment.  Firstly, there are in fact, certain measures &mdash; I admit freely that they are not dramatic measures &mdash; but measures specifically directed to support industrial employment, contained either in this budget or definitely flagged for, at the latest, the 1981 budget, the beginning of the year.</P>

      <P>The halving of the hydrocarbon tax for industry is a measure which could be so described.  It reduces industry's costs.  I am humble enough to admit that I am only a beginner in this field but I read the hand-outs of the Confederation of Irish Industry.  I accept they must look after themselves and that there must be a certain amount of self-interest buried in what they say, just as there is in the utterances of trade unions, farmers or anybody else.  Nonetheless, when they have a persistent message which seems to make sense I am inclined to believe it.  Their message all along has been that industrial costs, through Government action, have been made too high.  We have gone some distance to try to remedy that situation by cutting the hydrocarbon tax which put an additional impost of about £50 million on industry at the beginning of 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that in the near future we will carry out the promise we made of reducing the PRSI contribution in manufacturing industry and tourism from 10 per cent to 8 per cent.  That will be a visible lightening <Col N="852" /> of the costs which industry has to bear and consequently an opportunity for them to be more competitive.  That has a fall-out in terms of greater employment.</P>
    <P>The public sector pay is what I want to focus on.  Deputy Gene Fitzgerald seems to think that because one may be saying something severe about public sector employment it is a threat to employment generally.  The contrary is the truth.  If you can borrow enough money there is no trouble renting blocks, filling them with desks, putting people behind those desks and calling them jobs.  No doubt something can be found for them to do.</P>
    <P>It would not be too much to express our present desperate financial situation in terms of an inadequate control on the growth of the public sector in recent years.  I do not put all the blame on Fianna Fáil for this, but I put a very substantial part of the blame on them. Since we left office just over four years ago the number of non-industrial civil servants &mdash; I am not counting the Garda, nurses, teachers, the Army or health boards &mdash; has grown by over 9,000.  When we left office the figure was just over 45,000; it is now 54,000.  Even in 1977 many people thought the figure of 45,000 was too big.  The total public sector &mdash; I do not want to be understood as saying there were not some parts which did not need to be enlarged, notably the police force and no doubt others &mdash; has grown by 31,000 people.</P>
    <P>I will take a flying guess at the average salary of a public sector employee &mdash; some will be paid three times this amount and others might be paid only half but I am taking a guess and if it is a poor average someone can correct me &mdash; being, say, £8,000.  This would mean that the extra annual wage burden carried by the State in consequence of the expansion which has taken place in only four years is a £250,000,000; and that is only for wages.  That army of 31,000 has to be housed, heated and the appropriate parts have to be uniformed.  There is overtime, travel and subsistence expenses and all kinds of overheads, the ratio borne by which to the crude wage figure I could not guess, but I would not be too far out in saying it could be £350,000,000 rather <Col N="853" /> than £250,000,000 at least when these overheads are taken into account.  That figure is so huge that, extended over a small number of years, the cumulative budget deficit situation can be virtually entirely attributed to it.</P>
    <P>That is a crude exaggeration.  I know I am putting it in primary colours by explaining it like that.  But it seems mysterious that Deputy Gene Fitzgerald should not appreciate that a reckless expansion of the public service, merely because he had agreed to it as an easy way of appearing to be making jobs for school leavers, restricts the State's capacity to invest in productive and wealth-creating employment, because in the end it threatens jobs rather than creating them.</P>
    <P>These are not jobs which create wealth.  A job which creates wealth has the spin-off effect of creating more employment.  A job which consumes wealth does not, or if it does, it does it only indirectly and with much less powerful force.  Every pound invested in a needless expansion of the public service &mdash; and I am alive to all the arguments we heard from Deputy Flynn earlier about the young boys and girls of Mayo who could no longer expect employment in the public service &mdash; does direct injury to the national economy and is a threat to a real expansion of the economy in terms of productive and wealth-creating industry, agriculture and those services which are exportable.</P>

      <P>These are points which were made last night.  I intended saying how the budget will bear on the three sections of my Department.  I would have gone into more detail if I had more time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1980 industrial employment fell, as will be visible in the IDA report which will be issued in a few days, by about 9,000 and the volume of exports in April 1981 compared with April 1980 fell by about 8 per cent.  These are sad recessional figures.  The only way we know &mdash; and there may be geniuses on the far side who know some other way &mdash; of rescuing <Col N="854" /> that situation is by trying to make Irish industry and tourism, which has also had a bad time this year although it may not be beyond rescue, is by pressing all the time to deliver a product which is competitive, whether it is an industrial product or a holiday.  That is the only way we can get ahead.  No doubt it can be done in the short-term by borrowing.</P>
    <P>While on that subject I want to say that the kind of statements we heard during the election campaign about this country's &ldquo;creditworthiness&rdquo; are misplaced. A country's &ldquo;creditworthiness&rdquo; has nothing to do with the security a bank or an ordinary lending institution expects from a debtor.  When a foreign institution decides to lend money they do not ask about security as a bank does.  They ask: are the Government likely to continue paying the interest?  Are the Government likely to go on servicing this debt and giving a return on the investment?  So long as that calculation is answered favourably, irrespective of the size of the national debt or of the constricting effects on expansion, employment and genuine wealth creation, the Arab money will flow in.  As long as they judge the point has not been reached where an Irish Government will default on their debt, or that they will ask for rescheduling, as some countries not very far away have had to do, and so long as they do not get a lower return than originally anticipated, they will go on lending.  They are not worried whether Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael are in power, nor do they care about the standard of services provided for our people. They have only one criterion: will Deputy Colley, Deputy Briscoe, Deputy O'Toole or myself, whoever is in charge of this Ministry, keep writing out the interest cheques?  The moment a situation develops of instability where a doubt and question mark hang over the economy's capacity to sustain a Government who will keep on writing these cheques and absorbing so much of their national income, the tap will be turned off.  The advice I have been getting &mdash; I am perfectly certain the advice Deputy Colley received was no different &mdash; is that that moment in the nature of things can arrive very suddenly and without warning. <Col N="855" /> That, among other things, is what we want to avoid.</P>
    <P>The burden represented by the national debt together with the size and costliness of the public sector is not understood by the public.  They do not realise that half or more of the national budget goes on public sector pay.  They do not realise even more dimly that 31p in every Revenue £ goes on paying interest on the State's debts.  When we left office in 1977 that figure was 21p in the £.  The geniuses opposite have succeeded in adding 10p in the £ to the proportion which is absorbed in the annual national revenue by payments of interest on debt, increasingly on foreign debt.  At least if it were domestically raised debt the interest money would stay in the country and tax would be progressively creamed off; the money would be re-cycled at home. That is not the case with money which is paid out in yen, dollars and deutschemarks. The public do not understand this when they clamour for &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There was a period of horror when the word &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; was very big with Fianna Fáil.  Things which the old button-boot brigade in Cumann nGae-dheal had done in the twenties, because they considered it any Government's duty to so them, such as repairing the roads and installing telephones, suddenly became &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo;.  I thought we would live to see the day when we would hear people talking of filling in the pot holes in the infrastructure.  They were barely able to do that by the time they finished.</P>
    <P>The artery through which money can be forced to pay for roads, railways, airports, schools and hospitals is being furred up.  It is developing sclerosis; there are fatty deposits in the artery; and the channel left for the flow of financial blood is being narrowed with every passing year.  Every time the national debt is increased, a new debt is incurred, a new obligation to pay interest is incurred, that sclerosis becomes more marked.  Every time the public service is needlessly expanded, every time a chance to rationalise is lost, every time an unproductive or counter-productive practice in the <Col N="856" /> public service is allowed to become consolidated, that artery is constricted still further.  Slán beo to the £25 million rationalisation plan we heard about from Deputy Gene Fitzgerald during his January budget.  It has sunk without trace.</P>
    <P>We must get this message through to the public.  It will be unpopular and will cause all kinds of antagonisms.  It will give us the most awful problems of equity.  Anyone who has done me the honour of listening to my contributions over the years knows that I have alwaus said &mdash; and said more forcibly than I have been given credit for by people who think that Fine Gael are a stick-in-the-mud, old-fashioned party when it comes to financial matters &mdash; that we must avoid the situation in which burdens are seen to be carried most grievously by the poorer people.  It is not good enough to lecture trade unionists about how they must exercise restraint on small incomes, while people who are better able to bear burdens get away relatively painlessly.  I have never been in favour of that.  Everyone here knows that I personally was in favour of the wealth tax, and could see no good reason for scrapping it.  I think I am the only dissentient: but my party are against it and it will not be resurrected. No one need take fright at my saying this.  I have always taken the view that equity in taxation is absolutely vital, and we will have the most awful headaches in producing equity so that burdens will be seen to be fairly applied and fairly carried between all sides.  It has been acknowledged that a move was made towards that yesterday by a couple of innovatory items in the budget speech; but to continue the impetus which these moves represent without destroying private enterprise or incentive in industry and agriculture will be a most dreadful headache.  We may go down under the strain.  I do not under-estimate the size of the burden facing us and I hope that we will be able to conduct ourselves fairly and decently and with courage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There were certain parts with which I would disagree fundamentally. In view of the way in which this debate has gone, the first question that arises is whether this budget was necessary. The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism has been speaking as though it were self-evident that the budget was necessary but he must accept that the figures on which he and his colleagues base their case are by no means factual.  They are figures which are projected forward and some people quite close to the scene in the Department of Finance are somewhat at a loss to understand the basis for the projections which result in a projected deficit of £950 million. To say that the projected deficit is not factual is not to say that there is no basis for concern; on the contrary, there is a basis for very considerable concern. We are in a serious situation.  We are going through a world recession largely triggered off by an enormous increase in oil prices, relatively far greater than in the previous oil crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that is common ground.  There is no argument about the fact that we are going through a serious world recession and the fact that our economy, largely as a result of that recession, is in a serious situation.  Whether or not action should be taken now or not all is a matter of some dispute.  In this connection I notice <Col N="858" /> that references to the budget deficit and how it is likely to turn out suggest that the budget deficit envisaged earlier this year in the first budget introduced by the previous Government was somehow tossed aside and ignored and that the figure now emerging is coming without reference to any known factors other than a profligate attitude on the part of the previous Government.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the economic review and outlook issued recently by the Department of Finance one would find a breakdown of portion of this in pages 15 and 16.  It itemises some details of items over and above those provided for in the budget introduced by the previous Government. The amount for social welfare involved £77 million, the amount for agriculture £45 million and for transport £29 million.  That was a decision by the previous Government not to pass on the increase in fares which was imminent but to discharge it out of the Exchequer which in effect meant out of borrowing by the Exchequer.  Similarly a sum of £58 million was mentioned in relation to ESB charges on the same basis.  There is a reference to other items, which are not specified, totalling about £150 million. But the items I have mentioned were the result of a deliberate decision by the previous Government, not something that just cropped up because of bad house-keeping or accounting.</P>
    <P>If one takes the ESB charges as an example of the problem that arises here as to whether or not this budget is necessary one will get a good idea of the issues involved.  On the one hand a decision not to impose the ESB charges which will be very substantial but to meet them out of the Exchequer cushions the economy against very serious economic and social problems which would arise because of the imposition of substantial increases in electricity charges on top of the already steeply increased charges for electricity and other forms of energy.  The impact of steep increases in the ESB charges are of serious economic and social import.  At a time when the economic situation is difficult and when the situation of unemployed people is extremely difficult a strong case can be <Col N="859" /> made for trying to ride out the storm by cushioning people against the worst effects of the energy crisis which is the root cause of the increase in the ESB charges.  On the other hand the argument can be made that one should let reality and market forces prevail and that failing to do so is trying to shield people from the reality that would ultimately take over.  That argument has a considerable monetarist tinge but it is a tenable argument. I mention this because the two points of view in the circumstances in which our economy finds itself and in terms of the world recession are legitimate arguments which could be put forward in good faith.  The question of whether or not this budget is necessary and whether it is necessary at this stage is something that can be argued in good faith either way.</P>
    <P>What cannot be contested is that the decision to bring in this budget by the Government is one that has been largely conditioned by political considerations. They have been paramount in the decision to bring it in.  In case I am misrepresented in this, I have not said that there is not an economic case for introducing this budget.  It is arguable either way but whatever the arguments economically, the over-riding argument in the Government's mind has been political.  I say that because the programme which the Government intended to embark on is one that presents considerable economic difficulties. The most obvious difficulties arise where one is talking about making certain income tax concessions and paying for them as one goes, by substantial increases in indirect taxation.  One is immediately faced with a number of political and economic difficulties.  If one is committed to a programme like that but has the opportunity of blaming the difficulties that arise on one's political opponents it is very difficult to resist that temptation.  This Government not alone did not resist that temptation and did not attempt to resist it but grasped it gratefully with both hands.</P>
    <P>As soon as this Government were elected I said to a number of my colleagues, &ldquo;they will bring in a very harsh <Col N="860" /> budget; they will blame it on Fianna Fáil; then they will adjourn the Dáil for about three months hoping that the mud will stick on Fianna Fáil and they will then come back and try to get the benefit of the revenue from the impositions they have made and utilise it for their own political advantage&rdquo;.  Many people in politics would regard that as a legitimate political ploy and maybe it is.  But it does not prevent us from pointing it out.  It confuses the issue as to the real economic situation and what action the economic situation requires.  The over-riding argument in this area is a political and not an economic one.  It should not be so.  The over-riding argument should be economic.</P>
    <P>The most significant aspect of this budget from the point of view of the consumer &mdash; and probably ultimately from the point of view of the economy &mdash; will be the deliberately generated inflation it contains.  There is a range of taxes provided for in this budget which, at the best of times and in a budget intended to cover a full years' operations, would be very substantial.  The Minister for Finance has told us that the effect on the consumer price index of these additional taxes will be an increase of 3 percentage points.  In making that calculation he did not allow for the actual increase to the consumer in many cases being higher than the increased tax because of increased mark-ups, a phenomenon with which Ministers for Finance have had to contend.  It is one they would very much wish to be able to avoid, to ensure that increased taxes represent the sole amount of the increase on particular commodities but they cannot do so; that is a fact.  Inevitably, in many of these cases, the actual increase in price to the consumer will be considerably more than the increase imposed by the taxation concerned.</P>
    <P>Additionally we have the increased ESB charges &mdash; we do not have the details &mdash; but I believe they will be substantial. We are going to have increased CIE charges and they will be substantial&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Decided by Fianna Fáil not to be imposed but to be paid out of the Exchequer, as I said earlier, by borrowing by the Exchequer, the case for which I referred to earlier.  It is a quite respectable case and the Minister need not refer to it in that way.  There is a quite legitimate, respectable case to be made for it whether one agrees with it or not.  The fact is that these charges will now be imposed.</P>
      <P>In addition to that we find that there are a number of other charges going to be imposed.  Unfortunately they are not specified - we do not know exactly &mdash; but it is clear from what has been said in regard to agriculture, for instance, that there will be changes made there which will either increase charges or reduce services substantially.</P>
      <P>With regard to the health services, to quote from the document entitled Principal Features of Budget:</P>
      <P>Hospital and prescription costs will be borne to a greater extent by those users who are able to pay for them; appropriate changes will be made from 1 August in hospital charges and in the Health Boards' drugs refund scheme.</P>
      <P>Then it says rather ominously:</P>
      <P>Substantial savings will also be achieved by the Departments of Justice, Environment, Education, Defence and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not know what is involved in this. We do not know whether it means, for instance, in the case of the Department of Justice that the extra gardaí who were being recruited are not now going to be recruited.  But it is reasonable to assume that in a number of cases there will be increased charges for services.  Those, in conjunction with the ESB and CIE increases, and the increases arising from the various taxes imposed, not least in relation to all aspects of motoring but above all the increase in the basic rate of VAT from 10 per cent to 15 per cent will add up to a sizeable and significant increase in the cost of living in the consumer price index.  The increase in the VAT rate applies to all of the most basic necessities other than food and clothing. <Col N="862" /> It will affect the poorest as well as the richest people in the country.</P>
    <P>In addition to those increases it would appear &mdash; again there is a surprising lack of precision in a great deal of what the Minister for Finance said &mdash; that there will be an increase in charges under the PRSI, that there will be a levy increase this year under the PRSI.  It appears also that this year there will be a levy imposed for the Youth Employment Agency. Even though I suspect that agency may not be operational to any noticeable degree this year it appears that the levy will be applied to incomes this year.</P>
    <P>Therefore we have very substantial increases in taxes.  We have increases in ESB and CIE charges.  We have increases in services of various kinds, like the health services and others I have mentioned. We have levies proposed to be applied to people's incomes under at least two different headings, and all of these are to happen this year.  So we are talking about a very substantial increase in costs and a substantial deduction from incomes without any adjustment in income tax which was promised as the method of counteracting the effect of the increase in indirect taxes.  I find this whole aspect of the budget almost incomprehensible.  I say that because I have a great sense of <i>déjà vue</i> about this.  I stood on these benches before and told the Coalition Government, after a number of budgets they had introduced, they were simply fuelling inflation, making it almost impossible for restraint to be exercised in wage claims.  They did not listen until belatedly, in the budget they introduced in 1977, they started to do some of the things we had been urging on them.  But it was too late.  They had done the damage and the public told them what they thought of them.  I have no great hope that the Government will listen to me on this occasion either, but I feel it incumbent on me to point out to them some of the consequences of what they are doing. If there are huge increases in the consumer price index, which is what we will get &mdash; it is very difficult to put a figure on it because of the lack of precision in what has been said by the Minister for Finance &mdash; I would be surprised if that increase as <Col N="863" /> a direct consequence of this budget, were less than five percentage points.  If one adds to that the deductions from income I have mentioned, then that represents a substantial onslaught on the pockets of ordinary people.</P>
    <P>The kernel of the economic consequences of this lies in whether or not attempts will be made to compensate people in wage claims for what the Government are doing.  This is of course no new problem; this arose in the past under various governments.  Under the previous Coalition Government the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Richie Ryan, in an effort to demonstrate the effect of segregating increases in the cost of items arising from taxation and from other causes, arranged for the production of a consumer price index free of indirect tax increases.  As far as I know that is still being produced.  Who pays any attention to it?  Nobody.  I tried to persuade the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, in relation to increases in taxation on such things as alcohol and tobacco being devoted to job creation, that they should not seek to have them compensated for in wage claims but I was not successful. There is no evidence to show that this concept of not claiming compensation for increases in the consumer price index will be accepted.  Maybe it will but all the evidence I have suggests quite clearly that it will not be acceptable.</P>
    <P>The proposals put forward by Fine Gael during the election campaign depended on the acceptance of that idea and the proposals put forward in this budget are, in effect, Fine Gael proposals and depend crucially on that.  Serious as the position will be if we have only to contend with the consequences, which I have outlined, directly on what was imposed in the budget yesterday, it will be as nothing to the consequences if compensation is sought for those in wage claims so that the price of every commodity and service goes up accordingly, quite apart from any other causes for increases.  If that happens inflation will reach astronomical proportions and will get completely outside the Government's control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> That is why I regard this aspect as by far the most important and the one with the greatest potential for damage to our economy and that is why I find it incredible that the Government should have embarked on that.  Perhaps they are already in a position to ensure that such compensatory claims will not be made but I doubt very much if they have managed to do that.  I believe if they had we would have heard about it yesterday from the Minister.  We have to assume that no such arrangement will operate.  This means we will be back to the situation we were in under the previous Coalition Government except, I am afraid, it will be worse judging by the impact of what is involved, multiplied through all the other goods and services and claimed in compensation in wages, with consequential increases in the price of other goods and services.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the Minister for Finance was rather imprecise in a number of things he said.  I would like to get some elucidation on the capital savings the Minister has in mind.  He referred to this in his budget speech after dealing, first of all, with the Public Capital Programme and then with items outside that programme. In regard to the Public Capital Programme it would appear that he provided for an additional £30 million expenditure in respect of local authority housing and an unannounced sum in respect of the farm modernisation scheme, so that the additional expenditure is £30 million plus.  It appears from the table given in the document, Principal Features of Budget, that the reduction proposed in expenditure on the Public Capital Programme is £42 million.  That suggests that there will be a saving of £72 million plus on the Public Capital Programme, that is an additional expenditure of £30 million plus and a reduction of £42 million giving a total of £72 million plus.  On the non-programme side the reduction appears to be £134 million.  We have no indication of where these savings will be made.  The House and the country are entitled to get some indication of the areas involved.  I suspect that what is involved will affect employment.  If the Government wanted this budget and the <Col N="865" /> measures in it to be evaluated on a fair basis they should have ensured that the relevant information was available.  It is very relevant to know under what headings the Government propose to save those very large sums of money on the capital side.  We should be told that.</P>
    <P>We have, in addition to that, the reference in the Minister's speech to the non-programme side and the demands from semi-State bodies which have been cut down by £134 million.  There is no indication given about what semi-State bodies were involved, what they are demanding money for, what they are getting money for and what they will not get money for.  We are talking about very large sums of money and I suggest we ought to have been told what this is all about, what are the implications, particularly for employment.  One of the items the Minister was concerned with, and the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism was also concerned with it, was public sector pay.  The Minister dealt with this at some length and announced certain things amounting almost to an embargo in regard to certain aspects of recruitment and so on.  I do not disagree with the Minister for Finance in placing great emphasis on the impact of public sector pay, which quite self-evidently is a very important item in the budget.</P>
    <P>However, I could not help thinking about certain things when I listened to this concern and the statements by the Minister for Labour in regard to a current dispute within the civil service and also his statements as to why he will not meet the union concerned and why they ought to adhere to the agreed conciliation and arbitration procedures.  Then I think about the present Tánaiste, Deputy O'Leary, and I remember his marching up and down outside the office of the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs with a placard protesting against the failure of that Minister to meet a union that was in dispute in the Post Office at that time and were not adhering to agreed procedures.  I think how much times seem to change when some people assume office.</P>
    <P>I do not recall that merely for the sake of underlining the change of stance by <Col N="866" /> the present Tánaiste but also because I think it worth recalling in relation to that particular strike in the Post Office &mdash; a very difficult one it was &mdash; the stance adopted by the Government then and that all of those &mdash; including the present Tánaiste, but by no means him alone &mdash; who adopted the attitude they did adopt have a great deal to answer for. When we hear about the problem now arising regarding public sector pay each of us should recall the attitude we adopted at that time in regard to that strike which was a crucial one in relation to public sector pay.</P>
    <P>In the statement of the Minister for Finance there is a small item &mdash; some cynic said it was put in to satisfy Deputy Loftus; perhaps it has nothing to do with him &mdash; a reference to Wood Quay.  When the Minister referred to that, and the protection of our heritage in that context, what has he in mind?  Does he propose to introduce measures which would have the effect of obliging us or, if they had been in operation would have obliged us to ensure that there would be no building on Wood Quay?  Is that what he had in mind?</P>

      <P>I am well aware of what he did in that area, but I am asking about Wood Quay because that is what he spoke about in his speech.  I should not like to yield to the Minister for Finance or anybody else in concern about preserving our heritage.  Wood Quay is now really in the past, but it was very interesting to see how it was exploited by so many people who tried to obscure the facts from the public.  The facts are that there has never been in this country and in few other countries an archaeological site on which so much time, professional effort and money were spent.  That was not what was being sought.  It was being sought that the site be preserved, that nothing be built on it.  The fact that a museum was to be built there was swept aside.  Is the Minister for Finance now <Col N="867" /> saying that the Government intend to introduce legislation which would have the effect of preventing building on a site such as Wood Quay.  There are many other sites similar to Wood Quay in Dublin, as is well known.  If that is what he intends, they will never be developed. On the other hand, if he intends to ensure that there are adequate resources, financial and professional, to ensure that such sites are adequately, archaeologically investigated, classified and collated, I applaud his attitude.  But if he intends to do the kind of thing that was being urged by Deputy Loftus and other people at the time, then he should have spelled it out and justified it to all concerned.</P>
      <P>One of the most noticeable omissions from the budget has been provision for the creation of jobs.  A number of provisions have not been spelled out, and I suspect that they mean the loss of jobs, but few if any of the provisions will create jobs.  There is reference to the levying of incomes for the purpose of financing a youth employment agency.  We hope this youth employment agency will be successful but it appears that the levy will be applied this year and it does not appear that it is going to create any or certainly many jobs this year.</P>
      <P>There is talk about reducing costs on industry almost at christmas thereby helping to create jobs.  It is a far cry from the kind of programme the Fianna Fáil Government embarked on.  Not so long ago I heard Deputy Kelly, now Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, talk in passing about the policies pursued by Fianna Fáil in 1977 and 1978 being the cause of the present difficulties to which he was referring, I have had to speak about this on a number of occasions and I do it again without apologies.  The facts, as distinct from the propoganda that comes from our political opponents and others who should know better, are that Fianna Fáil created far, far more jobs than were ever created before in our history. The great bulk of those jobs was in the private sector, not the public sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What confuses the issue for some people is that unemployment is so high <Col N="868" /> today.  There are two major factors there to be considered.  One is the world recession that has affected everybody, very adversely in most cases.  The other, and the very important one in respect of our case, is that vast growth in our work force, the great increase in the number of young people coming on the jobs market. That is one of the great strengths of this country, one of the hopes for the future. But, because of that, the new jobs created &mdash; in which people are now working &mdash; are not properly reflected in the unemployment figures.  If we had not done what we did the figure for unemployment today would be well over 200,000.</P>

      <P>I am not surprised the Minister wants to quibble about words.  The fact is that jobs were created.  The important point is that the budget presented yesterday makes no attempt to tackle the problem of jobs for young people, but I suspect it provides in an underhand way for the loss of many jobs for young and older people.  Time will tell what will happen about this.  I regard the budget presented to us yesterday as indicating a very ominous future for the people in regard to prices and jobs.  I am afraid we <Col N="869" /> are going to embark once more on the same old programme we had to go through before of telling the Coalition how to go about this job.  They are not going to listen, but we will tell them just the same.  In the end we will have to take over the job and do it again.</P>

      <P>The Chair cannot give any such assurance.  The Chair would remind Deputy Sherlock that, perhaps unfortunately for him, the tradition here is not one that seems to cater for Independents but rather for parties, Government and Opposition.  I am interpreting here the tradition of the House.  The tradition is that in the earlier part of the debate those people described as first speakers for the Government and Opposition are called.  However, it was my understanding that later in the day Deputy Sherlock would be called, but it was not that he should be called now. Perhaps the Deputies would await the Ceann Comhairle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always the working class who burn while the gombeens fiddle. The time wasted arguing about this matter has been quite unnecessary.</P>
      <P>The budget has been described as a mini-budget, but that is not correct: it is a savage attack on working people.  The increase in VAT, in CIE fares and ESB charges will impose further hardship on them.  The cut-back in public expenditure means a job freeze in the public sector. The country is in serious financial and economic difficulties as a result of private enterprise, governments serving exclusively the interests of private enterprise. The bulk of the projected deficit of £950 million is a result of the Government having to borrow money abroad at high interest rates for the day-to-day running of the State.  The failure of this and previous Governments to spread the tax burden has meant a greater dependence on foreign borrowing and a greater burden on the PAYE sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget proposal to levy the banks to the tune of £5 million is an effort to deceive the PAYE sector into believing that a serious attempt is being made to spread the tax burden.  It is clear that if the tax loopholes were closed the banks' <Col N="872" /> contribution would be in the region of £40 million annually.</P>
    <P>The increase in VAT from 10 per cent to 15 per cent will impose hardship on already over-burdened working class people because it will affect items such as medicines, medical equipment, children's food, tobacco, cigarettes.  The worst feature of the proposals is the cut in public spending which will affect, among other things, the health services. I should like to emphasise that this is being done when many people do not have full eligibility for health services, because the income limit is far too low, and do not have the wherewithal to pay doctors or to buy drugs which are prescribed for them.  This situation will now worsen because in many instances the second phase of the national understanding has not been implemented.  To increase the cost of living at this time shows complete disregard for the needs of people in that category.  The Government have failed to realise that there is another system which, if implemented, would not impose such a burden.</P>
    <P>In reply to my question yesterday evening, the Minister said there would not be recourse to capital taxation because it would take too long to implement.  Is it fair that while so many wealthy people get off scot free, this fiercely harsh imposition should be put on the workers?  This budget is about taking money from some people.  The working class will pay the bulk of the money the Coalition now want to raise.  This makes the budget a class issue as well as a political issue.  We have a situation now in which people who pay health contributions do not, because they are in excess of a certain limit, have any benefit to get from the health services. The PRSI is to be increased by 1 per cent.  If that increase were to be devoted to providing a free health service for the people &mdash; I understand that that 1 per cent would give a free health service &mdash; I would agree with it because it is a way to distribute fair play.  That is not being done.  No consideration whatever has been given to it.</P>
    <P>Throughout the debate there has not been mention of resorting to the only fair way to raise the money needed, namely, <Col N="873" /> a tax on capital, on wealth, property and idle agricultural land.  The Labour Party have been silent on the issue of direct versus indirect taxation, despite repeated calls by the ICTU and affiliated unions. This silence is a scandal because there is more scope for raising tax from wealth and property than by any other means. The 1981 Fianna Fáil Budget projected that only £65.7 million would be raised through the various forms of wealth taxes, such as estate duties, resource tax, stamp duties and capital taxes.  Thus Fianna Fáil were saying that of the total taxation needed to run the State, the wealthy should only pay 2½ per cent of the total.  Instead, £1,400 million was to be raised on spending which would hit the working class and £1,154 million in direct taxes which at the present time is paid largely by the PAYE worker.  There-fore, the PAYE worker is to be taxed directly on his income and indirectly when he eats, drinks or consumes any item that has to be sold across a counter.</P>
    <P>We do not deny there is a crisis.  The current budget deficit is running at £950 million and the balance of payments deficit is forecast at £1,500 million.  My party say that the way to tackle the problem is not through the monetarist policies proposed by the Coalition parties in this budget.  We are aware that Fianna Fáil in office would be attempting now to foist the same policies on the working class.</P>
    <P>The serious problems left by Fianna Fáil must be solved by socialist means. The full power and resources of the State must be used to direct the economy along a new road breaking fundamentally and finally with the past.</P>
    <P>Most people realise that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael merely exchange partners at each election.  Different sections of the rich are represented by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  But what is constant is the burden borne by the working class.  Most people can see that the private sector is not creating jobs and productive wealth. Therefore, we must act on the logic of our experience and embark on long term programmes that will release the creativity and productivity of the State sector. This means planning the economy so that <Col N="874" /> the State will make the profits, that the idle rich will disappear from the pages of history so that every penny made by the State will be a penny put back into production. The long term solution calls for socialist planning now.  But in the present arrangement of class forces the task of a working class representative is to point out to the ruling parties that their policies will not work and will make the lives of working men and women more unbearable.</P>
    <P>In exposing the propaganda of the ruling parties we find behind them the propaganda of their real masters, the FUE, the IFA and the IMI.  One of their favourite big lies is that the wealth base is too small to tax in Ireland.  What are the facts?</P>
    <P>The facts are that on a conservative estimate the total value of productive wealth in Ireland in 1981 is £35,000 million. This produces a capitalist income this year of £2,500 million.  This huge sum, virtually untouched by tax, is spread among a few hundred ranchers, tenement owners and property speculators.  This mountain of capital thrown up by the working class is to be left untouched in this mini budget while the Coalition quarries at the dwindling hillsides of workers' wages.</P>
    <P>We want that mountain of capital to be taken up by the State and put to work, and while we use that capital to create jobs we want to give the working class a breathing space by freezing the prices of three essential commodities &mdash; food, fuel and transport.  In particular we repudiate the medieval prospect opened up by Deputy Kelly, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, of increasing CIE bus fares at a time when the Government refuse to subvent CIE's rapid rail expansion programme.</P>
    <P>The key to a better life is to remove the scandal of wealth without taxation. But, apart from the ethical and moral degradation caused by great wealth untouched in the midst of public squalor, there is the question of its sheer wastefulness.</P>
    <P>A striking example is the two million acres of Irish agricultural land lying fallow. Another example is the great derelict <Col N="875" /> lict sites that blight our cities.  We want to winkle out the owners of these lands and these sites and recall them from Spain, or from Cheltenham, or from oil speculation back to the real world.  A resource tax and a land tax with sharp teeth will awaken them from their dreams of betting pools or infinitely moving oil shares.  Use it or pay for it will be the message.  A proper land tax of not more than 1 per cent would not only raise £300 million but would help to start land moving on the market so that younger and more enterprising farmers would have the opportunity to plough the fallow land and turn it into agricultural wealth.</P>
    <P>There is no argument against wealth taxes to which we will listen sympathetically except those based on simple principles of justice and fair play.  There is the question of a direct tax system.  At present PAYE workers pay £17 in every £100 earned.  Employers and farmers pay £7 in every £100.  If employers, farmers and self-employed were taxed at the same rate as PAYE workers, the revenue raised would be close to £350 million, or one-third of the deficit which so pre-occupies the public mind.</P>
    <P>The Opposition party are saying that what the Government are doing is totally unnecessary.  This shows beyond any doubt the hypocrisy of the system and the failure to tackle the problems.  It is well known that there is wholesale tax evasion. If the Opposition party are correct in saying there was no urgent need to introduce a budget at this stage, why was this time not used to go after the tax evaders and to introduce a wealth tax? The Minister admits that he will be looking into this matter.  This would have the effect of giving working people confidence in the fact that they have a share in the country, and that consideration will be given to the needs of that section of the community.  I am very disappointed at the failure of the Labour Party to do anything about this.  I hope the reaction of the workers will not be to take to the streets to get their rights.</P>

      <P>Ó tháinig an Comhrialtas i gcumhacht trí sheachtainí ó shin, táimíd ag obair go dian ag iarraidh cúrsaí airgeadais an Rialtais a chur in ord agus in eagar.  I rith na trí seachtainí sin chaitheamar suas le 50 uair a chloig ag pléigh leis an fhadhb seo, agus is soiléir anois ón ráiteas a thug an tAire inné cén toradh atá ar an obair sin.</P>

Ba léir dúinne sa Rialtas, muna dtógfaí an chéim seo, go raibh caighdeán maireachtála muintir na hÉireann i mbaol agus, go deimhin, neamhspleachas muintir na tíre i mbaol.</P>
    <P>Ní hamháin go raibh gníomh éigin cosúil le seo riachtanach láithreach ach go gcaithfí rudaí nár chuir áthas ar bith orainne mar Rialtas a dhéanamh láithreach.

Sin suim airgid atá i bhfad níos mó ná mar a leagadh amach ag tús na bliana seo, i mí Feabhra seo caite, nuair a leag an Rialtas amach £515 milliún punt mar easnamh san cháinfhaisnéis.

    <P>Féachfar chuige &mdash; agus seo ceann de na geallúintí &mdash; nach mbeidh ardú eile i mbliana ar na praghsanna a bhaineann leis na príomh-earraí &mdash; bí, arán, plúr, bainne, im agus margairín.  Beidh deontas feabhsucháin ann arís do thithe.  I 1977 dúirt Fianna Fáil go ndéanfaí meadú ar na deontais sin, ach ní amháin nach ndearnadh meadú orthu ach cuireadh ar ceal ar fad iad i Mí Feabhra 1980.  Beidh cúnamh breise ar fáil ar bhóithre beaga agus laghdófar an cháin bhreis luacha a bheidh le híoc ag conraitheoirí.  Mar a dúirt mé, tá deontais méadaithe do mhicléinn ard-oideachais.  Tá sé sin fógraithe cheana féin ag an Aire Oideachais.  Laghdófar an cháin ar ola a úsáidtear i dtionscal, rud a chuideoidh go mór le tionsclaíocht na tíre.  Tá gearán ar siúl ón taobh thall den Teach i ngeall ar seo.  Ba mhaith liom cur i gcuimhne do mhuintir Fhianna Fáil gur ghearr siadsan cáin i 1980 ar ola tionsclaíochta, agus tar éis na cánach sin bhí an leibhéal is aoirde taobh istigh den EEC san tír seo.  Tháinig cáinfhaisnéis 1980 ach níor baineadh pingin amháin de sin i níor ardaíodh é nach níor baineadh tada de.</P>
    <P>Dúramar i rith an toghcháin go n-ísleofaí 50 faoin gcéad den cháin a cuireadh air i 1980.  Tá sé sin déanta sa cháin fhaisnéis seo chun cuidiú le tionsclaíocht agus le fostaíocht.  Chomh maith leis na buntáisti a bhfuil airgead curtha ar fáil dóibh, tá clár leathan leagtha amach ag an Rialtas.  Déanfar ath-chóiriú ar an gcóras cháin ioncaim an bhliain seo chug-ainn. Seo geallúint eile a tugadh.  Cuireann sé áthas orm a rá go gcomhlíonfar an gheallúint sin, ach caithfear a thuiscint nach féidir bun-athraithe a reachtáil sa chóras cánach i lár na bliana.  Caithfidh tú fanacht go dtí cáin bhliain eile chun a leithéid a dhéanamh.  Níl aon dul siar ar <Col N="879" /> gheallúintí sa chás seo.  Níl siad á gcur ar athló, mar ní raibh ceist ar bith i rith an toghcháin go dtabharfaí na hathruithe seo isteach díreach.  Dúramar go mbeadh na hathruithe ann ach nach mbeadh siad ar fáil díreach anois.</P>
    <P>Tá breis airgid curtha ar fáil chun tithíochta, agus sa chás seo tá scéim nua le tabhairt isteach ag an Rialtas maidir le hairgead a chur ar fáil do lanúnacha óga go mbeidh orthu tithe a thógáil.  Tabharfar spreagadh úr do dhaoine chun airgead a choigilt agus cuirfear leis an duais-chiste a bhíonn ann do dhuais-bhannaí, agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>It gives me no great pleasure to stand here on the first day I have spoken as a Minister and defend the budget.  The facts are that the present position was forced on us because of the state in which we found the economy.  Having scrutinised the expenditure in each Department on coming into office we had no option but to introduce the budget.  I cannot understand why speaker after speaker from the Opposition kept harping on the necessity for the introduction of the budget at this time.  To give some idea of the contradictions we find in the arguments put forward, Deputy Colley said we were afraid &mdash; I was accused yesterday on radio of being afraid &mdash; of the Labour Party and Independents.  We did not go far enough in certain respects.  We could have done what would have been regarded as absolutely and totally irresponsible and waited until next February. We did not but decided to act responsibly and in doing so put our ministerial heads on the chopping block by telling the Dáil and the country that if we were defeated on any of the votes the Taoiseach would dissolve the Dáil.  I do not regard that as fear.  It is acting responsibly and we should not seek kudos for that.</P>
    <P>It is our job to act responsibly and to be seen to do so.  If that demands courage, so be it.  We have been told and, from the far side of the House, have always admitted, that there is a serious world recession surrounding us at present. Deputy Colley, a man for whom I have great respect and a man of vast experience in different ministries, would <Col N="880" /> seem to suggest we should allow this recession to go over our heads and do nothing.  If we can in any way through internal management reduce the effects of that recession we have an obligation to do so.  The Government are now doing that.</P>
    <P>During the international recession we have been experiencing Fianna Fáil seemed to take the view that we would survive that recession and that it would be time enough to pick up the pieces after the recession had ended.  I do not think anybody accepts that kind of philosophy as being sensible especially in the context of the economic mess in which we have found the country.  Deputy Colley, a man who is very strong on the subtleties of the English language, admitted that there was economic justification for the budget but went on to say that the motivation behind it was political.  It does not matter to the consumer what the motivation is, whether it is economic or political.  I would prefer to believe that if there was economic justification for the budget that was much more important than having to defend it on political grounds.</P>
    <P>This budget has been introduced for economic reasons.  There is no justification for putting one's political head on the block for political reasons but we had no option other than to introduce this budget.  There have been repeated statements from the other side of the House during the day that there is in the budget a lack of precision.  That may be so and I am sure the Minister for Finance when winding up the debate will reply to this as well as to the many other matters that have been raised.  Lack of precision is one thing but a lack of honesty is something very different.  While many allegations may be made as to the motivation behind the budget and the figures contained in it, I do not think that the honesty and integrity with which the problem has been approached can be questioned.  The facts are that the provisions made in the Estimates, as we now know them, were false.  They were based on a false premise. The £515 million provided in the Estimates for the purpose of meeting the deficit on the current side was also miscalculated. We know now that the figure <Col N="881" /> is almost twice that.  If we failed to take action now to bring that massive excess under control we would be facing a starting deficit next February of massive proportions.</P>
    <P>One could not but note the alacrity with which Deputy Colley was able to skirt around certain years.  He defended vehemently the economic approach of Fianna Fáil in 1978 and in 1979 but did not have a word to say in this respect so far as 1980 or the first half of 1981 were concerned.  However, that is nothing new but it shows what is happening on the other side of the House.  Indeed, it is a very sensible approach because the activities in the economic sphere and in the financial management of the economy during the past year-and-a-half cannot be defended by anyone.</P>
    <P>The merits of bolstering up the ESB have been propounded by Fianna Fáil speakers.  There is a statutory obligation on the ESB to pay for themselves, as the former Minister who raised this question should know.  I do not wish to make odious comparisons but we do not want to find the ESB in the same unfortunate position as CIE by reason of not being allowed to pay for themselves and of not allowing the consumer to pay for the service being provided.</P>
    <P>What we found in Government was that a mass of price increases had been upheld and justified but were waiting sanction.  For political reasons all these increases were held up with the result that what faced the new Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism on his first day in office was a list of these increases, representing in terms of the CPI, something of the order of 2 per cent. The outgoing Cabinet went before the electorate on the basis that everything was all right though they knew that these services were daily sinking deeper into debt.  The deferment of these increases were in the interest of political expediency. Deputy Colley is of the opinion that the increases in this budget will result in an inflationary spiral.  I hope he will be proved wrong.  The Government have been very careful to select the least inflationary items in order to ensure that the <Col N="882" /> end result will not have this undesirable effect.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has mentioned a 3 per cent increase in the cost of living as a result of the provisions in the budget.  We are prepared to allow the CSO to calculate their figure in their time and we will accept the figure they publish. There will be no question of our seeking the shelter of the allegation of having been given misinformation by civil servants, as was the case when rash statements were made by the Leader of the Opposition when he was Taoiseach.  A miscalculation of over 6 per cent was made by him in his first utterance on the first day of the election campaign.  Then he comes along and apologises for having been misinformed.  How could a man of his experience do that when we are giving the facts?  They will be the facts and no apologies will be made and we will not have to revert to the excuse that misinformation was given.</P>
    <P>This budget is to many people possibly unpalatable, but it is absolutely essential. All independent economic commentators will agree that any further delay in taking the necessary action or taking the first step &mdash; and this is the first step towards putting the economy back on the rails again &mdash; would be highly irresponsible once the people given that responsibility were in possession of the facts.  As soon as this Government came into possession of the facts they did take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>As I said, it gives me no pleasure to stand here defending a budget when many more palatable things could be said and done by any Government in office. The economic state of the country allows very little option but to take the hard road initially.  Once people realise that the corrective action has been taken, I am quite sure they will see the sense in co-operating and not endeavouring to expect too much from a national cake, as has happened for too long, because the end result of that would be going back to where we started: into massive borrowing and a state where we cannot sustain our present standard of living.  That was the reality which faced this Government and <Col N="883" /> that is why we are forced into taking this action now.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá mar Aire na Gaeltachta go bhfuil cúram na Gaeltachta orm agus chomh fada agus is féidir liom go ndéanfaidh mé no dhícheall fadhbanna na Gaeltachta agus muintir na Gaeltachta a réiteach.  Tá a lán fadhbanna ag baint leo agus ag cur as dóibh.  Tugadh geallúintí do mhuintir na Gaeltachta cúpla seachtain ó shin agus ba mhaith lion a rá anseo go gcomhlíonfar chuile gheallúint a tugadh don Ghaeltacht agus dá muintir. Tá dhá chomhlacht reachtúla faoi mo chúram, Board an Gaeilge agus Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Beidh mé ag tacú leo chomh fada agus is féidir liom chun leas na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn. Sin é an fáth atá mé anseo, agus déarfaidh mé anois go ndéanfaidh mé mo dhícheall an job sin a dhéanamh chomh maith agus is féidir liom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a bad budget which in these early days after a general election could be described as an unprecedented rape of the electorate during the honeymoon period.  I do not say that without giving some thought to what I am saying, because we are faced here with a budget of many deceptions from a party who went to the electorate claiming to have all the honest people, all the people of integrity and intelligence, all the best of all that is going.  Nevertheless, they come here to present us with a budget which was inevitable because of the statements they made beforehand.  I am not surprised at the kind of budget it is.  It is a confused budget with many elements which will interact unfavourably on the electorate and will not be seen or felt fully by the electorate for some time. These interactions are skilfully laid and were put carefully to the House here yesterday so that we and certainly the electorate would not recognise too readily the elements they contained and perhaps, above all, so that the Independents here would not recognise too readily what is involved in this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is and will be seen in time to be a blatantly cowardly budget.  It does not address itself to the real potential of our <Col N="884" /> country.  It does not have the confidence to invest in our young people.  Instead, it follows the very well-trodden path of deflation and conservatism.  That, again, is not surprising, given the people who introduced it; but it is not what the young people of this country are looking for at this time.  It indicates a Government who do not believe in the capacity of our young people to repay that investment. I listened to the Minister for Finance yesterday saying that the young people would not be able in the future to repay the kind of investment being made by the £1,700 million capital investment programme to provide jobs and create opportunities for them now, this year. Yet that rather than promises for the future is what we need.  It is quite clear from what the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach said that the Coalition Government do not believe in the capacity of our young people to repay that investment.  The Coalition Government have so often stressed the marvellous asset our young people are, so well-educated, trained and prepared to take on the challenges of present-day life, given the appropriate leadership, stimulus, support and investment.  These they are not getting from this Government and this will become clearer to everybody as time goes on.  The Government keep on quoting this very simple, trite concept of housekeeping, maintaining your budget in the home, and they cite the need to avoid deficits and borrowing.</P>
    <P>But I ask this House: what house or family will not invest in its children?  Will parents not borrow for housing and for education? Will parents not borrow for their children to give them a start in life? So, also, must the nation borrow, within reason and within limits.  What then was the purpose of this budget exercise which was foisted on the electorate during what can be regarded as the honeymoon or the shell-shocked period?  It is a budget in which a deficit of £947 million has been projected.  Even the simplest student of economics, the simplest leaving certificate student, or you could go back practically to the primary certificate, would recognise the dishonesty in the way in <Col N="885" /> which the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance projected and guesstimated to create the worst possible situation that they could envisage, the most dismal economic figures, to justify their actions in this budget.</P>
    <P>I know what is done in the background. I have experience of what has been done here.  I am quite familiar with the way in which anything that could be found was thrown into this guesstimate to suggest the blackest possible picture.  That is what has been done, nothing more sophisticated or elaborate.  The fact that it was no more sophisticated or elaborate is borne out very clearly by the fact that, within a day of taking office, the Taoiseach could declare that there was an enormous deficit.</P>
    <P>Two things were proposed.  One was this fantastic guesstimate of £947 million which has succeeded in catching everybody's imagination.  The second was the assumption that there would be no Government action of any kind in between. Of course, normal Government action would have been based naturally on the half-year period.  Last year, when those figures were available, we had several rounds of meetings with the health boards to revise and recheck their figures and any drift which was occurring in them.  This is something which every Department would do and the Department of Finance would ensure that this was done when the figures came to light. Nevertheless, the budget deficit figure, which has been sold to the population has now, under the measures proposed here, been reduced by £160 million.  But if we look at this we find that this reduction includes CIE and ESB increases which account for £67 million.  Surely the Government are not suggesting that their predecessors planned to have no increases in these areas?  It was made quite clear that a more detailed examination would have to take place before the kind of increases which were being passed on to the consumer would be agreed in these two areas.</P>
    <P>Why so much activity then, to gain what seems like so little in terms of this proposed reduction in the theoretical budget deficit?  The normal half year <Col N="886" /> measures would have achieved and could have been used to achieve reductions of this order.  The real purpose in the budget is that it is an advance budget for 1982, to gain new revenue for the Government for political purposes.  It is preparing a base to have even further greater incomes and revenues to the Government in that period.  Its effect will be highly inflationary. It will add 5 per cent to 6 per cent to the CPI.  The Minister for Finance, when questioned here last night, made it quite clear that the 3 per cent to which he referred would only cover his little piece, the excise and tax duties.  He said he was not responsible for Deputy Kelly's aspect.  I accept the whole concept of Cabinet responsibility.  The Departments are not responsible but the Minister surely shares co-responsibility with his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Kelly, for the consequential increases which will occur at his end.  He has succeeded in getting everyone to talk about 3 per cent when he admitted last night that the 3 per cent only covers his aspect. He also specified very clearly that the 3 per cent is only the tax and the excise content.  It does not include other elements like increased CIE and ESB charges and increases in a whole variety of other things, including health charges and prescription costs.</P>
    <P>There is a list of other increases involved to which he referred but about which he did not give any details.  It will lead to inflation rates of 22 per cent to 23 per cent.  It is to be combined with what we said it would be combined with, an attempted wage freeze in the public sector. The Minister will have considerable difficulty in implementing that proposal made by the Taoiseach on a number of occasions before the election.  This would be a disastrous mix for the economy and it will lead to increased unemployment which is a tragedy at a time when substantial investment had led to a stablisation of unemployment in what is a very difficult situation for us with our rapidly growing young population.</P>
    <P>The housewives were conned.  The floating voter who happened to believe in the package which was put up by Fine <Col N="887" /> Gael &mdash; mind you she did not vote for the Gaiety Theatre package &mdash; now finds she must pay first in increased taxes and prices and then maybe later she will get the £9.60 back, from her husband no less, as a tax credit.  Assuming that all the other things go well, her husband's tax credit will come back to her.</P>
    <P>The students were conned also.  They found, to their dismay, that the grants which had been talked about so much, especially by Fine Gael speakers in UCD, were not to apply to those who were in college already and who did not have current grants.  A student there, who is just over the previous limit, and would now come well within the new limits, will not benefit.  That student is aware that he or she was conned into voting for Fine Gael on the basis they would get those increases.  I have spoken to them.  Members of the Government should speak to them.  They were misled by this Government of such enormous honesty and integrity.  In addition they now find that, not only were they misled there, but they also face a 30 per cent increase in fees.</P>
    <P>No-one so far has really looked at the impact of these impositions on people at different income levels.  I asked some questions, because I had some idea of the results, and got some information in advance from the Minister for Health on the kind of increases which would be imposed in that area in particular.  From some figures which I know I can estimate the likely impact of the extra taxes &mdash; the combined effect of the extra costs &mdash; on the annual income of a person in the £5,000, £10,000, £15,000, £20,000 and £25,000 income bracket.  I call these taxes, because that is what they are. Although the present Government like to talk about levies and other niceties, they are basically taxes.  The Coalition do not want to talk about taxes because they told the electorate that they would reduce taxation.  That is something which comes after you first have paid more &mdash; another part of the confidence trick which the Fine Gael Party, in particular, have played on the electorate.</P>
    <P>Take the health charges, which are plus 1½ per cent.  I mention these because the <Col N="888" /> Minister for Finance, although he has not given the details here has given them separately in answer to questions and has told us that they will not come into effect until later.  When we take their impact into account, along with those which are coming in now, the levy of 1 per cent from September on and the 3.75 per cent which is also being brought in on incomes over £8,500, together with the other increases which have come with this budget, we find that for a person on £5,000 annual income the health charges will cost an extra £75 per annum, the levy of 1 per cent £50, the 3.75 per cent will not bring anything in for people of that income, so there is a total of £125 extra.</P>
    <P>If we add to these the very barest, most meagre and essential extra motoring costs, together with the remainder of the CPI and some CPI costs which are not included in these levies, plus the increased ESB charges, we get a total of £575 extra, or £11 per week, for the person on £5,000.</P>
    <P>If we do the same exercise with regard to a person with, an annual income of £10,000, the health charges amount to £165, the 1 per cent levy £100 and the 3.75 per cent will amount to £56, giving a total of £321.  Take into account approximately £200 for essential motoring &mdash; and that is a very modest increase compared with what the motoring organisations are currently estimating &mdash; the £100 for the other CPI increases and the ESB increase of £150, that comes to £771 extra, or £14.80 per week for the worker on £10,000 a year.</P>
    <P>If we go to £15,000 bracket, the extra health charges &mdash; which are not, of course, going to do anything for health but go into the general taxation package &mdash; will amount to £290, the levy of 1 per cent £150, the 3.75 per cent begins to bite a little more here and will account for £243, giving a total of £683.  Take the motoring increases, CPI and ESB and you will get £1,283, or £24.60 a week. Perhaps now the Members of the House are beginning to see why I talked about the rape of the electorate in the early aftermath of the honeymoon period of the election &mdash; or not so much the election as the Gaeity Theatre document.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> If we take the £20,000 income, there are those, and I suppose the Minister would be one, who are interested at this stage in this bracket.  The health charges will come to an extra&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;£415, the levy of 1 per cent will take £200, the 3.75 per cent really begins to bite here and takes £431, which totals £1,046.  Take the motoring, CPI and ESB and it amounts to £1,646, or £31.60 a week.</P>
      <P>I shall go as far as the £25,000 income, as a matter of interest.  The health charges here take £540, the levy of 1 per cent £250, the 3.75 per cent bites a bit harder here too and takes £618, coming to a total of £1,408.  Take essential motoring costs, although there may be even an increase on this because of the car make which may be larger and travelling further in many instances &mdash; that will total £2,008 or £38.60 a week.</P>
      <P>It is worth bearing in mind that it is fairly easy to say that the people on £15,000, £20,000 or £25,000 have lots of income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is that those people do pay substantial taxes.  That reduces their gross income considerably and these charges are levied on their gross income, so there is a bigger impact than would appear at first glance.  One might think that people on £25,000 a year would not feel the extra £2,000 a year, or £38.60 a week.  But of course they do not really have £25,000, because taxation sees to it that this figure is very substantially reduced.  The same applies to the person on £20,000 and £15,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are very substantial charges which the electorate are being asked to bear.  We have also the extra health <Col N="890" /> charges, prescription charges, the drugs refund scheme, which is being increased, and a whole range of other charges spread all over the place.  One would need a little more time to gather all the information, but I have given enough to indicate very clearly that this is a savage impost on the electorate at each of these income levels.  These levies are a disguised tax increase.  They are ways of getting extra tax.  Take the effect of the 1½ per cent, 1 per cent and 3.75 per cent increases alone and it transpires that this is a complex way of putting on an 8 to 14 per cent income tax surcharge.  The people who are claiming that they are going to reduce taxes are actually putting on tax surcharges.  That is what is being done in the budget.  It is not, honestly, called a tax, but is basically a tax which is disguised, and that is its impact.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Gaeltacht mentioned the ESB charges and said that you must let the ESB increase their prices.  Of course, they must have a price increase, but must they always get the price increase they look for?  Are they always to come to the National Prices Commission and say, &ldquo;Here, rubber stamp that&rdquo;? In fact, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism told us earlier that he will speed these things up.</P>
    <P>That is great news.  He said nobody will have to wait for increases.  If they want increases they can be shoved up the line. I do not think it is reasonable to keep increasing prices.  I am speaking particularly for the lower income groups because I deal a great deal with them.  I have people coming to my door because their electricity supply has been, or is about to be, cut off.  I have been making special arrangements with the ESB staff for these bills to be paid, but it is becoming increasingly difficult.  Increasing oil charges are making this a more difficult situation which must be looked at seriously.  It cannot be dismissed flippantly as the Minister for Finance did yesterday and as the Minister for the Gaeltacht did today, but in a less flippant way.  He said we must be serious about this, knuckle down and pay up without asking any questions.</P>
    <P>We were sent here to ask questions. As an ordinary elected Member I want to <Col N="891" /> ask why the ESB need these increases.  If we look at their accounts we will see a long-standing anomaly.  It shows the way they interpret the Electricity Act.  The Minister for the Gaeltacht said they had a right to protect themselves and to ensure they have enough money to do that.  In their report of their accounts for 1978-79 and 1979-80 we see in their electricity income and expenditure accounts the following headings &mdash; income from sales and miscellaneous; expenditure: fuel, operation, maintenance and local charges; general charges, depreciation &mdash; the normal depreciation found in company accounts &mdash; and interest and other costs.</P>
    <P>Further down we have an amortisation charge.  This is unusual and will not be found in other accounts which show normal depreciation.  This shows the borrowings which are being written off.  This method of double accounting has continued for some time, but what does it mean in money terms?  In 1979-80 the combination of the different kinds of depreciation comes to £23,563,000, and amortisation to £20,771,000.  Even so the ESB show a loss of £9 million.  We must be concerned that there is a loss and that the consumer must pay these charges.  Other companies do not have the double allowance of £23 million and £20 million.  If the ESB did not have this double accounting system their accounts would show they made a profit of £11.6 million.  Bearing this in mind we must ask if this system should be continued on a permanent basis.  Should the consumer be asked again and again to pay increased charges to cover the ESB's heavy borrowings as well as covering depreciation?  They have a substantial cash flow coming forward and this is one area which must be looked at.  This leads me to ask why there must be a surcharge.  This is another political gimmick which is being foisted on us by the Minister for Finance, without addressing himself to the basic costs we are supposed to be meeting.  I ask him to look at this before he gives permission to introduce these increases.</P>
    <P>If this means this House must interpret the Electricity Act and convention then <Col N="892" /> let them come back and we can decide what the wording should be.  Increased ESB charges will make a very big impact &mdash; I do not have time to go into them in detail &mdash; and will mean an increase of £2 to £3 a week for the average family.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what the different sectors will contribute.  This is a very inequitable budget.  Take the health charges.  The PAYE sector will pay £76.4 million, the self-employed £5.2 million, and farmers £5.4 million, giving a total of £87 million. We know it will be difficult to collect the £5.4 million from the farmers and that it will be difficult to collect all the money from the self-employed, for many reasons, but we know it will not be difficult to collect it from the PAYE sector for obvious reasons.  If we add the levy of 1 per cent we find the figure is £51 million for the PAYE sector, £1.73 million for the self-employed and £1.8 million for farmers, giving a total of £54.5 million.  If we add these totals we find the PAYE sector will contribute £127.4 million, the self-employed £6.93 million, and the farmers £7.2 million giving a total of £141 million.  At this stage we can say the PAYE sector are contributing 90 per cent.  From questions I asked in this House I know it will be difficult to collect this money from the farmers because in many cases they do not have the money. There are PAYE people who do not have that money to contribute but because of the efficiency of the system they will contribute nonetheless.</P>
    <P>Now we will look at the 3.75 per cent on incomes over £8,500, which is to bring in £18 million.  There is nothing there for the self-employed or the farmers.  The VAT increases from 10 per cent to 15 per cent are expected to yield £188 million. The PAYE sector will contribute about £169 million, the self-employed £11 million, and the farmers £8 million.  The breakdown of those figures is only a very rough estimate based on the PAYE sector contributing 80 per cent, the self-employed 10 per cent and farmers 10 per cent.  We know that both the farmers and the self-employed can recoup a certain amount, so I took 5 per cent off each, leaving the remainder with the PAYE sector.  That last point may be subject to <Col N="893" /> some correction but the other figures have been given by the Government.  We find that the PAYE sector contribute £314 million, the self-employed £17 million and farmers £15 million, giving a total of £346 million.  Overall the PAYE sector contribute 94.7 per cent.  This is the broad base of which the Minister speaks.  It is grossly inequitable and demonstrably so.</P>
    <P>I now turn to our budget target of an increase of 5 per cent in the cost of the health service.  There was nothing hidden about this and it was not in any way misleading.  The measures taken by this Government will have an inflationary impact on the health services and on social welfare and Supplementary Estimates, which would have been necessary in any event, will now have to be increased considerably.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the previous Government were careless in their approach to the economy and aspects of the Estimates.  In 1980 we introduced considerable economies in the health services in areas such as energy saving. There was an adjustment in wages for nurses and others following the findings of a review body and the Labour Court. It is clear that nurses were for many years grossly underpaid and consequently adjustments had to be made.  The policy in 1981 was to have a series of meetings with the chairmen and chief executive officers of the health boards.  I take this opportunity to thank them for their work earlier this year.  The health services are inadequate at present due to many factors including years of neglect, lack of input of money and the tremendous growth of the population.  In 1979 71,000 babies were born, the highest number since records began.</P>

      <P>Last year the figure was even higher, and the Minister for Health will have to deal with this problem.  Care must be provided for these babies, and their mothers are demanding high standards. Nobody wants to die too soon and <Col N="894" /> anyone admitted to hospital wants first-class medical attention.  Better care is being provided and the survival rate has greatly improved.  Consequently the elderly, the mentally handicapped and those involved in accidents have a good survival rate.  Many new techniques have been introduced and there have been developments in out-patient facilities and community services.  However, because of our population growth there are great strains on these services.</P>
      <P>We carried out an in-depth analysis in each health board area.  The Secretary of the Department of Health visited the management in each health board area. The public should not be fooled into thinking that the homework was not done; it was done more thoroughly than for many a year.  The result was overall savings by the health boards, voluntary hospitals and homes and the GMS payments board.  The Minister can see the relevant figures.  We decided on a stand-still budget based on prudent management and an estimated inflation rate of 15 per cent.  Further savings would have involved reductions in staff and the curtailment of services.  We took a number of measures relating to longer-term savings. We carried out drug studies and an examination of the GMS.  The 5 per cent target could not be achieved in full this year but we must now consider the impact of this budget.</P>
      <P>Electricity charges within the health service will be greatly increased.  Hospital costs, prescription costs and the cost of the drug refund scheme will also be increased.  The increase in VAT will have a major effect, as will the increase in petrol and diesel costs.  All this amounts to a huge increase in costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social welfare beneficiaries are particularly hard hit.  The ESB increase will be between £2 and £3 per week.  The CIE and VAT increases will also have a heavy impact and the overall CPI increase will be between 5 per cent and 6 per cent. From October old age pensioners are being offered 5 per cent, less than the budget increase in inflation.  Widows, deserted wives and the unemployed are to receive 3 per cent.  Our leader dealt very effectively with that point this morning. <Col N="895" /> A widow under 66 years of age will receive an increase of 80p per week from next October.  I do not need to say much more to illustrate how derisory are these increases and how ridiculous they are compared to what we did before this Government came into office.</P>

      <P>In relation to schoolbooks and the VAT increase, I would ask the Minister to consider registering the boards of management for VAT so that they could at least recoup the greatly increased costs there.  It is done with farmers and others.</P>
      <P>The people have been misled by the Coalition who have reneged on their promises.  Instead of what they were promised the people have now got taxes in disguise.  The ordinary workers and middle income groups will bear the burden and the PAYE sector will carry 94.7 per cent of the increases.  I am concerned about the health services because of the inflationary impact of this budget.  I know that the Minister indicated that he plans to bring incomes savings there which will reduce services.  In relation to social welfare the increases are derisory and will not go even half way to meet the inflation brought about by this budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my first speech to the Dáil as a member of an Irish Government I wish publicly to express my consciousness of the honour that has been conferred on me.  That honour also reflects on the people of my own constituency of County Wicklow who have not had representation at Cabinet level since the days &mdash; about 24 years ago &mdash; of another Labour representative of the county, Mr. Jim Everett.  For my part I pledge to work unstintingly in the Ministries of Labour and the Public Service and to contribute fully to Cabinet discussions so as to ensure an improvement in every facet of the lives of the people of this potentially great country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking in the House yesterday on the supplementary budget the Minister for Finance expressed the Government <Col N="896" /> aim to bring our aspirations and demands in the area of incomes into line with the international value of what we produce. In the absence of any further addition non-agricultural wages and salaries under the present national understanding will this year increase by 17 per cent which is more than double the average figure expected in other EMS countries.  The Government aim to solve the problem that this poses by agreement.  In our programme we said that free central bargaining ought to remain the way in which to determine money incomes.  The welfare of the community requires that such bargaining should have due regard to its economic and social effect.</P>
    <P>It will be my objective as Minister for Labour to do all in my power to secure improvements in the climate of industrial relations.  This is a key area on which our progress towards the attainment of our economic and social goals will largely depend.</P>
    <P>The present industrial dispute in CIE, which has resulted in the cancellation of bus services in Dublin and the disruption of services in certain other areas, has arisen from a long standing claim for increases related to productivity.  Negotiations on various aspects of the claim have been going on for over two years but these negotiations have proved very difficult.</P>
    <P>A disturbing feature of the present industrial action is that it appears to have been taken before all the procedures available were gone through.  In this regard I would like to impress on employers and trade unions the need to adhere to the spirit and the letter of the dispute procedures and machinery which are available.  As far as CIE are concerned we must always be mindful of the high level of public finance which is involved. In this regard the total subvention for the current year amounts to £74 million.</P>
    <P>As an attempt to alleviate the hardship being caused by the present dispute the Government have arranged for the Army to provide a limited service and this service was introduced on Monday last.  As Deputies will be aware, the Labour Court are at present investigating the unions' <Col N="897" /> claims and hopefully this investigation will lead to an early resumption of work. I understand that negotiations in the Labour Court are at an advanced stage so I would not wish to make any further comment on this dispute now.</P>
    <P>It will be my policy not to intervene directly in the issues in disputes.  It should not be any part of the job of a Minister for Labour to tell employers or workers how much should be paid for any particular job.  These are matters for employers and unions to agree and, failing that, to avail of the various dispute settling machinery which is available.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to limit my involvement in strikes to the job of encouraging the parties to disputes to use the agreed procedures and machinery for the settlement of disputes and to ensuring that the machinery is adequate to the job.</P>
    <P>For the private sector the most important institution for settling disputes is the Labour Court.  It consists of 12 members who are paid full time out of the taxpayers' money and between them they carry the onerous national responsibility of settling all disputes which occur.  It may be that over the past four years the court have felt that their responsibility was being shared by Ministers.  In the most recent oil dispute, not one but two Ministers unsuccessfully intervened in the dispute and arguably prolonged the strike by at least a week.  I will expect the Labour Court to handle all such disputes on their own initiative in future.  If the court feel they need greater resources to deal with these problems I will see to it that they get all the necessary help to carry out their functions expeditiously.</P>
    <P>I intend at an early date to introduce legislation covering two of the commitments set out under the heading &ldquo;Industrial Relations&rdquo; in the Government's programme. The first covers the extension to all sectors of the economy of the legal immunities enjoyed at present by trade unions in the private sector under the Trade Disputes Act, 1906.  The legislation on this item should be relatively straightforward.  The second commitment to give full legal protection to the existing arrangements set up by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for &ldquo;all out&rdquo;<Col N="898" /> pickets involves more complex legal and constitutional questions and will require discussion in some depth with the interests concerned.  In considering this question, I am conscious of the degree of order which has been imposed on the Irish industrial relations scene by the ICTU's policy on &ldquo;all out&rdquo; pickets.</P>
    <P>The current national understanding is due to end for early starters on 30 September next.  As indicated in the Government programme, we are committed to the active encouragement of free collective bargaining at national level.  A recent report commissioned by the FUE which recommends some far-reaching changes in centralised agreements on pay policy will require careful study.  The Government's approach to how the discussions on a further national pay agreement should develop are set out in the section of our programme headed &ldquo;Anti Inflation Programme&rdquo;.  I will be indicating later some aspects of this policy relating to public sector pay.</P>
    <P>The discussions promised in the programme about the future role of the industrial relations institutions and measures for improving procedures and practices of industrial relations and personnel management will also be initiated as soon as possible.  On the institutional side, the discussions will have to deal with the Labour Court and their conciliation service, the rights commissioners, the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Employment Equality Agency, as well, perhaps, as such bodies as joint labour committees, joint industrial councils etc.</P>
    <P>As all these agencies have their role and functions defined in a variety of statutes it is obvious that the setting up of a single industrial relations bureau to incorporate them would involve extensive amending legislation or perhaps a completely new statute.  Wide ranging discussions will need to be undertaken in this matter.  Their aim will be, as stated in the programme, to improve efficiency and minimise delays and also to avoid disputes by tackling the root causes rather than the symptoms.</P>
    <P>At this stage I have an open mind on the best form of organisational structures which will achieve these desirable aims.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="899" /> There is no doubt in my mind, even as a result of my brief experience to date as Minister for Labour, that there is a vast amount of room for improvement in our industrial relations arrangements. The Government are anxious to provide such improvements in the institutional arrangements as will help to improve our performance in industrial relations.  They will however be anxious in the forthcoming discussions to secure the full support of both sides of industry for any institutional changes decided upon.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Industrial Relations which was set up under the previous Administration have now completed their report.  I shall arrange to have the report laid before the Dáil and published after it has been given initial consideration by the Government.  Due account will be taken of the commission's views in the further development of policy in this area.  It is relevant to point out at this stage that the ICTU representatives on the commission suspended participation in proceedings of the commission in accordance with a decision taken in the Annual Delegate Conference of ICTU in 1979.  Accordingly, the ICTU members did not participate in the commission's work from then on, nor have they subscribed to the report, a factor which, of course, makes the document less valuable than it might otherwise be.</P>
    <P>It would be my earnest intention to press forward with the discussion with employers and trade unions on these very important issues so as to lead to early agreement about institutional changes and the promotion of any required legislation in the near future.  I hope that I will have all round co-operation in this effort to make some improvements in an area where progress is difficult to achieve but is badly needed.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach has already announced, the Government propose to proceed immediately with the setting-up of the Youth Employment Agency which was promised in the Government's programme. Administrative arrangements for the establishment of the agency, as mentioned by the Minister for Finance, are in hand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="900" /> I visualise that the agency will establish close relationships with the Departments and agencies carrying out activities related to the employment and training of young persons.  At present the three Departments operating employment schemes are Labour, Education and Environment.  The main State bodies concerned in this task are AnCO, CERT, the IDA, SFADCo and Gaeltarra Éireann.  With regard to funding the agency, I propose, as indicated by the Minister for Finance, to introduce in the autumn legislation to provide for a 1 per cent levy on incomes.</P>
    <P>The financing of the agency and its operation will obviously be an issue of considerable importance and is a matter which will have to be dealt with by legislation. In the meantime, however, financing can, if necessary, be dealt with through an additional Estimate or a Supplementary Estimate.  When the proceeds of the youth employment charge are available it is my intention that the agency should assume responsibility for the channelling of these funds to the various bodies concerned.  The agency will also be asked to look into the question of expansion of the various schemes already in operation and the setting-up of new schemes which will help to solve the serious unemployment situation in relation to young persons.  At the same time it will be important for the agency to ensure that the schemes and training programmes being funded by it are those best suited to the needs of young people having regard to employment opportunities. I will be asking the agency to keep the various youth employment activities under constant review with regard to their relevance and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The Government's programme contains the target that 20,000 young people who are without employment for six months will qualify for certain forms of training, work experience and so on. Under the existing training schemes run by AnCO and CERT and the employment schemes operated by the Departments of Labour, Education and the Environment, over 20,000 young persons will be catered for in 1981.</P>
    <P>The figure I have given does not <Col N="901" /> include young persons who secure employment in jobs created as a result of the IDA and other job creation agencies. However, a proportion of the 20,000 young persons already catered for would not have been unemployed for six months prior to participation in the existing schemes.</P>
    <P>The speed at which employment and training schemes currently in operation can be expanded will of course vary significantly with the nature of the various schemes.  For example, work experience placements can be expanded quickly if employers generally co-operate in taking on the trainees.  The Work Experience Programme has proved a very useful scheme and has led to permanent employment for a high percentage of participants. AnCO are also in a position to respond urgently to the needs of the young unemployed through its Community Youth Training Programme and the use of external training facilities in outside firms.  These measures are the most flexible available to AnCO as the expansion of training centre activities are likely to take somewhat longer.  The process has to be slower because premises, equipment and trainers have to be provided. Nevertheless, AnCO will be in a position to expand their training centre activities somewhat in the near future as new centres and extensions to existing ones are now in course of construction and, in some cases, nearing completion.  Training by AnCO has also had good employment results and a high percentage of those trained have been placed in employment within three months of completing a course.  Investment in training is probably the best long-term investment in the youth employment area but other schemes are also valuable, particularly as short-term measures.</P>
    <P>The best estimate I can give of the current unemployment of persons under the age of 25 is that, excluding the current crop of school leavers, there were somewhere in the region of 40,000 young persons unemployed at the end of the school year.  Of course, a significant proportion of this figure would not have been out of work for six months.  This is offset by the <Col N="902" /> fact that those of this year's school leavers who are unable to obtain employment in the next six months will be added to the potential clients of the agency around the beginning of 1982.</P>
    <P>While the Government in their programme have given particular priority to the employment needs of young persons, it must also be borne in mind that we have substantial unemployment in our older workers and that their needs must not be neglected.  There are particular categories with especially severe unemployment problems &mdash; for example, middle-aged and older workers who lose their jobs and the long-term unemployed in areas such as Wicklow, Wexford and Dublin inner city.  The Government will be anxious to ensure that the emphasis on youth unemployment will not be to the detriment of those categories, that their needs will continue to be catered for and indeed, if resources permit, that the schemes to help them will also be strengthened.</P>
    <P>The financing of expanding activities under youth employment schemes will be very greatly helped by the availability of funds from the European Social Fund.  In general, Ireland can recover 55 per cent of the cost of such schemes from the fund. I am hopeful that the expansion of the schemes which will take place this year will qualify for aid from the fund under applications which have already been submitted to Brussels.  Applications for fund assistance in 1982 will be submitted in October and will reflect expansion of programmes which is visualised as necessary.</P>
    <P>The European Social Fund is due for a major review by the end of 1982 and discussions on the matter will be initiated at the Council of Ministers meeting in the second half of this year.  The fund has made an excellent contribution to the development of training services in Ireland since we joined the Community in 1973 and more recently has given assistance to the cost of various youth employment schemes.  I will be pressing in the discussions about the future of the fund for the introduction of more extensive aids bearing directly on employment and in particular on youth employment <Col N="903" /> so that our expanding programmes for young persons will continue to benefit to the maximum extent from aid from the fund.</P>
    <P>My programme for legislation relates to the promotion of new laws and to the amendment of existing laws.  This work will be carried out in full consultation with the ICTU and with representatives of employers.  I am not yet in a position to indicate finally all that I will be able to do but my programme will include the following:</P>
    <P>1.  I propose to implement the commitment of the Government in the 1980 National Understanding to promote legislation to reduce the statutory limits of working hours.  The broad aims of this legislation will be to reduce excessive overtime and create additional jobs.  The original commitment was for the introduction of this legislation during the first parliamentary session of 1981 for early enactment.  I am now taking up this commitment with a sense of urgency and intend to introduce appropriate legislation in the next session of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>2.  I propose to promote, as soon as the Bill can be prepared, laws for the protection of workers engaged in off-shore installations.  This legislation is long overdue and my intention is that it also will be introduced in the next session of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>3.  I propose to carry out a comprehensive review of the following social legislation with a view to setting to right some problems which have come to light in the course of their operation: Anti Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974; Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977; Unfair Dismissals Act 1977; and Employment Equality Act 1977.  This review will be put in hands immediately and I would propose to introduce amending legislation with as little delay as possible.</P>
    <P>4.  A substantial code of regulations in relation to dangerous substances is under examination.  My intention is to expedite the making of these regulations.  The Dangerous Substances Advisory <Col N="904" /> Council, which was set up recently, will have their role to play in this difficult area.</P>
    <P>5.  Within the next two years I will be introducing measures for the protection of workers in cases of insolvency of employers.  These will guarantee the payment of wages and related entitlements to workers in cases where the employers fail to meet their commitments due to insolvency or bankruptcy.  The measures will be in line with EEC laws and will bring Ireland into line with our fellow members in the EEC.</P>
    <P>6.  Perhaps the most significant non-pay item in the second national understanding for working women was the commitment to introduce a statutory scheme of paid maternity leave by April of this year.  I intend to complete that commitment by supplementing the provisions already on the Statute Book with two sets of regulations under the Maternity Protection of Employers Act, 1981. The first will safeguard the legal rights given to women under the Act by setting out how a case may be brought before the EAT where there is a dispute about entitlement.  To facilitate women having the necessary medical check-ups both before and after their baby is born, the second set of regulations will entitle them to take time off from work for the purposes of ante and post natal care.</P>
    <P>In the recent election women made clear their demands for more equal participation in all areas of Irish society.  This Government are responsive to the aspirations of women and intend to help them realise their ambitions.  In any event it is a waste of our national assets not to use fully in all areas of Irish society the intelligent contributions of women.</P>
    <P>The improvement of the status of women is high on my priority list for a campaign of action.  Therefore, since taking up the post of Minister for Labour I have looked critically at what can be done to achieve progress.</P>
    <P>Apart from the responsibility for women as workers, the Department of Labour have a co-ordinating role <i>vis-à-vis</i> other Departments on all aspects of women's rights.  The Commission Report on the Status of Women produced to <Col N="905" /> Government in May, 1973 has been the Bible of the women's movement.  It has been of inestimable value in setting out what needed to be done as a charter for Government.  In the decade since its production, much has been achieved.</P>
    <P>I intend to examine carefully what is left to be done and what I can do in co-operation with my colleagues in Government to complete the action indicated in the recommendations and suggestions in that report.  Excellent though this report is, it may not now reflect comprehensively the needs of women in Irish society in 1981 and a new charter may be necessary.  We have the basis for it here in the plan of action put forward by the United Nations at their conference in Copenhagen last summer.  It could be the basis for a national charter here.</P>
    <P>I intend to have consultations with the Council for the Status of Women, which is the largest grouping of women's organisations and all other interested bodies in order to set down clearly what the demands are at this time and frame a plan of action for Ireland.  I know that the council have already been deliberating this matter and I expect that we will have useful co-operation here.</P>
    <P>At that stage I intend to have consultations with my colleagues in Government who have special responsibility in areas where action is necessary on women's rights &mdash; family law, social welfare, health and education particularly.</P>
    <P>In regard to my area of special responsibility in the Department of Labour we have the legislative framework of equal pay legislation, equal opportunity in employment legislation and maternity leave legislation.  The procedures for redress are there through the services of the equality officers, the Labour Court, the Employment Equality Agency and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  It is my intention to look carefully at how the procedures for redress are working and how effectively the procedures have been affecting the aims of the legislation. Amendments to the legislation have been suggested by the Employment Equality Agency and the Labour Court and the equality officers and the amendment to the legislation is part of my programme <Col N="906" /> of new progressive legislation.  It is of particular concern to me that women should be fully aware of their rights under legislation and take the necessary steps to secure their rights.  In this the role of the Employment Equality Agency is very important.  It is my intention to ensure that the Employment Equality Agency will be given the necessary resources to carry out their mandate of working towards the elimination of discrimination in employment and promoting equality of opportunity in employment between men and women in every possible way. I will also ensure that the strength of the equality officer service is adequate to cope with the demands placed upon it.</P>
    <P>In a study of women in paid employment carried out in EEC countries it came to light that one in four know about the provisions of national law relevant to issues that concern them.  We must make sure that in Ireland all women are made fully aware of the details of legislation for equal pay and equal opportunity and that they are active in looking for their rights and using the procedures that have been laid down in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Women themselves have a big part to play in speeding up the programme of eliminating discrimination by working through their trade unions and voluntary organisations and co-operating with the Employment Equality Agency.  Indeed, women should be deeply involved in trade union affairs, not alone on women's affairs but on all issues important to workers.</P>
    <P>One of the major contributing factors to the appalling rise in the budget deficit in recent years has been the spiralling increase in the Exchequer pay and pensions bill.  As Deputies are aware, the bill grew by 24.8 per cent in 1979, 33.5 per cent in 1980 and on the evidence available it was set to grow by a further 25 per cent this year.  A major part of the growth is caused by the level of special pay increases &mdash; over the two year period 1979-80 they actually cost more than general increases under the national understanding pay agreements.  It is quite impossible, in the present state of the country's finances, to allow that spiral to continue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> In the January budget, the then Minister for Finance set aside £80 million to cover the cost of improvements in pay and pensions.  He went on to appeal for restraint in the pursuit of claims for special increases.  There has been no sign of that restraint.  The cost of special increases to which the Government are committed in the public sector is already well in excess of that £80 million which the former Minister provided &mdash; and the year is only half over.</P>
    <P>The flood of special claims shows no sign of abating and indeed some groups who have received special increases within the past two years are already coming back for more.  Many of those who benefited under these claims, and indeed most of the spokesmen who presented the claims, are aware that the kind of pay inflation which we have seen over the past few years cannot be sustained. Normally sensible people who conduct their personal finances in a prudent manner appear to ignore the damage which their actions on the pay front are causing to the community at large.</P>
    <P>This, in my view, is the crux of the matter.  Because of the extent to which borrowing was resorted to by the last administration to finance the budget deficit, thus postponing the day of reckoning, public servants, and indeed the community at large, appear to have lost sight of the fact that &ldquo;special&rdquo; pay increases have to be paid for.  A special pay increase for the public service means a tax or price increase for everyone in the community including those who are least able to bear it.  The longer the tax or price increase is delayed the more severe is the final impact.  If the consequences of &ldquo;special&rdquo; pay increases in terms of increased taxation or charges had been more immediate and more clearly appreciated, the rate of increase might have been slower and less damaging.</P>
    <P>One of the most difficult problems this Government face is to try to bring people both in the public and private sectors to a realisation of the hard and unpalatable facts which face us as a community.  We will not be deflected from this task.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the point where <Col N="908" /> further resort to borrowing would be disastrous and where we must meet cost increases out of revenue.  The Minister for Finance has outlined the manner in which this will be done.  He has made it clear that the Government will honour special increases already sanctioned and firm offers or formal commitments which have already been made and that they are anxious to accept, if at all possible, findings in cases currently before the Labour Court, an arbitration board or a review body.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the figures he gave yesterday that there is simply no money available to meet any other claims and the Government has no option but to ask public sector employers to invoke clause 6 of the agreement on pay policy.  It is the Government's desire that immediate negotiations should take place with unions representing public servants with a view to agreeing an alternative arrangement which will take account of the community's inability to find the resources to meet further special increases without risk to jobs and the viability of the economy.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am anxious to discuss with public sector unions the general question of the present method of determining public sector pay, and in particular whether existing arrangements for conciliation and arbitration should be modified or supplemented.  I hope that all the parties to these discussions will approach the task in a constructive manner and, in particular, with an appreciation of the fact that we must ensure that the arrangements for settling pay in the public sector take full account of the resources available to the community and the necessity to protect existing employment and to create new employment.</P>
    <P>I re-echo the remarks of the Minister for Finance when he adverted to the problems being created by the loss of competitiveness in the Irish economy generally.  As he said, we must find a way, as a community, of bringing our aspirations and demands in the area of incomes &mdash; both in the public and in the private sectors &mdash; into line with the international value of what we produce.  I have no doubt that the vast majority of Irish <Col N="909" /> workers would accept that objective as being fair, reasonable and indeed essential in the interest of preserving their own jobs and creating new jobs for our expanding population.</P>
    <P>As set out in the Programme for Government 1981 to 1986, the determination of money incomes is of critical importance to the rate of inflation, through its impact on the competitiveness of the economy, job creation and the structure of public finances.  This process will, we hope, be founded on free, collective wage bargaining.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and I had meetings on 20 July with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and with the Federated Union of Employers and the Confederation of Irish Industry at which, amongst other issues, the provisions relating to incomes policy in the joint programme were discussed.  These provisions envisage, as the Minister for Finance said in his budget statement, a new approach to central wage bargaining with the aim of reducing inflation.  It is intended that further meetings with the social partners will be held in the near future to consider the matter in greater detail.</P>
    <P>I hope that everyone will accept that, in the interest of the community at large and, particularly, the young and the unemployed, the Government's programme is the most realistic way in which to solve the problem of wage inflation both in public and private sectors.  If we do not solve the problem of wage inflation then we will not be able to solve our appalling employment problems and the outlook for the future will be very bleak indeed.</P>
    <P>All our efforts to grapple with the problem of inflation can be put at risk if unions refuse to abide by agreed procedures for resolving disputes and embark instead on industrial action whether in the form of full scale strike or in more limited forms.  Such action is all the more indefensible when the groups concerned are in secure employment and have agreed machinery readily available to them for resolving disputes in a peaceful fashion.</P>
    <P>The need to insist on a responsible <Col N="910" /> approach to industrial relations by public service unions is being highlighted at present by the industrial action being taken by clerical staff in the civil service which is disrupting social welfare payments and the examination results.  This action is a clear breach of the national understanding and the agreed negotiating procedures and seems to reflect a belief by some of those concerned that militant action is the most effective means of achieving increases over and above the standard increases in the national understanding.  This approach, which would make the public the pawns in ongoing struggles for better pay and conditions in the public service, must and will be resisted.</P>
    <P>I have made my position in relation to the present industrial action quite clear on a number of occasions.  I regard it as unreasonable and unnecessary because very fair offers over and above the standard national understanding increases have been made, aimed at bringing these groups into line with other comparable categories; the offers would cost up to £8 million a year, a very substantial figure particularly in present circumstances and, finally, the action is inflicting on less well-protected sections of our society inconvenience and hardship which are completely out of proportion to the matters at issue with the association concerned, the Civil and Public Services Staff Association.</P>
    <P>One point I am particularly adamant about is that I will not engage in direct negotiations.  I would regard that as a disastrous move from the point of view of civil service industrial relations generally. All negotiations will have to take place within agreed procedures.  The association presented their claims under agreed procedures and there have been negotiations on the claims on that basis. The avenue open to the association is to complete these negotiations and if they are still dissatisfied with the response on all or any of their claims let them have the outstanding issues put to arbitration. Meanwhile the staff should call off their industrial action which is hitting at some who in terms of employment and income are far worse off than they are.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> As the Minister for Finance mentioned in his Financial Statement, the numbers employed in the public sector in its widest sense have now topped the 300,000 mark &mdash; the highest figure since the establishment of the State.  Over 30,000 included in this figure were added in the four years from 1 January 1977 to 2 January 1981.</P>
    <P>The figure of 300,000 is very large in relation to the total working population and the rate of increase in recent years gives rise to concern at the growing numbers whose pay must be met directly or indirectly from public funds.  In addition to paying for the civil service, the Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána and those in the educational area, the Exchequer also bears the cost of the staffs of health boards and, effectively, of the staffs of voluntary hospitals.  The Exchequer also carries the cost of the staffs of the non-commercial State-sponsored bodies and bears the greater part of the cost of the pay of local authority employees. To the extent that the commercial State bodies are not viable entities either because they have to be subvented directly from the Exchequer or are indirectly subvented because, for example, they enjoy a monopoly or a near-monopoly position, the pay or part of the pay of their staffs also represents an unavoidable charge on the public.  The Government believe that this unchecked expansion of public sector employment cannot continue and they have, therefore, decided to stabilise numbers at the levels employed on 21 July 1981.  There is one major and minor exception to this decision.</P>
    <P>The first exception relates to new productive and self-financing employment which can be undertaken in the public sector.  I have always believed that, with the talents and skills available, there is no reason why the public sector should not be able to undertake, with success, the production of goods and services complementing or in competition with the private sector on a commercial basis. I would envisage, however, that the commercial criteria to be applied to State enterprise would be as strict as those applying in the private sector.  With this <Col N="912" /> end in view, the Programme for Government 1981-86, makes provision for the role of State enterprise in economic growth.  Resulting productive employment where the cost of additional staff is recovered from charges made to the public for the additional goods or services they provide will be exempted from the limitation on numbers in the public sector.</P>
    <P>The second exception is a limited provision related to staff for whom the recruitment process has reached an advanced stage and is a transitional arrangement to meet problems which might otherwise arise.</P>
    <P>These measures will be applied across the whole public sector by the Ministers responsible.  To explain its operation, I might describe its application to the civil service, for which I am directly responsible. At the latest count, there were some 57,000 people employed in the non-industrial civil service.  Having examined the position, I am satisfied that this number should be adequate to discharge the tasks required by Government for the foreseeable future.  This, of course, does not mean that the number in each section in each department will remain unchanged.  Public needs change rapidly and, indeed, the new and expanded services which this Government intend to provide will require staff for their administration.  This staff can and will be provided within overall total numbers.  In the first place, as new schemes and programmes are required, examination of existing services will reveal areas where the need for some services has ceased.  Secondly, given the large increase in numbers in recent years, I have no doubt that, by more efficient administration, most areas of the civil service can yield economies in staff who will be redeployed to provide the needed new services.  The management services staff in my Department and in the organisation units of other Departments will be charged with securing the economies necessary.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these arrangements will not lead to any undue burdens being placed on the staffs of Departments and <Col N="913" /> that by maintaining staffing at existing levels the service to the public will continue to be at a high level of efficiency.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I should mention that the Department of the Public Service are well advanced in a programme of radical improvement of the public service to make them more responsive to public needs, more cost-effective and more efficient. A very important part of that programme is the development of good systems to ensure that Government plans are carried through into departmental policies and priorities and that the money spent by Departments and State-sponsored bodies is spent with economy and to greatest effect.  I entirely agree with the comments of the Public Service Advisory Council in their seventh report on the importance of systems of that kind.  I need hardly say that any programme which results in worthwhile economies in the current critical budgetary situation will have the wholehearted backing of the Government and I am confident that my Department will have the full co-operation of the civil service as a whole and of their staff unions in the task I have mentioned.  In spite of the size of the problem, we are not seeking to cut back on numbers as would have resulted from a more drastic approach to the situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>I would stress that this approach to our problems will enable employment opportunities for school leavers and others to continue as vacancies arise.  While the precise numbers vary from year to year, recent trends show that about 3,000 people leave the civil service each year for various reasons &mdash; mainly retirement on reaching the retiring age.  Applying this figure to the public sector as a whole, we can expect some 15,000 job opportunities to arise each year.  This is a very considerable figure and, as the Government proceed to put the economy in order and to develop the other measures in their programme related to employment, I have no doubt that we will have laid a firm foundation for national development based on the creation of productive and sustainable employment.</P>
    <P>These measures are taken with the objective of safeguarding our economy <Col N="914" /> and the well-being of our people.  In the remainder of this year, there should be a saving of some £6 million in the provisions made for additional posts in the civil service in 1981 and the application of the measures to other areas of the public service should substantially increase this figure.  For the future, the limit on public service numbers should ensure that the process through which an increasing proportion of our national increase is spent on public administration will have been halted.  As the totality of the measures we are now taking begins to take effect, there should be an increasing increment of public funds available for productive employment leading to greater national wealth in which all, including the less privileged who must depend on the social services, can equitably share.  I should like to deal at length with this problem but I have not sufficient time.</P>
    <P>The two Departments for which I have been given responsibility present a daunting challenge.  With the co-operation of the social partners and the public as a whole, I believe I will be able, through the programme put forward by the Government, to ensure that the problems that exist, particularly in the area of industrial relations, are minimised in the coming year.  I know I can count on the co-operation of many people providing they are satisfied that the actions of the Government are fair and equitable in all areas. In the months to come I will have a full legislative programme from my Departments to put before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not realise that my successor in the Department of Labour, Deputy Kavanagh, would be speaking before me in this debate.  Secondly, I did not know he would have a script.  If I had known that I would have asked for a copy because there are many matters in it to which I should have liked to refer before I make my speech on the budget.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  Even though we belong to different parties we have served our country for a number of years in the European Parliament.  Though we may have differed in our national political <Col N="915" /> views we had one thing in common, namely, we were working for our country. At the time of the European elections we were contestants on different sides. The Minister was successful candidate but I was not successful in that election. I became Minister for Labour and now Deputy Kavanagh has that portfolio.  I would like to offer him my best wishes and congratulations.  The Minister said in his speech and I agree with him:</P>
      <P>It will be my policy not to intervene directly in the issues in disputes.  It should not be any part of the job of a Minister for Labour to tell employers or workers how much should be paid for any particular job.  These are matters for employers and unions to agree and, failing that, to avail of the various dispute settling machinery which is available.</P>
      <P>That is also the policy of Fianna Fáil.  It was my policy when I was Minister for Labour and it was the policy of Deputy Gene Fitzgerald who was my predecessor. Later, the Minister said that two Ministers had intervened in the oil tanker drivers dispute and he said they had prolonged it.  There was a similar dispute at that time at the sugar factory at Carlow. The tanker drivers dispute had been going on for two years and as a result the country was being brought to a standstill. Industry, private motorists, indeed all the people depend on oil, and the country was in danger.  The Labour Court had asked both parties to get together but one of them refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Government or Minister for Labour could not stand aside in a situation like that.  Incidentially, we did not intervene as between employers and unions on the question of the wage increase that should be given.  We met each party separately in an effort to get talks going.  To show how difficult the situation was, it took 75 meetings in a period of five days to get the parties to agree to sit down and talk.  In that connection I wish to record my sincere thanks to the Labour Court for the speed with which they got to work.  I should like to thank both parties involved in that dispute and to record my sincere thanks <Col N="916" /> to the ITGWU for arranging a ballot throughout the country of the 800 drivers. All that was done in 72 hours.  I trust the Minister was not insinuating that we were wrong on that occasion.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to be leaving the House.  If he is walking down O'Connell Street this evening and if he asks those he meets if they are satisfied with the manner in which he is handling the bus dispute, he will find they will say that they are not.  As the Minister was quoted in the press, I did not expect him to rush in with a fire brigade intervention.  I do not think anybody expected the Minister to do that, but the Minister cannot stand idly by and see workers walking to their work and old age pensioners trying to get about.  He should be seen to be active. He is not coming well out of this situation.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to paid maternity leave.  I will take credit for that, and so can the Fianna Fáil Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been the first time in the history of the State that we had a mini-budget and a maxi-budget on the one day.  We will call it a budget of 21 July 1981, and we are looking forward to the budget of September.  The taxes on cigarettes, petrol, beer and spirits were effective today but on 1 September we are to have the 5 per cent increase in VAT which in a full year will bring in £188 million.  In my reckoning that means £3.5 million per week, or £1 per week for every citizen of the State.  When we get to next October, according to an economist writing in today's paper, a man, wife and two children who have a standard car will be paying £9.50 per week more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an interesting figure juxtaposed <Col N="917" /> with the election campaign promise of Fine Gael of £9.60 per week to housewives, just 10p more than what the family I instanced earlier will be paying out next October.  I have yet to learn how that £9.60 is supposed to operate.  I read a statement that if a man is paying £500 a year income tax this promise will refund that £500 to the wife at home.  A married man with five or six children would have to earn £8,500 a year before the wife would qualify for the £9.60, but the wife of a small farmer or a small shopkeeper earning less than £8,000 would not qualify.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister for Agriculture will be the next speaker.  I should like him to tell me who will qualify next April for this £9.60.  Will all women who work at home qualify, and if not, why not?  Is a small farmer's wife not as much entitled to benefit as the wife of somebody earning £40,000 a year?  The manifesto says that the wife of somebody earning £20,000 or £40,000 will get the £9.60 by way of a refund or £500 of the income tax payable by her husband.  That is my interpretation of it.  Unless the husband is paying £500 per year in income tax his wife will not qualify.  If this scheme is introduced and those are the conditions, Deputies from Donegal, Dublin, Kildare and Mayo will be asking questions about a man paying £350 in income tax whose wife is not getting the £9.60.  They will want to know why not.  This should be explained to the public and to the House.</P>
    <P>From the statement made yesterday by the Minister for Finance one would think that we never had a budget deficit until Fianna Fáil took office four years ago. However, I must compliment the Minister for Finance.  He said:</P>
    <P>We have had a budget deficit in every year since 1972 and the public debt has grown enormously.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition said today that in 1975, about mid-term of the last Coalition Government, as a percentage of GNP, we had the highest budget deficit ever since the State was founded.  It is no harm to put that on the record.  Listening to people on television and radio and <Col N="918" /> reading the press for the past few weeks in the build-up to this massive and brutal budget we had yesterday, one would get the impression that this was the first time the State ever had a budget deficit.</P>
    <P>It was stated in this debate yesterday that in our budget we increased the price of spirits, cigarettes and petrol more than they were increased in yesterday's budget.  If we did, we used quite a lot of that money to pay for aids for farmers, to reduce income tax by £60 million, and to give £111 million to the most sensitive area, that is, to social welfare beneficiaries. We gave an increase of 25 per cent to social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>In yesterday's budget the Minister for Finance gave an increase of 5 per cent to pensioners over 66 years of age, and an increase of 3 per cent to others.  After he read his budget statement he issued a blue document showing the main features of the budget.  I see in that document that the dependent children of a blind pensioner will get an increase of 5p per week.</P>
    <P>Prices are going up today and the price of petrol and oil will go up in a few days. The increase in VAT takes effect on 1 September.  The children of a blind pensioner will not get this massive increase of 5p per week until October.</P>
    <P>This is fantastic coming from Fine Gael.  Maybe the shilling affects Fine Gael because once in this House a Fine Gael Minister reduced the old age pension by one shilling, 12 old pence.  This fantastic increase was sold well on television. I looked at the 9 o'clock news last night and we were told that the only people who will gain are the social welfare beneficiaries.  I do not want to go into the details but most social welfare beneficiaries will get around 75p or 40p or 30p.  When we are talking about millions of pounds it is an insult to a blind person with a family to offer an increase of 5p per week.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>Also, the terms of the disadvantaged areas scheme are being modified slightly....</P>
    <P>Probably the Minister for Agriculture has not held office long enough for him to realise that there is an outcry in Laois, <Col N="919" /> Carlow and Kilkenny to have those areas declared disadvantaged areas.  The Minister said the terms of the disadvantaged areas scheme are being modified.  My interpretation of that is that there must be no intention to extend them.  I sincerely hope the Minister for Agriculture will ensure that those areas are declared disadvantaged areas.  We have them in east Carlow, along the Wexford-Carlow border, along the slopes of the Black-stairs Mountains, Mount Leinster, right up along Laois, the Kilkenny border and the Castlecomer area.  I am satisfied that these areas are as backward &mdash; with due respect to Deputy Gallagher who has just left the Chair &mdash; as some of the areas in Mayo and Roscommon which have been declared disadvantaged areas.  When the Minister is replying I hope he will remember I am not just saying this.  I am quoting from the statement made yesterday by his colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>In the health area, hospital and prescription costs will be borne to a greater extent than heretofore by those users who are able to pay for them.</P>
    <P>There is no definition of who is able to pay.  As public representatives we know of many people who should be entitled to medical cards but who do not have them. There is something implied in it and perhaps it is a reduction in the financial qualification.</P>
    <P>It is stated:</P>
    <P>Appropriate changes will be made from 1 August in the terms of the drug refund scheme administered by the health boards and in hospital charges.</P>
    <P>Substantial savings will also be achieved by the Departments of Justice, the Environment, Education, Defence and others.</P>
    <P>If there are substantial savings in the Department of Justice one does not recruit more gardaí.  No one will deny that in the present climate we need to improve our security forces.  As far as I can see in order to have substantial savings in this Department one would have to cut down on the recruitment of gardaí as this is where the big expenditure is.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> In the Department of the Environment £30 million was provided for housing. This Department caters for sanitary services, roads and housing.  We must have proper roads if we are to expand industrially. As there is a 15 per cent increase in traffic on our roads there is need for by-passes, bridges, the improvement of arterial roads and so on.  If water and sewerage are not provided houses cannot be built.  If there are substantial savings in this Department over the next six months then roads and sanitary services must suffer.</P>
    <P>Who will suffer under the Department of Education if substantial savings are implemented?  Students.  The Minister for Education announced that there would be increases in grants amounting to £2.6 million but we see in today's papers that university fees have gone up so that students will be no better off.  If there are substantial savings what will they do?  Get rid of teachers, not provide necessary schools, not provide extensions to schools, equipment, cutback the bus service and so on.</P>
    <P>We need our Army to come to our defence and I congratulate them on the wonderful work they have done in the Lebanon and at home in aid of the civil power.  If there are to be substantial savings in this Department it means that as members of the Army retire they will not be replaced.  If that is not the case, equipment will not be updated.  If there are to be savings one must cut out something. I am sorry that the Minister did not define &ldquo;others&rdquo;.  Possibly he did not like to mention agriculture.  Perhaps there will be some savings there but God help the Minister if there are when the IFA get after him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be savings.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister spends more we will fully support him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I would not be in favour of less spending on agriculture.  It is our basic industry.  A lot of employment <Col N="921" /> in Carlow depends on agriculture. If we give aid to farmers to produce more we will have factories to process what they produce.</P>
      <P>The Minister met a deputation of workers from Erin Foods recently.  I was very concerned when I saw a reference to a cutback in the capital monies to semi-State bodies.  We spoke about £70 million but the amount that would be required now is far higher.  As far as I can recall the Government will give them only an extra £12 million.  On 21 May 1981 the board of the Irish Sugar Company decided to submit to the Minister their capital requirements.  The Minister informed us that it had not yet come before the Government but I am sure the Minister is aware there is need for a major capital injection into the Sugar Company.  They need new equipment and so on.  I do not know the exact figure but it is in excess of £12 million.  Perhaps I will find a fourth budget before I am finished.</P>
      <P>It is also stated that &ldquo;the Minister for the Environment is studying the possibilities of enabling local authorities to gain access to new sources of revenue, other than rates&rdquo;.  The sources of revenue open to them at present are the money they get from the Central Fund and the rates they get from businesses and farmers.  A new form of local taxation is to be introduced as nothing else can be interpreted from this.  That is another budget as far as I am concerned.</P>
      <P>Further on it is stated that:</P>
      <P>This imbalance in the economy must be corrected and the Government have, therefore, decided that the numbers employed in the public sector will not be allowed to exceed the numbers employed on 21 July 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If anyone running a business introduces new schemes it means extra work and personnel.  Nobody running a department or public service can say: &ldquo;I will have the same work force but will do far more work&rdquo;.  Take the example of £9.60 being paid to stay at home wives.  When that comes into force there will be 280,000 applications or thereabouts coming in to the Minister.  They will have to <Col N="922" /> be processed.  I could not even guess at the number of staff that will be required in the Department of Social Welfare to deal with the applications nor have I any idea how many extra staff the Revenue Commissioners will require to answer queries from the Department of Social Welfare to know if Johnny Murphy paid £500 in income tax because they have an application from his wife.  How can the Minister expect to reduce staff and at the same time impose extra work on that staff?</P>
    <P>We are told that certain changes are to be made in the Farm Modernisation Scheme so as to bring about savings.  Surely this means that somebody will suffer in the process.  However, the Minister for Agriculture may explain later how these savings are to be made.  We are told, too, that an additional £12 million will be provided to meet the demands from the semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>As a former Minister for Labour I naturally welcome the setting up of the Youth Employment Agency.  Already there are four special schemes in this sphere.  These are the community youth training programme, the temporary grant scheme for youth employment, the environmental improvement scheme programme and the work experience programme. Two of those programmes were the direct responsibility of the Department of Labour while one is operated by AnCO and the other by the Department of Education.  I hope that this Youth Employment Agency will co-ordinate the efforts of all these other youth employment schemes, which are working excellently.</P>
    <P>The number of young people who participated in the Community Youth Training Programme in 1980 was 2,071, while 11,000 young people participated in the work experience programme.  Last year alone 7,258 young people took part in that scheme.  What is more gratifying is that, of all those who participated in these various programmes, between 80 and 85 per cent obtained jobs.</P>
    <P>During the coming recess of the Dáil we can be confident of having many little budgets, but we shall not have the opportunity <Col N="923" /> of debating them here at the time. However, we can be assured of being in for a rough time.  I believe the economists when they say that the cost of this budget, when the various provisions have been implemented will be £9.50 per week in respect of the average household of a man, his wife and two children and where a standard car is in use.  In these circumstances I urge the Minister to give to housewives as soon as possible the £9.60 per week that they have been promised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was my intention to deal mainly with the agricultural aspects of the budget but I shall reply also to some of the points raised by Deputy Nolan.  At the outset, though, I should like to express the great sense of privilege I am experiencing by being in the position of making my first speech to this House from the front benches on the Government side.  I look forward to being in this position for some time and to discharging my duties in this office in the manner in which such duties have been discharged by all previous holders of the office.</P>

      <P>The Minister was not here when I was extending congratulations to the Minister for Labour.  I now extend to the Minister for Agriculture my congratulations on his appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy. Regarding the issues that have been raised by Deputy Nolan, there is one point I would make in particular and this relates to the way in which this budget has been framed.  The Deputy made reference to a number of measures in the budget which were foreseen.  These are measures which are designed to reduce the current budget deficit and measures which are designed in so far as possible to reduce the weight of public finances and of uneconomic activity.  In all of those measures we find reasons for criticism or for regret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Nolan seemed to be totally unprepared to deal with the problem of choosing between different ways of using available resources, but that is one of the main duties of Government and it was one of our main concerns in recent weeks <Col N="924" /> in examining public finances.  The first problem was to bring public expenditure under control so that we could use tax-payers' money in a way designed deliberately to achieve certain ends and not in a way which would simply mean that expenditure on given schemes or operations would run out of control.  We are not necessarily of the view which Deputy Nolan seems to hold that more expenditure always means better expenditure. There is the problem of choice and there is the problem of the total availability of public finance.  Those are the problems to which we have been applying ourselves in considering those areas of expenditure in which cuts could be effected.</P>
    <P>We have been concerned in making reductions in the forecast levels of expenditure but in ways which would not hinder the effectiveness of various public programmes and which would assure us that we would get better value for the moneys which would continue to be spent.  That is a simple point which must be taken into account.  It is regrettable that it was not taken more seriously by the previous administration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nolan raised also the question of our discussions some days ago with a deputation from the Irish Sugar Company workers.  At this point I do not wish to anticipate the Government's decision in that regard.  As the Deputy has pointed out, the company have submitted a plan to me.  I will be submitting that plan to the Government together with a number of recommendations and observations and until all of this has been considered it would not be proper for me to speculate on or to examine the matter further in this House.</P>
    <P>On the matter of interpretation, Deputy Nolan has been referring to selected parts of the Budget Statement and also to selected parts of this party's election programme.  Without necessarily agreeing, I can understand that the Deputy might find it difficult to interpret some point or other, especially if the interpretation did not seem to provide the answer that he would like to get.  I am bound to say to Deputy Nolan that his interpretations in some cases are highly imaginative and not at all in line either with what is <Col N="925" /> written in the programme in question or with the explanations that I and my colleagues gave during the election campaign.</P>
    <P>A deeper discussion of the question of the £9.60 per week for the housewives who stay at home would be in anticipation of next year's budget and perhaps this is not the point to go in detail into what we proposed.  It has been explained very frequently during the election campaign and I am sure Deputy Nolan was in a position frequently to hear the explanation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Put it in the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure also that he was in a position to hear in some detail the explanations that were given of the passages concerning that measure which figure in the Government's joint programme. Therefore, it would not be entirely wise, given the subject of our present debate, to devote any more time in the House tonight to that matter.  Deputy Nolan can be assured that we will be getting back to it and we will have the opportunity of putting his mind at ease as to the interpretations that are to be put.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Nolan asked about changes in the Farm Modernisation Scheme, which I will deal with in a few moments.  He also raised the question of staffing levels in the civil service and the relationship between what was said in the statement of the Minister for Finance on the question of staffing levels and of providing new schemes or improving existing schemes.  It is not necessarily the case that if you want to do something new or extra you must inevitably hire more staff. It is, first of all, a question of increasing productivity; secondly, there is the question of carrying out given tasks more efficiently; and, thirdly, there is the matter of putting an end to some activities which have outlived their usefulness.  All of these are ways of carrying out different works without necessarily having to <Col N="926" /> increase the total number of people involved.  I am sure the Deputy has met situations like that before and will not be too surprised to find that such can be met in the public service.</P>
      <P>Coming back to the agricultural aspects of this budget, the Government here are commencing the implementation of those items in the Government programme which deal with the problems we face in the agricultural sector, and our budget proposals deal with those problems on three fronts.  The first point I would make relates to yesterday's agreement in the Council of Ministers which provided further funds for the Western Drainage Scheme, which is currently in operation, and also set up a system of EEC aids to give interest subsidies to farmers who now have development plans under the Farm Modernisation Scheme.</P>
      <P>The second point is that, as I have mentioned briefly, the budget deals with the problem of getting our public finances into order so that Government action can be aimed consciously at dealing with the real problems that face us in an orderly way, and so that we can make a start on getting at the real roots of inflation, which is one of the main problems facing agriculture, as also is the case with all other industries in this country.  However, the effect on agriculture in recent years has been exacerbated by the fact that we have not had in the last couple of years the same overall rate of price increase that we had been used to in the earlier part of the seventies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third leg of our approach to the agriculture problems facing us at the moment is that the budget and its associated measures provide extra funds for a number of operations we propose to carry out in relation to agriculture.  We also re-arrange the use of expenditure already provided for in order to concentrate the resources in those areas where they will have the most immediate impact on the level of agricultural production. The picking and definition of measures that can have a rapid impact on the level of agricultural production is a matter of primary importance for us because we now have a situation where, given the <Col N="927" /> decline in our breeding herd and in the rate of certain key inputs in recent years, the prospects for increasing the volume of agricultural production have been jeopardised for some time to come and our main aim is to deal as quickly as we can with that situation and to overcome it.</P>
    <P>I will deal in detail first with the EEC measures which were agreed yesterday. I preface my remarks by saying immediately that these two measures agreed yesterday &mdash; that is a further extension and increase in the amount of funds available for the Western Drainage Scheme and the provision for a Community scheme of interest subsidies to farmers with development programmes &mdash; were given a political commitment by the Council of Ministers of the Community at the last fixing of farm prices last April.  I am happy that we have now secured a fulfilment of that commitment in the shape of those two measures.</P>
    <P>The drainage measure is in two parts. The first part of that is an increase in the amount of moneys available for arterial drainage in the west of Ireland in the catchment areas of three rivers which will allow us to carry out the work on these three rivers, as has been provided for in the original plan.  An extra £20 million has been provided over a period of five years to carry out that work.  Involved here was an increased allocation of funds to deal with the fact that the cost of the work which had been planned back in 1977 has increased substantially in the meantime and it was evident that it would no longer be possible to carry out all that was planned within the financial provisions that had been made in 1978.</P>
    <P>The second part of the drainage agreement which we got yesterday was an increase of 50,000 hectares, or 125,000 acres roughly, in the area which would qualify for field drainage under the scheme.  The scheme previously in operation had provided for aids for field drainage for 100,000 hectares.  Roughly that area is now covered by schemes approved and it seemed desirable that we should increase the total area covered by that scheme.  We got agreement on that yesterday so that we can look forward to <Col N="928" /> further progress in the total drainage programme in the west.  The importance of this, as the Deputies will know, is that drainage operations of this kind have a very substantial and immediate effect on the productive capacity of land.  There-fore, I am very happy that we have managed to get agreement on these extra measures because that will make a very rapid difference to the productive capacity of land in the western areas and, there-fore, to the income possibilities of farmers in that area.</P>
    <P>The second measure on which we got agreement in the Council of Ministers yesterday is a scheme of interest subsidies for farmers who have development plans under the Farm Modernisation Scheme, that is, for developing farmers as they are defined under Directive 159.  This is a very timely measure.  As Deputies know, we have a very serious situation on many farms, where farmers who are operating farm plans, whether they be development plans in the sense of the directive or their own plans in the case of commercial farmers, have run into trouble with the level of their financial commitments as a result of very rapid and substantial increases in interest rates over the planned period.  I am sure Deputies understand quite easily that a farm plan which is costed out on the basis of a 12 per cent interest rate quickly becomes uneconomic or unprofitable when the interest rate increases to 18 per cent, 19 per cent, or even more in some cases.</P>
    <P>We, therefore, decided that we should look at means of alleviating the burden of interest on farmers involved in farm planning.  As part of the commitment given at the last EEC price fixing session, which I referred to a few moments ago, the Commission agreed to put forward a proposal on interest subsidies for developing farmers.  That was agreed yesterday. That provides for a further 5 per cent interest subsidy available to developing farmers, both in relation to outstanding loans on existing farm plans and for new loans incurred on the basis of farm plans for a two-year period.  The European Community will fund the cost of that measure in part.  Fifty per cent of the cost of that subsidy will be met by the <Col N="929" /> Community in relation to subsidies for farms in the disadvantaged areas and 25 per cent of the cost of the subsidy will be met by Community funds again in relation to subsidies given to farms outside the disadvantaged areas.  I recognise that there is one difference between that final result and the proposal as it was put forward by the Commission, the difference being that the original proposal envisaged that a 50 per cent rate of Community participation would be made available in respect of the subsidy on loans outstanding on farms outside the disadvantaged areas also.  That proved to be a major point of difficulty in the discussions and, taking all the circumstances into account, it seemed prudent to withdraw a little on that aspect of the scheme in order not to jeopardise our chances of securing agreement on the scheme now.</P>
    <P>I had two reasons for doing that.  One was the fact that we need this scheme fairly rapidly for the people concerned and, secondly, I did wish to have some finality on the Community scheme because, as Deputies will know from the Government programme, we propose also to operate a similar scheme for farmers other than those in the development category.  We could not proceed with the definition of the national level scheme without having very clear agreement on what was going to be the content of the EEC scheme.  Those are the two EEC measures, the first of our three-pronged approach to the problem which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The second part of our approach is to try to deal with the effects of inflation on the cost of farm inputs.  One of the main problems faced by farmers in the last two or three years is the fact that we have had a rapid rate of increase in farm input costs, a rate which has not been matched by the rate of increase in farm prices.  It is a period during which the effects of inflation on farming have become even more acute than they were previously. That is something which the agricultural sector shares with the exposed sectors of the economy generally.  It is a problem which is addressed by the anti-inflation programme set out in our programme for Government which aims, among other <Col N="930" /> things, at securing a situation in which cost increases in our economy generally are related more closely to what the exposed sectors can bear, than has been the case up to now.  It is very clear from the experience of the past few years that, if the exposed sectors of our economy, including agriculture, have to bear the same kind of rate of cost increases as we have in the sheltered sectors of the economy, they are in serious danger of losing their capacity to compete, not only in export markets but also with products which we import and which compete with products produced at home.  For that reason and as far as agriculture is concerned, it is of primary importance that we get the rate of cost increase under control because, without that, we will find it much more difficult to get the kind of increase in farm output which we need, not only to increase farm incomes which would be our primary objective, but also to protect the jobs of those working in our food processing industries and other industries related to agriculture and to have any hope of increasing employment in these sectors.</P>
    <P>The third part of our approach is composed of the specific measures proposed in this budget in relation to agriculture. I preface my remarks by giving a brief run-down on what the expenditure side of our proposals is comprised of.  The original Estimate for the Department of Agriculture for this year came in net terms to more or less £170 million.  This House quite recently passed a Supplementary Estimate for £35 million and, based on our examination of the situation in the Department in the various schemes we are running, it seems we will need a further £30 million or so before the end of this year to keep going with the schemes that are there.  This is a clear case where the original Estimate and the Supplementary Estimate, both prepared before this Government came into office, were inadequate to run for the full year the full range of policies in operation at the time of the change over.</P>
    <P>I know there are difficulties in relation to agricultural expenditure in that a great many of the schemes run by the Department of Agriculture are open-ended.  It <Col N="931" /> is extremely difficult to say at the beginning of a year how much they are going to cost.  One can never accurately predict what the uptake of the various schemes is going to be.  In a number of cases, for example, the livestock headage payments under the disadvantaged area scheme and the farm modernisation scheme, the original provision was inadequate and we have to provide extra finance in order to keep those schemes working at the level which is demanded by the farming community. We have also made provision for new measures which are included in the Government programme, including the cost to the National Exchequer of running schemes in which there is an element of EEC finance.  In approaching expenditure generally, we take the view that it is necessary, not only to look at the needs of agriculture and the various schemes which we have running, but also to try to keep expenditure within the limits dictated by the economic situation.  We have, therefore, carried out a very careful appraisal of expenditure and resources and we have tried to concentrate expenditure in those areas which have the most direct impact on production.</P>
    <P>Another factor which we have to bear in mind is that some constraints arise from EEC membership, in that there are a number of cases in which proposals which we put forward must be notified to the Community authorities.  We cannot simply go ahead regardless until we have secured agreement or, at least, lack of objection on the part of the Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>When did the Minister find that out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This was pointed out in our programme which was published before the election and which, I am sure, Deputy MacSharry had the opportunity of reading on a few occasions during the election period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out, also, that the question which I have just raised, that of national aid, is a rather important one for this country.  It was raised yesterday by the current Council presidency, that is, the UK Minister, but there is a wider point here for us which is that, as an <Col N="932" /> exporting country, we need the gurantee that Community markets will remain open for our products.  We, therefore, need the guarantee that the rules of the Common Market are applied fairly strictly.  I am aware that one often hears people talking about the facility which other member States seem to have in breaking EEC rules and that if they can do it, why can we not?  That is a very understandable point of view and one with which there could be a great deal of sympathy from time to time.  On the other hand, if we acquiesce in flagrant breaches of the rules, or are seen ourselves to be one of the member States which plays fast and loose with the rules, we have more to lose than the larger member States.  Given the state of our public finances and the size of our economy, we cannot afford to compete with much richer economies as to how much national aid we can give to various products. I make the point because it is one of the considerations which we must have in mind in our approach to agricultural expenditure and one which, as I say, we pointed out in our pre-election programme and, indeed, in the Government programme.</P>
    <P>One of the specific measures for which we are this year providing funds is an increase in the ewe subsidy payable in the disadvantaged areas.  The present rate of subsidy is £6.50 per ewe.  We propose to increase this to £9.50 for every ewe in the mountain parts of the disadvantaged areas, up to the first 150.  We propose also to maintain the rate of £6.50 on the next 50 ewes.  We are putting a limit of 200 ewes on the number eligible for subsidy. The reason for this limit, quite simply, is that in relation to the cattle headage payments and beef cow headage payments there is a limit of 30 livestock units.  The figure of 200 ewes corresponds to a figure of 30 livestock units.  In the present circumstances, it makes sense to apply the same limit, in terms of livestock units, to the sheep scheme as applies to the cattle scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition, we would provide for a ceiling on the amount of subsidy obtainable by any beneficiary who has a mixture of cattle and sheep.  That ceiling would <Col N="933" /> be £1,750.  The change there is, of course, that there is no ceiling on the amount of subsidy which can be received by any beneficiary under the present scheme.</P>
    <P>The total cost of that measure, we estimate, would be approximately £2½ million this year and that £2½ million comes out of the additional £8½ million mentioned in the statement by the Minister for Finance as being extra funds available for expenditure in relation to agriculture.  The other £6 million of that we propose to use to finance the national interest rate subsidy to which I referred earlier.  We have already, in the total amount of expenditure, provided for a pre-budget increase.  We have already allowed a sum of £5 million for the State's contribution to the EEC subsidy scheme which was agreed yesterday.  We are allowing a further £6 million for the interest subsidy which we propose to pay to farmers in the commercial category and the other category who will not benefit from the EEC subsidy scheme.  The precise form of these two schemes is now being worked out and I hope to be able to make a full announcement quite soon on the exact shape of the EEC scheme which we intend to operate and of the national scheme which we will operate for people not covered by the EEC scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The £5 million is part of the figure to which I referred earlier, when I said that we calculated that we would need an extra £30 million this year to cover schemes that were envisioned at the stage when the changeover came.  As the Deputy knows, it was prudent, at least, to expect to have to make some provision for this country's participation in the cost of running the EEC scheme, because it had been expected.  It had been hoped that we would get agreement on the EEC scheme at the July Council session. In relation to other specific measures for agriculture&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in the first Supplementary Estimate of £35 million which the House passed a couple of weeks ago. It is, as I say, in the further £30 million which needs to be made available in order to keep the then existing schemes in operation, and to meet the foreseen expenditure before we started implementing any new policies.  To make it quite clear to the Deputy, we needed £30 million on foot of those items which were foreseeable, before implementing any new policies and we are making £8½ million extra available to implement the new items of policy which I have just mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to farm costs, the Deputies will have noted that we are proposing to reduce the rate of value-added tax on contractors' charges from 10 per cent to 3 per cent as of 1 September. This measure will be welcomed by farmers as a relief coming at a very appropriate time.  In addition to that, we are increasing the flat rate reimbursement of VAT to farmers from its present level of 1 per cent to 1½ per cent.  We are doing this for two reasons.  First, there was evidence for some time that the flat 1 per cent rate was inadequate to cover the costs actually incurred by farmers and, secondly, we have increased the rate in order to offset the increases in VAT on farm input announced in the budget statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have just outlined the first measures <Col N="935" /> which we propose to implement on foot of the Government programme in the agricultural sector.  In addition to those measures.  I am taking action immediately to set up, first of all, a special committee on food processing, to advise on policy measures in this sector, which will allow us to get greater benefits out of the undoubted quality of our products and out of processing those products.  All of us in this House would agree that a great deal of progress still remains to be made in our food processing, both in terms of the range of products being manufactured and in terms of the total amount of VAT and, therefore, the total amount of employment gained from our agricultural production.</P>
    <P>In addition, I will be proceeding almost immediately with setting up the machinery required to draw up a four-year plan for agriculture.  We propose, as far as possible, to run our agricultural policy on a coherently thought-out basis and want to make sure that we have before us targets which are at once realistic and clear, to which farmers and the food industry can work.  Finally, I am immediately setting in hand a study on grain handling because, as Deputies will know, at every harvest we find problems with handling our output of grain, problems which need not necessarily arise if we had a more co-ordinated approach, on the part of both farmers and the grain trade, to dealing with our production.  The implementation of other measures in the Government's programme for agriculture will follow later.</P>
    <P>I come now to the reorganisation of our spending which refers to possible changes in the farm modernisation scheme, to which I referred in reply to remarks made by Deputy Nolan.  We aim to direct a greater proportion of total spending in that scheme towards uses which will have a direct impact on production. Given that we do not have a bottomless purse, that means we will inevitably be diverting expenditure from uses which have a less direct impact on the level of production.  For example, we propose to limit the grants provided now under the group fodder scheme to silage <Col N="936" /> making machinery.  At present those grants are available for both haymaking and silage making machinery and experience shows that most of the expenditure goes on haymaking machinery.  Given the obvious desirability of increasing the production of silage and changing the emphasis in favour of silage rather than hay, we believe it would be appropriate to change the conditions under which these grants are given and to make them available only for silage making machinery.</P>
    <P>Another of our proposals will be to ensure that in the farm modernisation scheme the grants are given for buildings which are not over-elaborate and we will be laying down specifications for buildings which will qualify for grants.  This is already happening because farmers have been doing that themselves over the last few years, given the financial pressures that were on them.  As I said, we propose to modify the standards for buildings in order to get better value for the money going into the scheme and to increase the emphasis on the more directly productive uses of the funds made available.</P>
    <P>We also propose to suspend the grants for mobile equipment.  This is one of the smaller parts of the scheme which, in our view, is less valuable than other parts and in the interest of better value for limited amounts of available public funds we propose to suspend these grants.</P>
    <P>In spite of those measures it is evident that the cost of the farm modernisation scheme is increasing, and for a number of reasons with which Deputies are well acquainted.  Given the financial circumstances in which we find ourselves, we therefore propose to bring about a modest reduction in the overall level of grants.  I should add that all the changes I have been talking about, that is changes in the uses for which money will be made available and in the level of grants to which I have just referred, will be implemented in 1982.  We cannot do it in 1981 because most of the payments that will be made this year are on foot of development plans which have been approved already and it would be wrong to change the rules in the middle of the game.  The <Col N="937" /> changes I am talking about will be implemented next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Details of all these measures will be announced in due time.  Even given the changes which we propose to make in the farm modernisation scheme, we will still be spending over £40 million on that scheme and on the western drainage scheme.  This represents a very considerable commitment by the State to measures designed to improve the productive capacity of agriculture and to assist farmers in planning their output.</P>
      <P>On the reorganisation of expenditure, we have been looking at our expenditure in relation to bodies covered by the Vote for my Department and, as has been pointed out by the Minister for Finance, we will be making certain economies in relation to those bodies.  There is another point to which I will give some consideration, although it is not a matter which produces economies immediately.  I will be conducting a review to see whether any rationalisation is possible among the bodies which have been set up to deal with various aspects of the horse industry.</P>
      <P>Those are the main points I wish to make in connection with the agricultural aspects of the budget.  I could speak for a great deal longer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I have overlooked any other changes referred to in the Minister's statement and the Deputy brings them to my attention I will give him the required information.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out, we have provided a significant amount of extra expenditure for agriculture, even given the very difficult economic circumstances with which we are faced.  We have done this because we believe that one of our national priorities must be to increase as rapidly as we can the volume of production in this sector. We have shown that we are not going to proceed with indiscriminate increases in expenditure in any area of agriculture. I wish therefore to take a very reasoned approach to spending in this sector.  For that reason I hope Deputies will adopt the same approach in agricultural debates here.  I propose to adopt that kind of approach in my dealings with representatives of the main farming organisations, the bodies finance through my Department's Vote and the various other bodies which have contributions to make in this area.  While we are taking a very critical look at the way we are spending this money, it is also a very constructive look and that is the way we intend to proceed.</P>

      <P>I want to congratulate the Minister for Finance on the splendid delivery on his budget speech yesterday. When his speech was examined and analysed by political commentators it transpired that it was indicative of the confidence trick which Fine Gael perpetrated on the electorate in their pre-election programme.  The trick was somewhat similar to that perpetrated outside the Galway races by the three-card trickster ripping off the punters.  I do not say that lightly because since my entry to this House in 1977 I have always said that people who are elected here have the best motives in the world.  Each Member has the best interests of the nation at heart.  I believed that until the recent election when I canvassed my constituency and was told at one door after another &ldquo;We believe Fine Gael.  We believe the promise that they will give us the £9.60, improve the standard of living and stabilise prices&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> Deputy O'Malley referred yesterday to the lies in the Fine Gael advertisements. On Tuesday, 9 June <i>The Irish Times</i> carried an advertisement with the heading &ldquo;Fine Gael Nail the Lies&rdquo;.  The Minister for Agriculture should not smile cynically. This is the lie which was published and which the Government are living. Let me tell them how they came into power on a lie, a confidence trick.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We delivered.  The first lie was that Fine Gael would strictly control prices of petrol, beer and spirits. Yesterday's budget effected massive increases, not affecting Members or anyone earning over £10,000 a year.  These increases affect the working man.  When one examines the paltry increases in social welfare payments one really sees the true colour of the Fine Gael blue. Blue paper, blue theories and the leopard will never change its spots.  According to today's edition of the <i>Evening Press</i> the little luxuries of lite will cost £82 per week when the full impact of the budget take effect on 1 September.  A person consuming a modest three pints per day will have to pay an increase of £6.85 per week.  The old age pensioner gets an increase of £1.55 per week.  Do the parties opposite not feel ashamed?  I know that the situation is difficult and certain measures must be taken, but could they not have been a little more generous to the weaker sections?</P>

Fine Gael nailed the lie that everyone will pay more tax and stated that all tax payers with incomes under £50,000 would have more take-home pay.  How much more will they take home after the Minister's budget?  Who is telling lies?  You are telling lies and your Government is a lie from beginning to end.</P>

      <P>I never cast any <Col N="941" /> doubts on his motives as his leader did. He did all the wrong things but he was decent and honourable.</P>
      <P>Let me come to another point in this lying programme, namely, that rates will not be reintroduced.  During the election campaign I took part with the present Minister for Finance in a radio programme where this matter was discussed. Deputy Bruton pointed out that there was no question of the reintroduction of rates, even though he had previously said that this should be done and that there was no justification for their abolition.</P>
      <P>He also denied that in Government Fine Gael would introduce a levy.  This morning on radio he talked about charges for planning permission, street lighting, dustbin collection and information from the county council.  Will this be called rates, a levy or charges?  I have no doubt that ultimately this Government will continue with the big lie and reintroduce rates under another name.  Rates will be introduced by way of a levy or charge on the citizen who approaches the county council for information or services.  That is what the Minister said on radio today although he denied it yesterday.  The Minister denied a lot of things yesterday. When we teased out the budget we discovered that the Minister did not know what he was talking about, that he had taken his brief from the Taoiseach, the man with overview and he was caught out in a number of figures yesterday and today on radio.  He is the Minister responsible for the future welfare of the nation. Deputy Bruton's delivery was <i>par excellence</i> yesterday but the problem was that when we got down to the nitty-gritty we saw the inadequacy of Fine Gael thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture referred to the food processing industry which was one of the first things I referred to when I first came into this House.  I said that that industry had not received adequate support and that we had untapped resources in it.  I am glad to hear that the Minister is in the process of following up that line of inquiry into developing the potential of food processing.  Many thousands <Col N="942" /> of jobs could be had in that field.</P>
    <P>The pre-election programme favoured the better off elements in society.  But as far as the poorer sections are concerned this budget is an act of political terrorism. This morning I walked through a working class part of my constituency and people who would not have talked to me three weeks ago approached me to tell me that they were terrified as to their ability to pay for these increases.  The poor will suffer but it will be no problem to the better off people although they will be somewhat affected by it.  When I say the poor, I mean anybody earning under £10,000 a year, paying a mortgage and trying to rear and educate children.  An advertisement in <i>The Irish Times</i> prior to the election said that the Fine Gael anti-inflation plan would hold ESB, postal and telephone charges down, would increase child benefits by £3 per week, would pay £9.60 direct to the wife at home and went on to ask could one afford not to vote for Fine Gael.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, and Fine Gael have given us our answer.  Had they known the truth the people could have afforded not to vote for Fine Gael.  Fine Gael came to power on a lie.</P>
    <P>My constituency colleague, Deputy Kelly, is one of our finest orators, a man who chooses his words carefully.  On a radio and television programme he spoke about contamination and when tackled repeated that he would not be contaminated by the ragamuffins in the Labour Party, with their false ideology of the left. When the Deputy was tackled a third time he said &ldquo;what I meant was `diluted&rdquo;'. What he meant was contamination.  That word &ldquo;contamination&rdquo; cost Labour their Gaeity Theatre partners seats in Dublin South, a seat in Dublin South Central and a seat in Dublin South East.  Indeed, it cost the Labour Party their leader. Deputy Kelly says&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Kelly, made a speech in this House on 4 February 1981, as Deputy Kelly in <Col N="943" /> which he said that the punters wanted the earth because they were skilfully told that they could have the earth if they voted Fianna Fáil in 1977.  Did not Deputy Kelly learn very quickly?  Within four years, £1,000 million worth of promises. The Minister promised them the earth but he gave them a pickaxe and a shovel. Was it not the same Deputy Kelly who went to a coffee morning with the silk stocking brigade in Dundrum during the election and who when asked how he would pay for these promises said to the darling matrons in Dublin South, &ldquo;I am sure you will understand that it may not be possible to meet our commitments when we see the financial chaos of the balance of payments deficit?&rdquo;  Deputy Kelly was telling the truth but neither he nor the Fine Gael Party were telling the truth to the electorate.  He and his party had deceived the people down along the line.  The astonished matron said, &ldquo;Isn't he so honest?&rdquo;  Is not Minister Kelly so honest?  They came to power on the basis of one lie followed by another.  The Minister for Finance.  Deputy Bruton was a Mr., an unemployed candidate in the last general election who appeared with me on radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When asked how he would pay for the promises set out in this deceptive, lying Fine Gael document, programme, manifesto, whatever one likes to call it &mdash; and I am glad to see that nobody on the far side of the House is denying that it was a lie, because it was a lie from beginning to end &mdash; when asked how he was going to pay for it he became confused; he did not know how he was going to pay for it and said he would have to wait until they got into Government.  Yet they had thousands of pounds worth of advertisements in the newspapers saying what they were going to do but not how they were going to pay for it.  Now we know how they are not going to pay for it.  The Fine Gael programme was not an innocent lie.  It was a dishonest, total lie to the Irish people.  How they can ever again face the electorate with promises of any kind I do not know.  In 1973 they did the same thing.  In 1977 they did not because they did not know what they were doing then. <Col N="944" /> The have now broadened their base as a party but they have lied so terribly to the Irish people that they stand condemned. I would suggest to them that, having examined their good, upright consciences, they should consider getting out, going before the people on the programme they put before this House only yesterday &mdash; this savage budget, these impositions of taxes.  VAT and everything else that militate more against the working people than any other budget ever did.  It hurt the old age pensioner, the people relying on social welfare more than any other section of the community. As I said yesterday, it is a savage anti-people, anti-worker budget, one that ill becomes any Government.  It shows a total lack of imagination.</P>

He contended there were no grants or credits allowed to the poor in the proposed introduction of tax credits.  To the poor, to the medium poor, to the rich or the near rich, there are no tax credits.  It was such a &ldquo;con&rdquo; trick it is hard to believe they can lie happily in their beds night after night, then come into this House, stand up and try to justify it.  A family man, with two children, living on an income of £3,000 a year has no chance of gaining any concessions whatsoever according to Paul Tansey.

I will tell the House what he cared: he cared as much about the Labour Party as he cared about his leader.  He cared as much about the Labour Party and he will give the Labour Party as much loyalty as he gave Frank Cluskey.  If I were the Taoiseach, Deputy Dr. Garret FitzGerald &mdash; an honourable and decent man, too &mdash; I would not turn my back too quickly on the Tánaiste.

We will have a new environment, we will have free buses from one canal to the other, we will have a great city and all the derelict sites will be wiped out&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste worked hard to see that Mr. Cluskey would not be leader after the last election, and he succeeded.  Instead of having to carry Deputy Cluskey screaming from this House he and others in the Labour Party arranged that he would be defeated at the polls and thus make way for Deputy O'Leary, now Tánaiste, to take over as Leader of the Labour Party.  Deputy <Col N="951" /> O'Leary has succeeded in his main ambition in 1977 to become Leader of the Labour Party so that he could ultimately become Tánaiste, bag his Mercedes, take a shot-gun with him down to Meath and join the hunting, shooting and fishing gang there.  There he is, happy as can be, but he does not give a damn about the Labour Party or Fine Gael.</P>

I hope they do not have it over their beds because they will not have an easy conscience with it.  Let me refer to the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, an honorable, decent and compassionate man, a man who, we are led to believe, has the answer to all our problems: &ldquo;To all supporters, old and new I give an unqualified assurance that the programme which we will implement in Government will be the Fine Gael programme, The aims which we have as a Government will be the aims we express in our programme.  Fine Gael are prepared to forego office rather than compromise on the fundamental elements of the programme we have put forwared.&rdquo; On that basis the Tánaiste stands condemned.</P>

      <P>I notice the Deputy mentioned that earlier.  Many participants in <Col N="952" /> this debate have not lived up to the gravity of the situation.  We have had at least half the time of this serious debate filled with no more than sneers, jeers, jokes and laughs.  As a traditionalist I have always argued against television being brought into Parliament but as years go on and I witness the sniggers and jeers, the laughs and cynical smiles and hear the puerile contributions made by Members like Deputy Niall Andrews and some members of Fianna Fáil, I say the sooner television comes in and remains here so that people can see what is going on the sooner we will get some sense of decency, reality and seriousness and some exhibition of courage.  We might have problems dealt with seriously&mdash;not as a matter of strategy about how to win a football game depending on how slippery the ground may be or on which way the wind is blowing&mdash;or what dirt can be used on an opponent in order to injure him&mdash;but we might have the problems of our people properly dealt with as the people who sent us here have a right to expect.  If doing that means that you do not win out electorally at least you will have the comfort of doing your job properly in the way in which our young people would want it done.  That is idealism.  Idealism is a philosophy which endeavours to achieve the best; cynicism is a philosophy which laughs at the world and expects the world to comfort only the cynics.  That is what we have from Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had not intended to open my contribution in that angry mood but I have heard so much of the trivial debate that Deputy Andrew's remarks were just about enough to burst whatever patience I had left.  Our people do not want us to be scoring petty debating points over one another.  We can leave that to the pubs. I went into a pub on the way home last night.  The jokes were as good as they usually are on budget night.  I was invited to join the company, to pay for the last cheap drinks and sit amongst them so that I could be hammered.  That leg pulling is fair enough in a place of relaxation and entertainment.  Parliament is supposed to rule, to consider matters seriously. It is not the place for public house jibes.  Fianna Fáil are a party of cheap <Col N="953" /> jibes and that is why they are unworthy to hold office.</P>
    <P>It has been a tiring, wearisome, puerile debate.  I can understand the embarrassment of the Opposition; they created the mess that this Government have to clear up.  I would ask that the country ponder over the question that was being asked everywhere&mdash;in the media, on television and radio, in pubs and in private conversation&mdash;four years ago when in 1977 our Government were defeated in a general election.  Everybody asked did the Government get their timing right?  Would they not have been wiser to delay the general election until 1978 so that people would see what subsequently happened, that the economy was sound and was improving, employment was increasing, the net burden of taxation was falling, the life style of everybody was improving and Government expenditure could be safely increased without adding to the national debt?</P>
    <P>There was no argument from our successors that they entered into Government and found the cupboard bare.  They could not say it.  Nobody would have believed them.  They would have been shown to be liars.  They did not dare say it.  What they said was that we were not spending enough, that we had over £300 million already borrowed which the miserable Minister for Finance would not spend on a splurge.  We had Deputy Colley getting into his aeroplane, pulling the throttle open, saying he would get the economy zooming forward and upwards. He shot it up all right but it came down in a short time like a burst balloon, fallen flat.  With all the moneys they then borrowed they could not get it up in the air again, not even a foot from the ground.</P>
    <P>I am on public record as having disagreed with my own party after the Donegal by-election when I said, we should say to the Government, to Deputy Haughey in particular: &ldquo;we are disappointed, but we recognise you have a mandate to govern; you have a majority of 18 with which to govern; govern until 1982.&rdquo;  But they did not exhaust their mandate.  They ran out on their responsibilities. They hoped they would get <Col N="954" /> away with it just before the people realised how bad the situation was.  I support the clear indications given yesterday by a courageous, brilliant and refreshing Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton.  He revealed the true figures yesterday.  May I say with all humility that I was only £50 million wrong because ten days before the election I forecast that the deficit this year would be around £1,000 million?  I used the word &ldquo;around&rdquo; to allow for a margin of error.  I think I am entitled to say that I was on target.  This is a reality. The former Taoiseach knew it.  The Department of Finance knew it and told the Taoiseach and the Government the real figure.</P>
    <P>I cannot acept a slur by any Government and especially that delivered by the former head of the Government, a former Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, who said he had been misinformed by the Department of Finance who had told him that the annual rate of price increase was ten per cent instead of 18 per cent.  That is a mis-statement of the facts by Deputy Haughey.  Neither can I accept other criticisms that I have seen in recent days of the Department of Finance, that they have suddenly changed their opinion because their latest outlook and review of the economy in 1981 is so gloomy compared with earlier ones.  The political head responsible for reports of the Department of Finance is the Minister for Finance.  He gets drafts from his Department but he has the final word.  He alone may decide what figures and statements may be included.  He may decide that there is over-estimation or under-estimation by his officials.  He is the person responsible for all the text, not the officials.  To the best of my knowledge officials have always honestly and honourably discharged their function of giving correct and objective advice.  If Ministers reject advice and fiddle figures and publish in the name of the Department reports that are not in accordance with the facts given to them, the blame and the shame lies with those responsible, namely, the political heads.  As everyone knows the real head of the Department of Finance while Deputy Haughey was Taoiseach was Deputy Haughey.  It was <Col N="955" /> not the poor, unfortunate Deputy Gene Fitzgerald.  He is very good at shouting the cheap remark but he is not very literate, poor fellow.  I am not going to question his capacity to be numerate because that might be too embarrassing. That is the embarrassing reality&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will deal now with another aspect of deliberate or incompetent miscalculation.  Notwithstanding the additional money borrowed from aboard and the still unknown money that was committed secretly in the weeks before the election, many services were not provided this year because they cannot be paid for.  In 1977 Deputy O'Donoghue, who was then a Minister in the Government, said it was better to dig holes and fill them up again rather than having people idle.  Now we have the holes, not having paid men to dig them, but we have not the money to pay men to fill them up again.  That is the result of the failure to provide money for the most humble service, a highway to allow citizens to pass and repass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our most needy people, the sick and injured, the impoverished, the mentally and physically handicapped, have been left short of money that was promised and committed.  Many of the facilities provided in the days of the splurge cannot <Col N="956" /> be used.  I am talking about empty hospitals, clinics and homes that cannot be used because they do not contain even the basic furniture necessary.  Three weeks before the election a new labour exchange was formally opened with a great fanfare, but the Minister could not get either a telephone or furniture for the premises.  On the morning of the opening a telephone was rushed to the premises and was put in with the loose cable ends dangling from the table and a parcel of official paper put against it to give the impression it was connected to the wall. Fortunately a journalist endeavouring to contact his newspaper discovered the subterfuge and disclosed why the telephone did not work.  This kind of dishonesty I find quite sickening and deplorable. I see smirks of shame on the faces of a few people opposite but not as brazen as when Deputy Andrews was speaking.</P>
    <P>What is the reality in relation to the health services?  On the hospital end where honest estimates stand at £477 million, there is a shortfall of £44 million. But that is not the whole story.  The general medical services, the private hospitals and nursing homes and the homes catering for the mentally afflicted have been left short of millions of pounds. There is something contemptible in the extreme in doing as Fianna Fáil Ministers did.  I know of one case where some months before the general election invitations were sent to all and sundry to come to the opening of a new home for the mentally handicapped.  Among those invited were the unfortunate mentally handicapped children who had been enrolled for the home.  They came with their parents, and the photographers were brought in to make sure the great occasion was recorded for the press and television.  They all assembled with the Minister, the photographs were taken and published.  The day after the home was closed and the children have not since crossed the threshold because furniture and facilities were not provided and teachers and nurses were not recruited to look after them.  That is only one case I know of &mdash; I do not know how many tens and hundreds of such cases arose.  These shabby incidents were <Col N="957" /> repeated time out of number across the country.  Yet Fianna Fáil have the audacity to say that the money is there.  We know the cost of actual omissions.  We have not yet counted half the cost of the promises and commitments and of the misleading of the people that occurred in the past four years.  We may never know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of us are long enough in the tooth not to always expect what Deputy Colley in his innocence some years ago urged, namely, high standards in high places.  We have come to expect from Fianna Fáil the lowest standard in many ranges of their activities but I think that in the past few years they have stooped even lower than I, with all my experience, and I suppose some cynicism, had come to expect from them.  The result is an appalling debt that unfortunate young people particularly will have to pay because they will have to bear the lion's share of the enormous debt incurred in the past four years.  More than half of this money has been spent without significant advantage to the people but with much harm.  Most of it was spent in a way which fuelled the fires of inflation to such an extent that it will take us decades to cool the fires of extravagance that Fianna Fáil set alight.  It took courage for the Government to produce this budget &mdash; courage of an unusual degree and the kind not expected of politicians. I want to point out that this cannot be the end of the action that is necessary to get our budget, our economy and society right.</P>
      <P>Understandably on a budget, there is concentration by some speakers &mdash; not so much from the Opposition this time &mdash; on figures, without sufficient appreciation of the consequences of the various items of expenditure, saving and so forth. Today, for instance, there was considerable comment in a number of cases about the depressing effects of this budget.  Allegations have been made that it will lead to fewer jobs.  In my opinion, it will have the reverse effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant that Ireland, with its <Col N="958" /> highest rate of inflation, its highest Government deficit, its highest rate of Government borrowing, also has the highest rate of unemployment in the European Communities.  There is a direct relationship, an inescapable connection, between Government expenditure and the rate of inflation, and it is because that fundamental truth has been ignored since 1977 that we have a situation in which our rate of inflation has lost more jobs in Irish industry, commerce and on farms, throughout many services, than were created by the Government in the public service.  The Government service has been inflated by 10 per cent in numbers since 1977.  But the loss of employment in the private sector, what is called the open vulnerable economy where people have to compete with the rest of the world for the sale of their labour, their services, their goods, has been greater.  The productive end of our community has shrunk to support a public sector which while performing in many cases useful and essential services, is frequently not generating the wealth necessary to sustain those services.</P>
    <P>As I have said on many occasions in the last four years, we had from Fianna Fáil policies which were as wrong as wrong could be.  The world economy was improving substantially in 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979, but while we were in office for half that period we did not, during a natural healthy expansion of our economy in line with world economy, spend as though we were in the depths of depression.  But our opponents entered Government at a time when the economy was in boom.  They pumped in money like drunken sailors at a bar trying to impress the girls around them, not caring that they had people at home whom they were obliged to support, not caring that they were incurring debts and not caring about the morality of the whole exercise.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that part of the depression at present is and will always be when it occurs in Ireland &mdash; just as an improvement &mdash; attributable to world circumstances. But instead, of saving for that rainy day, instead of cooling people's expectations in a time of boom, the former Government spent when things were <Col N="959" /> booming, inflating peoples' expectations. They paid increases in wages for beyond what was necessary to keep in line with the cost of living.  The result was that, instead of achieving what they had promised &mdash; a 3 per cent reduction in imports &mdash; they actually increased the importation of non-essential goods by 9 per cent. The additional money which was mis-spent by them, instead of benefiting Irish jobs and the Irish economy, was borrowed abroad and left abroad to buy cheaper foreign goods and services to compete against Irish producers.  A more lunatic policy one could not conceive.  If a first or final year student of economics were to suggest that one should borrow in order to hand the money back to the lender for goods which the leader would supply you with and that you could sustain your economy by so doing, the student would quickly be failed, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the most encouraging part of the Minister's speech yesterday was his return to a theme which he has spoken about on several occasions.  When I was Minister for Finance I advocated more information should be given to Dáil Éireann and the public about Government expenditure.  He was one of those who supported me in that agrument, publicly and privately.  Since we left office, Deputy Bruton published a paper and delivered a number of speeches on that theme.  I am convinced he was on the right lines when he spoke about the need to publish Government Estimates several months in advance of their being debated in plenary session.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed when he spoke about postponing the publication of the 1982 Estimates until November next. This is the time of the year when Departments are drafting their Estimates, when the Department of Fiannce request all Departments to produce their Estimates before the end of July.  I believe the time has come when the Department of Finance should publish the Estimates as and when received from other Departments. Then the electorate would understand who are the big spenders.  The electorate would see who are making the big <Col N="960" /> demands.  At the time of the publication of the Estimates when received from the Departments, the Department of Finance should publish a clear statement of the kind of taxes that would be necessary to finance the generous expenditure proposals being made by spending Departments.  This would be the most effective way of establishing beyond any dispute the direct connection between taxation and expenditure.</P>
    <P>Until such time as the spending Departments are exposed to the same kind of criticism as the Department of Finance are subjected to, we will not get a proper appreciation of Government finances.  Far too much attention is given to and far too much drama is related to budgets, be they annual or supplementary budgets.  It is because of that drama, which is solely a British practice, that the finances of this country and Britain are so astray.  In other countries of the EEC the practice is to publish the Estimates six months or longer in advance of the year to which they relate.</P>
    <P>Unless we publish the Estimates early, then the electorate will not comprehend the consequences of the pressure from spending Departments for more and more money.  There is something wrong with a system of democracy in which a spending Minister is not regarded as a hero unless he spends more and more money and in which a Minister for Finance is not regarded as a hero unless he borrows the money to feed the enormous appetites of the spending Departments. That is the type of democracy that gets itself into the kind of mess in which we are at present and in which Britain has also been for so long.</P>
    <P>We therefore should carefully consider the need to publish Estimates when drafted by individual Departments.  Then the debate can begin, not merely between competing members of the Cabinet, not only secretively between officials in the various Departments, but in public.  This is the surest way of promoting understanding of the enormity of the bill and the need to cut it down.  It is a recipe for sanity.</P>
    <P>In a country which considers itself to be radical and reformist &mdash; I offer this <Col N="961" /> thought to a government which I regard as being both, and that is why I support them &mdash; we should consider seriously whether all old policies and practices are good, whether they meet the needs of today.  I believe that in many cases we would find expenditures and programmes which began half a century ago or less are not suited to the requirements of today. Annually a Minister or Department offering the continuation of old programmes should be obliged to justify them.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we tend to accept that the only expenditure requiring justification is a new expenditure. All too seldom do we criticise existing expenditure.  In fact, if there is a proposal from a prudent Minister in any spending Department or in the Department of Finance to cut back on an existing programme, the unfortunate Minister is subjected to jeers and boohs and howls and criticisms, angry deputations and delegations and protest motions and condemnatory resolutions of all kinds, although in fact he may be doing something which will be of considerable benefit to the economy as a whole and to many of the previous beneficiaries of a worn and inefficient scheme.  A country will not thrive if what is old and inefficient is untouchable.</P>
    <P>That is why I say we need to see Estimates many months in advance of Budget time to have them considered by committees of the House instead of debated in the kind of ragged, scattered, puerile speeches which we have heard on many occasions in the course of the discussions yesterday and today.  I would remind the House that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, which very many members of the House opposed for a long time is proving to be quite a significant success.  That is the view of members, journalists and the public in general.  It has been expressed on many occasions by our friends in the Fourth Estate.  Semi-State bodies, which previously used to squirm under secret <i>dictats</i> from Ministers and which were obliged to engage in programmes which they knew were not desirable or efficient <Col N="962" /> and in many cases were quite contrary to the objectives for which the companies were established, are in many cases delighted with the work of the Committee. Semi-State bodies have been released from the dead-hand control of Ministers and Departments.  Where they are in difficulties they are able to explain and justify their difficulties to the committee. On many occasions, I noticed in the Committees reports, Semi-State bodies receive support from all parties in this House and the other House for recommendations they had been advancing without success to the Departments for very many years.  While a Dáil Budget Committee will certainly throw additional work on Deputies, I believe that Members will find far more job satisfaction in sitting on such a committee reviewing proposals of all kinds for State expenditure and not being confined as at present to looking historically at past expenditures to check whether they were in accordance with the authority given for them.</P>
    <P>In the Committee of Public Accounts Members may not state whether or not authority for expenditure was wise, or whether it was no longer attaining the objectives for which it was first authorised.</P>
    <P>The kind of budget preparatory activity I propose takes place in most advanced and progressive parliamentary systems but not in the British one.  There are many people in Ireland &mdash; not merely those who engage in mob riots &mdash; who would argue that we should not copy British example.  We follow slavishly the worst example of one of the most inefficient Parliaments in the world.  If there are those among us who believe we should follow what is worthwhile irrespective of origin we should look at some of the committee systems which have operated in the British Parliament over the past decade or so.  They have at least made a move into the twentieth century. We who regard ourselves as a reformist and radical country find ourselves with a neighbouring conservative country moving ahead of us.</P>
    <P>We have occasion to hope from what we heard from the Minister for Finance <Col N="963" /> yesterday.  He does not want to preserve his Ministerial dignity in splendid isolation. He does not want to perserve his personal Ministerial supremacy.  He knows it is a myth.  He wants to share responsibility.  Any person who has ever been in Government, and particularly in the Ministry of Finance, knows that the myth of the all-supreme Minister for Finance went out long before this State achieved freedom.  It is good that responsibility for taxation should be understood by all the people's representatives so that there would not be any taxation without the representatives of the people being fully involved and held responsible for that taxation.  Opposition as well as Government.</P>
    <P>When we were in Government from 1973 to 1977 Deputy Colley, who was then the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Finance, refused to participate in any committee which the Government might establish for the purpose of reviewing the State's finances.  When he became Minister for Finance we renewed the Budget Committee suggestion and again it was spurned.  We understand now why.  The Government of the day would not have liked us to know the mess they were making of the economy and finances of the country.</P>
    <P>We now have an honest Government ready to explain everything and wanting the people to understand that there is a limitation to the readiness of the people to pay taxation and that there is also a limitation to the capacity of the country to borrow.  That cannot be understood without wider knowledge and without a more sensible approach to the problems facing us than the puerile contributions from the Opposition throughout this debate.</P>
    <P>I am disinclined to ask the Minister for Finance to make any reduction in his taxation proposals, not because I would not want to see them lower but because it would not be a responsible thing to do at this time.  Yet there is one specific case which I believe needs attention.  It was my ambition when Minister for Finance to abolish value-added tax on newspapers, periodicals, books and particularly <Col N="964" /> school books.  We cannot justify this taxation on information.  Freedom of information is a very important aspect of the democratic way of life.  We should provide education at the lowest possible cost.  Almost uniquely in this country we tax even school books.  There may be a couple of countries in which there is value-added tax on school books but I believe the rate does not exceed 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>I know that administratively it is argued by the Revenue Commissioners that it will be very difficult indeed to distinguish between school books and non-school books.  That I can well understand. I was asked by Church authorities when I was Minister for Finance to relieve value-added tax from recordings of sacred music which might be used in churches.  It seems a very simple thing but when you get down to deal with it administratively you find it is very difficult to distinguish between rock music which might be played in discos and music which might be suitably performed in the Church on Sundays, particularly having regard to the modernisation of many Church services in recent times.</P>
    <P>There will be difficulties in relation to classification of school books on the one hand and books which are not school books on the other hand.  We would like to encourage children at school to read all kinds of proper books.  It would be better than nothing, however, to have some group of qualified persons in the Department of Education verifying what are deemed to be school books or even freeing from value-added tax only those books specificaly on the syllabus.  It would be better to have that than to have the present situation in which we have value-added tax on school books.  That has always been my view from the time value-added tax was introduced.  If it had not been for the financial stringencies of our days in office I would have done it. Certainly we should not increase the rate of value-added tax on school books from 10 per cent to 15 per cent particularly at a time when school books and all books, many of which are published and printed abroad, have to carry not merely the value-added tax but also a disadvantage <Col N="965" /> of cost arising out of the difference between the £ sterling and the Irish £. The burden is increased by the fact that value-added tax is charged only after the cost of the book is increased by the variation between the Irish £ and the £ sterling which can vary from 30 per cent to 33 or 35 per cent.  There is this value-added tax at present amounting to 13 per cent of the price of the book published in Britain.  If we make VAT 15 per cent the position will become very much worse, with currency surcharges plus VAT adding well over 50 per cent to the cost of a book from abroad.</P>
    <P>Therefore I would plead with the Minister to look at this area.  I know the difficulties.  I would appreciate his anxiety to try to help and I believe he would receive the support of all Members of the House if as the price of relieving school books he had to make some other adjustment in value-added tax or some other tax.  I believe we should not be taxing books which are essential to the education of our children.  The same applies in relation to newspapers and periodicals. The free flow of information should not be subject to a tax of this kind, when, as of now in the midst of the depression, newspaper incomes have been slashed, primarily due to reductions in advertising and so forth, and when they are also affected by very substantial increases in the price of newsprint.  In recent years the cost of newsprint increased faster that the price of oil.  Newspapers and periodicals should be relieved of VAT.  I should like the Minister to let us know the cost of relieving school books and newspaper from VAT.  If as a consequence he has to put on some alternative tax, the country would welcome it.  He would be doing the right thing.  Knowledge and its acquisition should not be taxed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore tried to provoke me by suggesting that when I was Minister I was not a friend of the public sector.  We asked the public sector to face the realities of life.  We requested people in employment to accept their responsibility to contribute towards the costs which would have to be borne by the community as a whole if those who were unemployed were to obtain jobs.  I do not think <Col N="966" /> we were being unfriendly to people employed in the public sector or anywhere else when we made that responsible request to them.  I make it again tonight.  I made it before when I was in Opposition.  Any person who believes, as we in Fine Gael do, in Christian democracy accepts responsibility as an individual to help others.  We also believe that all people should help one another.  That is the essence of Christian democracy. We make no apology for that and if for so advocating we are to suffer the sneers and jeers, laughs and insults so be it.  We can easily wear that.  Much greater than us was subjected to insult for laying down His life.  In accordance with the principle of Christian democracy we urge people to be modest in their demands and expectations and to share with others.  That is the essence of Christian democratic philosophy which has Fine Gael, with their colleagues in the Christian democratic movement in Europe and throughout the world, urging the world to be concerned for others.  That was the reason why we are delighted to reverse the despicable move which Fianna Fáil made when in office when they reduced the contribution Ireland was making to the improverished, starving, dying people of the Third World.  The cost of so doing will not be taken into account by the Niall Andrewses of this world as they laugh and snigger at the efforts of the Government to do social justice at home and abroad in accordance with Christian democratic principles.</P>
    <P>We claim no glory for ourselves.  Our people are Christian and democratic and believe in sharing.  It is sad that since we became in Ireland enriched in material things in recent years that sense of neighbourliness and helping one another has suffered.  That is no reason why those of us who have responsibility for leadership in public life should behave as if we should encourage or follow this downward trend.  We have a duty to uplift the people, to remind them of their obligation and of the happiness of giving instead of taking from others all the time.</P>
    <P>The public service are capable of responding to a request to contribute their share.  They are prepared to be <Col N="967" /> patient and, if not, because they are being misled by political opportunists who suggest to them that they need not be, they will find as they now know that there is a limit to the readiness of the community to pay taxation to pay them.  The consequence of not being prepared to be moderate in pay demands will only increase the number of unemployed and the burden of taxation.  If these things do not sink in we will have the puerile debate which some Opposition Members have made this debate in the course of the last few days.  If they do not sink in the outlook for the country would be extremely dismal.</P>
    <P>I am not a prophet of gloom.  I am a realist.  I have confidence in the genuine faith of the people.  The people are capable of responding to the right kind of leadership which they will get from this Government.  If they reject us for giving them that leadership they will pay the price of the massive unemployment they suffered over the last few years and which unfortunately may possibly get worse for a short while because it will not be possible for us to correct the consequences of the worst economic policy ever inflicted on the country.  We used accuse the British of badly ruling us and of bad financial management.  What we experienced at the hands of Fianna Fáil over the last few years was much worse that what the nation was ever subjected to by foreigners which caused our forefathers to rebel against inefficient and corrupt rule.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to an address delivered by our leader to the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and which was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 24 June.  In that address the then Taoiseach said that in the current situation Fianna Fáil award high priority to protecting employment and creating new jobs.  He said that our policy of high productive investment was the only way to achieve these objectives.  Deputy Haughey went on to say that by developing our productive capacity to the fullest extent possible and by utilising our economic infrastructure as rapidly as possible we would ensure the new jobs necessary for our growing population.  The then Taoiseach pointed out that the policy was endorsed by the ICTU and he went on to suggest that the only course open to any Member of Dáil Eireann who does not wish to accept the monetarist approach was to re-elect a Fianna Fáil Government.  Incidentally, that word &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; has been mocked here today by the Government side who have been using it as if it were a new word they had just learned.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael have not at any stage published the costings of their promises.  On 29 January in this House the then Leader of the Opposition predicted that the budget deficit would be £561 million.  However, Deputy FitzGerald now Taoiseach, was prepared to promise benefits that would cost the tax-payer somewhere between £800 million and £1,000 million.  We may well ask who was codding whom?  It is obvious that Fine Gael have no intention of ever fulfilling the claims they made before the election.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the question of the removal of VAT from books and periodicals and he reminded us that he had had questions from us on many occasions in this regard while we were in Opposition between 1973 and 1977.  It has been my opinion always that VAT should not apply in the case of any educational material.  I am hoping that this party will produce, perhaps, a Private Member's Bill framed at having VAT removed from books.  In such event I trust that we would have Deputy Ryan's support.</P>

      <P>They have always been good at criticising but they cannot take criticism themselves.  The inflation rate, which possibly would have reached about 17 per cent in this year, will now end up anything between 22 and 24 per cent as a result of the latest inflation.  The average household which pays perhaps £60 to £80 every two months on the electricity bill will now be faced with an extra amount of from £16 to £24.  To use that often-used phrase statements by &ldquo;independent commentators&rdquo; are to the effect that yesterday's budget is going to cost the average working family £12 a week extra on their bill for all the various costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to raise this very serious question on the Adjournment. It is the question of the public examinations.  Before I do so I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister for Education on his appointment to this very important portfolio, one which cannot be over-estimated. It will call on him to exert all his strength and force of character, particularly in the clime that has been created with regard to financing all areas of the public service.  I wish him well in his role as Minister for Education and I promise him plenty of criticism, all of it constructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has prompted me to ask for an opportunity to raise this matter in the House is that I gather there are 346,545 examination answer books lying in the offices at Athlone.  From the figures I <Col N="973" /> have been given it would seem that all the Intermediate Certificate papers are there.  I would like to know from the Minister if that is true.  From the figures I have been given about the Group Certificate it would seem that all the Group Certificate examination papers are there other than the practical subjects and the ones that have already been dealt with. I notice from the statistics that there are 20,000 biology answer books in Athlone, and this is a very important subject, as the House will readily admit.  Are all the biology Leaving Certificate papers in Athlone?  I would like to know that from the Minister.  There are 7,000 chemistry answer books also there.  Are all the chemistry Leaving Certificate answer books there?  From the figures I have, the building construction answer books and the engineering workshop theory and practice answer books all seem to be there as well, and 5,500 physics answer books at Leaving Certificate level are there in Athlone also.  I would like to know from the Minister if that means that all the physics answer books at Leaving Certificate level are still there unmoved. I gather that 3,000 technical drawing answer books are there.</P>
    <P>That is not an exhaustive list, but I have mentioned those subjects because they are very important with regard to both careers and the attainment of places at third level.  The House will recollect that I amended the grants scheme last year and lowered the number of subjects required for a student who wanted to get a grant in those areas, mentioning specifically the subjects that I have outlined here.  I am glad to know that the examiners' conferences have all been held.  At least that part of the programme of public examinations is over.  If the dispute could be settled, the marking could start.  But I envisage serious problems arising now with regard to the teachers who have been employed to do the marking of the papers.  I would like to know from the Minister if they are on standby.  Has he had any consultations with them with regard to compensation?  They have just finished their year's work and the marking of papers is very difficult work indeed. It is very hard physically and mentally on <Col N="974" /> the people who do the examining and to have this sword of Damocles hanging over their heads without their knowing when the papers will be available to them to mark seems to be an added hardship. Has there been any talk of compensation for them?  Their families also will be involved in this.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will not have serious difficulties later on with regard to getting markers.  It has been my experience that the work is so difficult that even in normal times many teachers have taken on the business of marking 600 papers &mdash; that used to be the number handed out &mdash; and have not been physically able to carry it through and have taken the papers back to the Department and said: &ldquo;I am simply not able physically to finish this task&rdquo;.  It is a demanding, difficult and important task.  The teachers themselves, as far as the academic year is concerned, have no option so that if the marking runs into September there is no flexi-time with regard to holidays as far as teachers are concerned.  Their families will be at school and they themselves will be back in the classrooms.  Therefore, there is a difficult area to be dealt with here.  This underlines and emphasises the importance of getting the procedure underway.</P>
    <P>I agree with the thesis that the proper way to deal with the dispute is through the agreed procedures.  I am in support of the Minister in that.  I am asking him to exert himself to have the agreed procedures continued on&mdash;I was going to say &ldquo;set in motion&rdquo; but I gather that they have been set in motion some time ago. I am asking the Minister to direct his energies to having the agreed procedures working because there is no use in talking about proceeding according to the agreed procedures if nothing at all is happening.</P>
    <P>The officials who are in dispute with the Department are paid out of the Minister's Vote, so consequently he has a responsibility for them.  We had a parallel situation some time ago when the P and T strike was on and we dedicated ourselves in the Department to holding the examinations at that time and had grave difficulty in so doing.  The Minister will find that in this regard he has a superb <Col N="975" /> staff who when there is difficulty will be prepared to work 20 hours out of the 24 to try to solve this kind of problem for him.  Therefore, I am saying to him that he should utilise his own staff in his own Department, in the office of the Minister, in this regard to try to have this problem resolved.  We talk about the dedication of soldiers.  I assure him that that is the kind of total and single-minded dedication that he will find there when it comes to an important matter such as the successful conclusion of the marking of the examination papers.</P>
    <P>As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Minister know, the Leaving Certificate examination is extremely important for young people who are going to use it as a basis for their career, who are going to work immediately after it.  It is very important for those who want to go to the universities or to the regional technical colleges, the national institute or the teacher training colleges.  It is important for those institutions as well to have these results in good time to go through the selection process.</P>
    <P>The intermediate certificate is also a leaving off time for some people.  It is important for apprentices, as is the group certificate.  Consequently, the examinees are entitled to the results at a reasonable time.  I know there are difficulties and I do not want to sound or be unreasonable about it.  Many young people will continue on if they have the assurance they are making progress.  Their progress is indicated by their success in the group or intermediate certificate.  I want an assurance from the Minister that he is exerting himself and that his Department is exerting itself to have the papers marked and to have the results available in good time for students this autumn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. M. Noonan Mr. M. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I understand that the marking conferences have already been held.  At marking conferences, general guidelines are distributed in a written form to examiners.  The examiners take minutes of the meeting but no transcript is ever taken of a marking conference.  Examiners usually rely on their memories when it comes to the <Col N="976" /> nuances of a marking scheme or alternative methods of marking questions.  It has worked very effectively in the past because an examiner begins to examine the day after the marking conference. Now that this dispute has intervened, marking conferences will be five, six or maybe seven weeks in the past when it comes to an examiner marking the first paper.  I should like the Minister to take this into account and to consider the reconvening of examiners' marking conferences when the dispute ends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Wilson who, in his initial remarks extended congratulations to me and also promised constructive criticism, which is always to be welcomed and should be viewed in that light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it difficult, however, for somebody who, until three weeks ago occupied this position to represent that in some way the occupier of the position of Minister for Education has any responsibility or negotiating power to intervene positively in a dispute of this nature.  The Deputy knows that this dispute has being going on for a considerable length of time and arose during the tenure of his party in office.  In this case, as in the dispute to which he referred and which took place a year or two ago, the dispute is with the Department of the Public Service.  The Minister with responsibility is the Minister for the Public Service.  It must be realised that intervention on the part of any other Minister, whether publicly or privately, could very well have the effect of exacerbating a very delicate, unfortunate and regrettable situation.  I have endeavoured to recognise my responsibilities to the students, the public and the examiners in relation to this dispute.  I have had a number of discussions and have prepared contingency plans in the event of the dispute being satisfactorily resolved at different stages during the time which is normally utilised for the correction of papers.  It would be wrong and unhelpful of me, in the context of the delicate stage which this dispute has now reached, if I intervened publicly or to comment on it.  I have refrained from <Col N="977" /> doing so and I do not intend to be drawn through the mechanism of this Adjournment Debate into doing that at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to indicate to the Minister and the House that I said I was in total agreement with the agreed procedures being followed.  He must not have been listening to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that the agreed procedures were perhaps not observed at the start.  The item which was raised on the Adjournment is a statistical question asking for details of the numbers of answer books which are held in the Department's examination branch in Athlone and as to whether the examiners' conference had been held in each subject. In that regard, it is regrettable that this device has been used of questioning the adequacy of an answer which is entirely statistical, to endeavour to invite a member of the Government who has not got the specific responsibility to impinge on another and very delicate area, at a time when the public in certain areas, in the field of social welfare and especially the many thousands who are affected through this delay in the correcting of the answer books, stand to lose if there was to be an unfortunate or unhelpful contribution by another member of the Government.</P>
      <P>Of some thousand examiners, 700 are at work in their own homes marking leaving certificate papers.  Those papers which are being corrected at present cover the larger subjects, Irish, English, mathematics, French, geography, with the exception of biology to which the Deputy referred.  For the remaining 300 examiners, the papers for physics, chemistry, commercial subjects etc., have not been distributed although the conferences have been held in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the 1200 or so examiners for the intermediate certificate, some 505 are working.  Almost all of the group certificate examiners are working.  I am naturally concerned, as is the staff of the Department of Education.  We are saddened and disappointed at this turn of events which has caused disruption in the normal procedure of carrying out corrections to the answer books.  I am very <Col N="978" /> upset, as the staff of the Department are, that a fine tradition of service and loyalty and of close mutual co-operation between individual staff members, a tradition that often goes, as the questioner said, beyond the call of duty, has been disrupted.  I hope there can be an early and satisfactory resolution to the dispute, to allow the staff of the examination branch to return to their duties in Athlone and to allow the process of correction of answer books to go ahead.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson asked whether I had had discussions with any of the interest groups representing the examiners and those who will be correcting the answer books.  As he may have read in a statement issued by the ASTI, I had a meeting with that group late last week during which the entire situation was discussed and arrangements, which I believe were mutually acceptable to the representative teachers' body, the Department officials and myself, were agreed upon.</P>
    <P>In relation to the point raised here by Deputy Noonan regarding the length of time which may now elapse between the conferences for examiners and the actual marking of the answer books, it may be possible &mdash; although I hope it will not be necessary &mdash; to reconvene some of the conferences.  If that is the case, I assure the House that that process will be put into operation following the satisfactory conclusion of the dispute.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand how someone who was a member of a Government which did not adhere to the normal negotiating procedures in relation to particular disputes could now, entirely out of place, invite me within my new Ministry to participate in endeavouring to bring a resolution to a dispute which is clearly one involving staffs of a particular union in a number of Departments with the Minister of the Public Service. I have no intention of doing that.  While I agree with the Deputy in his lavish praise of the staff in the office of the Minister for Education, it was entirely wrong to suggest in this House that the ability, expertise and hard work of that staff might be utilised to bring about a resolution to a continuing dispute which involves staff members of a public service <Col N="979" /> union with the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>My interest is in ensuring that the least possible disruption is caused to the pupils involved, to their parents and to the examiners, who are entirely blameless in this dispute and for whom considerable disruption has been caused &mdash; both in their arrangements for carrying out the marking of papers and in their holiday arrangements. I have gone out of my way to ensure that, no matter what difficulties are presented, those teachers will not in any way suffer as a result of a dispute entirely outside their control.</P>
    <P>I am responsible also in relation to the third level institutions which will naturally have difficulties in the processing of the application forms for entry to the institutions as a result of the delay in the publication of the Leaving Certificate results.  It is, however, my intention, as soon as it is possible to do so, to arrange for the distribution of the remaining answer books for marking in the normal way.  The normal period will be allowed for the carrying out of that marking.  If necessary the examiners' conferences will be reconvened and every possible facility given to the examiners to ensure that they are allowed the full and normal period for the carrying out of the due process. <Col N="980" /> In that regard we may have to have special arrangements with the third level institutions.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all interests concerned to appreciate the difficulties under which a large number of the general public are being placed because of this dispute, especially the difficulties created for young people at an important turn in their lives.  I hope the Minister for the Public Service, in his undoubted unstinting efforts, will bring about a successful resolution of this dispute in the near future.</P>
