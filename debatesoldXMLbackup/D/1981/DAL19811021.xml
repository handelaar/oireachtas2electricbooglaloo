      <P>I move.</P>
      <P>That the Ceann Comhairle direct the Clerk of the Dáil to issue his Writ for the election of a member to fill the vacancy which has occurred in the membership of the present Dáil consequent on the death of Deputy Kieran Doherty, a member for the Constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.</P>
      <P>I regret I have to move this writ because of the death of a colleague who was elected by the people of that area and I hope he is at rest.  Having said that, if the democratic system is to be operated we should move, without any further delay, to elect a Deputy to succeed the late Kieran Doherty.  Last night the Leader of the Opposition made an excellent suggestion, that the Taoiseach should agree to the writ and that Senator Dooge should be a candidate.</P>

      <P>Only with the consent of the people of Cavan-Monaghan.  The Senator should be put forward to receive the <i>imprimatur</i> of the people of that area. I am sure the Senator would be very satisfied if he was elected and the people of that area could have full representation. It would also give the Taoiseach an opportunity of mounting his crusade on his white charger up to Swanlinbar and Monaghan town.  Then he will see that the people think of his crusade.  He would get some straight answers.  He could bring his knights of temperance with him and make a really good show, but I do not think he would win the election.  In fairness to people up there, they should have full representation.  Naturally, it will be a Fianna Fáil Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear other speakers.  If they do not want me to hear their arguments I am more than willing to make my remarks without having heard their arguments because I do not believe their remarks will be any more cogent than the ráiméis we heard from Deputy Moore a few minutes ago. The Opposition seem to have great difficulty in settling into their new task.  Yesterday they sought to choose the members of the Government.  Today they seek to choose our candidate for the by-election. It is a sad thought from their point of view that they are in opposition but they will have to accept it.  They must accept that I am Taoiseach and will be for a little while to come.  Perhaps I shall be Taoiseach for a long time to come, but that is a matter which will be settled in due course.  In the meantime the choice of Ministers rests with me and the choice of the Fine Gael candidate will rest with the Fine Gael Party.  Suggestions are, of course, welcome and helpful but will not determine the issue in that regard.  We have democratic procedures and they involve consultations of certain kinds common to political parties and we will be engaging in that when the time comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the proposal that the writ for the by-election be taken now, we are not disposed to accept that proposal. It would be quite abnormal to have a by-election at this stage immediately after a general election.  We have a very heavy legislative programme to get through.  I think I am correct in recalling that in about 1961 &mdash; and I had confirmation of this from the other side of the House informally some time ago &mdash; Deputy Blaney initiated the practice under <Col N="212" /> which very large numbers of Members of the Dáil and Seanad descended upon a constituency so that every voter had an opportunity of being canvassed directly by Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is a courtesy extended in by-elections which is greatly appreciated by the voters.  When Deputy Blaney initiated the practice we felt it desirable, in fairness to the voters, that they should have the same courtesy from our side of the House.  Since then at every by-election the Oireachtas have descended <i>en masse</i> on all constituencies.  I suggested jokingly, on one occasion to my opposite number that some type of nuclear disarmament agreement be entered into on this matter in which we would agree to withhold some of the SS20s to keep the Dáil going.  Problems were seen about the variable quality of missiles, the difficulty in determining which were standard missiles, which substandard and which super standard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has obviously forgotten about our neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This slightly frivolous suggestion did not meet with much enthusiasm on the other side of the House.  In the absence of such a nuclear disarmament agreement, if we now agree to the writ of this by-election, effectively the time of this House for serious discussion and the determination of measures of great importance to the future of this country in the years immediately ahead would have to be confined, effectively, to a period of five instead of eight weeks. Given the existing legislative programme this is not feasible.  I reflected on this for some time when on holidays and came to the conclusion that, given the time involved, it would not be practical to put this through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also, naturally, gave consideration to the relative political advantages of different times and came to the conclusion that this was indeterminate and indeterminable. The pros and cons were such that the balance was so indeterminate that the only consideration which could apply in these circumstances must be the question of the legislative programme.  On that <Col N="213" /> basis I finally reached the conclusion which I recommended to the Government.</P>
    <P>This programme includes, first of all, Finance Bill No. 2 implementing the provisions of the budget and which has to include, I am advised, Finance Bill No. 3 to implement the major tax reforms which the Government are introducing. This is because of the radical nature of this tax reform, changing over, as it does, from the old system of tax allowances to tax credits, a very important reform indeed.  The tax allowance system, of course, gives a special advantage to people in higher tax brackets who may receive up to 60 per cent remission in respect of any allowance, whereas the tax credit system operates equitably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I have no wish to interrupt the Taoiseach and would like to afford him every courtesy. I feel, however, that he should confine himself to the writ.  He is now embarking on a discussion of legislation which is to come before the House which we have not seen.  In fairness and courtesy to the House, he should confine himself to this matter of the writ for the Cavan-Monaghan by-election.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked to give my reasons and I would like to give them. The changeover to tax credits instead of tax allowances for the personal allowance aspect of the income tax code is very fundamental.  Accordingly the implementation of that and of the associated payment of £9.60p to non-working housewives I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners could only be undertaken if legislation goes through in this Session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach still believe that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were left to be put <Col N="214" /> through after the budget, it would not be implemented by the date set, provided and announced at the first press conference after the election, that is, the beginning of the income tax year, April next year.  Accordingly, we must bring in that legislation this term.  It will be a somewhat complex and radical measure of reform to make the code equitable where it has, up to now, operated unfairly in favour of the well-to-do and against the less well-off.  It will, of course, involve a net improvement, allowing for whatever increases in taxation are required to compensate, both direct and indirect, in the position of the people in the lower and middle income groups and a corresponding disimprovement for people in the higher income groups, since we are concerned with equitable distribution of income.  The party opposite, in their budgets, achieved a much more inequitable distribution than existed previously.</P>
      <P>Another measure which we must bring in with great urgency is the Youth Employment Agency measure.  I hope the other side of the House will welcome it though that welcome may not extend to every detail of it and they could try to make political capital by picking on some aspect and seeking to modify it as they are entitled to do.  But we would need a full Dáil to discuss it.  This measure, for which raising money by a 1 per cent levy on all incomes is supplemented by substantial additional money from the Social Fund in Europe, will enable us at least to treble, if not more, the present level of activity in regard to youth employment, in terms of work experience programme, AnCO training and direct provision for employment of young people in various areas.  This very major reform requires somewhat complex legislation.  It is vital that we start raising this money and meeting our target of 20,000 young people catered for by this agency as soon as possible.  I am sure that this Bill will receive a general welcome from the Opposition.  We cannot be certain what tactics they might adopt and I am not prepared to have something of this kind put at risk or in jeopardy by having a&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They might legitimately resent the fact that they were not being presented with our side of the case by people on the opposite side.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly not going to allow that.  Another Bill to which we attach great urgency, and the heads of which have also been passed by the Government to come before the House before long, is the Housing Agency Bill, which will mobilise forms of capital not now available for housing, without cost to the Exchequer, and enables houses to be provided on the basis of being earnings-related so that young people can, by committing a share of their income not exceeding 17½ to 20 per cent, be housed in houses whose cost at present is beyond them and would require under existing arrangements repayments of perhaps half or more of their incomes.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I will accept the ruling of the Chair on this matter, of course, but I would like the Chair to rule on this very simple motion seeking the movement of the writ for the Cavan-Monaghan by-election, whether it is in order for the Taoiseach to engage in a long discourse about the forthcoming legislative programme about which we have no knowledge and of which we have not been informed.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and have no intention of doing so.  I am merely giving the purpose of each Bill so that the House will appreciate why they are urgent and why we are not prepared to have them held up in any circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Whip is perfectly happy, but I have not given my reasons yet.  Just allow me to add, without going through the complete list, that there are other Bills which are of less urgent importance. There is one of great urgency, the urgency of which the Opposition will accept, though on detail we may disagree. That is the Bill which must be introduced to deal with the rent restriction situation.  This is held in suspense by legislation introduced previously for a period of six months and must be put through in this session.  Otherwise, there would be immense hardship for many people in rent restricted accommodation if they were required to pay rents which they could not afford unless provision is made to deal with that.  That measure must go through in this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are Bills such as the National Development Corporation and the fire service legislation which was held up by the summer break, which is extremely urgent and must be got through as rapidly as possible.  Having left this so long is a matter on which we cannot be happy.  To get these Bills through in five weeks <Col N="217" /> would not be practical.  To get them through in eight weeks, three of which involve a by-election, would not be practical.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, we cannot accept the moving of the writ at this stage but will ask the House to give us its support in not involving itself in a by-election at the expense of the public interest in respect of these measures all of which are vital to the public interest at this time, without going beyond the other possible measures we would like to get through but which are not as vital.</P>
    <P>For that reason I think I am entitled to give this limited explanation.  We are moving to reject this motion.  I would like to have heard other arguments put forward by the Opposition, but apparently they do not wish to put forward any other speakers.  I gather the House wants a vote now and I am happy to provide the opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not be silenced. I want to speak in support of Deputy Moore's motion to have the writ moved for the Cavan-Monaghan by-election.  I have very good and solid reasons for doing that.  I will start by mentioning the size of the constituency.  It borders on Aughnacloy, County Tyrone; moving south east, it extends to Crossmaglen; moving north west, it extends to Blacklion, Belloo, County Fermanagh.  It borders three of the six Ulster counties, another reason why the seat should not be left vacant any longer.  It borders Louth, Meath, Westmeath and Longford in Leinster, Leitrim in Connacht.  There are three provinces involved.  This is an <Col N="218" /> important, pivotal, and very large constituency.</P>
      <P>It is a constituency which in the past, up to the last general election, has shown great respect for democracy; it is a constituency which could be taken as an exemplar in the whole of Ireland with regard to exercising their democratic rights in voting.  This is no latter-day conversion to democracy.  Two years after the Ballot Act was passed in 1872, Cavan invited a Presbyterian, significant in the context of the politics of today, to stand for election and he was elected as nationalist MP for that area.  At the last by-election in that area we had Arthur Griffiths as our candidate and we elected him to this House.  Again we gave an example to the country of the proper exercise of democracy.  We had the highest valid poll in 1981 and the highest quota, if one excepts the constituency which had the Ceann Comhairle.  We had the highest Fianna Fáil votes &mdash; and this is significant &mdash; in the whole country, except for Clare.</P>
      <P>We are told this by-election cannot take place because of a heavy programme of legislation.  The Taoiseach said that in 1961 Deputy Blaney laid down some structures for by-elections.  Why does the Taoiseach feel he must follow this now? Why can he not keep the House going? Why can he not advance his legislative programme in the normal way?  If he does not agree with what Deputy Blaney did, why does he feel he must follow that course now?</P>
      <P>The Pandora's box was opened this summer and all the ills, doom and more doom, were let loose to try to break down the spirit of the country.  One little thing was left in Pandora's box and that was hope, and the electorate had that hope because they knew a by-election had to be held in Cavan-Monaghan, and that they would be able to let the Government know what they thought of their philosophy and their attempt to break the spirit of the people in the difficult circumstances that exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gathered from what the Taoiseach was saying that he was not addressing the House but a few Independents, and the Government are skulking behind those Independents.  On a recent radio programme <Col N="219" /> we had a lot of clap-trap from a Deputy about the Cavan-Monaghan constituency. I submit that he knows sweet damn all about that constituency.  He said the people who voted for Kieran Doherty knew he was an abstentionist candidate. That shows he does not know anything about the general election campaign.  The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry can verify that the campaign was not conducted on an abstentionist basis.  People were asked to vote for Kiernan Doherty and saved his life.  Many older and young voters did that, but unfortunately his life was not saved, even though he got the votes.</P>
    <P>In the general election the total valid poll in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency was 60,411.  In Limerick East&mdash;and some Members from Limerick East chose to pontificate on this issue&mdash;the total valid poll was 48,590.  In other words, Cavan-Monaghan had about 15,000 votes more, or three times the number of votes given to the Deputy who spoke about Cavan-Monaghan.</P>
    <P>The Government should come out and face the electorate in that constituency. Some concern was shown about who would represent the Fianna Fáil Party in that by-election.  We have chosen Senator Jim Leonard and know he will be the next TD for that constituency.  Fine Gael may have problems but if they want to try to have Senator Dooge elected, that is their business.  We are only too anxious to get the Government's record, their attitude towards employment and their lack of social concern before the people. We want to get a judgment from the people on those matters but we are not going to get it apparently.</P>
    <P>Once there was a heavyweight boxing championship match arranged in the United States between Max Baer and Joe Louis.  When the time came and the bell went, Max Baer was not available.  They found him skulking in the toilets.  They had to chuck him out of the toilet and throw him into the ring to fight for the championship.  We want Fine Gael, and Labour too, to come out and stop skulking, to face the people and have this by-election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It is really amusing that the Fianna Fáil Party are so anxious for a by-election in Cavan-Monaghan, basing their argument on the necessity to ensure that this constituency is fully represented.  That argument would be much more convincing if the precedent of North Tipperary were not so fresh in our minds.  It is only a very short time since a vacancy was created in North Tipperary when a Deputy of ministerial calibre was sent to represent us in Europe.  Not only was North Tipperary deprived at that time of an active and able Deputy but it was deprived of a Minister and a Mercedes.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> At that time the last Dáil had about 18 months to run and nobody anticipated a general election.  The then Taoiseach enjoyed, numerically at any rate, the full strength of a majority of 18 Members in this House and it was reasonable to expect that he would serve his term of office of another 18 months.  When the writ for a by-election in North-Tipperary was moved here it was voted down by the Fianna Fáil Party, led by the then Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Many people wondered why the then Taoiseach chose such a time for the general election but I had no doubt as to why he did so.  It was obvious that he had no choice because he managed the affairs of the country in such a way that he could not afford to delay the election.  It was held at a most unfortunate time; and, notwithstanding what Deputy Wilson has said about Fianna Fáil getting the largest vote in the country, they lost a seat in Cavan-Monaghan and their vote in the constituency dropped by 7 per cent.</P>

It will take very hard work to get the economy right again.  The former Taoiseach admitted as much in January 1980 when he said that the finances of the country were in a terrible state, that borrowing could not go on and that discipline would have to be introduced into our finances.  We saw what he actually did about it and these are the problems with which we have to deal.  It is to be hoped that the performance of the Opposition yesterday and today is not an indication of the help we will get from them in rectifying and remedying the mess they left behind.</P>

Honestly, I do not think the House can afford the luxury of three weeks of the sort of by-election campaign that goes on with the House being neglected and the business of the country being neglected.

      <P>It will come as a matter of a great disappointment to the voters in that constituency that this by-election is not being held.  As Deputy Wilson pointed out, it is a large constituency with more than 76,000 voters.  The constituency extends right across the whole of Ireland from within five or six miles of the east coast near Dundalk to within less than 20 miles of Sligo.  A by-election at this time would give the people there an opportunity to pass judgment on the performance of the Government.  The constituency is broadly representative of all the people of the country and because of that a by-election would give the Government an opportunity to see how the people are responding to their policies. The fact that it is an Ulster constituency would give the Taoiseach an opportunity of finding out the feeling about his crusade to change parts of the Constitution. Indeed, one could see it as a mini-referendum. Having regard to what the Taoiseach said yesterday about pursuing this campaign he should give the people of that constituency an opportunity now to pass judgment on that aspect of his policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to the economic policies of the Government.  I do not intend to deal with the changes that have come about since the Government took office but there is a strong feeling in the constituency about the Government's performance particularly in relation to the massive increase in taxation in July. <Col N="225" /> Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the way the Government found the country's finances when they came to office but a lot of the credibility of that story has gone in my constituency.  People there point out that within one hour of being elected to office the Taoiseach announced to the House that having studied the books he had to report that there was no money in the kitty but their view is that on that day the new Taoiseach would not have had time to read an evening newspaper let alone study the finances of the country.</P>

      <P>I take issue also with Deputy Fitzpatrick about the campaign on behalf of the H-Block candidate. There is no doubt that the people who campaigned for Kieran Doherty did so on the basis that if he was elected to Dáil Éireann it would save his life.  I presume that they and the people who voted for him had in mind that if he was elected he would be in a position at some stage to take his seat in Dáil Éireann.  The Taoiseach mentioned the problem of members of the Government and members of the various political parties going to the constituency to fight the by-election.  In my view that would be a worth-while exercise mainly due to the fact the most of the members of the Government come from the east coast.  It would be good for the Government to go to a constituency <Col N="226" /> such as Cavan-Monaghan to talk to the people.  When they return from the by-election we may get better legislation by virtue of the fact that they have discussed problems with such a representative gathering of people.  In my view the Government should go ahead and hold the by-election. If they had confidence in what they are doing they would hoild a by-election now.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that the last Deputy's memory is a fault.  The date is 11 February 1981.  The Dáil divided on the issue &mdash; Tá, 14; Níl 66.  I will support the Government on this matter mainly for the grounds put forward by the Taoiseach that there is important work to be done and that the Government intends to do that work and cannot be interrupted in that work for three weeks sojourn in the Cavan-Monaghan by-election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey will recall that during the four years of the last Dáil, and indeed throughout most of my political life, there were a number of issues which I tried to encourage Fianna Fáil, and particularly Deputy Haughey, to do.  To none of these would he give his attention. It now appears that this Government have made certain courageous decisions on a number of issues some of which are, I know, peripheral issues but which are important issues to the people involved &mdash; and they are sufficiently important to me at any rate for me to feel that a Government of this kind, whose lifetime may be limited, should be given every chance to honour their undertakings.  I shall give them every chance to honour their undertakings and carry out their various ministerial and legislative proposals and, at another time, constitutional proposals.  The issues to which I refer &mdash; and I am sure Deputy Haughey recalls them very well &mdash; are the issue of capital punishment, the issue of corporal punishment, which some people may think is not particularly important but which I believe is very important and have been campaigning for its removal since the fifties, the question of some kind of all-party committee on divorce legislation and the amendment of the Constitution in relation to that, a review <Col N="227" /> of the family planning laws, all very important to the individuals concerned. As well as that, as the Taoiseach has said, there is the question of tax reform with some kind of a lean away from Fianna Fáil policy towards a more redistributive type of policy of taxation.  I will judge and vote on this when I see it but the understanding I have is that we will tend to impose a greater level of taxation on the wealthy section of the community rather than on the mass of the ordinary people.</P>

There is also the question of housing finance.  These are all urgent matters which the Government say they are going to deal with.  Also, there is the question of the introduction for the first time of a seriously, in the true republican sense, pluralist society here which has been resisted by Fianna Fáil all through the years since the 1937 Constitution.  I obviously must support those proposals and I intend to do so.  This Government have a negligible majority.  They are a minority Government and so obviously in doing those things which successive Governments &mdash; Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil Governments &mdash; have, since the beginning of the State, resisted doing and refused to do, are giving evidence of a liberal advance in our society, and a person with my political views must obviously do what he can.  As long as <Col N="228" /> these things continue to get done I will support the Government.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the same position holds here.  It was I who moved the writ for the by-election in Tipperary.  The then Government had an enormous majority, Mr. Lynch's enormous majority of 20.  Is it not indeed a measure of the appalling blundering leadership by Deputy Haughey that he should now find himself fighting for this particular issue having prematurely lost this marvellous majority of 20 which he had at that time and with which he could have passed laws in respect of all these issues which I have referred to here today, the social and fiscal issues.  Instead of that he squanders that wonderful majority of 20.  However, his answer to me at Col. 1463, Vol. 326 was:</P>
      <P>We on the Government side are opposing this motion because we cannot see any particular need for the holding of a by-election in North Tipperary at present.</P>
      <P>Then he went on to give us an explanation which is still valid in relation to Cavan-Monaghan:</P>
      <P>The people of Tipperary are represented in this House by five Deputies,</P>
      <P>There are Deputies in Cavan-Monaghan. It is not like the direct representation system.  The people are represented by excellent Deputies from all the parties and they are providing representation in this House.  That was the point made by Deputy Haughey at that time.  I accepted it then and it is valid also today in relation to Cavan-Monaghan.  The former Taoiseach then went on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the by-election in Donegal last November &mdash; I hope the Opposition have not forgotten it &mdash; provided a recent opportunity for the people to <Col N="229" /> give a verdict on the policies and performance of the Government and Opposition it cannot be suggested that there is any serious public demand for a further test of public opinion at this stage.</P>
    <P>That is the case in respect of this by-election. The Deputy preceding me referred to the vote for the late Deputy Doherty.  Deputy Doherty was a member of the Provisional IRA.  He was a member of a political organisation who was abstentionist.  He had no intention of coming into this House.  He did not recognise this House.  He did not recognise the institutions of the State.  He was merely part of the Provisional IRA's attempt to destabilise our society with the other people that they have at the present time. The people elected him but they must also face the reality that they elected an abstentionist Deputy.  They have to face the reality now that for the reasons the Taoiseach has already given there is no great urgency in this matter.  The case could also be made that if the Taoiseach moved the writ now he would be promoting the case for the Provisional IRA and I do not believe this is a desirable thing.  They should not be facilitated in this way.  For the various reasons I have given I have no hesitation whatsoever in opposing the motion that the writ be moved.</P>

      <P>I want to say a few words in support of this motion.  Before the Taoiseach rose to give his address he wanted reasons why this by-election should be held.  That is not relevant because the onus is on him to give reasons why it should not be held.  The only reason the Taoiseach has put forward is the interruption of business in the House over the next few weeks.  I have worked in many by-elections over the years and the Taoiseach is creating the impression that the House would not sit during this three-week period.  All by-elections have been held during Dáil sessions.  It is only with the agreement of the Government and the Opposition that an odd half day or day was missed.  The full sittings of the Dáil on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday <Col N="230" /> took place during by-election campaigns. The Dáil sat this time last year during a three-week campaign in Donegal without any interruption of business.</P>

I am appalled at Deputy Browne, who was so great some months ago in moving a writ when the Fine Gael Party had not the courage to do so, suggesting that there is no real reason for a test of public opinion at the moment.  He does not know what he is talking about. We have a Government in office who put forward two sets of programmes and put forward a third one afterwards which were never voted on by the people.  If they have the guts they should face the people in a by-election.  There is no way they could face the possibility of a general election, which is really what Deputy Browne and other Independents are concerned about.  If this by-election was held in the near future we would win it.  The Independents, in particular, would not be very long here and that is why they are saving their seats.  They can go on radio and television but they will not fool anybody in the long term except themselves. My words will ring true in the not too distant future.  The Independents will be very sorry they ever supported the people who are in Government now because they will turn on them before very long. <Col N="231" /><i>(Interruptions.)</i></P>

I am putting forward the real reason why the Government will not face the electorate of Cavan-Monaghan.  The Taoiseach and the Government should remember that some weeks ago after a Government meeting they were running into Cavan-Monaghan.  They could not wait for the Dáil to resume to move the writ.  What happened?  The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry must have been at home for the weekend and he found that the Fine Gael Party had a number of candidates.

The real reason why the by-election is not taking place is that the Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party has threatened the Government with putting forward a very prominent female candidate on behalf of the Labour Party. These issues cannot be reconciled in the Fine Gael Party and also between Fine Gael and Labour in Government.  That is the reason why we are not going to Cavan-Monaghan and it has nothing to do with Dáil business.</P>

    <P>It is silly for the Taoiseach to get up in the House and waffle three months after a general election about pursuing policies in Government which were never voted on by the people.  If the people got a chance this minute they would turn them out very fast.  The Government should give them the chance in Cavan-Monaghan. If the Government care anything about democracy or if the Independents who will back the Government today and in the weeks ahead care anything for democracy we should have this by-election.  I do not care how the Government vote this down or the reasons why the by-election should not be held. <Col N="232" /> We live in a democracy and there is a by-election pending.  No matter who is in Government, especially at the beginning of a Dáil term, that by-election should be held as quickly as possible.  That is why we are moving this writ today when the Government failed to do so yesterday.</P>

      <P>I am not very impressed with the level of this debate.  It reminds me of what I have read about undergraduate debating.  I had not the opportunity of taking part in such debating as an undergraduate but I have read a good deal about the kind of debating which goes on and the kind of schoolboy arguments which go on at those debates.  I am reminded of this listening to some of the speeches by the Opposition especially those of Deputy MacSharry and Deputy John Wilson.  They are all sound and fury signifying nothing because I cannot see anything in their arguments.  I am not very impressed with their call for respect for democracy.  As Deputy Browne said they have been in power for 40 years and during that time they were not great proponents of democracy.  They were upholders of the Fianna Fáil Party's right to rule, not of democracy as a whole. Now that they are in opposition they are squealing and turning on people like me with taunts.  They have some news coming to them because I am not a man who can be bought or taunted.</P>

      <P>It is a very unpalatable fact for people in the Fianna Fáil Party to accept that people like me can be the centre of the stage.  I am here to stay and will not be pushed by anybody on any side of the House.  That is my record. When any issue comes along I will not be impressed by Fianna Fáil arguments.  I will be impressed by the interests of the people outside the House because the two are not synonymous.  In Ennis some time ago Deputy Haughey gave the impression that the interests of the country and the interests of the Fianna Fáil Party were synonymous but in my book <Col N="233" /> they are not.  History does not show that either.</P>
      <P>I am not impressed by the arguments put forward by Deputy Haughey and other Deputies about the need for the by-election because when Deputy Noel Browne tried to move the writ for the North Tipperary by-election he was turned down.  Deputy Haughey said there was no great need to move the writ at that time, that he was the boss and he would decide when the writ would be moved in Tipperary.  He was the boss at that time because he had a majority of 20 in the House.  He moved the writ in his own time but he is no longer the boss.  I have a say in this matter and I am not ashamed to say that I have.  I will decide in the interests of the people who elected me and in the interests of the people outside the House because Kieran Doherty who was elected in Cavan-Monaghan stood on an abstentionist ticket.  He was a member of the Provisional IRA who were never great democrats or showed any great interest in upholding democracy in this country.  I am very sorry Kieran Doherty died on hunger strike, a most squalid death for anyone and especially for a Member of this House.  The people who encouraged him to go on hunger strike, the armchair generals and the politicians on that side of the House who supported the five demands have a lot to account for.  We heard very little about that today.  There is blood on their hands.  Ten people died on hunger strike and many more were killed by guns and bombs.  That is more important than the schoolboy talk we have heard today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other important items that should be discussed by this House but we are wasting valuable time in discussing this matter.  Employment, peace in the land, taxation equity, matters relating to women and family legislation in general are far more important than what we are discussing now.  I will not take any homilies from anybody on that side of the House.  I cannot learn anything from them.  They are not sincere in what they say.  Deputy Wilson spoke about boxing but the only boxing he was ever involved in was boxing the ears of pupils.  He cast <Col N="234" /> shame on a boxer whom he mentioned but it is obvious he knew little about that boxer's career&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Wilson can only shadow-box.  As far as I am concerned the matter we are discussing can be left until the New Year.  Legislation that is due to come before this House is far more important than moving the writ for Cavan-Monaghan.  Unlike Britain and Northern Ireland, it is not a single-seat constituency and the Deputies in that area can carry on the work for their constituents. The people who voted for Kieran Doherty did so in the knowledge that he would abstain from attending this House.  He stood as a front for the Provisional IRA and I am not going to withdraw that statement.</P>
      <P>I am more concerned to have legislation put through this House that will help the people who are suffering.  That legislation is more urgent and important than moving the writ.  I am not in any hurry to see the writ moved.  There is no great loss to democracy or to the people. I will support the decision of the Government in this matter and I make no apology to anybody.</P>

      <P>In this debate there are very few people left to be convinced of the merits or demerits of holding a by-election at this time.  The public are more concerned to ensure that the Government get on with the job.  There is an argument going on in this House and valuable time is being wasted but it does not make much difference.  Everybody has his mind made up.  If there is a need for anything it is to change the procedures in this Assembly and to prevent a situation occurring where hours and hours of valuable time are wasted on empty rhetoric. The debate goes on but nothing changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have stated publicly on another <Col N="235" /> occasion, I will make an assessment with regard to any matter that arises in this House.  To say that a by-election would be a testing point of the Government's performance to date does not carry much weight because not too long ago we had a by-election and shortly afterwards the Government who won that election lost their 20-seat majority.  That was an indication of how the people felt and that is what matters.  As a Deputy for Sinn Féin the Workers' Party, I say to the honourable journalists who sit here that if they are printing anything they should print the facts and if they have not the facts let them ascertain them before they are put down in print.</P>

      <P>To a great degree this House is responsible for having to face up squarely to this by-election, just as in the past when the parties should have faced up to Partition instead of just condemning the atrocities and pushing it under the carpet. The reason we have to face up to a by-election is that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour between themselves increased the number of seats in this House from 146 to 166.  They appointed a so-called independent commission &mdash; I use the term &ldquo;so-called&rdquo; because they gave that commission political terms of reference.  If they had appointed a genuinely independent commission chaired by a Supreme Court judge and if they had said to that commission, &ldquo;There is the Constitution.  Give us a PR system the public will accept that is removed from the influence of the political parties because we had enough of this gerrymandering in the past&rdquo; we would not have to face this by-election today.  The commission that was appointed was told to take the lower figure of one TD per 20,000 people instead of giving the lead in these hard times and taking a figure of one TD per 30,000 people.  If they had done that <Col N="236" /> we would not have to face the by-election now.</P>
      <P>I accept the point made by the Taoiseach that it is necessary to get through a legislative programme during this session. It is my view that the people elected to this House cannot address themselves properly to the task if they are involved in a by-election.  It is not in the national interest to put off the by-election because as long as it is hanging over us we will not be able to do our job.  However, it is not in the national interest to put at risk the Government's legislative programme.  I understand the Labour Party have said they will not put up a candidate in the by-election.  I say to Fine Gael they should not put up a candidate.  They should not fall into the trap of getting caught up in a situation dealing with constitutional and fundamental rights.  This is not the time for it.  They should concede the seat to Fianna Fáil and get on with the job of putting through the legislative programme.  The Government have been in office for a short time and it is too soon to test their policies.  If Fine Gael contest the by-election they will find probably that Fianna Fáil will win the seat and that will be used to fight for a general election. This is not the time for a general election. Neither is it the time to abuse the people's fundamental rights in relation to the Constitution which is fundamentally sound. It needs amending but this is not the time to do it.  What we have to do is manage our economy.  That is what we were elected to do.</P>

      <P>We are persisting with our motion that this writ should be moved.  Nothing that has been said in the debate will deter us from doing that.  A number of side issues were raised, but the principal argument was the one put forward by the Taoiseach, and that is the one we should deal with.  His argument, which can be put very succinctly, is to the effect that the Government have a very important and arduous legislative programme before them, and they should <Col N="237" /> not be prevented from pursuing that legislative programme by the inconvenience of a by-election.</P>
      <P>Either we are democrats or we are not. Either we are totally committed to the democratic process and the ballot box or we are not.  Democracy is an awkward, inconvenient system.  It presents us with many problems and difficulties from time to time.  Either we stay with it and its inconveniences and awkwardnesses, or we do not.  I do not think the Fine Gael Party, who profess to be totally and fully committed to the democratic process, and who are not above lecturing us from time to time on that process &mdash; the supremacy of Parliament and the need to have resort to the ballot box to resolve our difficulties &mdash; are entitled on this occasion to put the ballot box and the democratic process into cold storage because it suits them, and because it would be awkward and inconvenient for them not to do so.  Because it is relevant to this argument I want to mention the constituency in which this by-election is being held.</P>

      <P>I want to mention briefly the constituency with which we are concerned, Cavan-Monaghan, in <Col N="238" /> which there are quite a number of people who are not particularly committed to the democratic process or the ballot box. I do not think it is very wise for the Taoiseach and the Government to be cynical about this by-election and to give those people who are not particularly committed to the democratic process an opportunity to say that politicians in Leinster House, as they are wont to refer to us, will resort to the election system and the ballot box only when it suits them, and when it does not suit them they put them into cold storage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne has always made a virtue in this House of his consistency. Frequently he has lectured us fairly intensely about his consistency on his principles and his objectives.  I do not think he is being consistent because, as he pointed out to us, it was he who moved the writ for the Tipperary by-election.  At the time he did that to embarrass and cause inconvenience to the Government. Let us face it.  He had no interest whatever in the electorate of North Tipperary at that time.  He just wanted to cause problems and difficulties for the Government. If he was so keen then that the by-election should be held, why has he changed his mind now?  If the Government's programme is so attractive to him, if it is such a sound programme and such a good reforming programme, why is he afraid to put it before the people in Cavan-Monaghan? If he finds it so beneficial and attractive as a programme, as a good and consistent democrat why does he not favour putting that programme, as outlined for us broadly today, before the electorate?</P>
      <P>If the Government and their supporters, the Independents, wish to draw a corollary between this by-election and the North Tipperary by-election, they must recognise that the writ for the North Tipperary by-election was moved in a situation in which everyone knew a general election was imminent.  Are we to take it that the Government feel the same situation applies and a general election is just around the corner?  If not, they cannot pursue that argument with any degree of consistency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to come now to the Taoiseach's <Col N="239" /> argument about the legislative programme. There is absolutely no reason why the Government's legislative programme should not be continued and why the Dáil should not continue to sit and deal with that legislative programme and, at the same time, have the by-election. That is the basic difference between us and the Government.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister, Deputy Kelly, is in the House.  Another Coalition Government were proud of their legislative programme.  They made quite a to-do about the amount of legislation they got through as a Coalition Government.  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, was probably the man responsible for bringing out a booklet outlining all the legislation they passed as a Coalition Government.  They did not run away from by-elections.  Quite a number of by-elections were held during the tenure of office of that Coalition Government. On their own say so, they still got through a very substantial legislative programme.</P>

When do they intend to hold it?  In January?  Deputy Kemmy says it should be put back to the <Col N="240" /> new year.  In the new year we will have the budget and financial business.

It is a very dangerous argument to slip into. On reflection the Government should abandon it.  There is absolutely no reason why the House should not continue to sit and why the legislative programme should not be carried on.  There is absolutely no reason why any Member of this House who is required to be here for the business of the House should be involved in the by-election.</P>

It is the Government's decision as to how many people they send into the by-election campaign, Ministers, Junior Ministers, or whatever.  It is their decision.  If they want to carry on the business of the House, there is nothing to prevent them doing so.  We will facilitate them right through the by-election in carrying on with their legislative programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not delay the House much longer except to make again the fundamentally important point that the democratic process is one to which we are committed. It does involve by-elections as they arise.  I believe that even though a by-election may be inconvenient or awkward for any of us we have a solemn parliamentary, democratic duty to hold by-elections as and when they arise.  I do not believe the Government are justified <Col N="241" /> in advancing this legislative programme of theirs as an excuse for not coming before the people of Cavan-Monaghan.</P>
    <P>There is one further point I want to make, which is that this by-election is being held in somewhat unusual circumstances, apart from the very tragic circumstances which have caused it.  This Government are now putting before the people programmes and policies, economic and constitutional, which were not put before them in the general election. If they have the respect for the democratic process which they purport to have &mdash; and which I believe they have fundamentally &mdash; then they will see that it is their duty to avail of this opportunity to put these policies and programmes to the test because many of them were not put forward for consideration by the people in the general election.  We are pressing for this by-election because we believe the democratic process demands that it should be held.  I want to tell the House this: if we are voted down on this occasion with the assistance of these impartial, objective, neutral Independents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approve the nomination by the Taoiseach of Senator James Dooge for appointment by the President to be a member of the Government.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Taoiseach)</P>

      <P>During this debate so far speakers on this side of the House have paid tribute to Senator Dooge.  I agree that he is a highly respected person but there are other people in the Fine Gael and Labour Parties who are capable of filling this post.  I would ask those on the opposite side who think they would not be capable of undertaking the duties of a Minister for Foreign Affairs to so indicate by raising their hands.  As there are no hands raised I assume that all those on the other side believe themselves to be capable of doing that job.  That message might be conveyed to the Taoiseach. Our situation abroad will not be helped by the appointment to this office of a non-elected person.  Consequently, it would be much more desirable that the Taoiseach nominate someone who has been elected by the people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should accede to the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition, that is, that Senator Dooge be put forward as a candidate in the Cavan-Monaghan by-election. Should the Taoiseach ignore this proposal he may be sorry afterwards, though people on all sides of the House will realise that there would be little chance of the Senator winning that election.  But if democracy is to work we must take the bad results with the good.  As Deputy Haughey said this morning, we will continue to press for the by-election in Cavan-Monaghan until the Government are dragged kicking into that constituency. Therefore, they may as well decide now to have the election.</P>
      <P>There have been other occasions on which Fine Gael Members have filled important posts.  In addition to the European Parliament, they have had representatives on the Council of Europe.  I have served in Europe with, for instance, people like Deputy Richie Ryan, a formidable man who performed well in Europe.  We know that the opinion in Fine Gael is far from being unanimous on this proposal to appoint Senator Dooge.</P>
      <P>I shall not delay the House.  My intention in speaking is to try to make the Government realise that they are making a mistake in this instance.  Perhaps even at this late stage they will change their minds and put forward for this prestigious office a Member of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to speak briefly on two aspects of this debate.  I wish, in connection with the question of the suitability of Senator Dooge for this office, to draw the attention of the House to a speech made by him in the other House on 8 October, when he spoke on the motion put down on behalf of the Government noting remarks made by the Taoiseach in a radio interview and subsequently. That speech of the Senator's is well worth noting, because it encapsulates and displays very well Senator Dooge's approach to what is the principal national external problem.  I use the word &ldquo;external&rdquo; in the sense of the problem being external to this State, though not to <Col N="247" /> the nation, that is, the Northern Ireland problem.  The central part of that speech genuinely displays the Senator's beliefs from my knowledge of him going back about 12 years.  I quote from columns 50 and 51 of the Seanad Official Report for the date I have mentioned.  In this part of his speech Senator Dooge was comparing the atmosphere of practical movement towards one another which he found at some levels and on some subjects in the UN with what might be done in this country. He said:</P>
      <P>It came through clearly on every occasion that a necessary ingredient of success in all these problems is a mutual recognition of the opposing points of view, perhaps only a conditional recognition that would serve to keep the conversation going, perhaps a recognition that says: &ldquo;I will for the moment take this one short step at the same time you take a short step and then from our new positions we will look again&rdquo;.  This is the great flaw in what Senator Leonard said.  He said: &ldquo;Maybe we will be prepared to move but only at the end; we are prepared to take the last step but we are not prepared to take the first step&rdquo;.  That is a sure way of ensuring that nobody takes a step.</P>
      <P>In that absolutely unpolemical and simple paragraph Senator Dooge has expressed what I consider to be the truth about our prospects in regard to reconciliation with and in the North.  Any point of view about that subject which fails to use that gradualist approach, which fails to prefer it to dogma &mdash; not particularly dogma that is strongly or sincerely believed in by those who enunciate it &mdash; which ignores or contradicts the point of view which Senator Dooge there represents is totally doomed and has no hope of working.  It would lead the country no further towards unity but it would be pre-occupied and doomed in all its other operations by reason of such folly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Usually I enjoy the speeches of Deputy Lenihan but yesterday I found myself losing interest in what he had to say.  He seemed to be speaking with a great deal <Col N="248" /> less ebullience than he usually displays. However, he did say, concerning the speech delivered by Senator Dooge at the UN, that he had fault to find with that speech because, although the Senator referred to various matters, he made no reference to the national aspiration. I have only the unrevised copy of his speech but I am quoting from that:</P>
    <P>There was reference in that speech of the Minister-designate to what we have always regarded as the basic national aspiration, to the view that has always been held, and however rough the road and however long the time within which that aspiration might be accomplished eventually that we desire the establishment of political structures within which an evolution to Irish unity would be possible.</P>
    <P>He went on to issue a certificate of excellence to himself in regard to the corresponding speech which he had delivered to the UN in the previous year.</P>
    <P>I want to say to Deputy Lenihan and Deputy Haughey in particular, who were out in front in this debate here yesterday, that it is not enough to be talking about our aspirations.  God knows, I lean over backwards to try to find points in common between my party and the Fianna Fáil Party, as my essential belief is that the Civil War has damned this country for the last 60 years and it should be brought to a close.  But no sooner have I leaned over backwards to find points in common than I find suddenly that I am being pushed away out to sea again by reasoning of this kind.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party towards the Northern problem would seem wicked if it were not childish; but since it is the attitude of a child one cannot take it seriously enough to attach a severe adjective like &ldquo;wicked&rdquo; to it. They speak about their &ldquo;aspirations&rdquo; as a child would speak about a flock of balloons. When somebody comes uncomfortably near them you can almost hear them shouting, &ldquo;Mind me aspirations!&rdquo; They think it is enough to recite that aspiration and their national duty is done.</P>
    <P>Do Deputy Lenihan and Deputy Haughey ever stand back and look at <Col N="249" /> themselves and listen to themselves?  I do not know whether literally they are grandfathers, but they are old enough to be so, and both of them have been in public life for a generation.  What has been their net contribution to Irish unity? I do not ask if they have won back a single inch of Northern territory because that is not the point.  Have they converted a single Unionist heart?  That is the point. I do not ask how active they have been in screaming for the English to do something, and running around tearfully pulling at Mrs. Thatcher's coat-tails to get her to come to twist the Unionists' arm and do something which she is not able to do.  I do not ask that, and I do not measure their success by the stridency with which they advance these demands. But I do ask, what have they done to build a bridge between the people in this country who at the moment would fight rather than have anything to do with us? They are of the age of grandfathers and they expect to be taken seriously by the young generation, by our children and grandchildren who are now leaving school, who can get nothing in the way of a lecture from the Fianna Fáil Party except about an &ldquo;aspiration&rdquo;.  They are mewling and puling about an &ldquo;aspiration&rdquo; about which not an hour's sleep has ever been lost by that party, and not a constructive step has ever been taken.</P>
    <P>I need not tell the House what I have often said, although I would be afraid to emphasise it too much, that I have not much sympathy for the Unionists.  They themselves are heavily to blame for the situation in which they find themselves now.  By their short-sightedness, selfishness and bigotry down the years they are to blame very largely, along with British indifference, for the horrible fate which has overtaken their Six Counties in the last 12 years.  At the same time, individually they are just ordinary people who have to slog through life the same as the rest of us, and they do not feel that they have to apologise for what they are or where they are or what put them there or what brought their great-grandfathers there or what their names are or what their faith is.  They do not feel that they are individually or personally to blame <Col N="250" /> for what has come upon them.  We have to carry some of that blame.  Maybe they are wrong about all these things and should be feeling apologetic, but we have to live with them and we have to find a way towards them and build a bridge to that end.</P>
    <P>Without in any sense adopting his political point of view I would like to cite a letter printed today in the <i>Irish Independent</i> from Mr. R.L. McCartney, QC, who led a group of Unionists down here about three weeks ago to see both the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition. I do not say this in any tone of exultation but in order to bring home to the Fianna Fáil Party how far away they are, what astronomical distances they are away from understanding this problem. They have to deal with people of whom Mr. McCartney probably is one of the most reasonable.  The fact that he is willing to come down here and meet members of the Government and Opposition demonstrates that, because many of them would not cross the Border under any conditions for anything.  This is what Mr. McCartney said in today's <i>Irish Independent:</i></P>
    <P>I came with others to Dublin in a spirit neither of truculence or intransigence but to impart the resolute views of another proud and independent tradition; and to say above all that the destiny of Northern Ireland and her people does not lie in the gift of any other nation but with themselves alone.  That basic premise should be the cornerstone of the Republic's policy towards Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not necessarily adopt that point of view, although I believe there is a certain amount of substance in it.  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Dr. Garret Fitzgerald clearly appears to recognise that fact&mdash;Mr. Haughey just as evidently does not.  I cannot say whether Dr. Garret FitzGerald's policy will lead to unity, but I am absolutely certain that Mr. Haughey's will guarantee partition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="251" /> That is what the most moderate kind of Unionist says.  Who is Deputy Haughey or Deputy Lenihan to brush aside those opinions and set them at nought, and treat them as being insincere? Why do we expect to be taken seriously with our aspirations?  Why do we expect to be taken seriously, and expect people to take us at our word when we speak about our own commitment to independence and freedom and a republic, but will not take the others seriously?  We do not believe the Unionists when they talk like that.  That is what I call childish and that is why I suspect the sincerity of these protests about aspirations. Somebody who has never taken any thought about what he is at is not entitled to have aspirations about it.  He has not earned the right to blather about his aspirations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan, above all, is in a weak position although, as I once said, his endearing characteristic is that it is impossible to embarrass him.  His shamelessness is an all-purpose, all-weather shamelessness.  As I have said, Deputy Lenihan has been around for a long time. He has been a political force of sorts for nearly a generation.  While in Scotland visiting a convention of Scottish nationaists about 1966 or 1967, not long after I joined this party, he said referring to our experience, that &ldquo;independence was not all it was cracked up to be.&rdquo;  That was Deputy Lenihan's advice to the Scots 14 or 15 years ago, and this is the man who cast doubts even on the degree of independence that we ourselves had then achieved.</P>

      <P>I want to emphasise another thing about Deputy Lenihan who gave us all a lecture here yesterday about &ldquo;aspirations&rdquo;. He was the man who himself, in the most humiliating possible way, was put over Mrs. Thatcher's knee a year ago when he misrepresented for local purposes the nature of the talks which the British Government had been induced to have with our Government.  Deputy <Col N="253" /> Lenihan came back with the usual business about the whole thing being raised to a new plane.  It had a new kind of globality, it was a kind of global arrangement now, the old stuff was past history, we had a new relationship, globality, a totality of relationships.  He came back talking about that kind of thing.  Naturally it caused panic in the North of Ireland among the people I was trying to describe a little while ago.  Mrs. Thatcher had to come out and disclaim him.  Imagine the humiliation of that.  The rest of us felt it, even those of us in Opposition at that time.  I object to having a Foreign Minister, whichever party appoints him, who is publicly ticked off by a British Prime Minister and implicitly accused of misrepresenting what has gone on.  Naturally, Deputy Lenihan who is as difficult to embarrass as it would be to sink a cork by throwing stones at it, came up with another one.  He said the new globalities are all &ldquo;institutional, not constitutional.&rdquo; With that formula he was allowed to skate through Christmas into the new year.  A man who has been publicly forced by the British Prime Minister to admit that there was nothing in those talks which bore on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland is in a pretty weak position to lecture Senator Dooge about not having said anything to the United Nations about our &ldquo;aspirations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I regret to have to comment on a despicable reference in Deputy Haughey's speech yesterday, which only echoed an equally despicable moment at the Fianna Fáil conference in Cork last weekend when he berated Senator Dooge for not having thrown his weight against the scheme which I announced in the Seanad last Friday whereby four different kinds of arrangements among a variety of others, some of which were found to be impracticable, are going to be adopted here with the intention of facilitating the travel of Northern people to the Republic and making them feel welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With in a week of becoming Minister I asked my Department to see whether, under the cover of my tourism hat, I could devise a package of schemes which would be clearly seen as a goodwill gesture towards the Northern community of <Col N="254" /> whatever creed or class, and which we could live with financially.  I want to commend here, as I did in the Seanad, the extraordinary enthusiasm and diligence with which officials in my Department and also in the other Departments involved, reacted to that request.  After some delay, part of which was due to my absence abroad, I was able to bring a set of four proposals to the Government.</P>
    <P>One was to extend to residents of Northern Ireland the facility for free travel for the elderly which we have for our own citizens.  The other was to make available in the same way for people conforming to the conditions free travel for disabled people from Northern Ireland on our buses and railways.  A third was to make a token contribution by means of extending an existing Bord Fáilte voucher scheme towards the cost of accommodation for people from the North.  I went out of my way to say it was only intended as a gesture of welcome, that I could not pretend, when the scheme eventually surfaced, that it was going to make any substantial contribution to the cost of their holiday.  It was merely a gesture of welcome; and to put it into that perspective and not appear to be claiming a dimension for it which it did not have, I said it was a gesture in the sense of a discount which might meet the cost of a meal or a couple of rounds of drinks.  Finally, the Department of Education very enthusiastically agreed to extend the youth incentive scheme to Northern Ireland youth groups, thus offering some support towards their costs in coming here for sporting or cultural events.</P>
    <P>I am proud of that scheme; but it does not really matter whether I am or not. The point is: looked at objectively it is the first time in 60 years that a Dublin Government have done something concrete towards making the people in the North feel wanted here.  Even if the scheme does not work, if it is a failure, perhaps even counterproductive&mdash;I do not claim to have any foresight or wisdom about this&mdash;it will still remain the first effort in 60 years to do something of this kind.  But what do I find with the Soldiers of Destiny, with their breathless aspirations <Col N="255" /> to Irish unity?  What is their reaction? They got a tame SDLP man to come down to their platform and denounce it as being an exercise which will only excite resentment&mdash;I think he said contempt &mdash;in the North.  That point of view was repeated here yesterday by Deputy Haughey.  How dare he speak like that? He knows perfectly well that it is sincerely meant.  He knows perfectly well there is not one ounce of local partisan feeling or input in that scheme.  He knows perfectly well it is intended without reference of any kind at all to the local political scene, and if somebody had predicted that we could get that reaction from Fianna Fáil I would not have believed it.  I would have said they may do low things on us but they are not that low, to try to discredit a scheme which has plainly and patently got only one purpose, to try to spread goodwill among people who hate us and to whom Fianna Fáil have given little enough reason to change their minds.  I did not think they could be low enough to do it; but I was wrong.  They were able to get their party leader to do it and also a man from the SDLP to do it.  I consider that one of the most despicable things I have encountered since I entered politics 12 years ago, to undermine a scheme which has no other purpose than to reconcile the people of this island, because I do not expect that its concrete tourist spin off will be anything but marginal.  It may even be non-existent.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad last week I said that I would look at the scheme in a year's time and if parts of it were less productive than others we reserve the right to ourselves to close them down because there is a limit to the amount of money we can spend, even on this scheme, modest though it is, and I do not advance it as being more than modest.  It will cost a significant sum of money which we can ill afford at this time, thanks to the bungling and the hoofling of the party opposite over the last four years.  If we find some parts of that scheme are less productive than others we will close them down and switch the money from the less productive to the more productive areas.  Perhaps <Col N="256" /> someone will get a better idea and perhaps some further dimensions of the scheme will become possible.  In that case, we will put the money into them.  I do not want anyone to think, as long as I am in office, that we are committed to exactly the four points of the scheme.  We are not, but it is the first such effort ever made in this State, and that is the way it is greeted by the Legion of the Rearguard.</P>
    <P>I consider that a shameful performance, especially when uttered in the context of trying to discredit the appointment of Senator Dooge whose words I quoted at the beginning of my contribution and whose approach to Northern Ireland is absolutely correct &mdash; let us go a little distance and try to persuade them to come a little distance and then look again.  That criticism in the context of trying to discredit Senator Dooge is absolutely contemptible.  I am sorry to have spoken heatedly about this but I feel very badly and very strongly about it.  I cannot believe that decent people who support Fianna Fáil can have felt anything but shame when they saw what was said on the platform at the weekend by Mr. Mallon and yesterday in the Dáil by Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDLoftus" hpid="Mr. Alderman Dublin Bay-Rockall Loftus Mr. Alderman Dublin Bay-Rockall Loftus">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alderman Dublin Bay-Rockall Loftus</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who oppose the appointment of Senator Dooge have only themselves to blame for the situation they face today.  Their predecessors, the framers of the 1937 Constitution, instead of providing for a truly vocational Seanad in which experts in their own field would be elected by national bodies and come directly into the Seanad and having two co-equal Houses from which the 15 members of Government could be appointed, gave the Taoiseach the right to appoint 11 personal friends, as it were, to the Seanad and to compound this they said that the Taoiseach has the right to nominate two of those Senators to be members of the Government.  The Taoiseach has many valid reasons for nominating Senator Dooge and he also used a pragmatic approach.  If the shoe were on the other foot and the former Taoiseach was faced with a dilemma, having to depend on five so-called independent TDs for his <Col N="257" /> future political security, he would do precisley the same thing.  He would use, in terms of pragmatic politics, what is before him, exercise his constitutional right and appoint a person from the Seanad to this high office.  I hope some day in this House we will pass a Bill to do away with the Taoiseach's right to nominate 11 persons of his own choice to the Seanad and so elevate the status and standing of the Seanad in the minds of the public and that this Bill will be passed by referendum.  Until that is done, we must face the realities of the situation. All that the Taoiseach was doing, in the last analysis, was something which was pragmatically necessary because of the situation in which he found himself.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Dooge's appointment, I accept what has been said in terms of the North.  The British Government imposed Partition as a temporary arrangement and it is the British Government who must undo this and tell politicians, North and South, that they are going to do so.  Senator Dooge should point this out to the world because Mr. Prior did announce that it was an international political issue.  People like the Caucus in the United States of America are making this a political issue.  They do not support physical force and I accept that.  The National Caucus and the Ancient Order of Hibernians in the United States want the Partition problem solved and it must be solved politically. We have been condemning the atrocities which are occurring in the North and will occur until this problem is solved, and brushing them under the carpet.  Senator Dooge has the capacity and the will to keep that to the fore.  It is a political issue which must be solved by Britain who imposed it on the politicians, North and South.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on the nomination of Senator Dooge to the Seanad.  I cannot understand what all the song and dance by Fianna Fáil is about, having regard to the fact that the rules under which Senator Dooge is now being nominated as Minister for Foreign Affairs is the product of Fianna Fáil's electoral engineering and <Col N="258" /> designing.  Surely every Member of the House knows that, in the very early days of Fianna Fáil, one of the first acts of the then Taoiseach, or President of the Executive Council as he was at the time, the late Mr. de Valera, was to nominate in his new Government the late Senator Joseph Connolly and appoint him as Minister for Lands and Fisheries.  There was nothing wrong with that appointment.  In those days he was accepted, as the nominee of the Taoiseach, the Head of the Government.  Those of us who have been in political life long enough clearly remember that later on Mr. de Valera fully exercised his right in nominating the late Seán Moylan.  Everybody who remembers the late Mr. Moylan has happy memories of him as a man of integrity, courage, and determination, a good Minister and a soldier of Ireland, a sincere Irishman.  It was because Mr. de Valera saw these qualities in Seán Moylan that he nominated him to be a member of the Government.  The Fianna Fáil Party readily accepted that recommendation of the Head of the Government. There was no song and dance about that appointment.  Very few in the House today had the honour and privilege of knowing the late Mr. Moylan, but we who did knew a man who was fully devoted to the service of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The position today is that the Taoiseach has the very same right and privilege to nominate, in the same way, a man whom he believes to be the best and most suited for the position as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Nobody in this House disputes the right of the Taoiseach to do this because once a man is elected by this House as Taoiseach, he has the responsibility and duty of appointing to Government posts men whom he can trust and on whom he can rely.  As Mr. de Valera saw great qualities in Seán Moylan and Joseph Connolly, so, I am sure, the Taoiseach sees equally an abundance of qualities in Senator Dooge.  Clearly, the law of the land allows such an appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see nothing whatever wrong with the appointment of Senator Dooge to the Seanad.  I have known him for perhaps all his period in public life and before that.  I know his ability and sincerity and <Col N="259" /> I am aware of his outstanding brilliance and intelligence.  He is cautious in what he says and does.  Rightly or wrongly, the Taoiseach says that he is to be the man during the term of office of this Government to be the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He is a good choice but he has an extremely difficult job before him, more difficult in some ways than Members of this House can appreciate.  He will be answerable to this House, like every other Minister, for his conduct in that office and the manner in which he will discharge these very grave and difficult duties.  It is only right, on the occasion of the debate on his appointment, to place on record that, as the representative holding what I consider to be the most vital and important portfolio of the whole Government, he must concentrate his energies on the contribution which Ireland can make to world peace.</P>
    <P>The role of our Minister for Foreign Affairs at European or United Nations level is vital for the survival of this country.  We are living in a period when the clouds of war hang over us.  Anybody who seriously studies the situation in Poland knows that world peace is being threatened.  Many problems coming before the United Nations are of concern to Ireland and we can have a great influence on other nations.</P>
    <P>I consider Senator Dooge to possess all the qualities of a diplomat.  He is a person who can give and take, make suggestions and is farseeing.  I have no doubt but that he will exercise all his energy towards the contribution Ireland can make to world peace.  His first job will be to lessen the number of our enemies abroad and increase the number of our friends.  In the history of the world a small nation like Ireland was never more in need of friends.</P>
    <P>The duty of our Minister for Foreign Affairs is to canvas for friends and solicit their support in times of need.  No member of the Government can do more to highlight the good name of Ireland abroad than the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  In recent years we have had more than our quota of unfavourable and <Col N="260" /> undesirable publicity abroad.  Some of that publicity made one ashamed to admit publicly to being Irish.</P>
    <P>Here we have a new Government, a new Minister for Foreign Affairs, whose nomination hopefully will be approved today, who will embark on the very difficult job of increasing the number of Ireland's friends abroad, or perhaps lessening, and if possible, eliminating Ireland's enemies or those who are not favourably disposed to us.</P>
    <P>Ireland can play a great part in maintaining world peace, despite the fact that the man in the street may feel that as a small nation we are insignificant when compared to the great world powers, but that is not so.  Ireland's voice abroad can be heard loud, clear and determined, especially around the table at the United Nations.  I hope there will be frequent discussions between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and our representatives at the United Nations so that on every occasion Ireland's voice will be heard loud and clear.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs must stand bravely and courageously for neutrality. He will have to play a very important role in this area.  When the EEC was first mentioned we were told it would be a European institution to look after economic matters.  Recently it appears to have been devoting some of its energies towards security and military operations. Ireland's role in this area will be different from that of any other member of the EEC.  We should not leave the European countries under any misapprehension that the majority of our people favour neutrality and non-alliance with any great European or world military power.</P>
    <P>If anything interferes with our neutrality I have every confidence that Senator Dooge will report all the details to this House.  Most EEC member states are also members of NATO and our stand as a neutral country is the envy of many of those countries.  We can be described as the most westerly outpost of Europe. Therefore it is only right that our position should be made clear.  We are standing fast on the principle of our neutrality.  We will not surrender it and if there is any question about Irish association with any <Col N="261" /> military groups, this House and the Irish people should be consulted.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge will be faced with very great problems and he can play a major part in relation to nuclear disarmament. Many European and other powers engage in nuclear activities of one kind or another and the whole of civilisation is threatened with a horrible disaster in which millions of people would be wiped out in a nuclear holocaust.  Those of us who are interested in this matter, especially those who heard Father Bruce Kent speak on his last visit to Ireland, realise the horrifying dangers of a nuclear war. It would be extremely short and savage in its impact destroying not only human life but the very land on which we live. Senator Dooge can play a major role in the cause of nuclear disarmament.</P>
    <P>It makes one wonder as to the average degree of sanity of those responsible for the administration of states when one looks at the millions who are unemployed and the unlimited money being spent on nuclear armament in preparation for the destruction of mankind and of God's gifts to mankind.  Senator Dooge will have the opportunity to speak about the dangers to our entire civilisation posed by preparation for nuclear war.  No other Minister will have the same opportunity.  He must dedicate himself to European and world peace and to disarmament and must make it clear to our friends in the European Community that Ireland will not enter into any security or military alliance with any powers but will stand by its neutrality.</P>
    <P>The Minister can also play an important role by using his influence to ensure a greater degree of support for the Third World.  There could be nothing worse than to witness people dying from hunger and malnutrition and suffering because of the lack of medical supplies.  It is frightening to study documentation on conditions in the Third World.  We must increase our share of aid and influence other states to be more generous to those who are existing in circumstances of destitution and starvation.  Ireland can play a role in bringing some form of hope and relief to the starving millions.  I often wonder about the degree of sanity among <Col N="262" /> people in public life in many powerful countries when reading of wheat being burned and food being destroyed.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the Chair's intervention.  I feel rather emotional about this subject and it is certainly one of the great problems with which the Minister for Foreign Affairs will have to deal.  I should like to join sincerely in wishing Senator Dooge the height of good luck, success and health in the enormous job he is faced with.  I should like to ask him seriously to put greater emphasis, if possible, on the activities of the Council of Europe when he assumes office.  I should like to ask him to examine the file in his Department in relation to the appointment of a permanent representative from Ireland in Strasbourg.  The case has been made but no decision was taken by the last Minister and no decision has since been taken but I hope Senator Dooge will be sufficiently courageous &mdash; I am sure he will &mdash; to see to it that this appointment is made.  I hope and trust that all his difficulties, which will be many, will be crowned with the success and good luck he so rightly and richly deserves.</P>

      <P>I want to speak briefly to this motion.  Before the debate concludes <Col N="263" /> I am anxious to get a cast-iron guarantee on this whole question of neutrality. The issue of whether the person appointed comes from the Seanad or this House does not interest me because I know that the appointment would not have been made were it not in order under the Constitution.  However, it is amazing the amount of time that has been devoted to that aspect of the matter in the debate.  I understood that it was Government policy to defend the military neutrality of this State.  I believed and accepted that until now.  I have read some correspondence on this issue.  One last Tuesday pointed to the fact that EEC Foreign Ministers issued a statement to the effect that with the consent of Ireland's Professor Dooge they had agreed to step up co-ordination of foreign policy, including the political aspects of security.  That letter stated that neither the Dáil nor the Irish people were consulted about this important development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important thing is that the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lenihan, said the other day that this agreement has the effect of making Ireland for all practical purposes a member of the Western Alliance in a political though not yet in a military sense.  He said that there is now in effect no limit of any kind on political subjects which may be discussed and Ireland will be fully drawn into East-West tensions and conflicts with profound implications for our position as an island in the event of war. In my view not since Frank Aiken represented this country as Minister for External Affairs has the position of our neutrality been very clear.  Is it correct, as is claimed by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, that there is a definite move on the part of the Germans, British and Italians to get Ireland if not into NATO then in, by the back door, to a European Defence Union?  I want an assurance on this issue from the Taoiseach before I make up my mind on this. I also want the matter clarified by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I was disappointed to hear Deputy Lenihan quoting from press reports of press conferences and so forth of Lord Carrington. <Col N="264" /> If the former Foreign Minister has facts on this issue he should spell them out.  I listened to his contribution in this debate and he did not do that.  He made no impact on me because he quoted at length from reports on this, that and the other.  I want the Taoiseach to give a cast-iron guarantee that there will be no interference with our neutrality if the appointment of Professor Dooge as Minister for Foreign Affairs is ratified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points I want to make in this debate and I will start by dealing with the general approach of the Leader of the Opposition who said he was going to object to the appointment of Senator Dooge as Minister for Foreign Affairs on political, legal and constitutional grounds.  I did hear a good deal from him &mdash; and we have heard a good deal from other people &mdash; about political grounds but we have heard less about the legal and constitutional grounds.  Of course, some things have been said by the Leader of the Opposition, and at least one other speaker from the benches opposite, endeavouring to tell us that what is being proposed here is contrary to settled constitutional practice. Those speakers went on to tell us that what was intended in the Constitution was that this provision in the Constitution should be used only to put in defeated TDs and that justified the appointment of Senator Moylan.  We were told that Senator Connolly was appointed in the distant past, under a different Constitution, a different Seanad with different powers, and the appointment was not a precedent.  The Leader of the Opposition even went so far as to suggest &mdash; a most extraordinary phrase &mdash; that the appointment of Senator Moylan was only a venial sin, that he died quickly.  I am not quoting verbatim what he said but that is the exact impact of what he has told us.  He said he was only there a short time.  He was only there a short time because he died and that does not seem to me to be an adequate justification for distinguishing between the two appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that the Constitution makes provision for up to two Ministers from <Col N="265" /> the Seanad who may not be Taoiseach or Minister for Finance.  I take a lot of the points made by Deputy Browne but I could not quite agree with him on one point he made.  He said that in constitutions based on the Westminster model, as ours was, it was against the spirit of such constitutions to make such an appointment but he recognised that it was in our Constitution, the right was there and, therefore, he would support the appointment because it was constitutional. In fact, of course, the origin of this provision lies in the fact that our constitutions have been based to a significant degree in their practical aspects of the structure of Government on the Westminster model.  Of course, our Constitution has a totally different aspect which transforms it in terms of protection of human rights, the power of the Supreme Court or the High Court to protect human rights by annulling any Acts of the Oireachtas that may be unconstitutional. That is an extra dimension to our Constitution but in the practical application of things we find that our Constitution reflects in quite a remarkable degree the British practice.  The first Constitution did and this was maintained in the second Constitution.  In fact, the origin of this clearly lies in the British practice under which Ministers can be drawn from either the House of Lords or the House of Commons, a practice which still continues there.  There is, in fact, a very distinguished Foreign Secretary in the United Kingdom at present drawn from the House of Lords.</P>
    <P>That is the origin of it and it was maintained by Mr. de Valera in the new Constitution on the basis that up to two appointments could be made.  We have often heard the legendary story &mdash; perhaps it is legendary &mdash; about Mr. de Valera looking into his heart and knowing what the Irish people thought.  I think Mr. de Valera had certainly a very considerable understanding of the Irish people and the fact that he remained in power for so long suggested that he had it, but what I am not so clear on is how members of the Opposition can define what Mr. de Valera meant by including this provision.  To tell us that it was <Col N="266" /> intended only for defeated TDs, that one must first be defeated as a TD before one could be appointed a Minister under this provision, is something which, to say the very least, would require some justification in terms of citation of some statement by de Valera, public or private, that he had in fact intended this.  There is, of course, no such evidence.  The provision was carried over from the previous Constitution and it is not confined in any way and was intended to provide for the situation where a Taoiseach might wish to draw on people of skill or experience who had not been elected to the Dáil.  That is what it is there for.</P>
    <P>In selecting Senator Dooge and in proposing him to the House, I acted within this constitutional provision.  I know that there may be argument &mdash; Deputy Noel Browne expressed this view &mdash; that this should be out of the Constitution but that is a matter for discussion in due course. Personally &mdash; I speak for myself only on this; the Government may have a different view when they come to discuss the Constitution &mdash; I think it is a useful provision. It was placed there by the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party at the time in Continuity of the previous Constitution in order to enable this power to be used, as it had been used by Mr. de Valera in appointing Senator Connolly as Minister for posts and Telegraphs originally, which he thought right.  Having used it in that case under the old Constitution he re-enacted the power and used it again in the case of Senator Moylan.  Nothing that was said in the debate on Senator Moylan's appointment would justify the interpretation that has been put on it, that it can only be used to appoint a defeated TD.  If anything the debate in 1957 would suggest the contrary.  I should like to refer Deputies to volume 161 of the Official Report, columns 1499 to 1509 in which when Deputies McQuillan and McAuliffe dissented on this subject &mdash; the Opposition party at the time did not dissent or object to the appointment &mdash; the appointment was defended by Deputy Donogh O'Malley when he referred to the fact that:</P>
    <P>.... the method by which Senator Moylan was chosen for this Ministry <Col N="267" /> was put before the Irish people and approved in the Constitution which was passed by the Irish people in a democratic manner.</P>
    <P>That argument having been put forward by Deputy O'Malley, and both parties agreeing that this was the position &mdash; the Opposition did not dissent &mdash; Senator Moylan was appointed with the dissent of two people, Deputies McQuillan and McAuliffe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding the premises in question cannot be considered in isolation from that of the company's larger shirt factory in Buncrana.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware the present company were formed in 1980 to take over a long established business which was then in receivership and in danger of closing down with substantial job losses.</P>
      <P>I understand that in the reorganisation of the business following the take-over, it was considered necessary thenceforth to concentrate the manufacturing operations in the Buncrana factory.  As a result, manufacturing at the St. Johnston premises was discontinued in September 1980, and the premises have since been used by the company as a warehouse.</P>
      <P>I am not aware at this stage, of any proposals for the resumption of manufacturing operations at the St. Johnston premises.  The formulation of any such proposals would be a matter for the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the problems being faced by the Clubman company the whole clothing and shirt <Col N="274" /> manufacturing industries have been facing considerable difficulties.  Could I ask the Minister of State what are the Government's proposals to protect the jobs of Irish workers involved in the shirt manufacturing industry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is relevant to the job losses in Clubman.  I have no doubt the Minister of State has in his brief and is anxious to inform the House, the Government's views with regard to the protection of jobs in this industry, particularly when one considers the Minister's comments with regard to the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign and the fact that it is to be done away with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally in a case like this where a factory closes down and jobs are lost the IDA take an interest and sometimes endeavour to see that other industries are provided to take up the employment lost.  Is there anything of that nature contemplated in the case of St. Johnston?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The IDA are not in a position to promote the premises for an alternative industry at this point in time because they are currently being used by the company.  However, the IDA are keeping in close touch with the company about any possible developments in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the use of the Clubman premises by the company surely the services of the IDA and the other agencies of the State can be offered to the company involved so that manufacturing can start up at St. Johnston rather than merely using the premises as a warehouse?  Has this been done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We would obviously like to see the St. Johnston factory being opened up for manufacturing purposes. As the Deputy is aware, there has been a rationalisation of the undertaking within the particular company.  That is their business.  In the situation which now prevails where the premises at St. Johnston are being used by the company the IDA have no particular function in relation to those premises.</P>

Would the Government get in touch with the IDA and promote this particular area in <Col N="276" /> view of the fact that 45 jobs are being lost here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure that any proposition put forward by any shirt manufacturing concern would be considered by the IDA.

Of the total due for collection in 1981, including arrears, the amount uncollected at 31 August 1981 was £66.8 million.

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and I made a clear statement on this matter some months ago.  The IFA endorsed our attitude, that where farmers could pay then they should pay if only to relieve pressure on other farmers not in a position to pay.

      <P>Since 30 June 1981 three officers were assigned in an unestablished capacity as clerical assistants to my Department.

The appointments are temporary and may be terminated at any time in accordance with the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.  Their duties are those of clerical assistants in the sections of my Department to which they were assigned.  Their remuneration <Col N="280" /> is £78.50 a week.

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  This is a wider question than the question on the Order Paper.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment, having regard to the rapid and substantial growth of Dublin city and the adjoining urban area in the county, the steps being taken by his Department, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned, to improve substantially signposting to different suburbs and arterial roads to, from and <Col N="287" /> within the urban area in order to reduce the considerable confusion and related traffic hazards arising out of a dearth of such signposting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of informative traffic signs is a function of the road authority concerned.  As the Deputy may be aware, a new improved system of such signs for national roads is being implemented by road authorities and is being financed by way of special grants from my Department.  The signposting of national primary roads in the Dublin county area has been completed.  A scheme of informative signs for the national secondary road N.81 has been prepared and the necessary signs have been ordered by Dublin County Council. Dublin Corporation have provided route number direction signs for national roads and a grant of £7,000 has been allocated this year for the provision of further such signs.</P>
      <P>The cost of providing informative traffic signs on roads other than National roads is chargeable to the authority's own resources, including its annual block grant allocation.  Road authorities are from time to time reminded of the need to rectify deficiencies in traffic signs.  In notifying road authorities of road grant applications for 1981, attention was again directed to the provision and maintenance of traffic signs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As one proud to be a servant of the people and not an officer, would the Minister agree with me that it is desirable for the people of this country and visitors to it to get where they want to go and that reliance on traffic signs designed in the days of horse-drawn traffic is unlikely to facilitate this objective?</P>
      <P>The second question is this: about seven years ago now money was allocated for the establishment in the Department of Local Government, as it was then, of a special division to bring about substantial improvement in road signs.  To date there appears to be little evidence of the success of that division.  I wonder if the Minister can comment on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> The last point I want to make is this: having regard to the fact that car tax has now been restored, would the Minister use his good offices to ensure that a very significant slice of the revenue yielded as a consequence will be used to improve the roadsigning all over Ireland, bringing it up to international, and certainly European standards?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would agree it is necessary that signposting be as clear and as helpful as possible to travellers on the roads.  Certainly the signposts used previously are not now suitable.  One aspect of those previous signs was that they were placed at a height that could be seen from the box car as one travelled along the road.  Obviously that does not apply now. The division established in my Department, about which the Deputy spoke, is functioning.  Even from observation I think the Deputy would agree, and certainly I would hope that there has been a very significant improvement in the quality and number of signposts.  I cannot speak about inside Dublin that well because there would be another constraint in erecting signposts inside urban areas, that is, one does not want a proliferation of what are called street furniture on roads.  This city is already sufficiently cluttered with dustbins, parking meters and all sorts of other signs.  There is already too much on the pavements creating a real difficulty in this respect.  Outside the city, certainly on the roads I travel, the quality of signposts and their frequency has been very much improved. The third part of the Deputy's question was?</P>

      <P>I did not think we would need them up there for some time according to the vote this morning.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply to the last point made by the former Minister for Finance, would he give this commitment to the already much overburdened motorist&mdash;that his payment of the road tax will be used for road construction, signs and lighting, that at least the Government would allocate that sum of money to the road programme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what sums of money are involved.  But, as I said to Deputy R. Ryan, I will certainly be using whatever influence I have to get as big an allocation as I can from my Department in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the delay in responding to proposals by local authorities, made in consultation with the Garda authorities in the matter of changing speed limits in towns in the area, is most unreasonable? In one instance there was a delay of three years before there was a response to those proposals.  Is the Minister prepared to say that this practice will be changed and that any forthcoming proposals will be dealt with expeditiously?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, certainly that would be so, that I would be very happy to deal with them expeditiously.  But one must be careful in this regard that what one is doing will hold up in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I want to make is that because there were previously complaints about delays in the Department of Local Government, as it was then, some years ago it was decided that the drawing up of by-laws should be handed back to local authorities.  That was a good thing.  It is done now in consultation with the Garda authorities.  They merely come to my Department for rubber stamping &mdash; that is an exaggeration of what happens &mdash; almost rubber stamping, but that is a good system.  If the Deputy knows of any specific instances where the delay has been unreasonable and if he will have his <Col N="290" /> local authority approach me directly, I will have the matter expedited.</P>

But in Gaeltacht areas, where it is so necessary for the culture of this country and its language that the Gaeltacht be preserved and allowed to grow &mdash; a very delicate plant &mdash; we should be very careful in making any change that might hinder that growth.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the present position and the dates of future developments in relation to the proposed Southern Cross route in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Approval in principle has been given to proposals submitted by Dublin County Council for the construction of that part of the Western Parkway/Southern Cross Route between Red Cow on the Naas Road and Harolds Grange, and to the council proceeding with detailed planning for the route. Road grants totalling £2.445 millions have been allocated to the council to date for the sections of the route between Naas Road and Firhouse Road and work has been completed on one of these sections from Greenhills Road to Tallaght Road.  I understand that the council are preparing a compulsory purchase order for the lands necessary for the section from Greenhills Road to the Naas Road and that land is being acquired for the Tallaght Road/Firhouse Road section. The completion of these three sections would provide a new road linking the Naas dual carriageway with Firhouse Road and would represent about half of the total length of the route from the Naas Road to Harold's Grange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the remainder of the route from Tallaght By-Pass to Harold's Grange, Dublin County Council, in October 1979, appointed consultants to draw up the compulsory purchase documents necessary for land acquisition and to prepare detailed design and contract documents.  A preliminary alignment study prepared by the consultants was considered by the council at a meeting on 6 July this year and I understand that the matter will be further considered by the council.  The timing and execution of work on further sections of the route is primarily a matter for Dublin County Council, depending on the rate of progress by the council with detailed planning, land acquisition and the availability of resources.  Accordingly, I am not in a <Col N="292" /> position to give a time scale for completion of the route.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if any steps have been taken, or will be taken, to ascertain the exact lead content of the petrol used in this country; if this lead content is injurious to health; and, if so, if there are any plans in hand to reduce the content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Communities (Lead Content of Petrol) Regulations, 1980, made on 9 December 1980 prescribe a maximum permitted lead content in petrol of 0.64 grammes per litre. These regulations give effect to the EEC Council Directive of 29 June 1978 on the lead content of petrol.  The directive stipulates a maximum content of 0.40 grammes per litre in the EEC generally but allows for the placing on the market here, during the period of five years commencing on 1 January 1981 of petrol having a lead content greater than 0.40 grammes per litre without, however, exceeding a content of 0.64 grammes per litre.  This derogation was allowed because of the technical and economic problems which the immediate implementation of the lower limit would have created for the Whitegate Oil Refinery.</P>
      <P>The lead content of petrol is now monitored by the Department of Industry and Energy.  The results so far indicate lead levels in no case exceeding 0.40 grammes of lead per litre.  At present all our petrol is imported from other EEC countries and complies with the minimum standard of 0.40 grammes per litre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department maintain contact with the Department of Health in regard to the implications of environmental lead for human health.  The view of that Department is that, while they would favour any reduction of lead in the environment, the results of tests for lead in blood carried out by them, as well as the general level of lead in air as revealed by monitoring in Dublin, do not indicate any <Col N="299" /> cause for alarm at present.  The matter is being kept under continuing review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am pleased to hear that the situation does not give cause for alarm at this stage, would the Minister agree that the lead content in the air in the Dublin area is unacceptable?  What steps are the Department taking, in co-operation with the Department of Energy, to reduce the lead content of the petrol coming from Whitegate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Department of Energy.  While any level of lead content is unacceptable from a health point of view we should be careful not to give the impression that for some reason the Dublin area is dangerous in this regard.  The monitoring that has been undertaken in Dame Street and in O'Connell Street has shown that the levels are not dangerous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that recent reports of surveys in this connection have shown that in some of the inner city school areas there is a considerable level of lead content in the air compared with the suburbs. Is it the intention of the Minister to take any action to reduce the lead content in the air in the inner city area which is deprived so much in other ways?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approve the nomination by the Taoiseach of Senator James Dooge for appointment by the President to be a member of the Government.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(The Taoiseach.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I had been dealing with some general points raised by the Leader of the Opposition and by other speakers, points, one might say, of principle, rather than being related to the performance of Senator Dooge in the past three-and-a-half months.  Before coming to that latter question there is one other point I should like to make.  I note the argument being put forward regarding the importance of a Minister for Foreign Affairs attending clinics regularly and dealing with the problems of his constituents as an exercise in bringing him down to earth.  I see a certain value in that: such activity brought me down to earth very much on returning from Brussels and attending at clinics in Ringsend or Donnybrook.  However, I do not regard it as a vital element of foreign policy making and I should only like to speculate as to why Fianna Fáil did not consider it important in regard to the offices of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and of Minister for Agriculture when they appointed Senators to these posts.  One would have thought that these were areas of activity in respect of which constituency experience would be more relevant than in the case of foreign affairs.  Therefore, if there is anything in the Fianna Fáil argument, and I do not think there is, it is not for that party to put forward such argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other general comment I wish to make is that I regret the dismissal from the other side of the House of the measures that the Government have taken to encourage movement between North and South, moves which we have pointed out as small but helpful.  Such dismissal comes very badly from a party who in Government did nothing to encourage <Col N="304" /> movement between North and South and who effectively terminated political contact with the Unionists in Northern Ireland for a period of about two-and-a-half years.  They attack us now for trying to open up contact but I am not prepared to accept that criticism.  Neither the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism nor myself have suggested that the measures taken are of major significance but anything we can do, however small, to encourage contact must be done.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the specific criticisms of Senator Dooge in regard to two issues &mdash; the question of what he said at the UN regarding Northern Ireland and the question of EPC, to which I shall address myself at some length in view of the statements made by Deputy Lenihan and the fact that the record in regard to his performance is so totally at variance with the statements he has made.</P>
    <P>Regarding what Senator Dooge said at the UN, the quotations used by Deputy Lenihan were deliberately selective to the point of distortion.  For example, there was an omission in regard to what Senator Dooge said to the UN Assembly about the origins of this problem and about the division of our island 60 years ago.  Deputy Lenihan omitted to tell us that the Senator went on to say that it was in this area, set up 60 years ago in the circumstances he had described, that the Unionists who were a minority on the island then became a local majority but that there was also a substantial minority who strongly opposed the settlement which made them a minority within Northern Ireland, people who aspired to the unification of the entire island.  Senator Dooge went on to say that ever since the result has been a divided community in that part of the country in which political identity and loyalty were always the basic issues in democratic elections there and where violence has flared up at frequent intervals.  He raised the question also of what the future political structure should be in the island and he posed the question of what future political structures would be necessary within Northern Ireland and between North and South, looking forward to the steps that might <Col N="305" /> be taken in the future to resolve a problem created 60 years ago.</P>
    <P>To quote from the Senator's speech while omitting these references and to accuse him of not dealing with the problem of the unity of Ireland is to carry matters to a degree of distortion which is unusual even across the floor of this House.</P>
    <P>There is a misquotation also because Deputy Lenihan said that Senator Dooge had told the UN that he did not see this problem as a colonial problem.  What he said was that historians may argue as to whether the problem of Northern Ireland was in its origin a colonial one, that the Government here do not approach the issue in that way, that we do not see it as a matter of a disputed territory or a claim of some kind by the people of the South on Northern Ireland.  In addition, in other speeches in the US Senator Dooge dealt with this question of Irish unity.  For example, in a widely publicised speech to a prestigious group of Irish-American editors and journalists he said that our ultimate goal must be to translate into reality this guiding vision of an Irish people united beyond all strife in a generous acceptance of all our traditions, united in an Ireland which all Irish people can consider proudly and unquestionably their own.</P>
    <P>Can this be construed as lukewarm or inadequate?  Such words have been used about it.  He also made other references. On 6 October in Washington he pointed out the two paths to the unity of Ireland, one through peace and one through violence. The only path is that through peaceful means.  I do not think that the party opposite would contest that.  When he spoke in the Seanad on 8 October he called for honesty in our discussions on the Northern Ireland issue, a call which has not been answered fully.  To accuse him of failure in his duty by using particular worn catchphrases is hypocritical.  A reading of any of his statements should make clear his deep commitment to bringing reconciliation and unity to our people.</P>
    <P>I want to say several things about EPC. First of all, on the general issue of neutrality which has been raised in this <Col N="306" /> House by several Deputies, there is a distinction between the Fianna Fáil Party and the parties on this side of the House. I do not want to overstress this but it is fair that we should be aware of it.  The Fianna Fáil Party since 1970 have taken a position with regard to defence in relation to the Community which was never expressed or taken up by the previous Coalition Government nor has it been nor will it be by this Government.  This was expressed by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, on 21 May 1970 when he said: &ldquo;We will as members of the Community be prepared to assist if necessary with defence&rdquo;.  He said also: &ldquo;As the Community evolves towards political objectives we must be prepared to play a part in this respect&rdquo;.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Kennedy, speaking in the Dáil on 23 November 1978, referred me, when I questioned him on what he had said on this subject when he had echoed these words, to what he described as a formulation of the former Taoiseach Deputy Lemass, in relation to this, namely, that if the occasion arose we would face our responsibilities as a member of the Community if we were under attack.  That formulation in relation to the Community as it is at present has been used only by the Fianna Fáil Governments before and after the previous Coalition.  At no period in Coalition did I or any other Minister or Taoiseach ever use such words.  There is a difference in this respect with regard to the existing situation between us in that we have been careful not to use words of commitment of that kind.  I do not want to go beyond that or make a major issue of it, but for the other side of the House to criticise us in this respect when they have gone beyond the position adopted by the party on this side of the House and done so over a period of a decade on a number of occasions is trying to mislead the House with respect to the true position.</P>
    <P>When we joined the EEC, the intergovernmental process with regard to EPC was under way and involved consultations about foreign policy with a view to seeing whether the countries of the Community could arrive at a common <Col N="307" /> position.  I found this an invaluable process because it gave this country the opportunity of an input into foreign policy-making in disproportion to our size and enabled us to put forward the views which in many cases certainly were not those of the majority and in some instances might not be held by more than one or two other countries.  I believe that this experience was shared by both of our Governments.  The input of successive Governments &mdash; I will not distinguish between them in this respect and the party on the opposite side of the House &mdash;in regard to certain issues like Namibia and Zimbabwe &mdash; has been significant.  I was told when in opposition by a very senior British source that if it had not been for the consistent support in European co-operation we gave in government &mdash; and which was given by our successors in government when Deputy O'Kennedy was Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; to the successive British Foreign Secretaries in opposing pressures within the UK for an internal settlement without the Patriotic Front, it would have been more difficult for successive British Foreign Secretaries to withstand pressures within the UK for an internal settlement. This is a testimony to the kind of input a small country can bring to bear if it is consistent in its approach and endeavours to prick the conscience of other countries.  I am not saying that we did it on our own.  The other countries in the Community were concerned also that we should not make a serious mistake here, but the Irish input was significant and acknowledged to me privately by a senior British politician as having been so.  The joint input of our successive Governments on the Namibia question has been constructive also in endeavouring to ensure that the contact group carry out their mission in the full spirit of the policy of the Nine on this issue and our vigilance in that area has been a helpful, constructive and progressive element.</P>
    <P>The position that we in Government took up on the Middle East from the time we became involved in EPC which was carried on by our successors &mdash; perhaps carried a little further than prudence <Col N="308" /> would suggest by Deputy Lenihan in Bahrain &mdash; was constructive.  We, with France and Italy, were the only country to recognise in 1973 that this problem could not be resolved unless, in addition to ensuring the security of the state of Israel, an attempt was made to deal with the Palestinian question not as a refugee problem but as a problem of securing also a homeland for the Palestinian people. The position we took up on that in 1973 was shared by only two other members. By the time the Government changed in 1977 others had come round to our point of view and our consistent position there helped the evolution of foreign policy in that area.  Moreover, in regard to other areas such as disarmament issues, Third World issues and colonialism, we took up positions in the UN which diverged from those of our partners.  That is to say that where we could find ourselves in agreement with our partners we have not gone along with them but have sustained our position in the belief that the position we have taken up is one which they eventually come to join us in holding, as was the case in regard to the Middle East.  This has led us on a number of occasions to voting in the UN with the support of only one other member of the Nine, as the Community was until recently, and differently from the other seven members. Sometimes it was the Netherlands, sometimes Denmark.  Our record here is good. When we have a conscientious position not shared by other member states we retain our position because we are anxious for others to share our view.  We seek to put that view forward and achieve shared positions amongst the Nine.  That process, therefore, has been constructive and has involved the question of the political aspects of security from time to time.</P>
    <P>One of these where the input of the Community as a whole, ourselves amongst them, has been constructive was in relation to the Helsinki Agreement discussions that went on from 1973 to 1975 when the agreement was signed. The centre of gravity of policy formulation amongst the western members of the 35 European states taking part in that conference was within the Nine in Euro- <Col N="309" /> pean political co-operation and not, as it might well have been, in NATO.  The fact that the western position evolved from discussions amongst the Nine, leading to discussions with other countries including the various neutral states in western Europe&mdash;which, of course, though neutral militarily, share our concern for security and the maintenance of the balance of power in Europe&mdash;indicated a constructive process.  We were happy to participate in that with the other members of the Nine and with the other countries of Western Europe including the neutrals.  That these discussions involved matters such as confidence-building measures, observation of manoeuvres and conditions under which manoeuvres on either side could be observed, that that type of discussion on political aspects of security, involved in this instance the other neutral countries in Europe, is constructive.  The fact that discussions within EPC have involved the political aspect of security has been the case since we joined and has been constructive. We in Government sought always to ensure that we did not come under any pressure during that period. We were vigilant to ensure that this process would never go beyond the political aspects of security into the military aspect, although occasionally I recall Ministers speaking as if they were at a NATO meeting and I had to chide them and remind them that they were not. They were forgetting where they were and speaking as if everybody present was a member of the Alliance.  I never failed to remind them where they were, that we were not all members of the Alliance and that we were discussing political issues as members of the Nine.  That process caused us no problems at that period; we maintained our position without difficulty and, it has to be said, without pressure.</P>
    <P>However, there have been developments recently which have threatened some modification of that.  They arise, in the first instance, from an initiative by the German Foreign Minister, Herr Genscher, and have led to matters to which Deputy Lenihan has made reference in this House.  Deputy Lenihan <Col N="310" /> behaved improperly in showing to a newspaper a confidential document about foreign affairs covered by the Official Secrets Act and dealing with a matter of current political concern.  That is a bad precedent and one which should not have been set.  It is all the more undesirable because the Minister proceeded to use that document as a basis for misleading the journalists concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am reluctant to go further in this matter but if Deputy Lenihan, who has disclosed a confidential document to the press with a view to giving a distorted picture of what happened, persists in this House in his denials of what is in those press reports, I will have no alternative but to tell the House what the conclusions of that meeting were. Does the Deputy deny that at that meeting he agreed to the third option being discussed?</P>

      <P>We have had here a persistent attempt to suggest that at this meeting something occurred different from what actually occurred.  I did not want to be drawn into stating what the conclusions of the meeting were save if forced to do so by the Deputy giving an incorrect account to the House which I cannot allow to stand.  In those circumstances I have to say that the recorded conclusion of that meeting at which Deputy Lenihan was present, and I presume present to the end and awake when the conclusion was being discussed, the conclusion was it was agreed that the political directors, the heads of the political sections of the foreign office should examine options two and three.  That is what Deputy Lenihan agreed to and that set us on a slippery slope of a highly dangerous kind and since then this country has been under unremitting pressure as a result of the acceptance of that decision by Deputy Lenihan.</P>

      <P>As a result of what was agreed to by Deputy Lenihan, Senator Dooge at the Brocket Hall informal meeting found himself under very strong pressure which was reported in the press. There was no secret about the matter, because of our position being conceded. It was with considerable embarrassment and with the infliction of some damage to our position that the Senator had to pull back what was conceded.  That is never helpful in diplomacy, having to say that option 3 could not be discussed contrary to what had been said by Deputy Lenihan previously.  As a result of the Brocket Hall meeting and the strong stand taken by Senator Dooge to retrieve the position, we were able, at the London meeting, to have inserted in the communique a limiting clause which retrieves the position and puts on the record that what is involved is maintaining the existing position and not expanding the scope. That clause which Senator Dooge succeeded in having inserted and which put a stop to the drift initiated by Deputy Lenihan at Venlo, is as follows:</P>
      <P>As regards the scope of European Political Cooperation, and having regard to the different situations of the member states, the Foreign Ministers agree to maintain the flexible and pragmatic approach which has made it possible to discuss in Political Cooperation certain important foreign policy questions bearing on the political aspects of security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The clause contains three essential elements: first, having regard to the different situations of the members states&mdash;a <Col N="315" /> reference to our position&mdash;second. maintaining and not expanding the scope of the present situation; and, third, limiting discussions to political aspects of security.  The achievement of that at the London meeting was a major diplomatic achievement in the circumstances of the damage which was done at Venlo to our position.  Very hard work was done at these two meetings, not alone by Senator Dooge but by the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs, to retrieve what had been done.  Working together the position was secured and is clearly established there.  Unfortunately, I cannot tell the House that this is necessarily the end of these pressures.  The belief which exists now in certain governments that Ireland can be pushed further on this matter means that, despite the clear agreement reached in London, pressures continue from certain sources for a widening of discussions.  They are very dangerous pressures which could lead Ireland into a direction of isolation and would be very damaging indeed if the situation were ever to arise in which political co-operation became a process from which we were excluded because of a drift in the direction initiated by Deputy Lenihan.</P>

      <P>I had to put the record straight.  I can assure the House that this Government, with Senator Dooge as Minister for Foreign Affairs, will persist in its course of seeking to retrieve what was seriously damaged at Venlo, resist further pressures and use our diplomatic skills, which in our Foreign Office are considerable and which the Senator has in full measure, not only to resist these pressures but to prevent our being isolated in the process of resisting them. That is all I wish to say on the subject and <Col N="317" /> it is more than I would have wished to say under normal circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The personal qualities of Senator Dooge led me to the conclusion that he was the person I should appoint to this post.  It is my duty to ensure that the Government which I lead has people in each of the posts who are best qualified to undertake the tasks allotted to them. I made my judgment on this matter as the national interests required the appointment of someone who, in my judgment&mdash;subject, of course, to the approval of this House&mdash;is best qualified to defend our national interests in the crucial area of foreign affairs.  That they need to be defended has been made evident, I am afraid, by this debate.  Senator <Col N="318" /> Dooge's knowledge, judgment, intellectual capacity and diplomatic skill, his commitment to a progressive world order and to an opening of Europe towards the Third World, his intimate knowledge of Eastern Europe, unique among people with political experience in this country &mdash;all these contributed to my decision to appoint him.  I believe that his work in the past four months, especially his skill in dealing with the European political co-operation issue, finding it in the mess it was in when we took office, has already vindicated my confidence in him.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby appoints Mr. John Horgan of 19, Upper Gardiner Street, Dublin 1 (who has been nominated in accordance with section 15 of the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977 by The Labour Party) to be a representative in the Assembly of the European Communities for the constituency of Dublin in place of Dr. John O'Connell who was elected as a <Col N="321" /> candidate of The Labour Party and who has resigned as a representative in the Assembly with effect from 10 September 1981.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion relates to the appointment of Mr. John Horgan as a representative in the Assembly of the European Communities for the Constituency of Dublin in place of the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>I wish to point out the difficulties caused by the Labour Party both in this Parliament and in the European Parliament by reason of their policy attitudes in regard to filling casual vacancies which have arisen since the general election. The appointment of Deputies Treacy and Pattison blatantly contravened the whole principle of the dual mandate which we in Fianna Fáil have maintained by decision before the election and since.  We have rejected the whole concept of the dual mandate and in that respect the Labour Party have been running counter to the trend in the European Parliament where less than 25 per cent of the membership is now accredited to two parliaments. In the case of Mr. Horgan at least they are not using the dual mandate but at the same time they are running counter to the spirit and the letter of the Treaty of Rome and the regulations establishing the European Parliament by appointing a person who could not in any circumstance be regarded as appropriate for nomination to a casual vacancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Political Committee of the European Parliament who have been examining this matter have come down strongly against any nomination principle being adopted as a means of filling casual vacancies.  The President of the Parliament, Simone Veil, is equally concerned about this.  The policy trend within the Community is against dual mandate and also against filling casual vacancies on a nomination basis.  On those two grounds the Labour Party have committed three offences in recent months&mdash;and the Coalition Government have supported them&mdash;against the laws and spirit of the European Parliament.  There is a very strong view that the person who should fill the casual vacancy is the person next <Col N="322" /> entitled to it at the election held to establish the European Parliament.  I understand that view was expressed to the Taoiseach by the President of the Parliament. To maintain the elective principle it is essential to ensure that the person who stood for election to the European Parliament should be the person entitled to the seat in the event of a casual vacancy arising.  In this case this would mean that the Labour Party should nominate Jane Dillon-Byrne, who was the next Labour candidate in the Dublin constituency following the election of Deputy O'Leary and Deputy O'Connell.  This is the logic of the situation.  Indeed, it is only because of the fact that the European Parliament, its Political Committee and the President of the Parliament are willing to accept a <i>status quo</i> situation as presented to it by a member government that the Labour Party have got away with their attitude in regard to Deputies Pattison and Treacy and now in regard to Mr. Horgan.  It is causing very real embarrassment within the Community, the Parliament, and its committees.  It is also a real embarrassment to the President of the Parliament.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this has all arisen because of the approach of the Coalition Government towards the European Parliament. They have tended, particularly the Labour Party, to make it a question of &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo;.  Two Deputies have already been selected to fill the O'Connell and O'Leary vacancies and they cannot pay attention to their duties in the European Parliament or here by reason of having to travel between the two and by reason of the tight majority situation that exists here.  In addition to that&mdash;this aspect has arisen since the appointment of Deputies Pattison and Treacy &mdash; the Labour Party, and the Government, are running counter to the expressed views that have emerged in recent months in the Political Committee of the Parliament&mdash;a specialist one relating to elections&mdash;to the views of the President of the Parliament and of the whole institution.</P>
    <P>We had a debate on the appointments of Deputies Pattison and Treacy before the Recess but since then the question of Mr. Cluskey's credentials arose.  As I <Col N="323" /> stated, it was just because of the grace, the goodwill and the basic decency of the European Parliament&mdash;it is not nice to be depending on those sort of criteria&mdash; that Mr. Cluskey was permitted to take his seat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a lot of nonsense. The Deputy does not know what he is talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very decent of them because the fact of the matter is that they did not want to embarrass the Government or the Labour Party.  It is clear that what the members of the European Parliament wanted, in particular the members of the Socialist Group of the Parliament, the group responsible for this move and to which the Labour Party belongs, was to emphasise the elective nature of the Parliament.  The Socialist Group see a strong point of principle involved, that once the Parliament is elective it should remain elective right through in respect of casual vacancies as well as in respect of the original appointments. There is a very real logic in their attitude and a very real point of principle involved.  If the decision is made to go from a nominated Parliament to an elected Parliament, it obviously runs counter to that principle to have a system of filling casual vacancies that does not have any relation to an election.  The logic of that very strong view held by the Socialist group and the other influential bodies I mentioned in the Parliament should have driven the Labour Party, if they had any sense of decency, and the Government, if they were not just horse-trading with certain individuals, to the conclusion that they should keep half right with the system within Europe and appoint the person who was next in line electorally in the last European election. In the last European election the third Labour candidate was Jane DillonByrne, the next person entitled to the seat after Deputies O'Leary and O'Connell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully need not raise his eyes to high heaven because that is the way it works in all of the European countries <Col N="324" /> with the exception of Great Britain, that the next candidate on the list is the person who gets the casual vacancy.  In Britain, where there is the specific situation of the single seat, obviously they have to have a by-election procedure and that is written into legislation there.  We do not have to have a by-election here because we have more candidates than one per party because of the multiple seat situation.  I appreciate there is a section in the Act, written in after agreement by all parties, relating to this.</P>

      <P>I am aware of that situation and I made a speech along those lines before the Recess.  But it has now emerged that that section in our legislation&mdash;let us talk about this rationally because that legislation passed through this House without a division&mdash;now runs counter to the universal opinion of Europeans who are concerned about how to fill casual vacancies within the Parliament. In fact, but for the goodwill of the authorities of the European Parliament and of the various committees, this matter would be pushed to the ultimate.  I am sure the House is aware that there is a grave danger, if someone wanted to do it, that this matter could be upset, that the filling of these casual vacancies in the manner they have been filled could be upset by application or petition to the European Court by an elector of the constituency concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point running away from that real fact.  I do not want to over-labour the point in any party political sense because it is a serious matter that concerns the reputation and the <i>bona <Col N="325" /> fides</i> of Ireland within the Community, particularly with regard to our adherence to the parliament, the Treaty of Rome, the legislation and regulations establishing the Parliament and, generally, our standing within the Community.  We cannot be seen to be blatantly flouting Community regulations and rules.  It was only by reason of the goodwill of the Community that we got away with this in regard to Deputies Pattison and Treacy and Mr. Cluskey.  It was a <i>fait accompli</i>, so they decided not to disturb the matter. However, we are now in a situation where the Labour Party and the Government are aware of the feeling in the Parliament and its committees.  The Government are aware of the feeling in the Parproposing to do runs directly counter to the expressed views of the Parliament and, in my view, the casual vacancies as they have been filled could be upset by an application or petition to the European Court.</P>
    <P>The reason we are opposing the appointment of Mr. Horgan is because the Government and the Labour Party have had notice of the matter.  That makes it all the more serious.  In the appointments of Deputies Pattison and Treacy and Mr. Cluskey the same degree of notice did not exist, but the European Parliament and its committees have investigated the matter and put the Government and the Labour Party on full notice in regard to the matter.  They are aware of the strong views that have been expressed and also that the President of the Parliament intends making her views known to the Taoiseach.  That sort of environment did not exist prior to the Recess and in that type of political environment it is ill-conceived for the Labour Party and the Government not to acknowledge the expressed view and react in the spirit of the law, of the Treaty and of the legal interpretation of the law and the Treaty.  The European Parliament regards with great sanctity and concern the question of the Parliament being an elective Parliament.  They regard any breach of that by way of a nomination for casual vacancies as being a serious matter. This motion runs counter to all that and in my view it is flouting our European <Col N="326" /> partners, our friends in the Community and the institutions of Parliament.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the logical way out was for Labour to put forward the next candidate who was not successful in the European election, the third Labour candidate after Deputies O'Connell and O'Leary.  There was a perfect formula that would meet the express wish of the European Parliament and at the same time do justice with regard to membership so far as Labour were concerned. Instead Labour have obviously followed the principle of spreading the jobs for the boys over as many members of Labour as possible; they have practically all been accomodated now one way or the other.  It is a great achievement on that criterion and, under the umbrella of jobs for the boys, it is the most successful operation I have seen for a long time. But it is a rather cynical exercise which certainly does not do credit to the Labour Party or to this Government.  It is doing a very serious in justice and doing damage to this country in regard to its credibility and reputation within the community and here.  For that reason we are opposing the nomination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like my colleague Deputy Lenihan, wish to oppose the nomination of Mr. John Horgan of 19 Upper Gardiner Street, Dublin, to the European Parliament.  In putting this proposal to the House the Labour Party are merely continuing to show their contempt for and lack of commitment to the whole European concept and what it means to Ireland.  At the time of our accession to Europe it was Labour that opposed the referendum and attempted to persuade the Irish people to stay separate from the Community.  We, in Fianna Fáil, led the campaign and succeeded in achieving a massive victory in the referendum.  The people supported our view and the terms of the negotiated treaty.  Now we have a situation, after the general election in June, where Labour are fixing up those who did not already get State cars and who lost in the election. They propose a series of names to the House, Messrs.  Cluskey, Patterson and Treacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> Following on these nominations the Socialist group of which Labour are members opposed and questioned this whole procedure.  I admit that the law as it stands is such that what they are doing is legal.  However, in the spirit of the directly elected Parliament, what they are proposing to do is contrary to the wishes as reportedly expressed in correspondence to be forwarded to the Taoiseach by Madame Veil, I look forward to reading the letter when it is lodged in the library of the House as was promised yesterday by the Taoiseach with the proviso that there was nothing else in it of a confidential nature.  I accept that reservation. The Labour Party are going totally against the express wishes of the Parliament with regard to the system of nomination.</P>
    <P>I had the privilege of acting as director of elections during the European campaign in the Dublin region and I recall the very effective campaign by Jane Dillon-Byrne of the Labour Party; she was the third Labour candidate.  If the Labour Party were serious about their commitment to Europe or about the wishes of their own socialist group or about the national interest, surely the right and proper thing for them to do was to put before us here today the name of the candidate who stood in that election. It is not my way to make personal remarks, but it must be said that the name we have before us here belongs to a man that I have a lot of respect for but who did not stand in the European election. He stood for the Dáil and was defeated and he stood for the Seanad and was defeated.  Now we are being asked to accept the nomination put forward by the Labour Party.  We will probably even be accused of having the gall to debate the issue.</P>
    <P>In view of the express wishes of the President of the European Parliament and of the need for continuity within this direct election process of following on on the defeated candidate, I would suggest that the proper thing to do is to name the defeated Labour candidate, Jane Dillon-Byrne.  There would have been <Col N="328" /> some logic in doing that rather than what we are about to do.  I join Deputy Lenihan in opposing this resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not surprise me that once again Fianna Fáil have come out in their true colours supporting the bigoted unionist Northern Ireland and the British Conservative Party in an attack upon our system of nominating people to the European Parliament.  Ours is a system which ensures representative proportional democracy whereas the British system or the system that some European countries support means that an unrepresentative person is elected.</P>
      <P>I am surprised to hear Deputy Burke suggesting that Mr. John Horgan is unsuitable because he has been twice defeated.  Fianna Fáil are members of a group in the European Parliament that holds the Parliament in such contempt in that their French members, who are the dominant group in that group of the Parliament, will not allow any person directly elected by the people of France under the de Gaullist banner to hold office in the European Parliament for longer than a year; at the end of each year the person holding the office is replaced by the next defeated candidate so that by the time we reach the fifth year of the first directly elected European Parliament in 1984 the members of that group in the European Parliament from France will be those whose claim to be there will be the fact that they were fifth down the line when the people of their constituencies elected the candidates they wanted in 1979.  I know that Deputy Burke and others regard that system as undemocratic and as a force.  But they cannot come home from the European Parliament and disown those on whom they rely in the European Parliament to carry on their campaign there.  The objective of the majority of the group to which Fianna Fáil belong in the European Parliament is to so belittle the Parliament as to allow people to hold a mandate for only 12 months so that in the fifth year of the Parliament the people who represent the people of France are those who came fifth in line in the elections of 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil has heard today of misrepresentations of what has happened in the <Col N="329" /> Parliament.  The Commission that is charged with responsibility to verify credentials looked at the credentials of the persons nominated by this Parliament and unanimously expressed the view that the credentials were in order and that, as a result, the Labour nominees to this Parliament should be adopted.  That was the decision of the committee and that was the decision of the Parliament and the only people who were not a party to the endorsement of that view were the British Conservative Party and the Unionist member from Northern Ireland, Mr. John Taylor.  That apparently is the company Fianna Fáil want to choose.  They are denigrating a system of selection for the European Parliament which they put before the Dáil and Seanad.  The legislation they are now condemning and belittling in the course of this cheap campaign of political opportunism, which began yesterday at 3.30 p.m., is their own legislation.  Whatever imperfections our legislation may have according to theory it results in a situation in which the proportions of the electorate are more or less maintained.  Surely that is the correct thing to achieve.</P>
    <P>Last week, in one of his usual erudite, forceful and relevant contributions to the European Parliament my colleague, Deputy Joe McCartin, made the point in reply to Mr. John Taylor that under the system of election which Mr. John Taylor regarded as superior if he for some reason or other forfeited his seat in the European Parliament tomorrow and a by-election ensued in Northern Ireland it is not Mr. John Taylor's political grouping who would get the seat.  It is more likely that the seat would be taken by a more extreme Unionist group led by one of Mr. Taylor's arch political enemies.  If the Northern Ireland seat now held by the Nationalist minority was for any reason forfeited tomorrow and a by-election took place the Nationalist minority would be unrepresented in the European Parliament for the next three years.  Is that the kind of system which Fianna Fáil regard as superior to the one we are using here today?  I do not think any true democrat could support such a system.</P>
    <P>I believe many countries in Europe are <Col N="330" /> quite wrong in using a system which ensures that one of the best qualifications to have for membership of the European Parliament is to prove you were defeated in the European Parliamentary elections. That is what happens in any country which operates the system of taking the next in line.  For goodness sake do not let the people in this Parliament proceed to denigrate a system which we know in our heart of hearts is a fair one because it allows the electorate to be represented roughly proportionate to the manner in which they select representatives to Parliament. Our people voted that way knowing that is the system that would operate.  That is the way they voted in 1979.  It would be a denial of our responsibility to our electorate if we were now, in the middle of the first term of the European Parliament, to change the system. You do not change the rules in the middle of the game if you have any sense of fair play.  It could well be that before the end of the European Parliament there could be a change of Government here and I suspect Fianna Fáil may be endeavouring to fill a vacancy in their ranks in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on record our appreciation of the fact that the Fianna Fáil representatives in the European Parliament did not take the line in relation to the last three nominations from this Dáil that the Fianna Fáil Party are advocating today.  In a patriotic and responsible way they upheld the Irish legislation and accepted the decision of this Dáil.  I asked the Fianna Fáil Party to cease playing politics with European institutions and to cease giving, as they appear to relish giving, quotations to people like Mr. John Taylor so that he can use their denunciations of our system of representative democracy to make further attacks which he and his ilk like to make on this country.</P>
    <P>After due deliberation in this House and in the Seanad we adopted our system of replacing members of the European Parliament.  It is a good and fair system and ensures that the electorate have somebody who broadly represents their views, give or take a small margin of votes.  That is a good thing.  We know <Col N="331" /> under the way in which we practice democracy that if we had a by-election in the event of a vacancy occurring in the European Parliament the work of this House and of the other House would be seriously interfered with for several weeks because even a by-election for one seat out of 148 means, as far as we are capable of doing it, that we all take ourselves to the constituency where the by-election is taking place.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons which governed our decision not to have a by-election if there should be a vacancy in the European Parliament was because we did not want to have a situation in which you could have the local and national political work coming to a standstill because of the need to fill a vacancy in the European Parliament. If there was a readiness on all sides to play down the over-involvement of political personalities in by-election campaigns, if we agreed to contest by-election campaigns in the way they used to be reasonably contested 20 or 30 years ago, we could possible entertain the prospect of having by-elections in the future to the European Parliament.  When we have a situation in which one-quarter of the country would be involved in a by-election for the European Parliament, as far as the electorate are concerned, we could be certain that the whole political process here would come to a standstill because of the intensity with which we fight such campaigns.  That is a matter for consideration tomorrow and I do not see our abandonment of bad habits overnight. I again appeal to Fianna Fáil representatives to behave as responsible and patriotically as their representatives did in the European Parliament and approve this nomination today which is an exercise of the decision already taken by the Dáil and the Seanad.  We should not apologise to the rest of the world for a system of election which can compare more than favourably for the proportional representation which it gives to all sections of the people including minorities, with other systems.</P>

      <P>It is not poor Deputy Lenihan's day.  He <Col N="332" /> attempted to explain away a few things today and he landed every time with his face down in the mud.  He is a nice fellow really.  Most of us in this House and outside the House throughout the country realise that he is one of the nicest fellows you could meet socially but he is a dead loss as a politician.  On 9 July 1981 in Volume 329, column 352 of the Official Report he had this to say on the nomination of Mr. Cluskey:</P>
      <P>It can be said by Deputies opposite what alternative was there?  The Seanad is there; it is an obvious alternative. The Labour Party have, I suppose, two of their outstanding spokesmen in this House now seeking election to Seanad Éireann, former Deputies Horgan and Quinn, two of the best minds the last Dáil experienced sitting in these benches, and I can say that as a person sitting over there answering their very pointed questions day in day out.  These two excellent Deputies, two excellent minds, are now seeking election to Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>One of them is now seeking nomination from this House to the European Parliament. Poor Deputy Lenihan forgot what he said in July and he now says he is not suitable.  Maybe what happened to him earlier today has rattled him a bit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out to Deputy Lenihan and to the Fianna Fáil Party that I am a great believer in democracy and in the law of this land as passed by the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas had two things to say in the Bill which became law here in 1977.  The European Assembly Elections (No. 2) Bill, 1977 in Article 5 of the appendix says that the office of representative in the Assembly shall be compatible with membership of the Parliament of a member state.  That is very definite.  The only reason why Fianna Fáil are opposing the dual mandate, as they call it, is because for political reasons, fearing they would lose the last general election, they wanted to have a corner where they could refuse to agree to pairs as they would not have anybody in the European Parliament who was also in this House.  There is one little girl who <Col N="333" /> nearly got elected.  If she had got elected I believe Fianna Fáil would have a little bit of trouble with their dual mandate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of comments she made.  The explanatory memorandum to the Bill made the following statement regarding section 15:</P>
      <P>Article 12 of the Act annexed to the Council decision provides that subject to the other provisions of the Act each Member State shall lay down appropriate procedures for filling any seat that falls vacant during the life of the Assembly.  Under the existing electoral system in this country two different methods are employed for filling casual vacancies.  Such vacancies in the Dáil and among the elected members of the Seanad are filled by by-elections, while casual vacancies in the membership of local authorities are filled by co-option. This section provides that casual vacancies in the Irish representation of the Assembly will be filled by appointment by the Dáil of a person who is qualified under this Bill for election to the Assembly and where, following the preceding election, the seat falling vacant was held by a person who was a candidate of a registered political party, the appointment will be made by the Dáil on the nomination of that party.  Such a nomination must be made within three months of the vacancy arising.</P>
      <P>That is the law of the land.  The contempt for the law of the land shown by the two Deputies from Fianna Fáil who have spoken is obvious here this afternoon.  They put the Bill through the House and it was passed unanimously but it is not acceptable to them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps certain people in the European Parliament consider it is not an ideal way but, as Deputy Ryan pointed out, the way certain other states fill casual vacancies is not ideal from our point of view.  They did not ask us if what they did was the right thing to do; they abided by the law of their land.  Fianna Fáil went to. <Col N="334" /> considerable pains to explain their position when they were putting the Bill through the House and it is quite extraordinary now to find they are opposing the appointment of a person whom even Deputy Lenihan described as one of the best brains in the House.  Perhaps that is the reason.  Perhaps Fianna Fáil do not want the Labour Party to have people of the calibre of John Horgan.  Deputy Lenihan mentioned that John Horgan had been defeated in the election.  I remember Deputy Lenihan suffering defeat.  People in politics are subject to that.  However, Deputy Lenihan went into the Seanad and subsequently he was nominated for Europe.  For years the dual mandate operated and Deputies and Senators of the Fianna Fáil Party went to Europe.  They saw nothing wrong with that then.  I repeat the only reason they see anything wrong with the dual mandate now is because they were afraid they would be beaten at the last election and their view was that in the case of a tight vote it would be nice to be able to say they were not prepared to give pairs.  It was a lousy decision, a rotten decision to take.  It is contrary to the spirit of the Act and it could only be taken by the people who are running Fianna Fáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will substitute the word &ldquo;rotten&rdquo;.  On 26 October 1979, at column 126 of the Official Report, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. O'Kennedy, said:</P>
      <P>One of the most difficult problems related to Assembly elections is the selection of a method for filling casual vacancies.  In the electoral law of this country two methods of filling such vacancies in the membership of elected bodies are recognised.  Vacancies in the Dáil and among the elected members of the Seanad are filled by by-election while vacancies in the membership of local authorities are filled by co-option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to by-elections there are <Col N="335" /> two very serious objections in the context of Assembly elections.  First, there is the considerable expense and inconvenience of holding a by-election in the large constituencies proposed in the Bill but, more important, there is the distorting effect which by-elections could have in our representation in the Assembly.  There is of course a strong argument for by-elections in relation to the national Parliament in that they provide a useful method of testing public opinion between general elections and can, thus, have an important bearing on Government policy.</P>
    <P>This argument has no relevance in the context of the Assembly which will not have the task of appointing an executive to be responsible to it and for this reason their representational aspect becomes more important.  A by-election is therefore not a suitable device in this context but, on the other hand, direct co-option by the Assembly itself is also not appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Bill arranged to have co-option made, as was stated earlier.  Deputy Lalor continued on some what similar lines.  At column 1390 of the Official Report of 27 October 1977 he stated:</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal in relation to casual vacancies.  Provision is made that the nomination by the Dáil will come from the party of the person who has for some reason or other been responsible for the casual vacancy.  The explanatory memorandum states that where following the preceding election <Col N="336" /> the vacant seat was won by the representative of a registered political party, the appointment by the Dáil will be on the nomination of the party concerned.</P>
    <P>Today two Fianna Fáil Members are challenging their own Act.  They are saying it is wrong to do what the Oireachtas decided should be done, that we should have some other way.  On two occasions today Fianna Fáil Members had the audacity to decide that they should be able to select our candidates for elections. It is extraordinary to find Fianna Fáil so interested in selecting our candidates. Not long ago they had considerable difficulty in selecting one of their own.  I suggest they should work on that matter because it needs some work to ensure they do not get into trouble again.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hold up the business of the House, as Fianna Fáil have been doing.  We are doing what we are entitled to do under the law of the land when a casual vacancy arises.  We are saying that John Horgan is the person we want in Europe.  We consider it impertinent of Fianna Fáil to suggest that they have a right to decide what way we select our candidate or to decide that the law, because it does not suit them, should not be operated in the way it is laid down.</P>
    <P>I move that John Horgan be appointed as our candidate in the European Parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When the Government took office in July we found it necessary as a first priority to introduce a supplementary budget in order to protect our public finances. The Bill now before you gives statutory effect to the taxation changes which I announced on 21 July and includes some additional new tax measures.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with its individual provisions, I would like to recall the circumstances which made the supplementary budget necessary.  The new Government inherited a financial situation which had gone seriously out of control.  If developing trends had been allowed to continue unchecked, current spending for 1981 would have been nearly £500 million more than was provided in the budget estimate of last January.  This statistic alone illustrates vividly how critical the situation had become and how necessary it was to do something about it without delay.  The main object of the budget was to ensure that Ireland could remain an independent economy.  The options were to face reality immediately or to face an even worse situation later.</P>
      <P>The general reaction from the public to the measures proposed in the budget was one of acceptance of the unavoidable. It was encouraging to find that commentators were in general agreement that we acted with prudence and responsibility.</P>
      <P>But the July budget, as everyone knows, has not solved our financial difficulties. We are still faced with a deficit for 1981 of nearly £800 million.  Going into 1982 the position is worse, despite the fact that the measures taken in that budget will reduce by about £450 million the gap between spending and revenue that would have existed otherwise.  The main factor accounting for this deterioration still in prospect is that our Central Fund services, which are mainly debt service costs, will increase by about £400 million next year over this year.  In addition, there are once-off revenue gains of the order of £100 million this year, including the expected £66 million from the bringing forward of the Corporation Tax in payments date, which will not recur in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are continuing to borrow to an unacceptably high level to finance public expenditure and the consequent burden of debt imposes severe limitations on our ability to expand and develop the economy.  So we have no choice but to continue to exercise a very tight rein on public expenditure.  Between 1970 and 1980 Government debt increased eightfold from £1,000 million to £8,000 million. Foreign borrowing accounted for an increasing proportion of this debt.  At end-1980 our foreign debt was well over £2,200 million, compared with only £362 million as late as 1974, and by mid-1981 it had almost reached £3,000 million &mdash; up 35 per cent in six months.  As a result the cost of servicing debt is absorbing an ever-increasing share of our tax revenue. Thirty per cent of all revenue in 1981 will <Col N="341" /> be needed to service the public debt.  Put another way, approximately 80 per cent of total receipts from income tax will have to be set aside to meet the cost of borrowing.</P>
    <P>We must aim to develop the economy to the maximum of its potential and this is a first priority of the Government.  But to borrow almost to the point of recklessness is contrary to this aim.</P>
    <P>The level of borrowing reflects the size of the current deficit in recent years.  Let me put our position in perspective in an international context.  Despite the July budget we still have the highest current deficit for Central Government among all EEC member countries this year.  Most of the other member countries will be near to having a balanced budget but two of them, Belgium and Italy, regard their position as very serious because they face deficits of the order of 5 per cent to 6 per cent of their gross domestic product.  Our prospective 1981 deficit is 8 per cent of our gross domestic product.  Belgium and Italy have seen fit to take corrective action and have been informed by the EEC Commission that they cannot afford to support such high deficits.  We, too, have been advised by international institutions such as the EEC and the OECD that we cannot sustain our present level of borrowing and that we should in particular aim to eliminate borrowing for current spending with all possible speed. This advice has been given after due consideration of our position and it would be unwise to ignore it.</P>
    <P>It is not correct to argue that our good credit rating abroad is confirmation that our borrowing policies are in line with accepted practice.  This is not the criterion by which we should determine the extent to which we borrow.  A good credit rating is no guarantee that we can rely on an unending line of credit.  The fundamental consideration is that we have accumulated an unacceptable level of debt and that an unacceptably high share of our tax revenue is being absorbed by interest payments.</P>
    <P>I am circulating with this speech, for inclusion in the Official Report a table <Col N="342" /> showing our relative position within the EEC in regard to both budget and balance of payments deficits.</P>
    <P>This huge cost of debt is a deterrent to sound expansion, it is a deterrent to the generation of more employment and it has encouraged the economy to develop on an artificial and ultimately unsustainable basis.  It has led to excess spending on goods and services, much of which are imported, to the benefit of foreign economies. Government expenditure has a high import content.  For example, economic analysis shows that any given reduction in current Government expenditure leads to a fall of about three quarters of that amount in imports. Increased taxation, and increases in certain indirect taxes in particular, has an even greater impact on imports.  The July budget, by curbing the prospective over-run on current expenditure, and increasing indirect taxes, had a significant effect in restraining imports.</P>
    <P>The high level of imports, indirectly caused by the Government deficit, has led to a huge balance of payments deficit, now likely to be more than £1,400 million or 14 per cent of GDP in 1981.  This deficit is of unacceptable proportions by any standards, Irish or international.  In 1974 a payments deficit of 7½ per cent of GNP, barely more than half our present figure, induced the Government to take corrective action.  Our prospective deficit for this year is almost double the size, in relative terms, of the next largest payments deficit in the Community&mdash;that of Belgium, which is expected to amount to 7½ to 8 per cent of national output this year.  Apart from Belgium and countries whose balance of payments are in surplus &mdash;that is, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg and the Netherlands&mdash;the size of payments deficits in other EEC countries this year is expected to range between 1¼ per cent and 3½ per cent of national output.</P>
    <P>It is irrational and irresponsible to be borrowing more and more money to pay our way from day to day.  It is for this reason that a budget was introduced last July.  It has not solved our difficulties but was an overdue step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> I now turn to the individual provisions of the Bill.  Part I of the Bill is concerned with customs and excise matters.  Sections 2 to 7 confirm the budget increases in the excise duties on alcohol, tobacco products and hydrocarbon oils.  As I said in July, increases in these duties were unavoidable if we were to redress the difficult financial situation and to help pay for the concessions announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>In section 8 provision is made for the abolition of the annual registration charges of £20 and £5 respectively on cars not exceeding 16 horse-power and motor cycles and the re-imposition of road tax on these vehicles at the rates which applied prior to August 1977.  Provision is also made for a reduction in the initial registration charge on new vehicles to the 1977 levels and for an increase in the rate of road tax on cars exceeding 16 horse-power from £6 per horse-power to £8 per horse-power.  These changes came into effect on 1 September last.  They will bring in £8 million in 1981 and £27.5 million in 1982.  The abolition of the road tax in 1977 was unwarranted.  It meant a loss of badly-needed tax revenue and it ran contrary to the commitment to energy saving.  Most people will agree that it is right and proper that it should be restored.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with a technical matter. It revokes an order adjusting the composition of the rate of excise duty on cigarettes imposed in the July budget. The adjustment ensured that there would be no increase in the excise duty on cigarettes as a consequence of the increase in the rate of VAT from 10 per cent to 15 per cent on 1 September.  The provisions of the order are now incorporated in section 4.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill contains the value-added tax provisions.  Section 11 gives effect to the increase in the annual turnover registration thresholds promised in my July budget statement as an incentive to small business.  Under the proposed new limits a trader whose business consists entirely or almost entirely of the sale <Col N="344" /> of goods will not have to register unless his annual turnover is likely to exceed £30,000 and other traders will not have to register unless their annual turnover is likely to exceed £15,000.  The new £30,000 limit compares with existing ceilings of £18,000 and £9,000 and the figure of £15,000 covers the category heretofore catered for by a threshold of £3,000.  The increases are very substantial.  They simplify the present system and they largely restore and in some cases improve in real terms the levels set originally in 1972. The new levels should allow as many as 500 traders to discontinue registration for VAT purposes.  The cost in 1982 is expected to be somewhat less than £¾ million.  The section also contains a technical provision to ensure that immovable goods supplied by one taxable person to another, where both are registered together as a group for VAT purposes, will not thereby be relieved of any VAT otherwise chargeable on such a transaction.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 13 give effect to the VAT changes announced in the July budget, namely, the increase in the lower rate of VAT from 10 to 15 per cent, the compensating increase in the flat-rate addition from 1 per cent to 1½ per cent for unregistered farmers and the extension of the 3 per cent effective rate for building to agricultural contracting services. I would like to emphasise that under these arrangements the farming community will not have to bear a net increase in their VAT burden.  This is ensured by the increase in the flat-rate addition and by the special provision for agricultural contractors.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for the deferment, in respect of the taxable period 1 September to 31 December 1981, of the VAT increase on tourist services supplied to tour operators, travel agents or car hire firms for the benefit of visitors from outside the State in those cases where prices were settled prior to 1 January 1981.  The provision is intended to allow, for a further four months, the completion of important formal contractual arrangements involving visitors from outside the State without increase of VAT.  I considered <Col N="345" /> this concession to be necessary in order to allow the industry to fulfil these contracts without incurring additional costs.  This arrangement will apply retrospectively to 1 September and the value of the concession to the industry is estimated at £½ million.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains two stamp duty sections.</P>
    <P>I announced in the budget that I would be imposing a special £5 million levy on the banking sector and this is now provided for by section 16.  The money will be obtained by way of a stamp duty, which will be charged on the current and deposit accounts of each bank.  This duty is being calculated by reference to the average level of accounts for the period April to June of this year and it is to be paid within 14 days of the passing of the Bill.  Section 17 provides for a new stamp duty on credit cards and certain charge cards, which I also gave notice of in my budget speech.  The duty will come into effect early next year and it will be at a rate of £5 per annum.  It will complement the duty on cheques which was increased to 5 pence per cheque last August.  Supplementary cards issued to individuals will not be charged to the duty.</P>
    <P>Section 18 is a technical provision.  It clarifies the application of section 54 of the Finance Act, 1970, which gives permanent statutory authority to the Minister for Finance to raise money for the Exchequer by means of the creation and issue of securities.  The present section confirms that a loan agreement is a security for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I have given a resumé of the provisions in the Bill.  For the most part it is concerned with the taxation changes announced in the supplementary budget.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to return again briefly to the factors which have made it necessary to have a second Finance Bill this year.  Most of the taxation changes which are incorporated in this Bill are designed to increase tax revenue and thus help to maintain within reasonable limits the huge burden of State borrowing.  It is, of course, easy to <Col N="346" /> be highly critical of each particular tax increase in isolation.  It is also easy to take the overall package of increases and reject it on the grounds that it is too severe an imposition of taxation.  But it is less than honest to comment on the tax increases while overlooking the question of our public finances.  Those who advocate more spending or less taxation must follow through the consequences of this. It is heartening that the Irish public generally appreciate that we have been living beyond our means and that it would be irresponsible to continue as if the resulting financial problems would simply go away in the longer term.  It is wishful thinking to suggest that an upturn in the world economy will lift us out of our difficulties.  It is unfair to create the impression that our borrowing is being used to create more wealth for the nation when in fact a large proportion of it is needed simply to meet our day-to-day expenses.</P>
    <P>The measures taken in the supplementary budget and confirmed in the Bill now before you are an essential part of the process of reconstructing our public finances after the spendthrift approach that was followed in recent years.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>This Bill is for the purpose of implementing the budget provisions introduced by the new Government in July.  It is clear from the contribution of the Minister this afternoon that what I said at that time was correct, that was, that the budget was no more than a propaganda exercise on the part of the Government in an effort to throw responsibility on their predecessors. There has been reference already to the Pandora's Box offered to the public in the run-up to the general election.  It is not my intention to dwell to much on the pre-election gimmicks of the parties opposite but it is well known now that the attitude of Ministers is that Government's programme was designed to woo the voters but that now that they are in office they will do what they believe to be right.  Their programme and the so-called Gaiety programme constituted the reason for the July budget and, consequently, the reason for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill represents the implementation of the first stage of the Government's economic strategy and, despite the lip service paid to a non-existent counter-inflation programme, the Government have added 5 per cent to the cost of living whereas a reduction in the inflation figures was the central theme of the Fine Gael proposals.  This additional 5 per cent in the cost of living has pushed the inflation figure from the 17 per cent level at which it was when we left office to a minimum level of 22 per cent, the figure admitted now by all experts.  It may possibly be more.  In these circumstances is it surprising that the national pay talks should break down?  There is an apparent lack of interest on the part of the Government <Col N="348" /> in those talks, but we must not be surprised at the breakdown in negotiations when there is a 15½ per cent difference between price rises and proposed income increases, which, according to the Taoiseach, will be a critical element in economic strategy.  The prospects for wage moderation have been seriously damaged by spiralling inflation but what is particularly demoralising to the people is that there appears to be no end in sight so far as inflation is concerned.  The Government have committed themselves to an income tax package which is regarded by every respected economic authority as madness precisely because it will add to inflation.  Massive indirect taxation will have to be imposed in next January's budget, especially as the cost of the package has escalated from an estimated £263 million to £300 million.</P>
    <P>Our opposition to this Bill is based mainly on its representing a major step in changing to indirect taxation which affects all sections of the community.  Perhaps the Minister's recent activities and absences have led to his being out of touch with his own community but any Member of this House has only to walk into a shop or a public house to realise the decline in activity as a result of that indirect taxation.  One has only to talk to the recipients of social welfare, a group to which the Government parties have paid so much lip service for so long, to realise how their problems have been added to as a result of the July budget. The pittances granted to social welfare recipients&mdash;5p in the case of an orphan, for instance, and 85p in the case of a widow&mdash;are insignificant having regard to the increase in the cost of living that has been fuelled by those parties who have talked so much about the elimination of poverty.  However, Deputy Woods will be going into this area in much greater detail.  Never before have this category suffered so much.</P>
    <P>Neither the economy nor the people generally can afford the cost of this Government's programme.  Industry is suffering from the high level of inflation and the situation is even worse in regard to agriculture.  I am surprised to hear the <Col N="349" /> Minister refer to the benefits in this Bill so far as farmers are concerned.  When he was on these benches he ranted and raved about the impact of inflation on farm incomes.</P>
    <P>We, too, believed that current deficit borrowing was not advisable and should be terminated but we contended that it should be terminated within a reasonable and a sensible period.  We cannot compare our situation with that of the Belgians or of the Italians or, indeed, of any other of the Community countries.  This Government have forgotten about people.  We have a growing population, unlike our European partners.  More than 25 per cent of our population is under 25 years of age, so the need for growth to cater for employment opportunities for those young people is great and every member of this House must have been inundated with requests from parents and young people themselves when the belated leaving certificate results &mdash; belated because of industrial action within the public service &mdash; became available. Fathers and mothers on behalf of their children and young people themselves are now seeking employment.  It is sad to see how few the opportunities are. Of course, we are told there cannot be any further intake into the civil service, the public sector is overloaded, overmanned. The public service sector in this country has served the nation well and has catered for the community's growing needs, the growing needs of a bigger population and of current administration to meet the essential services for that growing population.  This Government have set out deliberately to say: &ldquo;It is on your shoulders, you shall not have any increase or any extra numbers.&rdquo;  I understand that even within Departments at the moment replacements are not being approved for vacancies occurring.  Young people have little opportunity of being recruited this year into the public sector at local or national level.  The professional services even have been curtailed and the opportunities for those who have gone through third level education institutes are very few.</P>
    <P>All in what interest?  It is in the interest, <Col N="350" /> as I have said, of propagating further a propaganda exercise all caused by the need to implement a mad tax package deliberately foisted on the electorate to win votes at some considerable cost and expense now and in the future.  That is why we are opposed to this Bill designed to swing to indirect taxation at too great an imposition on those not well equipped to bear the impact and effect of that indirect taxation.  This Government cannot go on adding gratuitously to inflation while at the same time maintaining a fixed exchange rate.</P>
    <P>One of the points to come most clearly out of the report of the three economists is the crucial role of the exchange rate in maintaining competitiveness and this is underlined dramatically by the last-minute revision downwards of three percentage points of the proposed norms.  Why and how was that 9.5 per cent norm originally reached reduced to 6.5?  People in society realising the need for employment opportunities have to compare that 6.5 per cent with the 22 per cent plus inflation rate that we will see, at least 5 per cent of which has already been contributed to by the direct actions of this Government.  It is clear that exchange rate involatility can make complete nonsense within a very short period of competitive norms and that the exercise lacks credibility.  A major part of the Fine Gael economic strategy has collapsed as a result.  We will hear more about that in the weeks and months ahead and see it more clearly.  The independent economic commission and the norms which they would lay down were the centre-piece of that party's anti-inflation policy and it is manifest that they have not been accepted and that there was no chance of acceptance once inflation had increased.  In other words, the action of the Minister for Finance in July immediately retarded those norms from ever having any public acceptance.</P>
    <P>I understand from a reliable authority that the Government are having enormous difficulty in putting their tax package together, and small wonder.  It is evident that little research was done on it and very little thought given to it.  There are major difficulties, and major decisions <Col N="351" /> on the mode of operation have still to be made.  The tax officers are demoralised, as most Members of this House know well, and they are in a state of total confusion.  Sending out some 300,000 cheques of £9.60 every week will not improve the circumstances of any household, will add an extra burden of administration and will require extra staff at a time when the Government have frozen extra posts for the civil service and said: &ldquo;Thou shalt nor recruit, thou shalt not fill existing vacancies.&rdquo;  How does one try to make those impossibles meet?  We all know here that representatives of this House have resource to the tax offices because of the normal problems of their constituents, and one will be told there that they dread the impact here.  This is only part of the whole problem.  We are talking now about the wife at home and that famous £9.60.  What about the wife whose husband is a low wage earner paying no or little income tax?  How is she catered for?  Where does her £9.60 come from and who pays it?  We on this side of the House are interested in that.  This is indirect taxation at enormous cost, again to fuel inflation.  We want to know also about the widow in receipt of a social welfare pension.  Does she get an increase in her pension, plus the £9.60 that she cannot get from the husband who is no longer there?  What about the wife of a small shopkeeper or a small farmer?  Do they get the £9.60?  Have we now created further divides in society by switching the £9.60 and paying it by cheque into households that will, as the result of the measures which must be taken to provide it, be no better off and may be worse off?</P>
    <P>We will be asking these questions during the weeks and months ahead and the answers are causing enormous tensions and strains within the Government at present.  An election pledge which was no more than a cheap gimmick to win votes &mdash; and which has been described as that by some of the present Government in private conversation &mdash; is now no longer of interest to them because it did what they intended it to do.  It is distorting the whole thrust of economic policy and <Col N="352" /> is the whole reason for the Finance Bill which we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>If the Government carry out their intentions we will soon be faced with departmental Estimates for the next year &mdash; at least that is what we were promised. We expect that this will be part of what the Dáil will be doing during this session particularly now that we have a heavy legislative programme, as we were led to believe this morning.  Because we have a heavy legislative programme the people of Cavan-Monaghan were deprived by the vote of this Government and a few supporters walking through the lobby from exercising the normal opportunity that would be afforded to electors in such circumstances where a seat lay vacant.  If the Government carry out their intentions we will be seeing shortly the departmental Estimates for next year which may cause substantial reductions.  We will be awaiting with interest what these Estimates will be or if there will be cutbacks in them and are some of the current speeches of Ministers at present designed to cater for cutbacks?  Are those cutbacks all in the interest of the madness of a package prepared by the Fine Gael Party in the early months of this year?</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, although there seems to be some confusion as to how or why he missed a decision that apparently had been taken at Government level, added words of advice, along with the IMF and the Director of the ESRI in pressing the Government to postpone its tax package or to have it introduced on a phased basis. While the Government are ready to quote these authorities when it suits them they will ignore their advice when they choose.  I was interested in the Minister's speech to the House this evening and to see his change of heart in a short time.  It was interesting to hear him say that it is not correct to argue that our credit rating abroad is confirmation that our borrowing policies are in line with accepted practice. He is using the argument that we have a good credit rating.  Yet the Taoiseach said outside the country and at home that our credit rating abroad at that time was not a worthy one.  Of course, he <Col N="353" /> knew it was, but his irresponsibility was forcing him to say other things for purely party political purposes.  His colleague at the time on this side of the House, Deputy Bruton, now Minister for Finance, made the very same accusations, but now he uses the fact that our credit rating was good &mdash; in other words, admitting that what he had said then was incorrect.  He uses it now to advance his argument here.</P>
    <P>That is the type of Government we have, putting an unbearable burden on the ordinary citizen simply because of a mad tax package devised in a moment of desperation.  It was not researched or thought out and will cause great difficulty in its implementation.  Most people will probably be worse off.  It will be divisive and discriminatory unless it covers all people in a similar category, including the stay at home wife, whatever position her husband holds.</P>
    <P>At a recent conference attended by the Taoiseach on The Irish Economy and Society in the Eighties, Mr. K.A. Kennedy, Director of the Economic and Social Reserch Institute, said that the Government had abandoned the fort on unemployment.  Surely it is our biggest problem?  I said earlier that youth unemployment was a problem far greater for our economy than for any of our EEC partners because of our young population and because of its growth.  Yet every action of the Government has been directly opposite to what it should have been if they were interested in promoting employment.  The drop in activity in the services sector has been so evident because of the impact and impositions of the budget that gave rise to the Finance Bill.  As a result not only are there no job opportunities in the services area but the numbers of jobs are being reduced in many different areas.</P>
    <P>We strained to hold down unemployment figures which, until June last, has risen at a lesser rate than in most other EEC countries.  It rose by 27 per cent here in comparison with a rise of over 60 per cent in Britain and the Netherlands and 44 per cent in Germany.  Unemployment showed signs of estabilising in May <Col N="354" /> and June.  It is now bound to rise as a result of the Government's inflationary policies.  They have frozen jobs in the public service and put the whole burden of job creation on the private sector.  If, as the Taoiseach said for the first time at the weekend, the creation and preservation of jobs is the Government's first priority, why has he imposed a freeze on the creation of posts in the public sector? Why has he reduced the number of teaching posts in primary schools and teacher training colleges?  I am sure my colleague, Deputy Wilson, will cover that subject in greater detail.  With so many of our population under the age of 25 this must be viewed with great seriousness.</P>
    <P>The Tuam sugar factory is to close down in a year's time with the loss of 400 jobs and jobs in our semi-State companies such as Aer Lingus and the B+I are at risk.  One major job-creating organisation, the IDA, are also under attack from Coalition Ministers.  They are talking about paying back grants.  The Coalition Government, by knocking the economy, are discouraging foreign investors and no amount of palliatives, national development corporations or youth employment programmes will have any effect.  The Government's economic policy is having the effect of throwing large numbers on the dole.  There is little doubt that by next year unemployment will have reached 150,000 or 160,000 as a direct result of the Government adopting the wrong policy at the wrong time.</P>
    <P>Our young people have little hope.  To give an indication of the lack of interest by State agencies at present or perhaps the lack of interest by the Government, recently the ESB sent a circular letter to State agencies like the Industrial Credit Corporation, Fóir Teoranta and other agencies of that nature involved in financing industry, especially ailing industries. The ESB, in their wisdom, decided on a change of approach.  They said that, if there were any moneys due to that State body by companies in receivership, before a recommendation of supply the ESB would be paid first or, alternatively, at best, that arrangements would be made so that the receiver, and not the <Col N="355" /> company which had run into receivership and probably might not be in a position to pay, would accept responsibility for the burden.  That may sound very good in economic terms.  It may be very sensible bookkeeping on the ESB's part. However, it demonstrates very clearly the lack of Government commitment to maintaining jobs, let alone creating them.  All of us know in our own constituencies that such unfortunate happenings take place from time to time and there is always a problem of power supply. Furthermore, this State board have informed their Department which is run by the Tánaiste, Leader of the remanants of a once proud Labour Party, and he has not seen fit to take any action to prevent this measure being implemented.  That is the commitment which we have from this Government towards employment.</P>
    <P>Now, let me take the details of the Bill itself.  We spelt out in detail in the debate in July what would be the result on the CPI of the imposition of indirect taxation on beer, cigarettes and spirits.  It cannot be denied that we had, in the two previous budgets, also hit those old reliables. One must ask when is the stage of diminishing return reached?  If we are to judge by the lack of activity in the various shops, hostelries and pubs, that diminishing return stage is being reached.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is the very serious impact on employment.  One knows so well that the intake into the services sector in recent times has been extremely valuable, particularly in the case of youth employment.  It now appears that there is a shedding of employment rather than an intake.  All those early sections of the Bill are affecting the CPI substantially and throwing a greater burden on industry, the farm, the home, the worker, and on the social welfare beneficiary who, as I said, was offered in return a mere pittance by a Government which pays lip service to eliminating poverty.</P>
    <P>That brings me to some of the other impositions.  During the last budget debate and the previous one we listened to the speeches from the other side of the House.  The present Minister for Finance <Col N="356" /> and his colleague, the present Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, those two particularly, condemning us, as a Government, for increases in petrol costs and the hard, savage imposition on the rural and urban dweller and on the industry generally. Our imposition on the motoring public fades into insignificance compared with the terms of this Bill.  Look at one after the other of the savage impositions, first on petrol itself secondly, the duty on the price of a car.  Remember we still have a substantial number of people working in our car industry in exceptionally difficult times.  Now there is a car duty.  They are further affected by the increases in VAT in this Finance Bill.  Also, the fact that VAT is added to servicing the car and to spare parts makes it a savage burden on the motoring public.</P>
    <P>This afternoon, the Minister obviously forgot all that he had said when here on this side of the House and I look forward to Committee Stage of this Bill, to reminding him then of what he said to me a few short months ago.  When he was going through the sections of the Bill today, he spoke about the car tax and said that the abolition of the road tax in 1977 was unwarranted.  It meant a loss of our badly needed tax revenue and ran contrary to the commitment to energy savings.  &ldquo;Most people will agree that it is right and proper that it should be restored.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Who &ldquo;most people&rdquo; are, I am not sure. Certainly, I will find it very hard to discover anybody who agrees that it should be restored.  I remember him, a few short months ago, crying to high heaven because we had increased the registration fee, saying that we were really imposing a car tax.  He now turns and says that it should never have been abolished.  The hyprocrisy emanating from the Government is almost unbelievable.</P>
    <P>What about the impact on those employed in that industry?  Again, there is a very important service sector in that industry.  Is it already true that people are being shed in that area as well?  We talk about monetarist policies, although there are people in this House, including Deputy <Col N="357" /> Ryan, who would tell me that these are not monetarist policies being introduced by the present Government.  This Government have forgotten completely about the most important ingredient in our 1981 society, and that is people &mdash; young people, particularly.  That is why this morning the Government fear the voters of Cavan-Monaghan.  The House knows full well that when they went there to test and sound out the ground, they knew full well that those voters would give them the answer which the voters of Ireland would like to give them at present. No Government can afford to forget about people, particularly in a population as young as ours.</P>
    <P>Can we be sure that the motor industry, already hard his prior to the July impositions, will not now suffer more severly, and the very important services sector?  The Bill goes into some detail to reintroduce the road tax.  The Minister, with some relish, referred to section 8 of the Bill this evening as if he were getting great satisfaction in imposing a tax on the farmers in his own constituency and on the workers in mine &mdash; those whom he cried for back in the earlier months of this year, those working 20, 30 or 40 miles from home, driving to and fro.  Since this budget was introduced, in my constituency people have come to me seeking employment nearer home, happy that they have employment but realising that the added cost of travelling is eating into their earning power.  Taking all this into consideration, an independent commission come out with a norm of 6½ per cent. I am not in any way of taking from the capacity of those three experts to do a job afforded to them.  However, I am saying that their task was made impossible before ever it started, because of the impact of this Finance Bill, the fuelling of inflation which seems to give such satisfaction to all spokesmen on the Government side of the House.</P>
    <P>I can see the diminished Labour Party voting for this Bill and I want to tell them that their supporters are extremely disturbed. Here is a once proud party supporting tough monetary policies typical of any Fine Gael Government of the past. <Col N="358" /> I have no doubt some Independents may purge their consciences by press statements or otherwise and who will remain seated or else walk dutifully through the lobbies when the time comes simply because they have had the playback from the ground which frightened them from facing the electorate at this time.</P>
    <P>In principle, my party believe banks and financial institutions should pay a fair and equitable amount of tax.  We will discuss the details of this Bill more fully on Committee Stage.  My predecessor, Mr. Michael O'Kennedy, established the commission on taxation whose members were representative of Irish society.  He hoped to get an interim report from them on financial institutions simply because as I said, we believe banks and financial institutions should pay their fair share of tax.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we should have a strong banking system.  I hope the relevant section in this Bill is not being introduced to buy votes because if that is the reason I would regard it as a dangerous precedent.  What happened the commission on taxation established by Mr. O'Kennedy?  What are the views of the present Minister for Finance?  Has he met the members of the commission?  Can he say when a report might be issued?  I should hope that because of the interim report the Minister for Finance will have a broader base on which to work at budget time when he is imposing taxation.  Everybody knows the scope for movement of any Minister for Finance has been narrowed but I would like the Minister to tell the House what his attitude is towards that commission and when he expects to receive their report. As I said, this is an extremely important commission and I too am looking forward to reading their report.</P>
    <P>I am not very sure about the intentions behind section 17 (3) which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>There shall be furnished to the Revenue Commissioners by a bank or a promoter, as the case may be, such particulars as the Revenue Commissioners may deem necessary in relation <Col N="359" /> to any statement required by this section to be delivered by the bank or promoter.</P>
    <P>To what statements are we referring? How deeply are we going into the banking business?  Are we going into individual accounts or are we, by a back door method, pursuing certain people?  I have read the earlier sections but I want to know if that section gives the Revenue Commissioners more scope to go after people they suspect of avoiding tax.  I would like the Minister to spell this out clearly in his reply.  I realise we will have the opportunity of going into detail on Committee Stage but in the meantime we are entitled to know the intentions behind this section.</P>
    <P>It is on Committee Stage that every Deputy can make his contribution to improve a Bill because sometimes measures appear ideal on the surface but when looked at in detail can be found to cause many problems.  That has been the experience in relation to Finance Bills in the past.  Sections imposed for very good reasons were used by certain people to avoid or evade tax.  We must examine every line of the Bill very closely and carefully to ensure that this does not happen.</P>
    <P>Was the Minister wise to jump at the 50 per cent increase in VAT on what are essential ingredients in the life of the ordinary person?  We talk about essential foodstuffs and clothing being exempt, and it is right that they are.  The Minister has increased VAT on other essential items by 50 per cent.  One could sum it up by saying that luxury goods, essential foodstuffs and clothing are excluded, but the VAT rate is increased on everything else.  I referred to the impact of this imposition and the decrease in activity which has become so apparent in every area.  Last month will be known as &ldquo;Black September&rdquo; because of the introduction of the new VAT rate.  We are opposing this Bill because of its move towards indirect taxation and the real hardship which is being caused.  My colleague. Deputy Woods, will give details of the severity of these impositions on the less <Col N="360" /> privileged in our society.  Has the Minister any idea of the difficulties faced by an elderly widow trying to buy coal?  She receives an increase of only 85p.</P>
    <P>The Minister married only recently and perhaps he is not aware that September is the time when children return to school and parents must buy school books.  This heavy burden has been worsened this year by the 50 per cent increase in VAT on these books.  Was this deliberately arranged by the Minister so that there would be a worth-while income from these sales?  Parents have no option but to buy the required books.</P>
    <P>During the term of the previous Coalition Government the present Taoiseach was the very flamboyant Minister for Foreign Affairs while Deputy Richie Ryan carried the burden of Finance.  They became known as prophets of doom and gloom and perhaps that is why Deputy Ryan is sitting on the back benches.  The present Government are fighting for the same title and if they remain in office long enough they will outstrip their prede cessors in undermining confidence and preaching doom and gloom.  I accept that this is a time of world difficulty but at such a time we must endeavour to support our own economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the deficit and referred to the same figure as the present Taoiseach when interviewed during the election campaign.  Prior to that election he led the pleading from these benches for more subsidies.  Is he now saying that the needs of social welfare recipients should not have been attended to, that extra assistance should not be given to farmers, that subsidies should not have been given on essential foodstuffs?  It appears that there has been an about-turn since he left these benches. The first step was the budget, the implementation of which we are now discussing. When its full impact is felt it will be seen as both inflationary and deflationary. One brilliant spark opposite asked how it could be both.  The inflationary impact on the cost of living is caused by the imposition of indirect taxes and the <Col N="361" /> resultant down-turn in activity causes the deflationary effect.</P>
    <P>The VAT increase was the most savage of all, especially in its timing.  Some may ask why people did not purchase school books before 1 September but perhaps the books were not available then or the money was in short supply.  The newspaper industry gives substantial employment in major towns and cities.  Is the new income derived to be <i>pro rata</i> as high because of an understandable reluctance, perhaps, in the case of homes suffering the effects of this budget to buy a newspaper or periodical less?  Is somebody's job being placed in jeopardy by that change and will any extra revenue earned be worth the possible impact this measure will have on employment?</P>
    <P>We have all heard of the campaign by provincial newspaper proprietors about the difficulties they are experiencing. They would be entitled to say that we all turned the deaf ear to them but there is no doubt that in some cases they were going through extremely difficult times. At that time they appealed for the removal of the tax but now they are faced with a 50 per cent increase and that is bound to have an impact on sales.  If it does have that impact on sales will it have a resultant impact on employment?  If that is so will it mean that there will be other people queuing up to draw unemployment benefit and taking away any revenue that may be gained because of the imposition?  It is interesting to note that copybooks are not included.</P>
    <P>When we discuss the building industry we must remember that it is our second major industry.  It is of great importance in rural and urban Ireland and it has given good and lucrative employment over the years.  The industry can be fuelled quickly by Government action or resources and, because of the widespread nature of its operations and the many services and service industries or suppliers it builds around it, it gives great employment. That industry is not going through the easiest of times at present.  We are all aware of the hike that has taken place in bank interest rates and we have been warned that there is more to come. <Col N="362" /> Young couples faced with a big mortgage last July must now pay a lot more and, if experts are right in their predictions, they will be paying still more shortly.  Such happenings affect the building industry. If in this important area we suffer a down-turn and consequent unemployment then those people will return to the employment exchange to draw money which is being collected by the Government in VAT but must be used to pay unemployment benefit.  Again, an extremely deflationary aspect of the budget.</P>
    <P>One could list all the items that are affected by the budget, those that used carry the 10 per cent VAT rate which has been increased to 25 per cent.  The easiest way to describe those items that now carry the 25 per cent VAT rate is to eliminate or omit the luxury goods and items such as clothing, footwear and essential foodstuffs.  Other than those items everything that goes into a home, an industry or a farm is caught by additional taxation.</P>
    <P>Children's drinks, ice cream and sweets are also subject to the increase.  Is that human consideration?  We must remember that in this case we are not only talking about the children because the drinks, ice cream and sweets are manufactured here.  Again, one must ask the question if there must be a cutback in the purchasing power of a household because of the tax imposition will there be a cutback in the purchase of children's drinks, ice cream and sweets?  We must also ask if that will result in jobs being lost.  If that is so we will witness more of the deflationary impact which is an integral part of the proposals before the House.</P>
    <P>We should all examine our consciences about the impact of the budget.  The summer recess must have given Members an opportunity of assessing the real impact of the Minister's proposals.  If Members moved among their constituents during the summer they would certainly be aware of the downturn and the lack of activity I have referred to.  If that is the situation are we encouraging and promoting unemployment in our growing <Col N="363" /> young population at a time when school leavers are seeking employment?  They should be, and must be, the major consideration.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the Finance Bill serves a very important function.  I am not saying that discussion on the Constitution is not important but in regard to it, as our leader stated, we have made our position known and it is now up to the Government to put forward their proposals but in the meantime let us return to the main problems of our society which I have outlined this evening.  Those problems relate to youth employment, which should be given a high priority, and unemployment generally.  What about the employment agency?  What good things will we hear about it?  The sooner we hear them the better so that we can examine them.  Any measure that will help create employment in any way, particularly youth employment, will have our support provided it is a real and genuine attempt by the Government to solve that important problem.  It appears that very little thought was given to anything else other than justifying a propaganda campaign implementing and imposing a tax package that had not been researched or thought out and is now a burden around the necks of the members of the Government and is the cause of much internal strain.  It is causing headaches to many people who are well advised, well informed and experienced in regard to taxation because they do not know how it can be implemented or serviced at a time when the Government are talking about cutbacks and about non-replacement of people.  How does one bring those two ends together?  The results, I fear, are frightening.  The Leader of the Labour Party put himself in a rather unusual alliance with the International Monetary Fund in advising caution and phased introduction because even he saw the folly of this policy.  It will make no household better off and will obviously make some worse off.</P>
    <P>I referred to the commitment by the Minister for Finance in the budget in saying that the departmental Estimates would be changed in format and that they <Col N="364" /> would be introduced here before Christmas instead of after the budget as before. I would not disagree that that is a worth-while step forward.  But if, on the other hand, the indications at present being given by some of the Ministers are designed to be kites flown to cover possible cutbacks on the way, then I fear that the mistakes of the budget will be seen as a way of compensating for all that has already been promised in Pandora's Box.</P>
    <P>I referred already to the price increases, the imposition of indirect taxes.  They are also affected by the imposition of the 50 per cent increase in VAT.  Of course the services are affected to an enormous degree.  What I am saying is that the measures here before us this evening are not designed to help our country at a time of world recession, at a time of explosion in our population never seen before by us and not being experienced by the other EEC member states.  I do not defend borrowing for the sake of borrowing.  I have always said that borrowing for productive purposes makes sound economic sense, particularly in a world recession, because it generates more activity in our infrastructure and services, which we need.  If I would level a charge at Governments of the past it is that during periods of recession such investment was not made in our roads, water services and communications.  We have evidence of this in all areas of our country.  The better our infrastructural services are the greater chance we have if we have a Government committed to groups like the IDA in promoting and developing industrial growth and job creation in our society.  Therefore, on the capital budget I believe it is proper to borrow to meet our needs.</P>
    <P>The current deficit is a different problem which has to be brought under control. But how, over what period and by what method needs more thought and careful consideration than just imposing hardship on people.  That is not being done for the purposes for which the Minister for Finance is trying to make out it is being done.  It is being done to accommodate the tax package that was used so extensively in May and early June this <Col N="365" /> year to get votes for the Government. This tax package is now costing the Irish people dearly.  The buying of votes is one thing but they were bought dearly.  It was a very clever manoeuvre by the Taoiseach on the evening he announced his Government when he said that the books were much worse than he thought. Everybody knows that he barely had time to fit in a two or three minutes press conference on his way back from the Park to appoint the Government here.  Obviously it was a strategy that had been thought out in advance to condition the people for the measures that will be necessary to introduce the £9.60.  It will be paid out in a discriminatory way.  It will make no household better off.  It will not apply to many housewives who will have to stay at home too because their husbands are not in the tax net or because they are widows or because they are small farmers, shopkeepers and business people. These are questions I would like the Minister to address himself to when replaying to this debate.  I would like the Minister to tell us who will get this money and to give us good reasons for not opposing this Bill.  But until such time as the Minister does this to our satisfaction, I see no option but to oppose the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill affects every person in our society.  I referred to the farmer. Some small concessions are being made. But the imposition of the 5 per cent minimum increase in CPI is a huge burden on him.  His motoring costs have gone through the roof.  The worker in the city, the town or in rural Ireland finds that nowadays a car is no longer a luxury but an essential means of transport to work. I remember Deputy Richie Ryan introducing an imposition some years ago saying that there was waste and people could use one car where four were being used. That is very easy to say for someone who does not know the difficulties in rural Ireland.  What is being imposed today is increased duty on the purchase of the car, increased VAT on that car, a huge hike in petrol, the restoration &mdash; with some delight apparently on the part of the Minister &mdash; of the road tax and, of course, the most expensive item of all: the VAT <Col N="366" /> on spare parts and servicing that makes motoring very expensive.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry has been given a temporary concession in the Bill before us.  We are all aware of the difficulties being experienced by the tourist industry.  The imposition of that 50 per cent increase in VAT on almost everything will affect the tourist industry too. The tourist industry is a service industry and hotels do worthwhile packages. Groups book 12 months in advance.  It can be difficult for the organisers and the operators of those tours to get the 50 per cent increase in VAT.  A concession is given to them in the Bill extending this up to the end of December.  I am glad the Minister has seen some light.  He needs to see more light before any other steps like that are taken which can hinder this industry.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <Title>Private Members Business. - Tuam Sugar Factory Closure: Motion</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy MacSharry on 20 October 1981:</P>
    <P>That having regard to the deeply serious social and economic repercussions for the West of Ireland which would follow the closure of the Tuam sugar factory, Dáil Éireann requests the Government to take whatever steps are necessary to maintain sugar beet processing operations and ancillary activities in Tuam and in particular to promote actively beet growing in neighbouring farming areas in order to ensure adequate future supplies for the sugar factory.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann endorses the Government's decision that Exchequer resources be provided for Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teo. to enable it to continue sugar production at <Col N="367" /> Tuam for the 1982/83 beet campaign and that absolute priority would be given to securing new industry in the Tuam area with a view to providing alternative employment opportunities.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Agriculture)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reported progress last night I was speaking about the growth in the sugar industry.  It is encouraging to note that there was an increase in the acreage of beet grown this year in the Tuam area.  There was a 39 per cent increase over the previous year.  Some of our young farmers have played a very important part in this increased acreage of beet.  It is a very encouraging sign that the Sugar Company and Macra na Feirme are involved in beet growing competitions which takes place in the small farms in the west.  I hope young farmers are encouraged through this scheme to grow more beet.</P>
      <P>I also hope that the company's land bank is available for young farmers.  I am sure the Land Commission could be prevailed on to make land available to the Sugar Company for beet growing.  There is not sufficient publicity given to the land bank.  The Minister for Agriculture last night did not seem to realise the significance of the land bank, which consists of over 1,000 acres and could be leased for beet growing.  It is very important that it is given to small farmers who have not any suitable land or perhaps have not any land at all in which to grow sugar beet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may well be that it is from the small farms in the future that the Sugar Company will obtain a supply of sugar beet and it might be from those farms that the increased acreage will be obtained.  I have read a number of articles in recent weeks. One article in particular gave the views of a large farmer in County Carlow in relation to his own farming enterprise. He had mixed feelings about the sugar beet crop.  Last year he had 140 acres under beet and this year he was down to 40 acres.  He stated he was moving into winter cereals and was definitely phasing <Col N="368" /> out the sugar beet.  He said he was not happy with the strain of seed or with the system of payment by the Sugar Company as he thought it was unfair.  Those matters should be very closely examined.</P>
    <P>It is important to have research undertaken into a suitable strain of beet seed. The Italians have developed a particular strain of seed and I understand they have got a significant increase in the yield per acre.  The development of the Italian sugar industry over the last few years has been extraordinary.  There are many areas of similarity between Italy and Ireland.  I know that the Sugar Company are involved in research and development. This has improved the return to growers, but much more needs to be done in this regard.</P>
    <P>I cannot talk about increased acreage or about research and development without referring to the western development programme introduced by the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Ray MacSharry.  This scheme will make available extra acres of land for beet growing. The sugar beet crop can make a major contribution to cleaning the land and improving and building up fertility.  I do not believe the crop will be grown if the Tuam factory closes.  Despite what the Minister for Agriculture says about his efforts to transport beet, it will not be grown.  The BGA and the workers action committee in Tuam as well as everybody who has an interest in Tuam and the west of Ireland want a long-term commitment to the sugar industry.  All those people believe that the acreage of beet can be increased.  The Galway committee of ACOT have stated that another 5,000 acres of sugar beet could be grown without having an adverse affect on the livestock population.  The Minister for Agriculture did not state last night what he was prepared to do in the event of this increased acreage.</P>
    <P>I read in the paper about an interview with Deputy Sherlock who said that in the event of an increased acreage he was prepared to view the situation concerning the Tuam factory in a different light.  I am very glad the Deputy said that but I <Col N="369" /> would be happier if the Minister for Agriculture had said it.  Last night the Minister spoke about providing alternative industry in Tuam.  We have over 2,000 people unemployed in the Tuam area and 600 people unemployed in the town of Tuam.  He also spoke about employing consultants, which I consider to be a fruitless exercise.  He said that Tuam would be included in the review but he also said after we met the Taoiseach in a deputation that he would be taken aback if the consultants had a different view to the one he had.</P>
    <P>There are people in the Government who talk about the importance of planning. I was very interested to hear Deputy Michael D. Higgins talk about the importance of long-term planning.  How can they talk about long-term planning when they are only giving a 12 months' reprieve to the Tuam factory?  I believe there are many Deputies in the Government benches who are very unhappy about the way the Minister for Agriculture has handled this situation.  They are very unhappy at the way he has tried to keep the announcement of the closure a secret and are also unhappy he did not take some positive action.  Deputy White went on record as stating that the Minister did not come to grips with the situation. He stated on 15 September last that the Tuam factory cannot be allowed to close.  He also said: &ldquo;There are some yes-men but we are not all yes-men in the party.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies who have similar feelings to those of Deputy White to consider the drastic situation for the people in the Tuam area if this factory closes.  I ask those Deputies to accept this motion. Even though it is put down by the Fianna Fáil Party it is not political in that sense. If they cannot vote for this motion I ask them to abstain and save the sugar factory in Tuam.  We need this factory.  It was put there for socio-economic reasons.  It will be a big blow to the west and the people in the Tuam area if this factory closes.  It will be a psychological blow to the area and to the whole west.  I ask that the motion be accepted and that the factory in Tuam be saved.</P>

      <P>This is my maiden speech in this House and if one were looking for a more contentious issue one could hardly find one.  I preface my remarks by saying that it is a very difficult decision for any Government to close a factory as important to a town as the sugar factory is to Tuam.  However, there are various aspects of the matter I shall deal with later.</P>
      <P>First, I entirely sympathise with the work force of the Tuam sugar factory.  I am talking about friends and neighbours, about people with whom I have worked for many years and I take due note of the position they are in.  When I first heard of the decision by the board of the company to close the factory I considered it a very cruel and severe blow.  So far as industrial relations were concerned its timing was very bad.  When I heard the factory was to close in a few months time and that alternative employment was being sought by the IDA to replace the permanent and temporary jobs that would be lost I said that I could not accept that part of the argument.  One does not have to be an economist to know that in these difficult times it will be very difficult to replace the jobs in question and I told this to the authorities concerned.</P>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach and the Government to note what I said.  I must tell the House that I was thankful to the Taoiseach for his humane approach when the facts were put before him and when he was told that if the factory was closed now there was no way to get alternative employment for the workers.  It is more difficult to close a sugar factory, particularly when it is only one of four in the country, than to close other types of industry where work can be started and finished more quickly.  I will deal with that aspect later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a new Deputy for East Galway. As far as I am concerned people cannot be put out of work unless there is alternative employment.  I must confess that at this stage I am not too sure the IDA can replace all the jobs that will be lost when the factory closes in 12 or 18 months <Col N="371" /> time.  Incidentally, many people believe there will not be jobs for them in Tuam when the present campaign is completed. We are talking about another campaign after that which brings us to the spring of 1983 and I hope by that stage the IDA will be able to get into the area the type of industry where the talents of the workers in Tuam can be used to the full.  If we cannot get more beet into Tuam, at least we will be making the best of what could be a very bad situation.  I expect the IDA to do what is required in this instance and if they do not I will take up the matter with the Minister and the Taoiseach.  As a representative from East Galway I want to ensure that there are as many jobs provided as possible.</P>
    <P>Needless to say I should like to see the beet factory in Tuam continue in operation but there are economic factors that will make this very difficult.  However, I was told in the House last night and read in newspaper reports that the workers in the factory and the BVGA have a plan to put before the farming community to increase the beet acreage.  I wish to lend my support to that.  I should like farmers in Connacht to be in a position to produce beet from 10,000 acres of land.  If the Tuam factory is to survive in the future the beet must be grown.  One of the reasons for the present situation is that during the years until last year the beet acreage fell drastically.  It does not make good sense economically to bring beet from Carlow, Cork and Dublin.  Unless the farmers respond to the call to grow much more beet we will be in a very unsatisfactory situation.  I hope that the proposal of the BVGA and the workers will succeed.</P>
    <P>As a former beet grower I should like to put some facts on the record.  What is being proposed in Tuam will be an uphill battle for a number of reasons.  The yield per acre of washed beet in the west is only 11½ tons per acre while the figure for the rest of the country is 14 tons per acre. If the price of beet is between £25 to £30 per acre and the west starts with a deficit of three tons per acre, it is obvious that western farmers are almost £100 per acre <Col N="372" /> behind the rest of the country.  This has taken its toll during the years.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons why beet growing has not been popular in the past nine or ten years.  In the west the soil is of a poor type, there are many fragmented holdings, there is little mechanisation of the kind common in good tillage areas of the country and, finally, the technology that has come into beet growing, particularly in the past three or four years, has not been readily available to western farmers.  Their resources have not allowed them to invest in the machinery and expertise that is necessary.  Many farmers who hear this appeal to grow more beet will believe that others connected with the industry have had more rewarding results than they have obtained.  That is a fact of life.  It is well known that, like other sections of industry, the farming community will respond and produce a product if there is enough money in it for them.  Nobody can blame them for that.  If in the next 12 months we get a suitable increase in acreage, I will ask the Taoiseach to have another look at the decision to close Tuam factory.</P>
    <P>Rumours are emanating from the south of Ireland, and in particular from the Mallow area, that the 24,000 tons of beet on the way to Tuam might not be available next year, and that they want all their beet for themselves for an economic campaign.  If we process over 2,000 tons of beet per day our campaign in Tuam will be shortened by a fortnight. The prospect of a huge increase in beet into the Tuam plant, irrespective of where it comes from, is not great at this stage.</P>
    <P>Other important considerations arise. I am not too happy about the actions of the board of the Sugar Company over the years in relation to their western activities. I should like to go on record as saying it would appear that, when any projects had to be chopped, the Sugar Company headed west first to do the hatchet work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the projected losses for the Sugar Company this year will be something like £14 million or £15 million, and to that the Tuam factory will contribute something like £2½ million.  If that is the case, I wonder what other factories are likely to be in trouble.  While it is true that Tuam is in a loss-making position, there must be other loss makers somewhere in the group also.  I would ask the board of the Sugar Company to look very seriously at that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion most of the Sugar Company's factories have been grossly overstaffed over the years.  I understand from a recent communique from the workers that, as a matter of self discipline, they <Col N="374" /> have decided to reduce the numbers.  I consider there has been very bad management by the chief executives and the board of the Sugar Company.  I cannot understand why it is necessary for the Government to pump something like £75 million into the sugar industry to make it competitive.  The problems should have been foreseen years ago and the necessary finance made available down through the years.</P>
    <P>Tuam was also the poor relation when it came to capital investment.  A total of about £49 million was spent in the past ten or 12 years by the Sugar Company group for modernisation of factories.  In Tuam we got £3 million.  Deputy Richie Ryan, as Minister for Finance, pumped £800,000 into Tuam in the mid-seventies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>He said it would not be viable to get beet into Tuam any more.  He suggested an alternative industry which could be housed in a sugar factory.  I am very interested in this.  It is rape oil seed for the manufacture of vegetable fats.  This crop could very well be grown in the west.  It is ideally suited to our conditions.  I will ask the Minister for Agriculture to have it checked out to see if it can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vitally important that the labour force in Tuam should have a real alternative. If the beet acreage is not increased next year, and if it is not a <Col N="375" /> viable proposition to process sugar there, I hope we will have a real job for everyone who loses his or her employment. The Minister told us that a 24,000 square foot factory is being allocated to Tuam. I hope that will become a reality and that an industry will be provided there in due course.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the members of the Oireachtas all-Party committee were unanimous in suggesting that this sugar factory should close.  I have said this publicly before.  I was very disappointed that there was not a voice from west of the Shannon on that committee.  I do not doubt that the members of the committee were in a position to judge from what they have heard and saw.  We have problems in the west which people who do not live there find it hard to understand.  If it were possible to increase the beet acreage substantially, I would be asking the Government to ensure that every incentive possible was given to the farmers to continue growing beet for their own factory in Tuam.</P>
    <P>Who to blame is an important issue. Fianna Fáil have put down a motion as is their right.  It is also worth mentioning that in 1977/78 when the potato part of the Erin Foods arrangement went wallop in Tuam, I did not hear any call from Fianna Fáil for a subsidy for the potato business.  What actually happened on that occasion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that had not the slightest hope of ever getting off the ground.  I listened attentively to Deputy MacSharry about the possibility of getting the Minister for Agriculture to negotiate subsidies and so on in the Common Market.  I wonder why was that not done <Col N="376" /> in regard to the potato business in Tuam at the time because it left a very sour taste when a lot of people lost their jobs, most of whom had not an opportunity of an alternative.  He mentioned also an injection of £500,000, I assume, for modernisation in regard to sugar extraction. If one is to believe what one has heard from various sources it would appear that the Tuam factory would need a far greater injection of capital before it would be on a par even with the other three factories which are also, I understand, very much below European standards.</P>
      <P>I might refer again to Professor Rafferty who suggested that it might be very difficult to maintain three factories under the conditions obtaining, never mind four.  But, bearing in mind the problems with which we are confronted in the west, every effort must be made by all concerned to grow more beet.  I am personally behind the campaign.  If it has a reasonably successful outcome then I remain to be convinced that there is no hope for the factory as a beet factory.  On the other hand if it is a thing that, for entirely economic reasons we cannot have a beet factory, then without questtion we must have some type of heavy industry which would compensate for the type of jobs people would be likely to lose.  I want to go on record here that I will not accept a small demountable type factory from the IDA which might give jobs to perhaps 20 or 30 people only&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the few minutes remaining at my disposal, when it is all said and done, bearing in mind the historic link of the Tuam sugar factory with many thousands of people in the west&mdash;if there is a genuine call for a campaign to grow more beet &mdash; then I remain convinced that the factory could be saved. Certainly I would be making that request to the Minister for Agriculture at the end of next year if I saw a large increase in the beet acreage.  It might well happen that for one reason or another &mdash; perhaps because of pressure from the other factories &mdash; we would be unable to get the amount of beet that would ensure a reasonably successful campaign.  Should that happen, as a member of the Government party, I will be asking the Government to ensure that the jobs exist.  I will also be requesting &mdash; if they cannot come up with jobs at that time &mdash; a continued subsidisation of the factory until there is established a proper alternative industry.</P>

I said I would do everything withing my power in this regard.

Deputy Connaughton said in the course of his speech that it would be kept open until, I think, 1982-1983, when he would go to the Taoiseach.  I do not want to be a prophet of gloom, but the way the Government are going it will be our leader who will open it in 1983.  Fianna Fáil opened the factory in Tuam for social reasons.  I was present when the sod was turned for the foundation of that factory. I grew beet for the factory until I became a Member of this House.  It became uneconomic for me to continue because I had only a small farm.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton gave examples of the return from beet.  When we grew beet it was on one acre and half an acre and we got up to 17 tons.  It was 30 shillings a ton.  If it were not for the factory in Tuam many small farmers in the thirties would not have survived. Sheep were sold for £1 and cattle for £6. If one got £2 for growing beet, one could buy cattle or sheep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is more beet grown in County Galway than there is in a county in Munster where there is a big factory.  Beet production increased in Tuam last year because of an incentive given by the former Minister for Agriculture.  In the thirties <Col N="381" /> one ton of pulp was given back for every 16 tons of beet.  Beet would be grown in the west if there was a plan for doing so.</P>
    <P>I have great respect for the workers. They are dedicated men but they are being thrown to the wolves.  They are prepared to go to any extent as regards staffing and co-operation with the company to ensure that the factory is not closed.  I was secretary of a beet growers association and we formed a group.  The person in charge of the company had an interest in mechanisation for small farmers. At that time the work was all hand done and there was very little tare. Recently 11 tons of beet was the average because there is so much tare.  I had only average land but I was able to get 17 tons. On average I got 13 tons but during the war years, because there was no artificial manure available, I was down to nine tons.</P>
    <P>There was one area in County Galway, Ardrahan, where some of the best beet in Ireland was stationed.  In regard to potato planting I remember sending potatoes to the Tuam factory for £8 a ton with 20 per cent dry matter.  When we tried to get a decent price from them they went behind our backs.  We were looking for £12 a ton.  The farmers in Louth, fair play to them, send them down at £9 a ton until they got a better market elsewhere. We could not grow them at that price because my average production was 11 tons.  The company would not make a decent deal with us so they were not all that co-operative.</P>
    <P>About 20 years ago I was in Paris at a conference of international agricultural producers.  We were speaking to those in charge of beet factories in the Netherlands. These factories were co-operatives. Nobody would be accepted as a member of a co-op unless he grew 10 acres of beet.  I asked somebody would it eventually come to be the case in Ireland. The company were very anxious to get rid of the small grower.  I do not believe every effort was made to make Tuam a viable proposition.  The company were biased against the factory there.  I appeal <Col N="382" /> to the Minister to see that something is done now.</P>
    <P>I have great respect for Deputies Connaughton and Donnellan.  Deputy Donnellan's father, Michael Donnellan, was involved in this from the beginning. There are three Deputies in the Government from the west with intelligence and yet the Taoiseach did not think it worth his while to pick one of them as a Minister. Indeed, Deputy Donnellan's father was a Minister of State.  The Government do not give a damn about the west.  One will not see a State car in the west.  It looks like a case of to hell or to Connacht.</P>
    <P>I hear a lot of talk about employment and advance factories.  How many of these are idle at present?  Quite a substantial number.  The fact that there is an advance factory in an area is no indication that there will be an industry there in a reasonable time.  In Tuam not only is there the beet factory but engineering and turf cutting operations.  They will all go when the factory closes.  The psychological effect this will have on people in the west will be the biggest disadvantage of all.  It is ridiculous, with the number of people who are unemployed at present in the west, to talk about closing the factory.</P>
    <P>The workers are very dedicated and are determined, with the help of the BVGA, to do everything possible to keep the factory open.  It is necessary to have a plan for Tuam.  How can we ask farmers to produce more beet and become mechanised when we tell them we are closing down the factory next season?  I suggest that the BVGA and the action group should form groups such as I did in my time.  I got a group together in my area of 40 farmers who had only 50 acres between them.  We bought a seeder and a hoe and arranged with the contractor to harvest the beet.  It is not possible for small farmers to become mechanised on their own but they could do it collectively. If I was not a Member of the House I would grow beet all the time. The tops of beet can be given to sheep and this helps to provide winter feed for them.  When I used to grow an acre or <Col N="383" /> two of beet at this time of year I would buy in 20 sheep to eat the tops of the beet.  At that time everything was cheap but of £1 per head meant a profit straight away of £20 for the 20 sheep.  Therefore, there is an added incentive to beet growers in this way.  The smaller a beet grower was the more efficient he was.  The small man was in a position to supervise everything personally.  For those growing beet on a large scale there is the cost of hiring machinery which takes from the profits.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that sufficient beet would be available for the factory if the company produced a five, six or eight year plan.  Another point that is important to remember is that while the factory at Tuam was not established solely for social reasons there was a social element involved.  The country should be run for people as opposed to running the economy but I fear that the latter is what is happening now.  To concentrate only on the economy would be to eliminate all the social amenities.  How many of the State companies that are operating for the social benefit of the people are paying? The answer is one.  Every penny lost in the Tuam operation is being costed now but we have not seen any detailed account of the other millions of pounds that the company have lost in the past two years.</P>

      <P>The figure of £2,500,000 has been mentioned in terms of keeping the factory open but we hear nothing of the amount of money that will be involved by way of redundancy payments, pay-related benefits and unemployment benefits, not to mention the psychological effect on the whole area because of closing the factory.  Though I live some 25 miles from Tuam I was associated very much with the factory.  The decision to site the factory in Tuam was taken by Fianna Fáil but certain members of the then Opposition said that the crows would fly through that factory.  I wonder if that is still their attitude.  I am fairly old <Col N="384" /> but I understand what is going on all around me.  I do not like to be bitter but I wonder if the fact that this factory is suffering now is because it was supposed to have been the baby of the late Mr. de Valera who had it established for social as well as for economic reasons.</P>
      <P>I know that is not the case so far as each of the local Deputies is concerned but it is a great shock to all concerned to be faced with the closure of the operation. At the first indication that something was happening I attended a meeting in Tuam at which I said that there would be no closure, that this was something we had been hearing about for a number of years but I was astonished when news of the intention to close reached me.  One can only wonder where all the socialists on the other side of the House are or what they will do next.  It is all very well to say that everything must be costed but that is not much help to those who lose their jobs.  In the case of Tuam the loss-making situation began only in the past couple of years but suddenly the factory is being axed.  I acknowledge that the Fine Gael Deputies in the area did their best to avert a closure but they do not seem to have any influence.  They did not get the cars but neither did they get the factory.  I am aware that the Deputies across the House are under instructions from their Whip to vote against us this evening but they could make their protest by abstaining.  We are not making a political issue of this matter.  As we have made clear from the start there is no question of bringing down the Government. Should they be defeated this evening it is not our intention to table a vote of no confidence in them.  All we are asking them to do is to keep the Tuam factory open.  I appeal to the Government this evening not to close that factory.  I should like to hear what Deputy Donnellan has to say on this whole matter.</P>

      <P>I will not sit down now. The Deputy should have got time from <Col N="385" /> the Government.  We intend to take up the time alloted to us.  The only incentive ever given to beet growers in the Tuam area was that given by our spokesman on agriculture, Deputy MacSharry, and that was by way of a subsidy towards pulp. We have heard a good deal about not being able to use EEC money to help out this factory but it could be used by way of a subsidy on pulp.  Such a subsidy would be an incentive to many people to grow beet.  I am convinced that in a situation such as that which prevailed in the old days when there was a ton of pulp allowed for in respect of each 60 or 70 tons of beet supplied to the factory, plenty of beet would be grown in the Tuam area.  When I talk of beet growing in that area I am thinking of an area stretching down to Offaly and including also some parts of Meath.  When I was a member of the BVGAI served with some very fine men from both Meath and Offaly.  I have much respect for the Minister for Agriculture on a personal level so when I criticise him it is in respect of his policies.  It is ridiculous for him to say that the other sugar factories will take beet from the west.  We know very well that BVGA members in the Thurles, Carlow or Mallow areas will not allow beet from outside into their factories until their own produce has been taken.  Consequently, beet from those areas that would normally serve the Tuam factory would not be taken at these other factories until January or February.  Anyone who knows anything about beet growing knows that it is not good to have the beet on hands after Christmas.  I recall a time when there was a threatened strike at the Tuam factory during the winter months and when the late Jim Larkin, a man for whom I had great respect, spoke here as a trade unionist and asked the workers not to strike at that time because of beet being a perishable commodity.  Beet left uncovered in frosty weather deteriorates within a very short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody can speak with more authority. That is why I would like Deputy Donnellan to get five minutes because he should be an authority on it also.  I speak with authority and I know what I <Col N="386" /> am talking about and cannot be contradicted. I spent all my life growing beet until I came in here and I would be growing it still if I had not come in here, although I might not be very active on a tractor now.  I grew beet when we pulled it and counted it with our hands.  We filled it into a horse's cart and we brought it five miles to the railway station and threw it into the railway wagon with our hands.  We brought two loads per day. We got up at 6 o'clock in the morning and started taking off leaves from the beet.  We had to do it in those times and if it had not been for the beet at that time we might not be farming today.  The beet was there for economic as well as social reasons as far as the west of Ireland was concerned.  I am confident that it will be there again and that the people will grow it, provided the Government change their attitude.  There is no good in Deputy Connaughton saying that he will give all. I know he will throw his weight behind the campaign to grow beet, but it will be to grow beet for a factory that will be open for only 12 months.  In the name of all that is good and holy, what is he thinking of?  All we are asking for is a long-term policy.  The farmers will grow beet if it pays them.  If they got the pulp, with the increase in the sheep population in the west of Ireland &mdash; which has been very substantial because only very few were interested in sheep until the last couple of years, again thanks to Fianna Fáil when we got into the French market&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was the best of friends with the members of the old BGA from all of the factory areas.  As far as Tuam is concerned there was no attempt by any of the factory areas when I was on the central executive of the association to do anything that would downgrade Tuam. Do not forget that the Government of the day are the major shareholders in the Sugar Company and they can call the tune.  No matter what the Sugar Company want to do, if the shareholders say it is not to be done that settles that.</P>
      <P>I very seldom feel as strongly about anything as I do about this because I was associated with it and because I am a farmer.  I believe that it will not be realised until the factory is gone what a terrible blow it will be both psychologically and economically to the west.  I appeal on behalf of the workers who are making every effort to help in anything which the company needs to make the factory viable. The workers are prepared to cooperate, but I am afraid that the factory is going to be closed and I hope it is not for political reasons.  I remember being in Tuam at a meeting when it was pointed out that nowhere was this to be made a political football.  This motion is that the Government would keep the factory open and that is what we are asked to vote for.  I make a special appeal.  There is no good in talking about advance factories. We have seen too many of them empty.  There is no good in talking about other industries.  This is a major industry in the west.  Close it and you strike a blow against the west, but as I said before, I am afraid the west does not count very much with the present administration.</P>

      <P>I am not a spokesman for the Government, the Opposition or the Sugar Company but a Deputy having 18 years employment with the Irish Sugar Company and I will be having regard to the facts as I know them.  It is more than surprising that in February 1981 when the recommendation of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies made known that they recommended the closure of the Tuam factory, Deputy Callanan and all his colleagues did not get down to it and show the Irish Sugar Company and the Government or the State that they could grow this beet and produce it in that area west of the Shannon.  No, there was just a marginal increase in the <Col N="389" /> acreage of beet grown.  It is amazing that people who are so aware now did not see the writing on the wall for them then. The beet has not been grown in the area. It was stated in an editorial of the <i>Farmers Journal</i> that the beet would not be grown in the area.  If that is the authentic voice of the farmers I do not know what the Deputies are speaking about.</P>
      <P>We are told that the borrowings of the Irish Sugar Company are now £75 million and that the interest repayable is around £14 million this year.  Is it the Government, the Opposition or the company who should be debating this matter?  Is it the banks who should be debating this issue?  In effect it is the banks who own the Irish Sugar Company now.</P>

      <P>There would be no problem with the Irish Sugar Company if they had been allowed to follow the policy which they adopted and saw as absolutely necessary for them to adopt five or six years ago or even longer, the policy of diversification.  In the first instance when the Irish Sugar Company were under the management of Lieutenant-General M. J. Costello, head of Erin Foods, the Government of the day restricted that company to 30 per cent of the home market. Was that fair?  Was it fair to pay State money into a company to set up Erin Foods so that they could go into the food business and then decide that they would get 30 per cent of that market and no more?  Lieutenant-General Costello proved in no uncertain manner that he <Col N="390" /> was a capable man who developed the food industry and the Irish Sugar Company. Who accepted his resignation and why did he resign?  It was because the Government interfered in the company business.</P>

      <P>It was Government interference and especially Fianna Fáil's interference in the company's diversification programme which dragged the Irish Sugar Company down.  There is no doubt about that.  Originally a factory was built in the Tuam area and it was stated that 13,000 acres of beet would be grown in the catchment area of that factory. A couple of years ago there were just 2,430 acres of beet grown in that area and Deputy Killilea must have been asleep if he thought that situation could continue.  One will have to make the decision at the end of the day in the light of what one knows about the situation. There is fear in the minds of the people employed at present by the Irish Sugar Company in Mallow, Thurles or anywhere else because the company have not got the support they deserve because the previous Government who were in power for so long did not increase the equity base or the equity capital of the company. There was no increase despite the fact that the company were going down and down.</P>
      <P>One also must recognise the fact that borrowings must be attributed also in part to the heavy capital programme on which the company have had to embark. The fears in the minds of those at present employed by the company &mdash; and it is only a few months since I left the company on leave of absence on my election to Dáil Éireann &mdash; is that the company will not survive and, whether it is Mallow, Thurles or Carlow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Any analysis of this situation will have to be based on whether it is the best proposition to keep a factory which has not just been a lame duck, but, as far as the Irish Sugar Company are concerned, a dead duck for many years. Our proposal is to establish an industry in the Tuam area which could obviously <Col N="392" /> provide more security than a sugar factory because it appears that we have not got in the past eight or ten years and are unlikely to get in the future the raw materials in the Tuam area, irrespective of what Deputy Callanan says.  By reason of that fact it would be wrong to build up the hopes of people who are depending on it for a livelihood.  There should be a proper analysis of the situation and a decision should be based on that.</P>

      <P>Economic logic was not applied to the decision to place the sugar factory in Tuam, but economists are making the decision today to close it.  That is fundamental to this whole issue.  Economists, in the name of the Minister for Agriculture, the Taoiseach, Fine Gael and the Government, have made the decision to close Tuam sugar factory. That is final and I will not go into any of the other arguments about what happened before and what will happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to remind the Minister, Deputy Dukes, that in 1971 when the Beet Growers' Association were beaten in the election for the representation of farmers on the Sugar Company, the present Minister for Agriculture before the BVGA were amalgamated with the IFA proposed on behalf of the Tuam board of the Beet and Vegetable Growers' Association a programme exactly the same as we are presenting today from the workers, the farmers and the clergy.  The present Minister for Agriculture brought forth a programme and made representations to the then Government.  Today that same man who made the programme we have on paper today rejects it.  That is also fundamental to this issue.  I am sorry because this is deeply felt in the community in which I live.  I had the privilege once of representing Tuam; I do not have that privilege any more, but I know how the people of that town feel.  If you look at this months' issue of <i>Biatas</i>, the magazine published by the Sugar Company, you will see the faces of the workers, small farmers, temporary employed people and the women of Tuam.  You will never forget it because there is a sadness there that is expressed only by them.  We could <Col N="393" /> talk in this House forever, but there was never an economic reason for putting the Sugar Factory in Tuam and there should not be an economic reason today to close it, in spite of what Deputy Sherlock said. Does Deputy Sherlock think that his fellow workers in the Irish Sugar Company think much of him today from the statements he has made tonight?  Many of them are sitting in the gallery of the House and I appreciate that they came to listen to this debate.  It is the last straw which they can clutch &mdash; the hope that we will decide tonight by vote that we will make the present Government, and particularly the front bench, change their minds on the policy they have implemented, or are trying to implement, in regard to the closure of the factory.  They are here tonight because they are democrats too.  I am a democrat and I hope that the Fine Gael TDs from Connacht will be democrats tonight.  There is a plan and where there is a will there is a way. As Deputy Callanan said, there is a will and I hope the Minister will make the way possible.</P>
    <P>The Beet and Vegetable Growers Association have committed themselves publicly to the assessment that an investment of £500,000 into a programme to grow beet in the Tuam factory area over a three-year period will reap in excess of 10,000 acres.  That is a small investment for any Government to make in a community, in a district and an area in which we live.  I should now like to address my remarks to Deputy Sherlock because he should get his facts right.  When the former Minister for Agriculture allowed the Sugar Company to pay by way of a subsidy on pulp an amount of money equivalent to £36 per acre last year, a grow-more-beet campaign commenced in that area of the west and I am proud to tell Deputy Sherlock that in that campaign the county of Galway increased its acreage by 1,000 acres.  The facts are there to prove that statement.  That amounted to an increase of 39 per cent in one year.  What about today?  The Minister, Deputy Dukes said last night that there is a differential in the return of cash to the farmer to the tune of approximately <Col N="394" /> two tonnes per acre due to climatic conditions, small farms and the many other reasons that prevail in Connacht. I should like to ask the Minister now, as the BVGA, the workers, the clergy, the Archbishop of Tuam and the people of the west are asking him now to give us that intervention of money that was given before and we will return 10,000 acres of beet to keep the Tuam factory open and viable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to that the Minister should listen to what the workers have to say.  They are a unique group of workers, particularly in Tuam, because they realise the delicacy of the factory.  We are all aware that it has literally been closing since the day it opened. Every year there has been such a cry.  As a matter of fact I should like to remind Deputy Sherlock that Mr. A.J.F. O'Reilly who was for a short time managing director of the Sugar Company had an agricultural adviser in Tuam shifted because he was getting too much beet in Connacht for the Tuam sugar factory, and that was not so many years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind Deputy Sherlock of another fact.  When it was said on the last occasion by my father, Deputy Donnellan's father and Deputy Connaughton's father, that we would give them 13,000 acres of beet they were given that acreage of beet.  In fact, they were given 16,500 acres of beet, almost twice as much as Mallow at that time when it was difficult.  They are the facts.  What are we doing about the closure of Tuam? It should be remembered that the Tuam sugar factory is the axis, the wheel on which the town of Tuam is based.  We should always remember that.  I challenge any member to go to Tuam and ask any person there where the &ldquo;factory&rdquo; is without mentioning the name of it and I guarantee each member that that person will respond by sending the person inquiring to the Tuam sugar factory.  That is an <Col N="395" /> indication of what it means to the town and to the district.  It is the lifeblood of economic, social and psychological activity in the west.</P>
    <P>I notice that tonight we have in our presence &mdash; I regret that he did not make a contribution &mdash; the Minister for the £300 million we are to spend in the west Deputy Nealon.  I should like to tell that Minister that the Tuam factory has given to society in the west of Ireland many things.  In the vocational field by the management of the factory and the make-up of it it has given to society in the west vocational teachers, trained men who served their time there and got jobs outside. In his own county of Sligo, not taking into account Galway, Mayo, Roscommon and Clare, there are about nine and, in fact, one of them was so good that he was promoted principal of a vocational school in that county.  When the AnCO training centre was looking for people to give instructions, out of 22 appointed in Galway city the Tuam factory supplied to that training centre a total of 12 instructors.  There are seven of them in Sligo, four of them in Athlone and I do not know where the rest of them have gone.  How can one replace that with another industry?  What is the Minister talking about?  There can be no replacement for such an industry because it gives to us a wealth of knowledge, a bail for the community that is unequalled. That cannot be given by an alternative industry.  We have a sugar factory and we have always had a problem with that factory but the answer to that problem is not to close it.  The answer is to tackle the problem, to do it by planning and investment.</P>

Not taking into account the income tax, company profit tax and all the other taxes that accrued to the State from that initial investment of £6 million, the company returned as well in share profit which was grabbed by the Department of Finance each year a total of £18 million since its foundation.

      <P>I will not listen to the qualms of the Minister for rising prices, Deputy Kelly.  I want to make an appeal <Col N="397" /> in a compassionate way.  I will start with my friend Deputy Higgins from Galway city.  Many of the workers in the Tuam sugar factory went to Galway to give him a hand to make his way to this House and I ask him to sit on his chair and let the front bench decide.  I ask him not to vote on this motion tonight and sit in protest at the closure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I now turn to my other friend, Deputy Paul Connaughton, a man I have worked with in Tuam Mart and a man I have seen at his work around Galway. Deputy Connaughton knows, as well as I do, that they cannot give us an alternative.  I ask him not to break his party line but sit down in his seat, stay there and not get up.  I do not know many more of the western Deputies but, finally, I want to turn my attention to a Member who has been a political enemy of mine all his life &mdash; his father was also opposed to my father &mdash; God rest both of them; they spent days and nights in the cold in Connacht putting the Tuam Sugar Factory where it is today.  Deputy Donnellan has made it known publicly throughout the country that he is disappointed at the performance of the Government. I say to him: &ldquo;Do not break your party loyalty, Sit in your chair and let them go up and vote.&rdquo;  The Deputy would be doing so on a non-political basis.  We are not asking for the downfall of the Government.  We are using the <Col N="398" /> democracy of the House to tell the Government and the economists, once and for all, to keep their messy fingers off the west of Ireland, and have the courage of their convictions.  I am sure Deputy Enda Kenny understands what I am saying, and I am certain Deputy McCartin knows what I am talking about.</P>

      <P>I am not asking anyone in the Coalition to join Fianna Fáil but I am asking them to sit down with us, let them close this factory if they are able, but I guarantee they will not.  We might lose the first round but Fianna Fáil will not lose the war.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 21 February 1981 and was certified fit to resume work on 18 May 1981.  According to the records of the Department, no insurance contributions were paid in respect of the claimant in the contribution year 1979-80 which governed his entitlement to benefit. Inquiries were necessary and it was established that the claimant had not in fact any contribution in the governing <Col N="302" /> contribution year and he is therefore not entitled to benefit in respect of the claim.</P>
