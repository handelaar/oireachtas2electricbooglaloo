      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 3, 4, 5, 12, 13 (resumed), 14, 15 and 16.  By agreement, proceedings on Committee Stage of the Finance (No. 2) Bill, if not previously concluded, will be brought to a conclusion at 6.20 p.m. today.  The question to be put from the Chair to conclude the proceedings on Committee Stage of the Finance (No. 2) Bill shall be:</P>
      <P>That all amendments set down by the Minister for Finance and not disposed of are hereby made to the Bill, the Bill, as amended, is hereby agreed to and as amended, is reported to the House.</P>
      <P>Private Members' Business, item No. 23, will be resumed immediately on conclusion of the proceedings on the Finance (No. 2) Bill.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Busienss, will the Taoiseach have any further statement to make to the House on the significance of his Summit talks with the British Prime Minister in the light of her statement yesterday in the House of Commons that Northern Ireland is as much a part of the United Kingdom as the Borough of Finchley, and that the problem is purely an internal matter for <Col N="1676" /> the United Kingdom Government and Parliament?</P>

      <P>I want to state that on the motion to nominate the new Comptroller and Auditor General the Leader of the Opposition raised in the House <Col N="1679" /> yesterday the question of the circulation of the prepared text.  It is incorrect to state, as the Leader of the Opposition did, that it is customary to circulate generally brief and uncontroversial statements of this kind.  As a matter of courtesy, however, a copy of such statements may be sent to the Leader of the Opposition.  In this instance, I instructed that a copy of the statement be handed to a member of the staff of the Leader of the Opposition last Friday morning.  In the House yesterday, I refrained from comment until I had established that it had in fact been personally delivered to a member of the staff on Friday morning.  I feel I should now make this clear lest a contrary impression prevail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not blaming anybody.  I am making a statement that this document was not delivered to or received by me.  The only document I received in this connection was a copy of a letter addressed by the Taoiseach to you indicating that Mr. MacGearailt had resigned.  The point I raised here yesterday was that it is a well-established precedent of this House that when a Taoiseach or a Minister of the Government reads from a prepared statement a copy of that prepared statement is distributed to this side of the House by the staff of <Col N="1680" /> the House.  That precedent was not followed by the Taoiseach yesterday.</P>
      <P>I happen to have from the Dáil reporters the report of the exchange between the Taoiseach and myself on this matter yesterday.  With your permission, as the Taoiseach has raised it, I propose to read from this report which is as follows:</P>
      <P>Mr. Haughey: I am sorry to interrupt the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach quite rightly is reading from a prepared text. The tradition in this House is that we should be given a copy of the prepared text.</P>
      <P>By way of reply the Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>I do not accept that.  This is a case in which it is not normal to circulate a short script like this.  The Deputy is incorrect.</P>
      <P>Then we had an interjection from Mr. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i> the legal adviser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick, Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, from Cavan-Monaghan said:</P>
      <P>There are many precedents for not circulating short statements.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach replied:</P>
      <P>Therefore the Deputy is incorrect and I suggest he should allow the business of the House to continue.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, reading from his own statement, in the last paragraph had to say this to the House:</P>
      <P>In accordance with precedent I have given the Leader of the Opposition an advance copy</P>
      <P>While a couple of sentences before that he sought to indicate that there was no such precedent.  I leave the matter rest.</P>

      <P>This blatant attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to obfuscate <Col N="1681" /> this issue will not succeed.  The question he raised, as was clear from what he read out, was the circulation of the statement to the House.  That is not the practice.  It is the practice, and there is a precedent for it which I followed, to send a copy to him.  That is what was said in the statement that I had done.  The Leader of the Opposition sought to mislead me into thinking he had not received it.  I did not wish to contradict him until I had checked the fact that it was delivered by hand to a lady in his office on Friday morning.  He should not try to mislead the House on that.</P>

      <P>Yesterday afternoon, when I raised the matter, I was not aware that the Taoiseach purported to have sent me a copy of his statement nor that he suggested I had received it.  I suggest that was not the issue.  The issue I was dealing with was a matter of precedent in this House.  When a Minister or a Taoiseach <Col N="1682" /> gets up to read from a prepared text, that prepared text, as long as I am in this House, has been given to the other side of the House.  That is a well-established precedent in the House and it was from that precedent that the Taoiseach departed yesterday.  I am prepared to leave the matter rest if the Taoiseach is but if not we will go on.</P>

I object to that and I believe that, in all fairness, the Taoiseach should withdraw it.  When I was engaged in raising this point with him yesterday I was not aware of any suggestion that a copy of the statement had been delivered to my office.

      <P>I am dealing with the very important question of the Taoiseach's suggestion that I attempted to mislead the House.  That is a matter of some significance.  It is more important than the circulation of documents.  When the Taoiseach got up to read his statement I merely interjected on a point of precedent, that he would give me there and then, as always happens in the House, a copy of the prepared text from which he was reading.  I was only dealing with the traditions of this Chamber.  I was not adverting in any way to the receipt in my office of a statement.  I was not aware that that was suggested and I had no knowledge of it.  I made no attempt to mislead this House.  I merely asked that precedent be followed in giving me a copy of a prepared statement from which a Taoiseach or a Minister is reading.  I would be grateful if the Taoiseach would withdraw the suggestion that I attempted to mislead the House.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That section 8 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972 (No. 22 of 1972), be amended&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (4):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1685" />&ldquo;(4)  Where, by virtue of subsection (3) or (6), a person has not been a taxable person and a change of circumstances occurs from which it becomes clear that he is likely to become a taxable person, he shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to be a taxable person from the beginning of the taxable period commencing next after such change.&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>(b)  by the insertion in subsection (8), after paragraph (b), of the following proviso:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided that this subsection shall not apply to business activities consisting of the supply of immovable goods by any such person to any other such person and, where a request is made by such persons pursuant to regulations under this subsection, such business activities shall be treated for the purposes of this Act, as if the request had not been made.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that there was some misunderstanding or some question raised on this matter on the Order of Business, perhaps it would be appropriate and helpful to Deputy Fitzgerald if I were to indicate what is involved here. The position is that before the Committee Stage of a Bill is taken which imposes a charge on the people, a resolution must be passed which is known as a Financial Resolution to enable the Dáil to approve of that charge so that it can then proceed to deal with the detailed application of the charge in the course of the Committee Stage debate.</P>
    <P>In the case of charges imposed at the time of the budget by means of a Financial Resolution passed at that stage, it is not necessary to come in again at this stage with a repeat Financial Resolution. In the case of certain of the charges which fall to be imposed in this Bill which were not subject to the Financial Resolutions passed at the time of the budget, it is necessary to adopt a Financial Resolution now.  For the assistance of the Deputy I <Col N="1686" /> want to indicate that the first of these resolutions which I am now moving concerns section 11 of the Bill.  In order to short circuit further queries about subsequent resolutions, I want to indicate to the Deputy that the other two resolutions relate to stamp duties concerning sections 16 and 17 of the Bill.  Naturally, the Deputy is perfectly in order in asking me any questions he wishes about the Financial Resolutions.  Perhaps it might be better for both of us if we could postpone a substantive discussion until Committee Stage.  However, that is a matter for him.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate and important that on the Order of Business the Taoiseach should be asked to explain to the House what is involved. The Taoiseach did not appear to know what was involved.  He did not indicate to the House what was involved in these Financial Resolutions.  I accept the explanation given by the Minister for Finance that the amendment of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, is necessary and the reasons for it.  I also accept the point he made about discussing it in more detail when we come to the relevant section. The same can be said about the Financial Resolutions dealing with stamp duty which I take it, are in connection with the changes in the position of the bank charges and that the second and third Financial Resolutions relate to that.  In those circumstances I am quite happy to have them discussed in some detail on the relevant sections rather than at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first section of this Bill which imposes penal indirect taxation on the workers and the community at large.  I said on Second Stage that any Member of this House who voted for or did not vote against the Financial Resolutions on budget night in July contributed to the downturn in activities and the difficulties imposed in the shop and in the pub.  We are now placing this imposition on beer.  I also said that all those increases in indirect taxation affect the CPI figure.  We are all aware of the damage done by any increase in the CPI figure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds spelled out clearly that there was absolutely no necessity for this budget.  I was criticised by the Minister for Finance for saying on Second Stage that it was a propaganda exercise. I submit that it was the greatest propaganda exercise ever perpetrated on the people.  It was started in this House before any examination of the books took place.  The proof of that is the buoyancy of the revenue returns in September which indicates clearly that we should never have had that budget.  It was introduced purely for tactical political purposes, and to blame Fianna Fáil.  The blame is now being transferred from Fianna Fáil, because of the breakdown in the national wage agreement, to the civil servants, the public sector, and what have you, or anywhere a finger can be pointed in the interests of political expediency.</P>
      <P>I am opposing this increase in the price of beer.  I am absolutely opposed to it because of the harm it is doing to the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister to spell out clearly the income from beer in the years 1979, 1980 and 1981.  I believe we are at the stage of diminishing returns with regard to indirect taxation.  I have some sympathy with the Minister for Finance at budget time.  The Taoiseach is so concerned about getting publicity that he is saying around this House &ldquo;Kill that story before it gets to the press&rdquo;.  His public image <Col N="1689" /> must be right regardless of the reality of the situation.  His attitude is that the public are not entitled to know about his shortcomings even though they certainly outnumber his few good points.</P>
    <P>I accept that a Minister for Finance has a very narrow base from which to operate in the whole area of taxation in a country and with a population such as ours.  Basically there is the matter of indirect taxation and income taxation.  There is no doubt that during our time in office we gave the greatest ever benefits to the PAYE sector.  However, that does not mean that the PAYE worker is not still carrying an unfair burden.  Of course he is.  There is also the area of capital taxation.  There has to be a more equitable distribution in this area, difficult though that may be in some ways.  On later Stages of this Bill we will discuss such areas of taxation.  I have a question down to the Minister for Finance about the Commission on Taxation.  I do not know if the Minister would like to comment on that now or if he would prefer to wait until Question Time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the floor to the Minister after I make some other points.  My fear is that we have reached the stage of diminishing returns so far as beer is concerned.  There have been two impositions of tax on beer this year, one in January and the other in July and I do not think the latter was necessary.  I should like to know the income pattern from such revenue and the quantity of beer sold over the period.  I submit we are approaching very closely to the point of diminishing returns and if that is so the Minister is narrowing the base very substantially in the whole area of financial control of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised two points of substance which I shall answer. First, he referred to revenue buoyancy. <Col N="1691" /> I should like to indicate the history of the revenue raised on home-made and imported beers during the past seven or eight years.  In 1974 the revenue was approximately £50 million; in 1975 it was £66 million; in 1976 it was £91 million; in 1977 it was £97 million; in 1978 it was £102 million; in 1979 it was £118 million and in 1980 it was £151 million in round figures.  For the period January to September 1981 the revenue was £122.13 million.  That is an increase of 30 per cent on revenue raised from that source in the same period in 1980.  So far as revenue is concerned, it is reasonably buoyant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking in money terms.  Has the Minister comparable volume figures?  There can be a growing volume of revenue but that does not say there is not a situation of diminishing returns.  We would want to know the situation regarding volume and quantity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of argument for experts in the incidence of taxation.  In 1974 sales amounted to 1,600,000 standard barrels of beer while the figure in 1980 was 1,760,000 standard barrels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that there has not been much of a change even though the population is larger.  Therefore, we are in the area of diminishing returns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central</i>): Will the Minister not agree that the increases imposed on beer during the years 1974 to 1980 corresponded with wage increases?  In 1980 wages and salaries generally increased by 17 or 18 per <Col N="1692" /> cent while increases on beer amounted to 30 per cent.  Will the Minister tell the House how that gap will be made up from the point of view of buoyancy in the year 1981-82?  There is bound to be a drop in consumption.  Has the Minister figures for consumption since the introduction of the July budget?  I am sure there is a substantial drop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a two-month deferment on the payment of the duty.  I do not have to hand the figures for consumption.  I may have them in a moment. The proportion of the retail price represented by duty after the July budget is 48.2 per cent.  In March 1976 it was 49.5 per cent and in January 1976 it was 52.7 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>1976.  Let me be straightforward about this.  I do not see any great sense in pretending that we do not face the problem of diminishing returns with all these duties.  In the last two years there has been a slackening in the consumption of beer.  In February consumption was 56,000 barrels whereas it reached a provisional estimate of 174,000 barrels in August.  It declined slightly to 142,000 barrels in September.  The August figure was after the budget but before the VAT increase.  There is an uneven pattern of consumption throughout the year.  It is not easy to draw any conclusions.</P>
      <P>Consumption in September 1981 was substantially greater than it was in September 1980.  The Deputy might be interested to know that.  Consumption in September 1980 was 135,000 barrels as against 142,000 in September 1981.  The consumption of 174,000 barrels in August 1981 was much greater than consumption in August 1980 of 148,000 barrels.  In July, before the budget, consumption was less than it was for July 1980, which is hard to understand.  It shows these figures are not as helpful or indicative of a trend as one might imagine.  It is too early to draw any definitive conclusions on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making recommendations to me or <Col N="1693" /> any other Minister for Finance the Department are careful about the matter of diminishing returns if one has too big of an increase.  The Deputy referred to the narrow tax base.  I would have thought that being the party that abolished rates and car tax they contributed in no small way to narrowing the tax base. As politicians we might be pleased with this but as regards balancing the books it has been a regrettable development because the few remaining taxes have to bear a heavy burden.  The risk the Deputy referred to of diminishing returns does exist and is aggravated by political promises of one kind or another that narrow the tax base, such as those given during the September 1977 budget.</P>
    <P>The Deputy sought to illustrate that the July budget was not necessary on the grounds of the September revenue buoyancy figures.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there was no unexpected level of buoyancy in September and that it was in line with the predictions for the ultimate outturn for revenue for the year.  Hence the deficit we anticipated will occur as a result of the July budget.  The reason the September figures are higher is that additional revenue was received from purchases made prior to the budget or the increase in VAT.  The surge in revenue during the September period is explained by preemptive purchases of goods prior to the budget or the VAT increase and not to any massive surge in revenue.  Indeed the Deputy would seem to be making a contrary case.  On the one hand, he was saying there was no need for the budget because of the surge in revenue.  On the other hand, he is saying we are running into the problem of diminishing returns. We cannot have it both ways.  Either there was a necessity for the budget because we were in a poor situation or alternatively the revenue buoyancy situation was good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has whetted my appetite to continue the argument.  His defence is so weak that he does not believe the position himself.  He knows the points I have made are correct. There is no contradiction in what I have said.  Both are equally relevant.  My colleague, Deputy Fitzpatrick, could tell the Minister more clearly than I because of his knowledge of the business the reason for discrepancies in beer sales in certain months in 1980 and 1981.  There are many conditions outside financial costs that affect beer sales and, consequently, revenue.  Obviously the problem of diminishing returns is of major concern.  As a result of the imposition there has been reduced consumption and people are going to licensed premises half-an-hour or an hour later than they normally would.</P>
      <P>During the months of August and September 1981 sales of beer were buoyant because we had the finest August for many years and this situation continued into September.  That is the explanation for increased consumption during those months.  The Minister must be concerned about diminishing returns.  There is no way he can talk about my arguments being contradictory.  There are diminishing returns despite occasional factors such as was the case in the months I referred to.  That is the argument on one hand.  There is nothing contradictory in the argument about buoyancy but the Minister refused to be flushed out at the conclusion of the Second Stage debate last week.  He did not reply to Deputy Reynolds in regard to the figures he submitted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not refer to the figures.  Buoyancy could be very substantial by the end of the year. It is worth noting that by the end of September 86 per cent of the projected tax revenue had been collected.  In other words, out of a total projection of £3,210 million for the year, £2,777 million had been collected by 30 September whereas the corresponding figures for the previous three years were much lower, the highest being slightly more than 72 per cent.  Therefore, we are talking about a substantially increased figure of collection and about a very buoyant tax yield. I am giving these figures again because of the Minister's failure to reply to them last week.  Taking into account the Christmas shopping bonanza that is yet to come and the VAT that will accrue from that, let us be generous and say that the figure is 75 per cent in terms of the total tax collected for the year.  This leaves a buoyancy of about £260 million.  When we consider this figure in the light of extra revenue of about £63 million, and cutbacks of about £113 million, we realise that the budget was totally unnecessary.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to my statement that the narrowness of the tax base was imposing a greater burden in the area of indirect taxation.  That is so but I appreciate the Minister saying that our party were the party who abolished what I considered to be the greatest burden of taxation on young married people as well as on many others, that was, rates on houses.</P>

      <P>The Minister should not be carried away solely on the basis of revenue buoyancy figures.  Volume is extremely important in this context.  With a growing and one would hope, affluent population, one would expect greater volume and, consequently, increased tax yield but that does not mean that there are no other factors involved.  This industry is one that provides good employment for a large number of people.  For the years 1974 and 1980, the Minister has given us total volume figures of 1.621 million barrels and 1.767 million barrels respectively.  These figures show only a marginal difference. The Minister made the point that the rate of duty on beer at the moment, allowing for the increased duty, is not as high as it has been on previous occasions but strangely enough the previous occasions were when Deputy Ryan was Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We recall that Deputy Ryan was the one who advised the Government not to go ahead with the £9.60 allowance for stay-at-home wives. The reason he gave was that the payment of this allowance would affect indirect taxation on items such as beer to the extent that the CPI would be increased, that potential revenue would be reduced and that there would be a downturn in activity both in the retail outlets and in manufacturing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of light reading I suggest that Members read the contributions of the then Deputy Bruton to the Finance (No. 1) Bill when it was at Committee Stage. <Col N="1697" /> Some of the comments he made then must be embarrassing to him now.  We are opposing this section just as we are opposing every other section in the Bill that adds to the imposition of taxes. These additional taxes were unnecessary. I would remind all Members of the House that they have a responsibility in voting. They have a responsibility to ask themselves whether we can afford to increase the price of beer still further.  It is a backward step.  The buoyant, happy figures that the Minister has given us for August and September will turn out to be most unhappy figures for November and part of December with the possible exception of the Christmas period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The statements made by the Deputy and his colleague about buoyancy will not be proved correct.  He cannot have it both ways.  However, I would like to deal with the point made by him and by Deputy Reynolds claiming that the revenue to the end of September was 86 per cent of the anticipated revenue for the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> The Minister mentioned fluctuations as regards withdrawal from bond and various things like that.  It is very hard to base it from month to month.  As was mentioned, the figures were up on one point and down on another.  I can see the reason for that.  I have no doubt that on this occasion, as with all budgets, there was a downturn in consumption. Shortly after a budget there is nearly always a downturn which lasts for five, six or eight weeks.  On this occasion there is not any doubt about it.  Anyone in the trade, especially brewers and distillers, <Col N="1699" /> will tell you that the trend this time is continuing down, that there is no upsurge at all in withdrawal from bond or from the breweries.  This downturn will continue.  I am convinced that when we come to the January budget we will see a drop in sales in the region of 12 per cent on spirits and 6 to 7 per cent on beer.  The reasons are obvious.  If you look at the economy generally you will see that the purchasing power is not there.  You cannot increase the price of a product by 28 to 30 per cent as we are talking about here and as we did in 1980 without increasing purchasing power.  That makes common sense.  The purchasing power is not there.  Wages last year went up 17 to 18 per cent.  The Minister here and all the Ministers are speaking about a reasonable wage agreement.  If there is to be a reasonable wage agreement, if the wage agreement is in the region of the figures which the Ministers have mentioned, 6 to 7 per cent, you will see a substantial drop in volume within the next six or eight months.  The public cannot get the purchasing power.  These are the facts of life. We are not keeping up on this occasion as we have done in the past when we matched it with increased salaries to keep the purchasing power.  On this occasion we are not matching it.  There is a gap of 10 per cent between wages increases and the increase in the price of this product. Other products have increased in price also due to VAT, due to the budget, and that is taking proportionately whatever volume of money is there.  Therefore, at the end of this year, if the Minister wishes to get a reasonable wage agreement, we will not be able to keep up the volume as we did in 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, we are going out of line as regards attracting tourists.  I have not the exact figures here but I would guess that beer alone is 10p dearer here in the South of Ireland than it is in the Six Counties.  You can say the same about the UK.  If we are to get a real volume of tourism, whether we like it or not we must get it from the UK market.  Let us relate the prices in the UK to the prices here.  If we are to attract tourists here we will have to take these factors into consideration. <Col N="1700" />  Tourism is the second or third greatest industry we have.  It spreads money throughout the economy.  It is a very useful industry which we should try to promote.  However, with this attitude we cannot help in any way to uplift tourism.  We have dealt it a savage blow, although there are concessions in the budget for the hotels.  Even so, this measure will have a detrimental effect on hoteliers and on the general tourist trade.</P>
    <P>One section of the community who will be affected badly at this time are the old. The recreation of the old age pensioner in his failing years was to come out in the morning and have a smoke and a pint of beer.  We are putting this completely beyond him.  I have sympathy for old age pensioners because they are not able to match the purchasing power which other sections of the community have obtained over the past five or six years.  People with strong muscle were able to keep up purchasing power but undoubtedly the old age pensioner is being victimised more and more.  Such people really are suffering from the effects of this inflationary spiral.  Increased prices on such commodities affect the old age pensioners directly.  The Minister may say that we gave them substantial rises, but these rises are more than absorbed by increases in the price of fuel and other commodities which old age pensioners have to pay for. If you check the increase in fuel prices you will see that the old age pensioners are not keeping up with inflation.</P>
    <P>If we are to keep on these lines the national wage agreement is of vital importance to all of us.  I hope that the Minister will be successful in getting a reasonable national wage agreement.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister tell us what effect there will be on the CPI as a result of the imposition on beer and the additional VAT charge?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The CPI effect of the increase of 2 pence a pint, composed of 1.82 pence in excise duty and 0.18 pence in VAT at the 10 per cent rate, was 0.226 per cent.  The VAT increase to 15 per cent on 1 September 1981 added 3.5 pence to the price of the pint.  The actual amount varied from 3.2 pence to 4 pence <Col N="1701" /> depending on the price.  The estimated CPI effect of this is 0.395 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this section is to increase the main rate of excise duty on spirits by the equivalent of 1.82 pence on a glass of spirits with effect from 22 July 1981.  This increase attracted an additional payment of 0.18 pence in VAT at the 10 per cent rate, making the then total increase 2 pence on a glass of spirits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear there will be the same problem here of diminishing returns and I would ask the Minister to give revenue and volume figures.  I reiterate my belief that this budget was unnecessary.  The additional duty on spirits together with the 50 per cent increase in VAT from 1 September represent a very substantial imposition.  Perhaps the Minister would inform us as to the effect on the CPI.  The arguments made by any Minister of Finance in defending a position on indirect taxation will not stand up.  There are many arguments as to the real drop in volume sales of spirits in the previous year and that argument still continues.  There is no doubt that there has been a drop and I believe the situation will worsen.  What Deputy Fitzpatrick said in relation to beer is equally relevant to spirits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always supported the concept of centralised bargaining under a national wage agreement and this Government have been careless in their approach to the idea of centralised bargaining.  This point is relevant here because of the effect on the CPI and the establishment of a norm.  I should like the Minister to tell the House how 9.5 per cent became <Col N="1702" /> 6.5 per cent.  He knows I am aware how this was achieved but perhaps he would explain it to the House.  This must constitute a great breakthrough in mathematics.  It was an unbelievable achievement, particularly when the first figure was achieved during a three-week period and the second in 24 hours.  We wish to know what the principle is because it will stand out in the history of political advance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should go black to dealing with spirits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister enjoys the point I am making because he knows that it was quite an achievement. Perhaps the mathematics involved will be explained sometime.  There is a move, especially among younger drinkers, away from more traditional spirits such as whiskey towards white spirits.  As Minister for Finance I was concerned about imposing additional indirect taxation on spirits because of the fear of diminishing returns and the effect on employment.  As the House knows, Irish Distillers did have quite an amount of short-time working. The Minister talks about my arguments being contradictory.  Whoever may hold that office, his defences will become more contradictory as time progresses if we continue to depend on the old reliables in the area of indirect taxation.  Remember the Minister forms part of a Government with a commitment to a transfer of direct taxation to indirect taxation of, we are told, approximately 8 per cent; there are various figures floating about.  In other words within two to three months at the most the Minister will face another problem, that of indirect taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore we must ask ourselves, how far can we go?  In beer I believe we are at the stage of diminishing returns.  In spirits I suspect we may be in a more serious position.  Deputy Fitzpatrick <i>(Dublin South-Central)</i> referred earlier to the importance of achieving a moderate wage increase, something to which we all aspire.  However, account must be taken also of the capacity of industry to pay, and the workers' plight and position in relation to changes such as these. <Col N="1703" /> Obviously if the increase is too low &mdash; as Deputy Fitzpatrick said &mdash; it will have a major impact on beer but even more so on spirits.  That is why I am pointing out the position to the Minister.  For example, has he any room, within the white spirits area and the traditional whiskey, to effect any changes?  I am opposed to the imposition of duty.  I was concerned earlier this year myself because of the half-time working obtaining in Irish Distillers.  They are large employers in the east Cork area and jobs like those are important.  Having had little choice available to one &mdash; how else was one to raise the necessary capital &mdash; and having touched it in January I believe there was no need then to have taken the action in July.  Again, we oppose this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy realises that there is a problem with regard to whiskey.  Indeed I am sure he realised it before introducing his January budget when he imposed 12 pence on the glass of whiskey whereas this excise increase imposes a mere two pence.  This, combined with the value-added tax increase, brings the total to 9.2 pence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would repeat what he has just said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, of course.  I shall repeat it all.  I was surprised at Deputy Fitzgerald talking obviously with some knowledge of the problems of buoyancy and perhaps diminishing returns in the matter of whiskey sales and sales of spirits generally.  I am sure he knew that before introducing his budget in January.  Yet in that budget he imposed 12 pence on whiskey.  He has said just a moment ago that while he did not want to do so &mdash; no doubt he did not want to do it &mdash; he felt he had to in order to raise the revenue necessary to keep the country going.  In that he probably sympathises and understands the position I face and indeed faced in July when I found that even with the 12 pence he had imposed in January, the figures for the likely outturn as far as revenue as against expenditure for 1981 was concerned were completely out of <Col N="1704" /> line.  However, I had to take action.  I was faced with all of the same reluctance in regard to increasing these taxes as I am sure Deputy Gene Fitzgerald felt way back in January.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, as a community, we have not been able to achieve any sort of control on public expenditure.  The figures estimated at the beginning of the year of what will be spent simply mean nothing within a few months because of supplementary demands and other increases.  That is what happened in the first six months of this year when expenditure went way ahead of what had been anticipated in the January budget figures. Action had to be taken immediately by the incoming Government if we were not to face an altogether intolerable situation by the end of the year which would have had a serious impact on our international credit position on which we, as a major foreign borrower, rely all too much.  The effect of the combined increases in the prices of spirits in the July budget is significantly less than the increase imposed by the previous Minister in the January budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the question I am answering.  The point I am making is that they came to 9.2 pence as against 12 pence in the January budget.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the possibility of diminishing returns in the area of whiskey and spirits generally.  I must say that there definitely is a problem here.  The figures for sales have shown a decline since 1978.  In 1978 there was an increase of 13.4 per cent in the consumption of whiskey over the previous year.  In 1979 there was a decline of 1.3 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that in volume terms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It declined in 1980 to 7.3 per cent.  It was against the background of those two declines that the then Minister imposed 12 pence on whiskey <Col N="1705" /> in the January 1981 budget.  That puts the situation in context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that at that time the Minister would not known&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy says he did not know I will accept that.  I will go so far as to say he was not in a position to know the figures for the latter few months of 1980 but probably did have those for the first few months.  I have the figures for the first nine months of 1981 available to me now.  Therefore, the then Minister probably had the figures for the last 10 or 11 months of 1980 available to him when he decided on his 12 pence in the January budget.  Therefore the fact that he did not have the December returns does not constitute much of a case for his increase in January.  However, in a sense this is a futile argument because we both know the country is in a serious dilemma as far as public finances are concerned.  That means doing things we would not otherwise do and which do cause certain problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not agree but I think some Members of his party would agree with me in this.  I have heard them on radio and television from time to time.  In fact Deputy Woods had the goodness to acknowledge that a supplementary budget would be necessary in the second half of 1981 anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>And I am aware of statements of a similar nature by Deputy O'Malley.  The decline in consumption in the first nine months of 1981 in volume terms, was 2.2 per cent on the corresponding nine months of 1980.  I have those figures now which illustrate again that the then Minister had fairly substantial figures available to him before imposing <Col N="1706" /> his 12 pence on whiskey and other spirits in the January budget.  The revenue derived from these sales in the first nine months, January to September, 1981 was 24.6 per cent more than was collected in the same period in 1980 &mdash; £83 million as against £66.6 million.  The effect of the excise increase of two pence on the CPI at the time of the budget itself was 0.052&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the excise duty only.  The value-added tax increase which came into effect on 1 September was 0.169 per cent giving a total of 0.221 per cent of the CPI.  The overall estimated effect of this on consumption was to be a drop of 2 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not given any indication of the consumption trend in spirits in the past nine months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I said there has been a 2.2 per cent drop between January and September.  In a period there has been a drop of the difference between 4.425 million litres and 4.326 million litres.  I can see the point the Deputy has been making. He is asking us not to over-penalise the whiskey industry.  However, the duty is based on alcoholic content and the alcoholic content of white spirits is less than that of whiskey.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the duty charged on white spirits is less.  If we were to charge the same duty on spirits with less alcoholic content as on whiskey there would be a further distortion and dislocation.  I do not think that the excise duty regime could be changed around in that way just to suit public taste, because people are changing from whiskey to white spirits, much to the regret of those of us who are traditional whiskey drinkers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not rigid.  It is simply <Col N="1707" /> that you must pay duty on the amount of alcohol in your drink.  Therefore, if you charge more duty on vodka with its smaller alcohol content than on whiskey you would be introducing a new discrimination into the tax code which would cause problems.  I take the point the Deputy is making.</P>

This section hits the hard pressed cigarette and pipe smoker who are again being asked to bear an extra burden.  The duty on pipe smokers for years lost the support of Michael Pat Murphy in the House.  Any time there was an increase in tobacco duty he went into detail on it. I am concerned about the effect on employment in the tobacco industry. Because of no-smoking campaigns, the duty on tobacco had reached the point of diminishing returns, and any Minister for Finance would do well to look into that aspect because the probability is that in future there will be a substantial decrease in revenue.

This can all be discussed across the House but I should like to know, particularly in view of the Fine Gael programme and the promise to transfer from direct to indirect taxation, what consideration the Minister has given to the proposals in relation to the areas of diminishing returns in the first three areas the Minister mentioned?  They are the old reliables and some of the areas that take the brunt of indirect taxation.  In the light of the Minister's experience I should like to know what he feels about the suggested 8 per cent impact there could be on the CPI because of the proposal.  As the Minister is aware, the advertisements are ready for the £9.60 allowance.  I should like the Minister's comments on that.  I presume the advertisements will be factual and I hope we will not get the type of high publicity campaign being operated by the Government at present. In other words, I hope we do not get a campaign to project the Taoiseach's image.  However, when the Taoiseach makes some statements like he did yesterday they can be seen by the public as being all wrong.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> I am always confused when duty is imposed on cigarettes because it must arouse a conflict between the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance, and the Revenue Commissioners rightly are concerned about revenue.  They are not concerned about a reduction in the sales of cigarettes.  In fact, they want the opposite, they want buoyancy.  It is the duty of the Minister for Health, on the other hand, to try to discourage cigarette smoking.  I try to do it with my family but I am not always successful.  I wonder if a common ground can be found between those conflicting ideas.  It is obvious that cigarette smoking is damaging to health.  With regard to the increase in the cost of tobacco the only section of the community I am concerned about are the old age pensioners who use hard-pressed tobacco.  About 16 years ago I believe there was a special provision for hard-pressed tobacco as against cigarettes.  I thought a concession was made then that came down in favour of old age pensioners.  Whether we like it or not that is the only luxury many old age pensioners have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer to see a man smoking a pipe than cigarettes and we should make provision so that hard-pressed tobacco carries a lesser duty than cigarettes because health experts tell us that pipe smoking is not as detrimental to health as is cigarette smoking.  We must bear in mind that there is an industry to be considered.  Some basis should be found between the Minister for Finance who wants revenue and, if possible, to increase buoyancy, and the Minister for Health whose duty it is to ensure that cigarette smoking is reduced for the sake of the health of the people.  I accept that some people find it impossible to give up cigarette smoking but they should be encouraged to change to pipe smoking. <Col N="1711" /> That is my case for making a difference between hard-pressed tobacco and cigarettes.  I can understand the complications this would mean for the Revenue Commissioners but it should be possible to differentiate between the revenue for those products.  I should like to know the total that the Government take on a packet of 20 cigarettes, including VAT and revenue, and that on an ounce of hard-pressed tobacco.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That was introduced in 1932 as a subsidy for local industry.  It has been retained since and it was in the form of a rebate until 1978.  When the duties were restructured in that year the rebates were done away with but the effect of it was preserved in the form of a preferential rate of duty.  The reason then was that put forward by Deputy Fitzpatrick on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to make a comparison.  Cigarettes are levied on the basis of the number of cigarettes, per 1,000 cigarettes, and cigars and hard-pressed and pipe tobacco generally are levied on the basis of a kilogram.  I will give the Deputy a comparison between piped tobacco and cigars which may be indicative.  The rate of duty proposed in the budget&mdash;it will reflect the previous practice&mdash;is £30.699 per kilogram on <Col N="1712" /> cigars.  The equivalent of cigarette duty in terms of pounds raised per kilogram of cigarettes is: cigarettes, £27.91; cigars, £30.699; Cavendish or negro head, £31.022&mdash;they are slim panatellas; hard-pressed tobacco, in contrast, £19.84; other piped tobacco, £24.938 and other smoking or chewing tobacco, £25.906.  One can see, therefore, that there is a difference between hard-pressed tobacco at £19.84 and £27.90 for cigarettes.</P>

They are likely to have been distorted by pre-budget purchases or purchases prior to 1 September to avoid the increase in VAT. Deputy Fitzpatrick has agreed with me on that.  These month-to-month figures tend to be highly variable.  All I can give is the advice I have from the Revenue Commissioners which is that the level of receipt of duty is in line with the target set out in the budget.

These increases attract an additional payment of VAT on the then obtaining 10 per cent rate and raises the total tax content of a bottle of wine by amounts varying between 10p and 20p a bottle on budget day.  As the House is aware, the level of VAT has been increased from 10 per cent to 15 per cent as of 1 September 1981.

I know the Revenue Commissioners will go on strength, but where wine is priced in a restaurant or a hotel it is not always the strength that matters but the quality, how it is kept, its age and so on.  I am not sure that the Minister will get at the root of the problem with this degree of strength.  If the Minister is going to tax stout, the working man's drink, I do not see any reason why he should not tax dear wines in proportion to their price. Anyone who can afford to pay £18 or £20 for a bottle of wine should be taxed proportionately.  However, I think the cheaper wine will suffer.  I know the Minister is going on the strength &mdash; there is probably no other way to work it &mdash; but I do not think the very dear wines will be <Col N="1716" /> sufficiently taxed, because it will be very hard to define their strength.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct as far as excise duty is concerned.  The amount charged is related solely to the alcoholic content as far as wine is concerned.  In so far as excise duty is concerned, there is no special weighting for an expensive wine which is <i>Appellation Contrôlée</i>, which will have a higher price because of that.  As far as value-added tax is concerned that is not the case, because that is on a percentage of the price and, obviously, the more expensive wine will bear a higher VAT content. There is also discrimination between sparkling wine, champagnes, in that they have a higher duty content for a given alcoholic content.  The duty is significantly more in the case of sparking wines.</P>

      <P>On 6 May 1981 the present Minister said he opposed the section, because it had substantially increased the price of petrol used by working people and had also increased the price of diesel oil which in turn, would substantially increase costs in industry. Now the Minister expects the senior Government member from Limerick, Deputy Kemmy, to support the increase in petrol.  The Minister had the audacity to <Col N="1718" /> make his remarks on 6 May regarding the increase in the price of petrol and today he is sitting coolly in the House expecting support from poor Deputy Kemmy who will be charged with increasing the price of petrol in his home constituency.  The Minister also expects other Independent members to support the measure and yet he was not in favour of any increase in May 1981.  The turnabouts and twisting of the Government are reaching new proportions.  The 9.5 per cent recommendation of the committee on costs and competitiveness, by some major mathematical achievement overnight, was reduced to 6.5 per cent.  We will hear of it being the principle of the Minister in the years to come&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>You may not be entirely correct in your ruling because I will quote another interesting snippet from another member of the present Government on 6 May 1981 in relation to the Finance (No. 1) Bill:</P>
      <P>The contribution of the increased price of petrol which is essential for getting people to work, has played its part in increasing the cost of living this year.  There are many parts, not alone in rural Ireland but in Dublin City, where people going to work must provide their own transport.</P>
      <P>Now, who said that?  The Tánaiste, Deputy O'Leary, leader of the once proud Labour Party, in this House on 6 May.  Without turning a hair, he made that statement a very short time ago and how right he was.  Then when they take office one of the first things the Coalition Government hit by indirect taxation is petrol, which is no longer a luxury, but is essential to the people of rural and urban Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This further imposition by the Government on its own and with the addition of VAT will have an effect on the CPI, <Col N="1719" /> which I will want to know from them. The Minister a short time ago, as Finance Opposition spokesman, saw no reason why the then Minister for Finance should not give special tax concessions to the workers travelling to work who use their own transport.  The Minister's memory is not so short.  He remembers that.  Has he now the same sympathy of practical application for these people, seeing that he has increased their travelling problem?  His predecessor, Deputy Ryan, came into this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;some years back.  He does not agree with the present Minister.  He has said that their tax promises must be scrapped before the economy is driven mad and places a burden on every worker.  What the senior Government Member for Limerick, Deputy Kemmy, has to face in travelling is a burden on him.  Deputy Ryan asked if it was possible to give these people this allowance, in November 1974 or 1975, when putting a heavy burden on the people by an increase in the price of petrol.  He said then that there were too many cars on the road and that the people living in rural Ireland should use one car for going to work, rather than four.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Flor Crowley Mr. Flor Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flor Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember hearing him that night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Deputy meant it, as a Member of the South Dublin constituency.  He would not realise the difficulties which face people in rural Ireland in trying to do just that.  He did not see anything wrong in what he said.  However, it is not as simple as that.  I am sure that there are many workers travelling together in twos, threes and fours, when they live in the same area and work in the same area or workplace.</P>
      <P>We will oppose this legislation and in opposing it, I draw attention to what the Minister, then Deputy Bruton said in this House, on 6 May which is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The taxpayer therefore has to pay the full cost of travelling to work and <Col N="1720" /> the increases in the price of petrol introduced by the Government in this budget discourage people from travelling to work and taking up employment within our economy.  This is something that has been greeted with very serious reservations by large sections of the public and perhaps it is the one element in the budget which attracted the greatest opprobium from practically everybody in Ireland.  We all know the price of petrol has gone up enough as it is as a result of the increased prices imposed by the oil supplying countries.  For our Government to come along and increase the prices even more strikes a very heavy blow to the production sectors of our economy.</P>
    <P>Now, listen to this.</P>
    <P>When accompanied by very high rates of motor insurance&mdash;</P>
    <P>And this was before the last 25 per cent petrol increase.</P>
    <P>&mdash;it is something which should not be introduced.</P>
    <P>Two-and-a-half months later, that same spokesman introduced the budget which we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>May I quote further from what the Tánaiste had to say on 6 May regarding the increase in the price of petrol:</P>
    <P>Whatever the Minister may say, he should be in no doubt that this was one of the most unpopular features of the recent budget.  It is appropriate that the House should make its opposition to that rather mistaken policy.  I understand how it has come about, and at the end of the day the Government's housekeeping arrangements are awry. They were forced in the circumstances to look for revenue in this very undesirable way, considering the effects that this measure has had on the economy.</P>
    <P>That was then Deputy Michael O'Leary, now Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Energy, speaking in the House.  Coalition Governments have always had a great capacity to reverse <Col N="1721" /> direction, change direction or alter the steering, with no apologies or excuses offered &mdash; just a U turn.  We oppose this measure very strongly.  I do not have to make the argument.  I need only quote from the Minister himself who shed crocidile tears for his constituents back in May last.  A few months later, those same Members see fit to introduce further increases to hit the worker going to and from his or her workplace, whether urban or rural, to hit industry &mdash; as of course it can only do, and very seriously.  I heard my colleague, Deputy Woods, make a point in this House on the already hard pressed health estimates and budgets for the health boards, having no extra provision for the increased cost of petrol and so forth.  These are just a few of the impacts and impositions of this petrol increase.  I have not found it necessary to use arguments, but have quoted from what Deputy Bruton, now Minister for Finance, and Deputy O'Leary, now Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Energy, said in the first part of this year on Committee Stage of the Finance (No. 1) Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am struck by the fact that Deputy Fitzgerald could not make his own speech on this subject, but had to rely on arguments produced by me in the past.  I suppose, in a sense, that is a back handed compliment for the work which I was doing, that I was able to marshal all the arguments at that time, whereas he could not think of any new ones for this occassion.  That does not suggest that the Deputy has been over-industrious in preparing his brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason this budget was introduced was that the financial provisions of the 1981 budget had gone completely out of line.  The expenditure was far greater than that provided in the January 1981 budget by the then Minister for Finance. There would have been no need whatsoever for this increase in the price of petrol or any of the other things if that budget had been a genuine one and if genuine efforts had been made by the then Minister for Finance and his colleagues to ensure the figures for expenditure <Col N="1722" /> they agreed to were adhered to.  We would not, on taking office last June, have had to introduce a budget with any increases in taxation if the previous Government had done their job properly in last January's budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Minister but the Chair has been insistent on keeping the minds of Deputies on what is in the section under discussion.  I remind the Minister that while reference back may be accepted as part of the case being made it may not widen the scope of what we are discussing here in section 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point I would like to make is that if remarks quoted in the House are to be made the subject of debate on this occasion it is important that the context in which those remarks were made should also be put on the record of the House so that the people who read the record and listen to the debate will appreciate the true situation. It is only with that in mind that I have referred back.  I fully appreciate the point you are making about keeping to the section.</P>
      <P>In the course of the budget debate last July I acknowledged quite clearly that I saw a major problem for many motorists when I had to introduce those increases for petrol.  I fully concede the problem people going to work face and also the increased charges imposed on them.  I have never attempted in any of the discussions on the budget here or elsewhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never attempted to minimise the serious adverse effects on the personal budgets of many people this has had.  There is no insincerity.  I am not trying to pretend that it is otherwise than <Col N="1723" /> a serious imposition on the people.  There is no substance for the charge being made that this budget and the increased petrol charges involved in it are a propaganda exercise.  Both sides of the House know that it is a serious imposition on the people.  It is ludicrous to suggest that people would try to seek benefit for themselves by imposing increases of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were faced with the necessity in July to raise the money that we were faced with raising, because the prospective budget deficit would be in the region of £950 million by the end of this year as against the predicted figure of around £500 million in the January budget, we had to look at all the possible sources of taxation available to us at that time.  Income tax cannot be changed in the middle of a year.  The income for tax purposes is levied over a whole year and one cannot change rates in a supplementary budget in the middle of a year.  That can only be done in an annual budget.</P>
      <P>The same goes for most forms of taxation.  We were not left with a choice.  We had to raise the money by indirect tax if we were to raise any money at all in July to get back to a situation where we would be on some sort of an even keel.  We had to turn to all the possible options in the area of indirect taxation.  Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy Fitzpatrick have indicated that there are limits in the matter of diminishing returns to what one can raise by means of tax on beer, cigarettes and VAT.  I was forced to the conclusion that I could not raise all that had to be raised to close the gap that had been opened up because the January 1981 budget had not been a genuine one, I had reluctantly to turn to raising a substantial part of the money which had to be raised by means of tax on petrol.  I recognised, in making that decision, all of the arguments I made from the other side of the House last May, which Deputy Fitzgerald is now repeating on this occasion.  It was with considerable reluctance that I was forced to make the decision I made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I felt that on balance one had to do <Col N="1724" /> something to put our finances in order as a top priority, otherwise the situation we would face by the end of 1981 would be quite intolerable.  Our figures would have been so bad, internationally, that we would not be in a position to borrow the money we must borrow abroad if we are to invest in improving the productive capacity of the economy.  It is the Government's commitment to continue investment, if necessary to finance it by borrowing abroad, to develop our infrastructure and prospects for employment. It would not be possible to make those borrowings with the confidence of the bankers who are lending us money unless we took action to prevent a situation, which was unfolding when we took office last June, whereby our balance of payments deficit was running completely out of control because of an uncontrolled current budget deficit by the previous Government.  It was in that context that I was forced by the realities of the situation to take the action I took in relation to petrol notwithstanding all the points Deputy Fitzgerald has made, the validity of which I recognise as being as valid now as when I spoke those words.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this section.  I am consistent in opposing it. When the increase in the price of petrol came in last January's budget I listened to the present Minister for Finance &mdash; I will not go over what he said &mdash; and his views were my views at that time.  In my speech on Second Reading of that Finance Bill I commented on the hardship imposed on people by the increased price of petrol.  The case now being made by Deputy Fitzgerald was made by the Minister for Finance when he was on this side of the House.  The then Minister for Finance said that the tax was absolutely essential but the present Minister for Finance is now saying that the previous Government did not go far enough to carry us over the 12-month period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>They put up the very same case the Minister is now putting up. <Col N="1725" /> I said that I thought the increase in the price of petrol imposed at that time was a hardship on certain people.  I am speaking about my constituency, which is 30 miles from Galway city.  There are many people from my area who are working in Galway city.  Their cars are not a luxury. They have to use them to get to work. The increase in the price of petrol imposed in this budget is part of the reason why it is so hard to get a national wage agreement.  The cost of travelling to and from work has increased.</P>
      <P>Another section of the community adversely affected by any increase in the price of petrol are the small farmers.  Their standard of living has been reduced.  A tanker collects milk from a large supplier, but the small suppliers in my area have a small tank which they put in the back of the car to bring their milk to the creamery every morning.  They have to have a car with a fairly strong horse-power.  A car with a low horse-power cannot pull a tanker.  A mini-car is of no use to small farmers.  The increase in the price of petrol will affect the income of small farmers adversely, and the income of all farmers.  Sometimes a farmer takes a beast to the mart in a trailer and he is definitely affected by any increase in the price of petrol.</P>
      <P>Petrol price increases affect the worker who has to travel to and from work and the farmer.  I do not want to make political propaganda when I say farm income has fallen consistently.  Anyone who knows anything about farming knows that.  I often wonder how many Deputies know or care a damn about farmers.  This increase in the price of petrol will definitely cause hardship to the small farmer.</P>
      <P>I am opposed to section 6 for these reasons.  I will not talk about some of the other increases on what might be called luxuries.  I want to get it across to everybody that a car is no longer a luxury.  The inconsistency I see in the statements made by all parties when they are on different sides of the House annoys me. I have always tried to be consistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Flor Crowley Mr. Flor Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flor Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is becoming a <Col N="1726" /> fetish with Government Minister to blame the Fianna Fáil Party for all the ills.  As the months go by their arguments are becoming more and more hollow. Regardless of what the Minister said, I cannot see any justification for this massive imposition of tax on energy.  No section of the community is immune from this savage tax.  Deputy Callanan referred to the small farmer and the small man who has to travel a long distance to work. They are not the only people affected. The employer is also affected seriously by this imposition, the employer upon whom we depend so much as a private enterprise economy.</P>
      <P>I am not saying the Minister had the easiest of tasks &mdash; no Minister for Finance ever has &mdash; but he showed political and economic misjudgement in this imposition.  We talk about reducing unemployment and looking after our young people and getting jobs for them, but we will sound very insincere if we drive up the cost of energy and in doing so create more unemployment and put more people on the dole queues.</P>
      <P>The margins of most manufacturers and business men are so small that even an increase of 1 per cent can make the difference between continuing in business and going out of business.  It has never been my custom in political life to preach doom and gloom, but the Government must wake up to the fact that ultimately this form of taxation is counterproductive.  The Minister may say he had to take action in the short term, but this step is counterproductive and we should be more far-seeing.  Apart from the value-added tax, about which we will be talking later, this is the most draconian taxation ever introduced by any Government.  It is like asking Dracula to treat somebody who is suffering from acute anaemia.  It appears to me to be as stupid as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I run a small business and I give employment to a certain member of people.  Even where you can control a small business and where a small number of people are involved, it is becoming harder and harder to survive.  Instead of creating an atmosphere of optimism in the economy, the Government are doing <Col N="1727" /> the opposite.  If there were a change of Government in the morning there would be an aura of optimism.  The essential difference between the Coalition Government and the Fianna Fáil Party is that we have always had confidence in this country.  We have been optimistic about the capabilities of the people.  In Coalition after Coalition, Ministers make the same mistakes and the same errors.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough that we have no real job creation schemes, but people in employment are not protected.  They will be at their most vulnerable as a result of the imposition of this tax.  The only word to describe their policy is &ldquo;monetarist&rdquo;, a policy which brings out the worst in capitalism and drives to the wall those who are trying to survive in small businesses.  When we examine the benefits versus the liabilities of this form of taxation we cannot doubt that the ultimate economic well-being of the country was seriously affected by the last budget.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may go around the country at his swashbuckling best and blame Fianna Fáil, but he will have to walk over many economic corpses on the grassy slopes of Ireland.  The Government must indoctrinate themselves with the belief that they are in Government and not in Opposition.</P>

      <P>I have been trying to show that the imposition of this tax on <Col N="1729" /> petrol and hydrocarbons will seriously affect the economy in the long term.  I was about to quote the late Seán Lemass who said &ldquo;a rising tide lifts all boats&rdquo;. That is relevant to the present situation. If the Government, by the imposition of these taxes and the preaching of gloom and doom, continue in this way they will depress the economy and all the economic boats will sink without trace.</P>
      <P>I know that in Opposition it is easy to make cockshots of Ministers and of the Government but I believe that in relation to these taxes the Government have been less than sincere.  They have imposed savage taxes and have blamed Fianna Fáil. I am sure this was a propaganda exercise. Perhaps the Minister for Finance was not involved in it but he has to carry out his duties and he is subject to a higher authority.  I am very worried about the future economic well-being because people will no longer be able to travel to work.  In my constituency many people have to travel long distances to work. When Deputy Ryan was Minister for Finance he said that people should get together and arrange to travel to work in the one car where buses were not available.  That is the only way they can afford to travel.  Between redundancies, the closure of factories and loss of jobs, even in the service industries, fewer and fewer people will be travelling long distances to work.</P>
      <P>A few minutes ago I asked the Minister if expectations or &ldquo;guesstimates&rdquo; of income were measuring up in reality and his answer was that they seemed to be, as far as he could judge the situation.  I was rather surprised because when we have a situation where unemployment is growing, ultimately the buying power of the population is reduced and as a result the income to the Government will be drastically reduced.  Perhaps that has not yet caught up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we come to the farming community.  I do not think anyone in the House doubts that if we have an economically viable farming industry all of us will benefit.  So much of this economy depends on agriculture for its success that the slightest slowing-down of progress in <Col N="1730" /> agriculture can have dramatic consequences for the country.  What other way can the farming industry be more seriously undermined than by taxing its basic resource, namely energy?  That industry cannot get by without using energy and hydrocarbons in massive quantities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gene Fitzgerald was right when he said many crocodile tears were being shed.  Even a person without an economics degree or without third level education is aware that if we tax the energy needed to produce our agricultural goods we will affect to some degree the output of that industry.  That is what has happened.  I do not see the Minister for Agriculture making any attempt whatever to highlight that fact.  The executive of the IFA have been conspicuously silent about the tax.  Perhaps it is because their former employee is now Minister for Agriculture that they are so silent.  There is no doubt that farmers have been seriously affected by the imposition of this tax.  Even farmers who are not in financial trouble are not making decisions about development, about purchasing more machinery or erecting buildings.  Many of them believe the Government when they say the country is in such a bad state.  The Government are doing themselves a disservice by this continuous harping on the state of the economy.</P>

      <P>I thought it was relevant to section 6.  I was talking about the imposition of tax on petrol and diesel oils.  If that is not relevant I do not know what is.  I do not want to start an argument with the Chair because that would be counter-productive and there would be no advantage for anyone in it.  The Chair has an important duty to perform and I realise how difficult that duty is.  I do not want to be the one to make the Chair's job more difficult.  However, I am sure the Chair appreciates that I must speak on behalf of the people I represent. I see how they are affected by this tax and the only forum I have in which to make their complaints is the Dáil.  If I stray off the line occasionally I am sorry. I will try to be relevant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flor Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not discussed VAT which is as great an imposition.  I confined my remarks solely to energy because that is the basic source by which we create wealth.  If we affect that source we will dampen, if not cut, the creation of wealth.</P>
      <P>Grand gestures in relation to the economy such as the youth employment scheme and so on are of no use if we do not look after existing industries and keep people in jobs.  The imposition of this tax seriously undermines the future employment of thousands of people.  The Minister should try to bring in some form of relief.  He brought in relief for industry and should do so for the farming community.  Their energy costs are escalating. Every job, either directly or indirectly, is related to agriculture and any help the Minister can give to the farming community in subsiding their energy costs would be for the good of the country.</P>

      <P>In dealing with section 6, which is very important, I wish to be associated with all the comments made by spokesmen on this side of the House. I could give a full run down on the Minister's statement which he made in May when he was Opposition spokesman dealing with our Finance Bill.

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It reminds me of the poacher becoming the game-keeper.  The Minister is doing a fine job as game-keeper.  I do not see any great improvement in society as a result of these impositions.  No extra jobs have been created. No part of this fund has been allocated to creating employment in the farming industry.  The imposition has had a serious effect on the income of farmers, workers and employers.  Any progressive farmer must have a tractor and a car.  He must have transport and energy.  He must have diesel for his tractor to help harvest <Col N="1733" /> crops, go to the creamery and so on.  By increasing taxation the Minister has seriously damaged the income of farmers.  In industry these increases can be offset against an increase in the price of goods manufactured.  People would have a very good case to make because of the increased cost of the transportation of their goods to retailers or outlets.  Farmers have no such redress.  They cannot go to the mart and ask the auctioneer to get an extra few pounds to compensate for the fact that it was more expensive for them to transport their stock to the mart. An important section of farmers' incomes has been eroded.</P>
      <P>As a former spokesman on agriculture and as a practising farmer you should be aware of the serious detrimental effects of your imposition in the budget you brought before the House and which you are trying to justify.</P>

Young people find it impossible to own their own cars due to the cost of petrol and other charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the practice to regard as confidential details of discussions at Prime Minister level.  My predecessor made that very point in reply to a question from Deputy O'Keeffe on 29 April 1980 in relation to the meeting in Luxembourg with the British Prime Minister.  Regarding Question No. 4 I understand that the Deputy has a question down on the same lines to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and he will be replying to that question in due course.</P>

Also, what is particularly confidential in regard to answering the question about the Workers' Council strike and the likelihood of such a tactic being invoked again?  In regard to Question No. 4 what is there that cannot be answered by a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or a &ldquo;no&rdquo; on the question of Republican prisoners both in Irish and in British jails in the context of the promise made by Mr. Jenkins to do something about the situation in terms of treatment and so on?

      <P>All weekly social welfare payments have been increased from the beginning of October.

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State accept that the practice up to now of flat increases in rates of benefit has resulted in the increases being less in the case of dependants?  The Opposition refer often to their having increased social welfare payments by 20 per cent in their last budget but in reality the increase for dependants was of the order of 8 to 9 per cent.  In the interest of honesty would the Minister agree that the same level of increases should apply to dependants as applies to beneficiaries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that was what the Deputy had in mind.  The practice followed by the last Government in April was that the personal and adult dependant rates were increased by 25 per cent with a 20 per cent increase for short-term benefits, but child dependant rates were increased by 10 per cent only. Perhaps in those circumstances there was a certain misleading by the usage of the term &ldquo;general increase of 25 per cent&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I have one final supplementary.  Would the Minister of State regard as desirable the continuation of the ridiculous situation that pertains now as far as social welfare allowance funding is concerned where you have a scheme initiated by the Department of Social Welfare, regulations as to the amount of benefit to be paid taken without consultation with anybody, the health boards authorised to implement the scheme and they subsequently having to get funding of it from <Col N="1741" /> the local authorities?  Would the Minister regard that as a desirable and acceptable form of dealing with supplementary welfare allowances?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if she is aware that the Eastern Health Board informed Deputy Gay Mitchell that delays in issuing fuel vouchers in his constituency at the beginning of the year arose because Dublin Corporation were allegedly having the vouchers printed and there was a problem with the printers; if, in view of the fact that the corporation deny this, she <Col N="1742" /> will ascertain why the Deputy was so informed; and if she is satisfied that such delays will not recur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question evidently refers to the issue of supplementary vouchers to implement the increase in the value of the fuel scheme from £2 to £3 weekly under the 1981 budget.  I am not in a position to comment on this allegation regarding the information stated to have been given by the Eastern Health Board regarding delay in having supplementary vouchers printed but I am satisfied&mdash;and from discussions I imagine this is the main thrust&mdash;that such delay as did occur did not affect the position of the recipients.  The corporation and the health board involved moved separately with the result that at no point were the beneficiaries without the vouchers or the value of the vouchers and they had sufficient vouchers in their possession from mid-January to avail themselves of the budget increase until the supplementary vouchers were available.</P>

      <P>I would consider it fairly serious if anybody was misinforming anybody else, and particularly a Member of the Dáil.  I gather from my reading of the correspondence in the matter that where delay was mentioned in one case the reference was to a normal delay and it may have been interpreted as an exceptional delay.  The difficulty may be more <Col N="1743" /> apparent, but if the Deputy feels that there are matters still outstanding about which my reply has not satisfied him I will be willing to meet with him personally and discuss this with him further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I have that in my file.  The important consequence was that pending the printing by the corporation extra vouchers were issued to cover the increase until the point where the supplementary vouchers were ready and printed by the corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State saying, therefore, that in effect the delay in reaching a decision about the rate which was to be applied to the vouchers meant that there was difficulty in the printing process for the corporation and presumably for others who had to face that problem?  Would she ensure, therefore, that a similar situation does not arise now in relation to the Christmas double week?  As she knows, that double week is to go into operation in the week commencing 7 December and as yet the legislation has not come before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The best way to <Col N="1745" /> approach the matter of children attending educational institutions is through educational grants and this Government have significantly increased the level of the grant and eligibility limits.  In the past many seemingly well-intentioned proposals merely complicated the schemes and the best procedure would be to continue on the lines already adopted by the Government in significantly improving grants and making them directly available to students.  The value of such a grant would amount to significantly more than the amount involved in the type of payment of which the Deputy speaks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Those attending third level education have been very well treated by this Government at a time of grave economic recession and the level of payments is extremely generous.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that fishermen are classified as self-employed by her Department and there is an anomaly in regard to tax payments because they are classified as PAYE workers?  Would the Minister accept it is unfair that a fisherman who may earn £500 for a season has to give an <Col N="1747" /> account of his earnings when he goes to the unemployment exchange while someone employed for a similar period who may have earned double the amount of money has only to give the date he finished employment and the name of his employer?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is moving into an area outside the scope of this question.

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that her Department classify these fishermen as self-employed?  I am concerned mainly with part-time fishermen. When they wish to draw social Welfare payments they have to give an account of their earnings and if they earned £500 their payments are cut by £10.  A person in my constituency who does temporary work for Bord na Móna and who earns double that amount automatically draws unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter raised seems out of line with the question, but I will explain the thinking of the Department on this matter.  The Deputy refers to seasonal fishermen on the Mayo coast who fish for salmon and lobster for a few months of the year.  For unemployment assistance purposes, they are assessed on profits from fishing.  Profits are assessed less expenses and there is a further disregard of £120 per year allowed under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is in contrast to the earnings of employees who are working under a contract of service.  They are statutorily excluded from the assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes. However, employees can claim only when their employment cases whereas self-employed seasonal fishermen can claim all year round and they are paid the appropriate rate of unemployment assistance <Col N="1748" /> less the weekly means averaged over the full year.  Income is taken into account over a yearly basis and is assessed as part of the normal assessment for supplementary assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give full consideration to this matter?  The fishermen she has mentioned are part-time, seasonal.  They are being deprived of the maximum rate of unemployment assistance during the winter when they cannot go to sea.  I support Deputy Gallagher and I ask the Minister to give further consideration to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been raised on many occasions.  The fishermen in this case would seem to be a particular group.  They fall to be examined through the method open to everybody else who, to some extent, is self-employed.  A system which appeared to be universally fair might prove to be unfair in some cases. This would seem to be a matter which could be examined by the new agency which has been set up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the practice of my Department to notify in advance recipients of disability benefit that payment is about to be terminated when for any reason entitlement ceases.  Where, however, payment of benefit is disallowed following examination by a medical referee, who expresses the opinion that the claimant is capable of work, payment is disallowed from the date of examination or from the date of last payment, whichever is the later.  In such cases the claimant is advised, if available for employment, to make application immediately <Col N="1749" /> to the local employment exchange for unemployment benefit or assistance.  Provided he does so without undue delay the application is usually back-dated to the date of the disallowance of disability benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that in practice this is not happening?  Where there are people in receipt of sick benefit and where payments have been stopped because they might not have sufficient contributions, in practice the Department may notify them several weeks afterwards.  The position then is that the persons involved have to await payments and if they do not get them they have to go to their public representatives.  Does the Minister agree this is not a good practice, because the health boards will not make retrospective payments and consequently a period of up to seven weeks may elapse during which those people are without income.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy has specific cases in mind he should report them for examination.  Claimants whose entitlements to benefits have terminated are notified of termination of entitlements three to four weeks in advance.  When they move into a further year when their contributions are not sufficient to cover them for benefit they are notified three to four weeks beforehand.  Such persons who are without means can make application for supplementary benefits.  I repeat that if the Deputy has specific cases in mind he should have them submitted for examination.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The claim of the person concerned to a widow's non-contributory pension was originally refused by decision dated 18 June 1981 on the grounds that her means, derived from the estimated yearly value of a farm, exceeded the statutory limit of £1,716 for a widow with one qualified child.  An appeal against this decision was lodged and as a result a pension at the rate of £24.15 a week was awarded with <Col N="1756" /> effect from 9 April 1981.  This has been increased to £25.20 since 2 October.  A pension order book payable from 5 June 1981 was sent to the designated post office, for collection by her, on 12 August 1981 and a payable order for arrears of pension to 5 June was issued directly to her on 28 August 1981.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's detailed answers given to the last 15 or 16 questions I should like to know if, in view of the fact that a Government Deputy has had to resort to the parliamentary question procedure to get such replies, there is any way she can speed up such factual information either directly to the person concerned or to the Deputy, or representative, on the person's behalf?  Obviously, the information given is factual, clear and up to date.  If it is seen that a Deputy using this procedure can get replies very quickly the other 165 Deputies will adopt a similar course. Can the Minister introduce a procedure which will enable individuals, whom we are all concerned about, to get such information as has been outlined in the answers to the questions tabled by Deputy Donnellan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, where any decision has been made about any individual that individual is more aware than any representative of the action that has been taken.  Such people are the first to know when a pension book is issued because it arrives at his or her door.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the replies given are honest and straightforward and the factual information must have been conveyed to some of those mentioned in the questions as long ago as September, six or eight weeks ago, and surely that information could have been conveyed to the Deputy in the meantime rather than delaying the House?  The Minister has told the House in some of the replies that the information was available to somebody as far back as last September.  It is now 11 November.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not arguing that point with the Minister but arising from the information that has been given to the questions mentioned I should like to know if there is any way the Minister can alter the system in her Department to give replies to representations by individuals and those who make representations on behalf of such people in a speedier manner than at present?  Deputy Donnellan is entitled to put down such questions but so also are the 165 other Members and the Minister of State will be sitting here for the rest of the term answering such questions if that procedure is followed by all Members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare why a person (details supplied) in Dublin cannot be considered for benefits payable to widows particularly in view of the fact that evidence has been submitted concerning her legal status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of deserted wife's allowance from my Department since March 1974.  The allowance is at the same rate as widow's non-contributory pension which would otherwise be payable in her case.</P>
      <P>On the death of her husband abroad in 1977 she claimed widow's non-contributory pension.  Her application was refused on the grounds that she had not established that she was his widow in law as the death certificate submitted by her showed him to have been divorced.  She has, however, continued to be paid deserted wife's allowance.</P>
      <P>Her claim was reviewed recently in the light of the documentary evidence submitted by the Deputy but as the legal advice available to my Department is to the effect that a divorce obtained by a person domiciled in another jurisdiction must be recognised as valid here it is not proposed to alter the decision in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that following the death of this lady's husband a letter of administration was obtained in the High Court certifying she was his legal widow?  In those circumstances surely the Department must take <Col N="1759" /> cognisance of such a decision or does the Minister of State not agree with a judgment of the High Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The advice of the Attorney General in this case was that this was a recognised foreign divorce and the Department followed the legal advice available.  The lady's solicitor did not pursue the question of the letter of administration and accepted the point about the divorce in this case.  The Department do not have any choice but to accept the law of the land in this case.  It is regrettable that the law of the land is so deficient and has not faced up to the anomalies which now exist as a result of many deteriorating situations in the marriage situation here.  We had a similar problem earlier in the session.  It related to a different problem rather than the specific one here.  I have every sympathy with the lady in question, who obviously would prefer to be considered as a widow rather than a deserted wife.  In terms of benefit she does not suffer.  I can understand that in terms of status she does, but it is not really a matter for the Department of Social Welfare.  It is a matter of the law of the land in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the Department have followed the law of the land?  As far as the law of the land is concerned the High Court ruled that this person was a widow of the deceased at the time of his death.  If the law of the land has given this person the status of a widow the Department should do likewise and accept her application in that light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Our legal advice is that the divorce of a person domiciled outside the State is recognised by the Irish courts as dissolving the marriage here and the application was therefore refused on those grounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I must make it very clear that the law of the land has been pursued in this case and that the High <Col N="1760" /> Court, which is the highest court in this land, ruled that this person was the legal widow of the deceased.  I cannot accept that the law of the land has been followed in this instance.  Surely this person has been adjudged as the widow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal aspect of the matter has been looked into very seriously by us.

She appealed against the decision and arising from the appeal her pension was increased to £11.85 a week from the same date.  A pension order book at a revised rate of £12.65, which includes the general increase payable from 2 October 1981 was issued to the designated post office on 8 October 1981 for collection by her. A payable order in respect of the arrears due from 29 May 1981 has been sent direct to her.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the statement by the present Minister for Finance.  On 6 May 1981, on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, 1981, in column 2318 of the Official Report, Deputy Bruton said:</P>
      <P>As I have pointed out, people have to travel long distances to work owing to the historic nature of the settlement of Ireland with people spread out over very substantial areas.  In some of the poorest parts of Ireland, such as County Leitrim, the number of families with cars is proportionately larger than in many richer parts in town centres.</P>
      <P>For someone resident in the centre of New York, petrol is a luxury because he or she needs to use a car very infrequently.  I have heard of someone living in New York who takes his car out once a month even though he is very well off because he can do everything he wants on public transport.  That is not the case in Ireland.  For Irish people petrol is essential in many cases, both to get to work and to live a normal life. The increased taxation imposed on petrol is a very severe burden on very many people.</P>
      <P>What has changed the Minister's approach to the imposition of this taxation?  He has done a complete turnabout and has imposed a higher taxation than under the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1819" />
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton stated here on 6 May that this imposition was wrong and unacceptable.  Yet he is the very Minister who imposed taxation on petrol at the first opportunity.  I accuse the Minister of sheer hypocrisy.  He said one thing and did another.  There is no justification for that and the Minister might as well admit it.</P>
      <P>On 6 May 1981 the Tánaiste, then Deputy O'Leary, said in column 2317 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>However, the overall strategy of relying on increased indirect taxation has the unfortunate effect of increasing the consumer price index and therefore bringing greater pressure to bear, leading to increased demands and wage claims.</P>
      <P>That is what the Tánaiste said when he was explaining why workers could not accept a 6½ per cent or 7 per cent wage increase as recommended by the three wise men.  He explained their case very well.  Yet he, as Tánaiste, with the Minister for Finance, imposed extra taxation on petrol which has made it practically impossible for the ordinary working man to live.  His wage has been eroded by the imposition of duties on petrol and he finds it extremely difficult to get to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had given a 25 per cent increase to social welfare recipients then perhaps it might have been justified, but he did not do this.  The Minister gave very meagre increases in the budget.  Furthermore, the proposals which were contained in the Fine Gael manifesto stated they would introduce a fair system of car insurance.  I remember at the time they were telling young people that when Fine Gael were in government motor taxation would be provided and subsidised by the State.  Part of the extra taxation on petrol should go towards a subsidisation of car tax for young people who are now being asked to pay about £1,000 to insure their cars.  The Minister should subsidise insurance companies to allow them to give a preferential rate to young people who are burdened with massive charges for premiums to insure their cars.  Many cannot get insurance and are forced into a position which is totally illegal and in many <Col N="1820" /> cases lands them in court, which is most unfortunate and regrettable.</P>
    <P>This Government are establishing a commission to inquire into insurance, instead of grasping the nettle and allowing a subsidy of some sort for these young people who find it difficult &mdash; and in some cases impossible &mdash; to get car insurance from any of the major companies.  That is not meant as a criticism of these companies, who are working under very difficult circumstances.  Fine Gael Deputy Gay Mitchell is a good, strong spokesman for young people in this respect.  I wish he would be more vocal in this House on this issue, which might bring pressure to bear on the Minister to put part of the increase on petrol towards a subsidy for car insurance for young people.</P>

      <P>On this issue, the Minister said that the purchase of private motor vehicles reached a record level earlier this year.  Obviously, he saw that an increase in the price of petrol was a way of bringing in a lot of revenue to the State.  What the Minister forgot was that there are two sections in the community &mdash; the wealthy on whom an increase in the price of petrol has absolutely no effect and the other section of the community, the working people, some of whom have now to travel long distances to work.  This <Col N="1821" /> increase has had a great impact on the working people and has resulted in their living standards being reduced.  There is no doubt about that.  They are spelling out, every other day, how much it has affected them and this point must be made with the greatest emphasis possible.  As it is likely that this will be law, the Minister must bear in mind that an allowance must be granted to people against the cost of travelling to work. They must be given a reasonably good tax allowance to offset this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Chair, quite rightly, said that as I had contributed already he would call another speaker.  I was not trying to evade Deputy Callanan's question.  I never would, and never have tried to, denigrate Deputy Callanan's contributions in this House.  I recognise his objectivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Sherlock's point about the increase in the price of petrol effectively reducing the workers' living standards, particularly workers in rural Ireland, and referring back to the quotation by Deputy Leyden of my speech, I must admit quite clearly that it does. There is no avoiding that.  I also admit, with equal frankness, that this poses a bigger problem in rural areas than in <Col N="1822" /> urban ones.  Those points are correct.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Opposition have obviously no contribution to make to the debate, but have had to rely in almost all their contributions on what I said in response to their Finance Bill.  I am somewhat surprised to hear the Opposition referring to hypocrisy.  I would have thought that this word might have been capable of being applied to them but I will not apply it as there is no point in trading that type of epithet across the House.</P>
    <P>The position, of course, is that the total increase in petrol price in this budget is 13.4p, an increase of 4p in July 1981 and of 9.4p in September 1981, in situation of unprecedented economic seriousness, when the Government were forced to take quick action and could not turn to other means of taxation and, for reasons which I have explained, had to rely on indirect taxation.  That is, effectively, the only kind of tax which one can enforce in the middle of the year.  In contrast with that, the previous Government in the normal annual budget, in January 1981, when they had all the other choices of revenue raising possibilities available, not just indirect taxation, imposed an increase of 15p &mdash; significantly greater than our increase in July.  In the previous year, in February 1980, they imposed an increase of 20p, even greater still.  Their present concern seems to be, shall we say, less than a fair reflection on their record.  Furthermore, the best way of measuring the impact of Government action in regard to the price of petrol is to look at the proportion of the total price of the product that the Government is proposing to take in tax.</P>
    <P>The result of the budget of July 1981, after the full effect of all the increases taking effect in September 1981 when VAT had been increased, is to bring the total tax taken by the Government on a gallon of petrol to 49 per cent of the price, whereas the previous Government in February 1980 brought the tax taken to 50 per cent of the price and in January 1981 to 51.1 per cent of the price.  In proportionate terms to the price of petrol, the imposition in this budget &mdash; which I recognise as very difficult and <Col N="1823" /> imposing a real diminution in the living standards of many &mdash; is, in fact, considerably less in real terms than that of either of the last two budgets of the previous Government.  This needs to be put in context against the speeches which we are now hearing from the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>In both of the Opposition's previous budgets, in February 1980 and January 1981, they had other choices available to them.  They had the whole range of direct taxation from which to choose.  They chose those substantial increases in the price of petrol at that time.  Our July budget, on the other hand, gave us a much more limited range of choice because we were effectively confined to indirect taxation which very often has this redistributive effect which is detrimental for the reasons explained &mdash; mostly by quotation from my speeches by people on the other side.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock, Deputy Callanan and others may well make the point that surely it could not be right for a Government to introduce any taxation which has the effect of reducing people's real living standards.  I am afraid that the situation is such that we are faced with little option. We are running the largest balance of payments deficit in Europe.  What is a balance of payments deficit?  It is, in plain man's language, spending more money abroad than you are taking in or, in the language of a household, living beyond your means.  There is no way, if one is living beyond one's means, that one can start moving towards living within one's means without, somehow or other, reducing one's standard of living.  Anyone who tries to pretend that you can by some magic solution, or fooling around with the tax rate, or economic wizardry, get into a situation where, having been living well beyond your means &mdash; 15 per cent beyond it in our case, because that is our balance of payments deficit &mdash; you can get back into balance without hardship, without diminishing your standard of living, is trying to fool people.  I do not believe in fooling anybody, if I can avoid it.  That is the context in which the whole thing has to be seen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1824" /> The point will be made with some force by speakers in this discussion that in regard to this increase on petrol and in regard to other increases, because it is relying on indirect taxation and not direct taxation, it has a disproportionate effect on one section of the community rather than the other, because it is rightly argued that the poorer you are the more of your income you have to spend to live. People on the breadline spend 100 per cent of anything they get on purchases, most of which are taxed.  On the other hand, if you are well off you can afford to spend perhaps only 70 per cent of your income and not spend 30 per cent of it and that 30 per cent is not affected by any purchase tax.  That is why it is said that indirect taxes are regressive.</P>
    <P>Nobody can argue against that case. However, as I have demonstrated, because of the timing of the budget, because it had to be introduced in July, we could not, in view of the structure of the tax system, have recourse to anything but indirect taxes.  It will be our aim over the period of our tenure in office between now and the next general election in four years' time, to adopt a tax programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the January 1982 budget and in subsequent budgets we will, within the broader and greater freedom allowed to Governments when devising tax plans at the beginning of a <Col N="1825" /> year, spread the burden more equitably. We recognise that any step in the economic management of the country which involves putting our balance of payments right, stopping us living beyond our means, not simply because that is an ideology of monetarism or any of the other isms that are thrown around here in the discussion, makes sense.  People in households cannot live beyond their means indefinitely.  Likewise, no Government or no country can live beyond its means indefinitely.  In order that we will have the money in five, six or ten years' time to provide jobs for our young people we must husband our resources carefully now.  It is simply about looking to the future, only spending as much now as puts us in a position next year, the year after and in subsequent years to do what needs to be done now as well as what will need to be done then.</P>
      <P>Our economic policy is about that and is not, as Deputy Crowley referred to, monetarism.  It has nothing to do with monetarism.  Monetarism is a macro-economic theory which may have some relevance in a self-contained economy as large as the USA.  A monetarist theory is of no relevance to a small open economy like ours.  Living within one's means is of relevance to an economy like ours, and so is putting enough aside for the young people of the future the same as any family would do.  That is what the Government's economic policy is concerned with.  It is not monetarism, Keynesism, Thatcherism or any of the other isms which have been mentioned.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying that, if the oil companies put another pound on the gallon of petrol, that will give an excuse to the Government to put a proportionately higher tax on petrol?  If the price of petrol was much less, it would not be a great hardship on people if it was increased.  It is poor logic to give the excuse that the percentage of the rise was only 49 per cent and that before the petrol went up the percentage was 50 per cent. I am delighted to hear the Minister acknowledging that indirect taxation is harder on the poor.  This is contrary to what his party said during the election campaign.  They said they would go on to indirect taxation and away from direct taxation.  The Minister is now admitting that indirect taxation is harder.  I hope that when the January budget is introduced he will implement direct taxation and not the Fine Gael policy which is to get away from this.</P>

      <P>Deputy Callanan is right.  The Minister's argument was so weak that he was defending his position by referring to the change in the proportionate charge of tax on the gallon of petrol.  Deputy Callanan is also right when he says that the Minister said, obviously against his party's well publicised line, that he is not in favour of a change to indirect taxation.  I am sure many people in the Labour Party and some of those in the Minister's party, including Deputy Richie Ryan and possibly also the Deputy from Limerick, Deputy Kemmy, will be well pleased if after all, the £9.60 will not be found by indirect taxation, which imposes such hardship.  We have not heard anything <Col N="1827" /> yet about the advertisements that are to appear in the very near future about that £9.60.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> I do not wish to go back on the section because it has been well researched.  As the Minister is extracting considerable revenue from petrol, would he ask his colleague in the Department of the Environment to extract the lead content which is five times greater in this country than in any other country in the world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take that point on board and convey it to the Minister for the Environment.  Deputy Sherlock raised a point, which perhaps I should answer, in regard to the effect of this on the less well-off sections of the community.  I recognise that the less well-off sections of the community tend to rely on second hand or older cars.  If the budget contained an increase in the price of petrol only, and no increase in the purchase tax on new cars, it could be argued that we were so structuring the budget, given the constraints under which we are operating, as to be even more inequitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that we have tried to remove that by increasing the purchase tax substantially on cars.  The more expensive the car, the more the purchase tax is as a share of the total cost. That is a progressive approach to taxation and it is an important part of the budget. It is in the next section.  Any increase in the price of petrol must be seen against that background.  In increasing the purchase tax we are doing something which has not been done for some time.  It is valuable both for the revenue it yields <Col N="1829" /> and from the point of view that it redistributes the burden on motoring to avoid imposing an undue burden on people who have to travel to work.  The two sections must be seen together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy said was factual.  I accept that.  Farmers need larger horse powered cars if they have to tow trailers behind them.  I am not disputing that with the Deputy.  I have recognised from the outset that there are problems in the imposition of indirect taxation and, in particular, there are special <Col N="1830" /> problems in rural areas with the imposition of tax on petrol.</P>
      <P>I did not come in here to make disingenuous arguments about the balance of payments effects, and so on.  Of course a tax which reduces petrol consumption makes savings for us in the balance of payments.  I chose deliberately not to use those arguments because they tend to mask the reality.  We might as well face the reality.  We are living beyond our means and we will have to face some reduction in our living standards if we are to live within our means.  If I were to try to pretend to the Deputy that this budget could be introduced without imposing real and substantial reductions in people's financial position, I would be attempting to deceive the Deputy.  I do not think I should do that.  The House must face realities.  In this budget we are asking the House to face realities.  We must cut our cloth to suit our measure, which we have not being doing for years.</P>

      <P>The effect of this section is to increase the rate of excise duty on category A motor vehicles from 40 per cent to 50 per cent of the chargeable value with effect from 26 July 1981.  The excise duty in the list price of a motor car is now 24.5 per cent and the VAT content, at the 15 per cent rate in operation since 1 September, is 13.04 per cent.  The resulting increase in revenue, including VAT, will amount to £8.5 million in the current financial year or, in a full year, to £32.3 million.  As I indicated in the discussion on the last section, I regard this increase in the retail price as important from an equity point of view in regard to the general thrust of taxation on motoring.  It is of course regretable that taxation on motoring has to be imposed at all, but if it has to be done the burden should not all fall on petrol because very often this has a greater effect on less well off people who have to drive significant distances to work than it has on people who have a lot of money and buy a big car but does not use it that much.</P>
      <P>This tax on the purchase price of cars will affect new cars and will be more socially equitable.  This is a very desirable change in taxation.  It is worth noting that new motor cars are a significant deficit item on the balance of payments and it is important not to encourage excessive purchase of them because of the balance of payments effect that has.  As I have indicated during the debate, the fundamental reason for the budget and the approaches of the Government is the serious situation we face with the balance of payments.  This measure will directly assist that as well as raising significant revenue amounting to £33.3 million next year.</P>

      <P>Any argument put forward by the Minister has been extremely weak.  He says he is trying to share the burden by not putting more on petrol but by putting some on new cars. One would get the impression from the Minister that this only applies to big cars. Is the Minister aware that in our second <Col N="1834" /> city we have the Ford motor company which is one of the biggest employers.</P>

      <P>Their range of cars is not all confined to big cars.  The Fiesta is the smallest one.  In the case of that car several hundred pounds will be added to the purchase price because of the impositions in this section and the section dealing with VAT.</P>
      <P>This is a deflationary measure because it will affect the new car market.  I am aware that there is a limit on the time for this Bill and that there is a lot of it to go through yet.  Perhaps the Minister would tell me what the CPI impact is of this section?</P>

      <P>The overall effect of the July budget so far as this section is concerned and including the consequential VAT is 0.35 per cent.  It is worth mentioning in this regard the trend in private motor vehicle registrations.  In 1980 the number of new private cars registered was 90,939 compared with 62,603 in 1972. That was a significant increase in that period.  The figures for 1981 remain very buoyant even taking account of seasonal factors.</P>
      <P>Question put and declared carried.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section re-imposes road tax on cars not exceeding 16 hp and on motor cycles at the rates which applied up to 1 August 1977.  It provides also for an increase in the rate of road tax on cars exceeding 16 hp from £6 to £8 per hp and for the abolition of the annual registration charges of £20 and £5 respectively on cars not exceeding 16 hp and on motor cycles.  In addition, it provides for the reduction in the initial registration charges in respect of cars exceeding 16 hp and of motor cycles to £5 and £1 respectively.  The present rate of £20 stands to <Col N="1835" /> be payable in respect of first registrations of all other new vehicles.</P>
      <P>Basically this is the re-introduction of motor tax.  I do not know whether it is necessary to embark on a long dissertation as to why the Government decided to make this change.  Perhaps the best context to put the matter in would be by way of reference to a comment which was made quite legitimately by Deputy Fitzgerald earlier when he referred to the narrowness of the tax base.  He adverted to the fact that some of the excise duties are as high as they are because of other sources of revenue not being available. The Deputy went on to say that we run the risk of diminishing returns.  I do not dispute that in substance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that both Deputy Fitzgerald and myself had whiskey in mind in this context.  This over-reliance on some of the old reliables resulted from the fact that the previous Government had voluntarily deprived themselves of other sources of revenue for short-term political purposes.  It was for this reason that motor tax was abolished on foot of a promise made during the 1977 election campaign.  The measure adopted by this Government by way of the reintroduction of car tax is not designed to give us an advantage in any sense over the Opposition &mdash; that would not be a legitimate way to proceed &mdash; but in order to demonstrate, apart from the revenue that would be needed, that the situation has changed and that it is no longer possible because of our financial situation to make promises that have to be paid for by way of borrowing.  It was not our intention in any way to adopt the attitude of reversing anything done by our predecessors.  As I have indicated elsewhere in the debate, there are many initiatives such as the establishment of the Commission on Taxation which we are prepared to work with and get the best from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many ways the abolition of car tax, apart from its revenue losing capacity, <Col N="1836" /> symbolised the mentality that lay behind the public mood in the lead up to the 1977 election and almost up to the 1981 election, that was, an atmosphere of total unreality so far as our true financial situation was concerned and also our ability as a country to provide for our young people in the future.  This atmosphere of unreality had to be brought to an end and one way of doing this was to reintroduce car tax and to show that as a country we cannot afford to lose revenue in this way any more, that we must not throw away uselessly revenue sources that are there in order to spread the burden evenly but rather to endeavour to get the best we can for our country in terms of improved revenue so that the money will be available to provide jobs and education and a secure future for young people not only next month or next year but in five, ten and 15 years time.</P>

      <P>The longer I sit here and listen to the Minister the more convinced I become that he, a decent man who should know the situation, is beginning to believe what he is saying.  If I am right I fear for the young people he talks about.  One has witnessed his cold, firm hand in some of the decisions taken by the Government, decisions that are not of any help to our young people.  But who is the Minister fooling when he talks about the youth of ten or 15 years from now?  We are faced with the problems now.  We have had the problem of a population explosion which was not provided for because of a decision taken by the Coalition in the mid-seventies not to go ahead with a census.  That has contributed to one of the major problems facing us now.  Is the Minister saying that all the decisions being taken now are in the interest of young people away into the future?  Does he realise that 130,000 of our people are unemployed?  When both he and the Tánaiste were on these benches they had a lot to say about an unemployment figure of 120,000 but because of the increases in cost between July and October there are now 130,000 <Col N="1837" /> people out of work.  I suggest that there are more important aspects facing us than the problems of the far-off future.  If these problems are not tackled now the repercussions will be very serious especially in regard to young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the budget can be said to have singled out one group of people that the Government were determined to penalise, that group were the motorists.  Be it the farmer in Meath or the worker in Limerick or Cork, whoever it may be, for some reason the motorist has been regarded as a target whom this Government could afford to attack without losing any support.  It started with a huge increase in the price of petrol.  Already since the change of Government we have heard the Minister talking about more than 20p in all the increases.  We have the increase in excise duty in the section to this Bill we have just seen go through the House.  We have the increase in VAT and its huge impact on the cost of the car, petrol, spare parts and repairs.  But the Government still were not satisfied that the motorist should get away with something which the previous Government gave him.  Their attitude is that the people of the country got away with two things from the previous Government: road tax and rates were removed.  Some members of this Coalition Government are still hinting that rates in some shape or form will have to be imposed again, but they are just too timid to take that final step. Instead, they decided to tackle the motorist and say to him that he had already received concessions from a previous Government in regard to tax on cars up to 16 h.p. but that they would take it back because it was something the motorist had got from a former regime and that this regime would hit him hard. I believe that is why road tax was reimposed.  I will not bore the House with quotations on the approach of the present Minister when the registration fee was increased in the Finance Act last spring. I could talk about the sympathy the present Minister appeared to be showing from these benches because there had been an increase in the registration fee. Now the car tax has been reintroduced <Col N="1838" /> and every Deputy who walks through those lobbies on this section too, be he from Limerick or anywhere else, is helping this Minister for Finance to say to the motorists &ldquo;You are entitled to be hit again because a previous administration granted you a concession by taking away the road tax; therefore we will restore it&rdquo;.  They will restore it because of the support they will get in the lobbies here in this House, but the motorist will remember that they have hit the petrol, the excise duty and VAT, thus increasing the cost of maintenance, spare parts and new car purchases.</P>
    <P>We oppose this measure.  We are entitled to oppose it.  It is not merited; it is not justified.  In the Minister's own party very many people would like the opportunity of voting in this House against this measure, which is completely unnecessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flor Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House too long, but surely the Minister realises that by this taxation he will further affect unemployment in the car industry.  As Deputy Fitzgerald said earlier, in Cork especially there will be considerable disquiet about the imposition of this tax.  Of course, the attitude of the Cabinet and the Government will be to continue to disclaim all responsibility for what is happening and again to blame Fianna Fáil for it.  We intend to highlight as much as possible the utter cynicism with which this Government have used the ordinary working man of the country. The cost to the State must be at least £4,000 between benefits and loss of revenue for each person who is unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>

The car industry in this country will suffer considerably as a result of the Minister's decision on this, while he and his colleagues will continue to disclaim all responsibility for it. I wonder what the hidden unemployment position is here.  How many youngsters coming out of school who would normally be available for jobs have decided to go back and do another year in school because no employment is available for them?  I venture to suggest that 130,000 is an under-estimation of the number of people officially unemployed.  There must be many more thousands of people in the category I have described as hidden unemployment.  This action by the Minister and the Government was an act of political revenge.  There were a lot of sour grapes after the 1977 election.</P>

      <P>It was a decision of political revenge in the strongest and most vicious possible sense.  They broke all precedent by going completely back on an undertaking given by a previous Government based on an attitude that we could afford to do it.  I am surprised to hear the Minister saying that everybody else in Ireland was under the wrong impression about where this country was going and reminding me that they were <Col N="1840" /> all out of step except our John.  I assure the Minister that the people are well aware of what is happening and that the <i>sine qua non</i> of a Coalition Government is to create unemployment, to affect industry and to hit at the smallest man, the man who needs a motor car to get to work, to carry out his job and to have a small bit of pleasure and luxury at the weekend.  This was a very bad decision by the Government, viciously and vindictively taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept the suggestion made by Deputy Crowley that this decision was vindictive; it was nothing of the sort.  It was what we considered to be a responsible decision in the light of a very difficult financial situation.  Deputy Crowley spoke of resisting temptation to introduce new measures of taxation like this as if the Government were looking for such opportunities.  This is nonsence. I do not wish to be offensive to the Deputy but his suggestion that the Government want to introduce taxation and have to be held back from doing so is diametrically opposed to the truth.  A measure like this is something no Government want to introduce but we were reluctantly convinced that it was absolutely essential.  That is the truth of the matter.</P>
      <P>This debate is not suitable for a discussion on the general question of employment.  The key element in protecting employment is competitiveness and it is extremely important to get our balance of payments right and to get moderate increases in incomes for all members of the community in order to increase our competitiveness.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will probably be aware, the tax on tobacco, unlike other taxes, is a combination of an <i>ad valorem</i> tax which varies with the price of the commodity.  It goes up as the price goes up, for whatever reason.  Another specific element is that it is a tax levied at a particular sum for a particular quantity and it remains at that sum until it is changed, regardless of what happens to the price of cigarettes in the meantime.</P>
      <P>The section obviously is designed to avoid an element of double taxation.  Cigarettes have been increased in price under the excise duty code by a change made in the budget in July.  They also fell to be increased in price again as a result of the increase in value-added tax from 1 September but because of the way in which the excise duty is structured, partially as a specific tax and partially as an <i>ad valorem</i> tax &mdash; a tax on the value &mdash; there was the danger that the excise duty would again be increased from 1 September because the increase in VAT from that date increased the value of the product sold, and because part of the excise duty is <i>ad valorem</i> there would have been a further excise duty increase on top of the value-added tax increase.  Clearly, that is not the intention of the Government and in order to ensure that further unintended increases do not occur this section is being introduced.  Hence, it is a relieving section and I trust it will have the support of all sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section raises the turnover limits above which traders are obliged to be registered for value-added tax.  It is also a relieving section and I trust it will have support.  It introduces two new limits of £30,000 and £15,000 annual taxable turnover to replace the present three limits which, expressed in annual terms, amount to £18,000, £9,000 and £3,000.  There is a slight difference here that might make the drafting somewhat <Col N="1845" /> obscure.  In the past the registration limits have been expressed in terms of turnover for the accounting period which is two months whereas under the new dispensation they are being expressed in terms of annual turnover.  The effect of this is to raise the limits to £30,000 and £15,000 instead of £18,000, £9,000 and £3,000.  The new registration limit of £3,000 will apply to a trader whose turnover consists of 90 per cent or more of the sale of taxable goods.  The £15,000 limit will apply to all other categories of trading.</P>
      <P>The Government recognise, as was stated in their programme, that there is a heavy burden of paper work imposed by our tax system on small traders.  We realise that small traders have enough problems competing with the large multiple stores and other new developments in the retail sector without imposing on them massive burdens of paper work which are unrelated to the amount of revenue to which they are liable.  For small traders we are adjusting these limits to relieve a significant number of them of the responsibility of keeping the books in question.  The cost to the Exchequer of this relief, because tax will obviously be foregone as a result, will be £750,000 in a full year.  It is expected that between 400 and 500 traders who are now registered will be enabled to have their registrations cancelled.  There are a number of traders, probably an even greater number, who are unregistered although they should be registered, or about to be registered under the old regime, but they will not now have to be registered. Applications for cancellation of registration will be allowed by the Revenue Commissioners on the basis of direct application by the taxpayer concerned and will be submitted for examination in the normal way.  This section is a welcome one and it will go some distance to helping small traders with the many difficulties they have in the competitive field.  The Government recognise that they face those difficulties and hope that this matter will have universal support in the House.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-Central</i>): With the rate of inflation and the increase in prices this concession will be short-lived.  Like the income tax brackets it will not be long before many of those traders are inside the group again.  The important fact is&mdash;I have mentioned this to successive Governments&mdash;that this one section of the community is involved in doing unpaid work for the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not know any other section of the community that would sit up late every night making up turnover tax returns.  Very few realise the amount of complicated work involved in this.  A trader would not need to be a substantial business man to take in £15,000 per year. With prices going up 25 per cent and 30 per cent it is obvious that the Minister had to make this move.  There are enormous complications for small traders since this burden was put on them.  When turnover tax applied some years ago a concession was given to traders to compensate them in a small way for the amount of work they had to carry out in preparing returns.  If the Minister was considering some form of generosity towards small traders he should concede something to compensate them for this work which is causing them a lot of <Col N="1847" /> harassment.</P>
      <P>We are all aware how difficult it is to get an exact balance into such returns and traders are asked to explain the least little irregularity.  Invoices can get lost and it is almost impossible for such traders with a small staff to explain that to the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not believe the exemption the Minister mentioned will apply to a sufficient number. I do not have any sympathy with the larger combines who can employ a secretary to do this work but the small traders cannot do that.  They cannot afford the personnel to allocate to this work during a working day when such work should be done.  Instead, the unfortunate trader has to do this work after trading hours, after he has closed his doors at 6 o'clock.  The trader must work until midnight making up these books and he should be given compensation for the valuable service he renders to the Minister for Finance.  It is much more complicated to make up than was the turnover tax which is quite simple.  Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned the question of taking the full 12 months into consideration instead of the two-month period.  As far as I can see if that is to be the case, in the event of a trader expanding his business in the last two or three months of the period, he can be caught for the whole previous ten months.  As far as I can see, it cannot mean anything else.  We welcome the increase in the exemptions but they are not enough because of the way prices have gone over the past 12 months, with inflation running at 20 to 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>First I would like to welcome the increase in the exemption limits.  They were introduced in 1972 and were increased on a couple of occasions since but they are still far too low.  The people who supply small shopkeepers and the grocery trade have most of their goods at 0 per cent and only a certain percentage of their goods at 15 per cent to 25 per cent.  There are various formulas agreed by the Revenue Commissioners to work out the VAT return at the end of the two-month period.  A shop with a <Col N="1848" /> turnover of £2,000 per week would be very small and the VAT collected in a two-monthly period, after a long process of keeping books and records and thousands of invoices, would be very small.  I would ask the Minister to consider, in the next Finance Bill, raising the exemption limit to £100,000 for people whose turnover consists largely of items sold at 0 per cent because the amount of money collected from such people is very small in comparison with the amount of bookkeeping needed.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick on the amount of time that an ordinary shopkeeper or any small businessman has to put into keeping books.  Because of the paperwork involved many small shopkeepers or businessmen prefer to get out of the business altogether and get into something else such as running a small farm.  We have reached the point where a person going into business would want to have his head examined because there is no incentive; he has to bear all the headaches and nobody cares a tuppenny damn about him.  If he goes bang there is nobody to pay him social welfare; he does not have security of employment.  Yet, in addition to all the normal headaches of going into business he is faced with ever-increasing amounts of paperwork &mdash; VAT returns, PAYE returns and so on.  Even the smallest businessman would need to employ someone on a full-time basis to look after it.  Officials and civil servants and officers of the Revenue Commissioners do not appreciate the amount of work involved.  I imagine that Deputy Bruton appreciates the amount of work involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that if the Minister were to raise the exemption limit to £100,000 for people whose turnover is mixed he would not lose any money and he would save these people all this paperwork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the question of changing the wording from &ldquo;the turnover exceeds in a two-monthly <Col N="1849" /> period&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall not exceed in any continuous period of 12 months&rdquo;.  I would like the Minister to explain how this is going to work.  Up to now with the limit at about £18,000, if the turnover exceeded £2,500 in a two-monthly period a businessman would automatically have to register for VAT.  The idea behind the new suggestion is good because it has happened that a person has gone over the limit for two months and then back to the lower income and there was chaos and nobody knew what to do; he should have registered and stayed registered.  It is a good idea to introduce the continuous period of 12 months.  But how is this period going to be determined?  Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested that it would be based on a person's accounts period of 12 months.  But I understand from reading the section that that is not what is meant. It refers to any continuous 12-months period.  They are two entirely different things.  A person's accounting year could end on 31 December and his turnover for that period could be below the threshold. But if the continuous period of 12 months were counted from June last year to June next year the figure might be greater than £30,000.  That person would then be registered for VAT because the turnover would be greater than the threshold.  If it is not made clear how this section is going to operate there will be difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy has partly done my job of answering the question raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick in explaining the reason for going over to the annual basis of assessment rather than the two-month one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To answer the question he himself raised, as I understand it&mdash;and if there is anything inaccurate in what I am saying I can come back and clarify it on Report Stage&mdash;the way it would work is that at any given time during the year, if it looks as if on the basis of the two-monthly period a person's annual outturn will be in excess of the limit, then the situation would fall to be examined as to whether he would be obliged to register.  But in assessing this, account will be taken not just of those two months but now, as a result of this, of his overall pattern over <Col N="1850" /> the entire year.  So in the case of somebody who is a seasonal trader and whose turnover goes up very rapidly in two months during the summer when perhaps he does most of his business, it will not trigger an examination because his pattern over the year will reveal immediately that it is only a seasonal phenomenon. But in the case of somebody who is not a seasonal trader, his reaching the same level of turnover in a given two-monthly period would trigger a different response because it would be obvious from his previous record what his pattern was.</P>
    <P>I would like to reply to a point made by Deputy McCreevy and Deputy Fitzpatrick about paperwork.  This is, by far, the biggest increase in the threshold in recent times.  There was one other increase in 1979, but on increase from 1972 up to 1979.  The threshold which is now £30,000 was increased to a range of £9,000 to £18,000 in 1979 from a previous rate of £6,000 to £12,000 &mdash; in other words, it was increased by 50 per cent in 1979.  The present increase is more in the nature of £12,000 to £30,000, an increase of more than 100 per cent &mdash; about 150 per cent.  That was a deliberate choice.  I decided during the three weeks in which work was done preparing the budget that, regardless of the situation, I would give thought to the serious inequity in the first budget, which I have now done.  Naturally enough, I am happy to look for suggestions for further relief in this respect as mentioned by Deputies Fitzpatrick, McCreevy and others.</P>
    <P>The only problem here is that people may not be all that keen to take this up. Most of a butcher's sales, for example, are of zero rated commodities, in fact all his sales are.  Of course, if he is not registered, his inputs of light and equipment used in his business are not capable of being claimed back.  If he is registered, he can.  Removing the requirement to register is not always the whole story, as far as the decision of the traders is concerned.  In many cases, those who are trading in zero rated commodities will see it as being in their interests to register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The person who will benefit from this, of course, is one whose <Col N="1851" /> sales are all at nought percentage.  It is in his interests to register.  All his inputs will be recoverable in the two monthly period.  The grocer, for example, has a mixed sale.  The Minister might check on the amount of revenue from people who have turnovers of up to £200,000 of mixed sales &mdash; so many at nought per cent, so many at 25 per cent and 50 per cent.  The amount that will be collected there will be quite small.</P>
      <P>Regarding the 12 month period, subsection (4) is one of the key interpretation sections.  That, from my reading of it, will be the subsection used to interpret when a taxable person commences to be taxable, having gone over the threshold.  It will be like the old system again of going back and finding when he crossed the two monthly equivalent of the annual period.</P>
      <P>I welcome the change from the 12 monthly period but it may be two years before an inspector comes to check a person's turnover and if a person registers himself how will he know that his actual turnover will be over £30,000? When an inspector calls he usually has to go back a long time in the records.  It could be the old system, doctored up in a new way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was thinking of another section.  In confirmation of the financial resolution passed in Dáil Éireann on 21 July last, this section confirms the increase in the former 10 per cent VAT rate to 15 per cent with respect from 1 September 1981.  At the same time, it provides that, despite the increase in the tax rate in question, there will be no increase in the effective charge of 3 per cent on buildings and building work.  It also extends the list of specified agricultural services to the 3 per cent charge which applies to buildings and building work, in lieu of the 15 per cent which would otherwise have applied.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the increase in value-added tax from 10 to 15 per cent is one of the major revenue generating parts of the July budget.  The additional yield is estimated to be £28.2 million in 1981 and £188.5 million for the full year of 1982.  The estimated total 1981 yield from VAT will be £594 million.  This is a major increase in revenue, which will make a big contribution towards helping to reduce the current deficit and put the Government and the state in a more solvent position.  It is a very big revenue earner, and very important for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to advert to one of the sections here, which is a relieving part of the general section, namely the reduction <Col N="1853" /> in value-added tax on agricultural contracting.  The Government recognise that there is a big problem in the country at large at the moment because of farmers now not being able to get contractors to do work for them.  This is partly due to the problems with which agriculture is beset, but also to the fact that the professional contractor was at a disadvantage so far as tax was concerned.  He was competing with the farmer, who might do some work with his own machinery for three or four neighbours and who did not have to register for VAT.  The fact that the contractor was paying 10 per cent VAT put him at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's wish, in the interests of employment, to encourage the development of agricultural contracting services on a professional basis in rural Ireland.  This will enable agriculture to operate on a much more flexible basis. It is not practicable for farmers to have all their own machinery and to provide for all their own needs.  If they attempt to do that, it will drive them into even greater credit difficulties than many face at the moment.  The aim must be for the best use of machinery and of capital and to minimise the requirements of farmers to borrow money to buy their own machinery &mdash; to encourage them, as far as possible, to use contractors.  There is great scope for an increase in contracting services in rural Ireland, in response to the present economic problems facing them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Flor Crowley Mr. Flor Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flor Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a lot of out-of-work contractors who would not agree with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to help in that direction, we are reducing the value-added tax rate to 3 per cent on a list of important agricultural services provided by contractors.  This is a major measure to help agriculture at a time when such a measure is needed.  When farmers come to study the provisions of the budget in more detail I believe this particular measure will be seen by them as an important one to assist a major industry.  It goes directly to where help is needed, towards providing better services and lower costs <Col N="1854" /> for farmers.  We all know that farmers are facing increased prices for their products and that their incomes are considerably less than those of other people.  This is beyond our control to a great extent because those prices are determined outside the country by agreement with EEC levels.  One way we can help in the income squeeze which results from this is by reducing the price of inputs which have to be bought by farmers.  One of the biggest inputs is the contracting of machinery services.  This measure, which reduces the rate from 10 per cent to 3 per cent or from what would have been 15 per cent if this had not been done, is a great assistance to an industry which we all know is in need of assistance at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a reflection on the Minister because I understand there is a deadline.  We have to be very careful in all of these issues, particularly in relation to Financial Resolutions and Finance Bills, that adequate time is given to the Opposition to tease out the details of the amendments.  That is obviously denied to us today through an agreement we have entered into and about which I cannot complain.  It is worth making the point because it can always be of some benefit afterwards to prevent this happening again or to find some loophole out of it.</P>
      <P>I will have to be very brief on this.  I am not clear how we will finish this Bill because obviously there will be some sections we will not get to.  This section is repugnant to this side of the House.  The increase in VAT from 10 per cent to 15 per cent means a 50 per cent increase and is the gravest penal imposition of the budget.  I believe it is the greatest contributor to the fact that this year we have not a real basis for a national wage agreement.  Surely all this budget did was contribute to increasing the CPI figure by about 5 per cent and reducing the magically achieved norm&mdash;I do not know how it was achieved &mdash; from 9.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now discussing the VAT increase.  I said on the Second Stage of this Bill and also during the budget debate that nobody could say that almost every item covered by the 10 per cent VAT rating was not an essential in the home.  All those items are important factors in the home, the office, industry, the farm or anywhere else.  A brief definition of the category of items in that grouping is all things, excluding luxury items and essential clothing and foodstuffs which are zero-rated.  That is the short formula of what is in it.  Forget about the luxuries and about the few items which are zero-rated <Col N="1856" /> and we find that everything else is included in the 10 per cent rating.  The Minister, therefore, attacked all those items and increased the rating by 50 per cent.  School books, newspapers, periodicals and every service is affected. There are so many things here that I could not hope to go into them this evening.  We are opposed to this section.  We do not agree with a 50 per cent increase in the VAT rating nor do we believe it is merited.</P>
    <P>We have not time to tease out all the points we would like to, but there are a few things we can mention.  Where are the real cuts the Minister spoke about in the budget?  Can we have them itemised on Report Stage when we can go into the matter in more detail?  We are opposing this.  My colleagues will have something to say.  I am at a loss to know how we can tidy up other sections which are of some interest.  There is stamp duty, which is very important.  We are not opposing the principle of the idea.  It is possibly a good idea, but we are very interested in the detail of the proposal.  I cannot see us this evening being able to go into the detail of how these new bank charges will be imposed.  It means we will have to give longer time to Report Stage, although I appreciate that it is a less satisfactory way of handling important matters like that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few comments on the section.  We can divide this section into two distinct categories.  One of the categories, as Deputy Fitzgerald has outlined, is the increase in the VAT rate from 10 per cent to 15 per cent.  The second division is the relief to agricultural contractors.  In one section we have a penalty imposed and a relief given.  It is an unusual section.  If the Minister for Finance can do this in all future Finance Bills it will make it quite difficult to vote against such Bills if he is able to combine in one section a major penalty clause and also some relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald spoke about the increase in the VAT rate from 10 per cent to 15 per cent.  I should like to mention a few other aspects of the section.  I would welcome a uniform rate of 10 per cent or 15 per cent, or what ever the case may be. <Col N="1857" /> When VAT was first introduced the rate which would now be equivalent to 15 per cent was 5.26 per cent, and the higher rate was 16.37 per cent.  Today people may wonder how those figures were arrived at.  There were good reasons at the time.  The 5.26 per cent rate was equivalent to the 5 per cent gross turnover tax on an inclusive exclusive basis. The 16.37 per cent was equivalent to the 10 per cent wholesale tax rate.</P>
    <P>I maintained at the time that it was absolutely ridiculous to impose such percentages on the tax paying public.  People had to have schedules, tables, reducing amounts, tax exclusives and tax inclusives.  Huge permutations had to be worked out every month.  It was beyond me why they could not have decided on 6 per cent and 10 per cent at the time. We should stand back from the system every so often and ask do we have to continue with it.  At the time it was said we had to have the equivalent of the turnover and wholesale tax rates.  It would have been better to have had a simpler system.</P>
    <P>The problem was confounded when the Coalition Government increased the VAT rate by 5 per cent and pushed the 5.26 per cent rate up to 6.75 per cent, and the 16.37 per cent rate up to 19.5 per cent.  Those may not be the exact figures. This shows the type of straightjacket we can get into.  The bookeeping involved was astronomical.</P>
    <P>I do not welcome VAT increases or any tax increases but, from an administrative point of view, I would welcome a simple rate of 10 per cent or 20 per cent, or some percentage like that.  When VAT was introduced in 1972 I was not a Member of this House but I asked why did we have to have different rates.  Instead of having a 10 per cent and 25 per cent rate, why not have a 20 per cent rate or a 16 per cent rate and include certain items in the 16 per cent rate and take other items out of the 25 per cent rate?  This would produce the same revenue.  We should have a cost benefit analysis.  If we wanted to take in so much money based on statistics of consumption, and so on, we could have one rate of VAT with everything <Col N="1858" /> else zero-rated.  With two rates only of 15 per cent and 25 per cent the bands are very close.</P>
    <P>In 1972 certain items were put in the high tax rate because they were regarded as luxuries.  Other items were put in the 5 per cent rate because they were not regarded as luxuries.  It was an arbitrary decision by the Government of the day. Since then there have been changes in what are considered to be luxuries and what are considered not to be luxuries and the rates are different.  Now that the tax bands are so close together is there any reason to have certain items rated at 25 per cent?  Why not have just one VAT rate?  This might put up the price of certain items.  Rates are not increased for the good of the taxpayer.  VAT is the easiest way of collecting money for the Exchequer.  It brings money in fast.  The Minister knows exactly what he will get.</P>
    <P>I may have strayed a little from the section.  When the Minister is introducing his next budget perhaps he would have a look at the whole area of what is in the different bands and adopt my idea.  My view is that we should have just one VAT rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy McGreevy's view as a general principle. I would have to consider carefully whether it would be practicable to adopt it.  If we were to have one rate, it would be somewhere in the region of 17 per cent.  Obviously it would save a considerable amount of administrative cost in that traders would not have to make calculations.  If the item were in the VAT rate it would be at a particular rate set at the time.  I do not accept &mdash; and this is bandied about in the debate &mdash; that goods in the 25 per cent rate are luxuries.  Most of them are not luxuries.  There is the ridiculous situation that if you buy clothes they are zero-rated but if you buy a zip to keep your clothes up, it is designated as a luxury and you pay 25 per cent.</P>

      <P>That is absurd.  Furniture is considered to be a luxury and is rated <Col N="1859" /> at 25 per cent.  It is not a luxury.  You have to have furniture.  There is not much of an ethical basis for the distinction which exists.  The issue raised by Deputy McCreevy is a big one.  I am giving my personal view at the moment, and I will look into it in detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flor Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>A big play was made about the problem the small trader has in filling in forms and trying to meet his commitments when the VAT man calls around.  Many family-run businesses whose turnovers are well in excess of the figures mentioned in the budget by the Minister are still family-run businesses and are put to the pin of their collars to try to keep their operations going.  They become involved in returning these figures to the VAT man.  This is causing them a great deal of concern.  Many of them are going out of business because of the worry, the stresses and pressures on them in trying to keep those books. Would the Minister consider giving positive incentives to those firms by way of subsidising their staffs?  I am not just talking about AnCO but I am talking of giving something far more substantial, say, £60 or £70 per week subsidy to every extra person employed in those businesses above a base level.  I do not want the Minister to give money to an inefficient firm for a few months.  I am talking of backing the winners, of backing the people who have a commitment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flor Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>That scheme is very good in its own way and I have no objection to it.  I am talking of a scheme allied to that scheme and the people I have in mind are experts in their field.  If the Minister would adopt this course many people could be taken from the register of unemployed and from the emigrant ships and given employment at home.  I do not know what other solutions there are to all the paperwork that is involved in making out VAT returns.</P>
      <P>The Minister made great play of the exemptions in relation to agriculture.  I know the farming organisations are not crying very loudly about this because probably they do not wish to be too hard on their former employee.  However, we will cry out about it.  If there is any one action, apart from the bank interest rates, that has worsened the lot of the farmers it is the VAT increase.  It has compounded their problems and they have confidence to continue with their operations.  Rather than making the few exemptions he has made in his budget, the Minister should consider carefully the matter of a further subsidy for farmers. As I pointed out before, the farmer is the barometer of the economy.  I would like to have developed that point but as we are under pressure of time I will give way to another speaker.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to section 12, will the Minister give the House an indication of the expected total VAT to be collected in 1982?  Further, will the Minister state what amount will be collected in 1981 as a result of increasing the rate?  However, I am more interested in the Department's estimate of what will be collected in 1982.  With regard to relief given to agricultural contractors, I welcome the decrease in the rate for farming from 10 per cent to 3 per cent which is the equivalent of what building contractors have had for a number of years. Presumably the intention is to give farmers some relief.  Because of the Act of 1978 agricultural services came within the ambit of VAT legislation.  Prior to that agricultural contractors were not obliged to register for VAT and they did not have to charge VAT on their contract work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason the then Government charged VAT was as a result of an EEC directive which compelled us to bring the supply of agricultural services within the VAT framework.  Agricultural contractors will now only be allowed to charge VAT at 3 per cent.  This should give some relief to farmers.  Since they were brought into the VAT net there has been a <Col N="1863" /> decrease in the numbers of contractors. Prior to 1978 any small farmer with a combine or whatever would help his neighbours and do part-time agricultural contract work.  Under the Finance Acts if a person is deemed to be carrying on a trade as a farmer he would have to produce books and accounts irrespective of his land valuation.  As a result many people stopped doing agricultural contract work.  The effect has been that there are now only specialised contract workers.  The fear of VAT and tax legislation has forced a number of small farmers out of this work.</P>
    <P>The cost of agricultural services is rising, and this is one of the reasons.  There is no competition.  Small farmers are afraid to do this work any more unless they are guaranteed that they will be paid in cash and the person for whom they do the work will not claim it against income tax.  Reducing VAT on the supply of agricultural services to 3 per cent offers some relief.  There are problems in agriculture at present.  We see the farmer demonstrations and hear advice given to them by organisations.  I welcome any concessions that could be given.  There is a serious problem in agriculture and nothing will be gained by farm organisations acting in an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion.  This section gives relief to farmers and I welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy asked a question which is rather difficult to answer.  He asked the likely yield from VAT next year.  I do not have the officially calculated figure available at present, but I can give a rough calculation. On the basis that the total yield for this year is £594 million, of that £28 million is as a result of increases in the budget; and, if one takes that away and adds on what we anticipate will be the full effect of the budget, £188 million, that gives something in the region of £654 million.  If one includes a value increase in sales of 15 per cent next year, one can add 15 per cent to that and one will get a rough amateur calculation as to the likely total revenue from VAT.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin South-Central</i>):  There is nothing as disruptive to business as introducing two taxes in one year.  This is probably the first time we had to encounter this kind of difficulty. In the July budget the Minister introduced various indirect taxes which had an inflationary impact.  There is no question but that VAT had the most inflationary impact of all.  It is very difficult to define what the impact will be on the cost of living.  One can be precise about the effects of direct taxation but there is no economist who can predict what the impact of VAT will be on the cost of living.  There are too many fluctuations. No-one knows what prices will increase by because it is just not possible to be precise to the exact penny.  That is a fact of business life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question about the hardship this will cause to the weaker sections of the community, large families and old age pensioners, who can ill afford to carry the increases at present.  I condemn this, as Deputy Fitzgerald did, because it will <Col N="1865" /> have a big impact on the cost of living index.  As regards VAT, retailers are responsible for all sales as and from 1 September.  What is the position regarding wholesalers who send out invoices after 1 September but whose goods were delivered during August?  What rate of VAT will they be subject to?  Will they be subject to the 10 per cent at which the goods were ordered or will they send out invoices with the new rate?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>Last night I was referring to the new ministry that the Taoiseach has set up, the ministry of poverty, and I was saying that it was the right thing to do, that this ministry under the present Government and the economic policies they are pursuing will be very necessary. The economic policies of this Government will cause untold hardship to the vast majority of the population of this country, not least the widows, the unemployed and the people referred to as the middle income group, who will certainly be a lot worse off than they have been. Consider a young married couple trying to buy their own home.  They have taken out a mortgage of £20,000.  We all know that you cannot buy a house for less than <Col N="1870" /> £22,000, £23,000 or £24,000 at the moment.  These people now will be saddled with an increase in their mortgage repayments of between £40 and £50 per month.  Can you image what is going to happen to the money that was promised during the election campaign to the stay-at-home wife, the £9.60?  It is the husband's money.  I have no objection whatsoever to women at home getting an allowance, but what about the woman who gets this money eventually and then finds that the mortgage repayment has increased by £40 per month?  What will happen in that household?  I am sure the husband is not going to hand out an extra £40 or £50 per month.  Therefore, if the wife wants to keep a roof over her head, in the majority of cases she will have to give back that £40 per month.  I would not mind this £9.60 if it were of any advantage, but the problem is that it will cost probably more than £9.60 to implement the scheme.  What will happen? Without benefit of extra cash coming in, that household will have to pay in some way either in taxes or indirect taxation the cost of implementing the scheme. This absolutely crazy.  We all know that the people working in the tax offices have refused to implement this scheme unless they get extra staff and more offices.  On the one hand the Government have put an embargo on recruitment to the civil service and on the other hand they propose to introduce a scheme which will require a massive increase in the number of civil servants.  People on very low incomes such as widows and social welfare recipients will not benefit at all but will contribute in some way to the cost of this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many women voted for the Government parties because they thought they would receive a certain amount of cash to help them in running their homes or to use as pocket money.  This will not happen and I hope these women realise that.  This Government have a terrible cheek to offer such small amounts of money to social welfare beneficiaries to offset the inflation they will impose on us.  A widow will get an extra 35p for a child and a person in receipt of an invalidity pension will get 20p for a child.  This <Col N="1871" /> amount would not even buy a stamp, which now costs 22p.  Some people are getting an extra 15p.  It is horrific to think of the hardship which will be caused by the economic policies of the Government.  I do not know how people will cope following the budget early next year when we expect that the rate of inflation will increase by another 8 per cent.  It will cost £500 million to implement the income tax package with which almost everyone disagrees and about which the Government have been warned.  Still they persist in going ahead with this plan and we will all have to pay for it, probably through indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>Because negotiations on a new national wage agreement have broken down, I am wondering what will happen in the coming year.  Who can blame people for seeking an increase of 20 per cent when inflation has risen by almost 13 per cent as a result of the Government's policies?  How many strikes will occur? What will happen to the wives and children of men who may be on strike for two or three months?  How will they manage if there is no strike pay and they are receiving some kind of social assistance amounting, perhaps to £45 per week for a husband, wife and two children?</P>
    <P>I am basically concerned about the poorer sections such as old age pensioners, widows, deserted wives and single people.  In our last budget at the beginning of this year there was an increase of 25 per cent in social welfare payments and I spoke to many old age pensioners shortly before the general election and asked how they were faring.  I asked whether they had sufficient and if they found that the increase was helping them. and the response was very favourable. They assured me that they were being reasonably well looked after.  These people who have given such service to the country should get as much as possible.  They had sufficient then but due to the policies of this Government they are now experiencing very lean times.  It is horrific that some of them were offered an increase of 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>This is the year of the disabled and a supplementary allowance paid to a blind <Col N="1872" /> person in receipt of a pension will now be increased by 5p for a dependent child. What is the point of giving people 5p?  It will probably cost more than 5p to print the bit of paper to inform them of the increase.</P>
    <P>The Government have increased indirect taxation to a level previously unknown and this hits every person in the community.  The people who can afford it have no problem but it hits hardest those on very low incomes, the widows, the disabled and those on unemployment assistance.  The Government must take another look at what they are doing. People depend on the Government in power to look after their interests and I am beginning to think that this Government have no social conscience whatever. They obviously do not care about the lower-paid workers and social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>It has come to my attention that certain health boards have decided, in view of cutbacks, not to allow people to obtain spectacles on their medical cards.  This would badly affect the elderly who need spectacles for reading during their recreation.  Perhaps the Minister when replying would indicate whether it is true that some health boards are cutting back on this service.  That would be the last straw.</P>
    <P>The economic policies of the Government are causing more and more unemployment.  More and more factories are being closed down.  When you have a high rate of inflation and of direct taxation industry is automatically hit.  What will happen?  A situation will develop in which more and more people will be on the dole queues, and that in turn will mean we will have to raise more money by more taxes.  The Government will be setting a spiral which will bring us down and down.  The situation will get gravely worse in the coming months unless the Government do something drastic.  We have a growing young population, a 40 per cent increase in those under 25 years of age.  What will they do with factories closing and new factories not being opened because people cannot operate businesses due to spiralling inflation because of direct Government action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1873" /> In the middle income group the average person will have to pay a 1 per cent levy on incomes of more than £8,000. That is an extra cost of £80 per year.  The VHI, in turn, will increase their charges. Where will it all end?  The Government have been warned to turn back before they reach the point of no return.  They are causing hardship and misery and high unemployment.  Coalition Governments always have been the same: they always caused hardship and misery from the moment they were elected.  This Government are moving in the same way.  Inflation has increased from 17 per cent to 22 per cent almost overnight.  At a time when we are trying to keep the economy stable, trying to keep wages steady and to have another national understanding, we are faced with the prospect of no national agreement because in order to combat inflation people must look for increases in their wages.</P>
    <P>It was wrong of the Government not to try harder to get income talks going.  They were not even seen to be doing something to keep the agreement intact, as we did last year when the Taoiseach called the various groups together and saved the agreement.  As a result last year we had few strikes, wages remained steady, the people were not unhappy, workers and employers felt a sense of stability.  It was extremely important to give that confidence to employers.  They must know exactly where they stand on wages.  In the free-for-all with which we are faced, workers will be looking for a 20 per cent increase which the employers will not be able to afford.  What will happen?  Great misery will be caused because all people will have to look forward to is a period of strife in the public and private sectors, without security for anyone.</P>
    <P>The economic policy of the Government is crazy.  They are going about everything in the wrong way.  If they wanted to give some money to women working at home there was already a system through which they could do it without extra cost.  We fought for a long time to get children's allowances payable in wives' names.  The Government have promised to increase children's allowances. <Col N="1874" />  Why not add to these allowances the money it would cost to administer the £9.60 scheme?  We are told it will cost an enormous sum to send out 80,000 cheques per week.  When I asked the Minister for Finance last summer how much it would cost he told me he did not know.</P>
    <P>If the Government want to do something for those in need they could use some of the money to help the battered wives, none of whom will be getting the £9.60.  None of them has a home to go to. The Government could have used the money which will be spent on the administration of this senseless scheme to build or to buy premises for the accommodation of battered wives.  There are premises at the moment available for a mere £200,000 but the Department of Health will not provide the money.  At the moment battered wives have to run from nightshelters at nine o'clock in the morning to old premises during the day which, because of their conditions, they are not allowed to say in at night.  If the Government had a social conscience, as the Taoiseach said they had, they should start immediately to spend this £200,000 to accommodate battered wives who are in dire need.</P>
    <P>At the poverty conference recently the Taoiseach made some strange remarks. He said, &ldquo;The wealthy are those people who own property or who have jobs&rdquo;. What did he mean by that?  Does he mean that the wealthy man is a bus driver who owns a house in Ballyfermot and is paying all these extra taxes in indirect taxation? Is he calling him a wealthy man?  To say that the wealthy were those who owned property and had a job is a strange statement.  He also said: &ldquo;We are committed to improving the real level of social welfare benefits&rdquo;.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach, if he means that, not to think in future of offering any person on social welfare a sum between 5p and 20p because, as far as I am concerned, that does not amount to looking after those in need.  I ask the Taoiseach to make a real effort to help those in receipt of social welfare benefits.  It is because of the economic policies being pursued by the Government that those people need all the <Col N="1875" /> help they can get.  I should like to wish the Minister responsible for poverty well in her task.  She has a very difficult job ahead and will have plenty of work to do in the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Miss Flaherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my confidence in the policies being pursued by the Government as set out in their programme to secure social justice for those dependent on social welfare.  I am glad that the fate of social welfare recipients is in the hands of a new Government.  The practice, the record and the residue of the last Government left us facing a task which is not easy for any sections of our community but is particularly difficult when it comes to protecting the position of those in receipt of social welfare benefits.  The commitment of the Government to secure social justice can never be in doubt.  Our activities to date, our commitments, our policies and our actions to deal with the immediate situation and plan for long-term solutions indicate that we take this task seriously and that we will continue to pursue the aims set out in our policy document.</P>
      <P>There is great inequality in our society. That is patently obvious and it is the Government's intention to pursue policies that will give equal opportunity to all.  This replaces the occasional thought given to the problem, the token increase in benefits which was the only answer conceived by the last Government to the problem of poverty.  We hope, in the place of platitudes and high flown sentiments, to have concrete action as the order of the day.  We cannot go on indefinitely preaching about the need to make the national cake bigger before we begin to divide it.  That was the last Government's great hope for the elimination of poverty, need and inequality in our society, that one could gradually hope that we could produce more and at that point the fall-out would be shared out to all and all would benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of the handing over of power in June the level of poverty here was as high, if not higher, than it had <Col N="1876" /> been ten, 15 or 20 years before.  The figures are shocking if we can talk of 25 per cent of our people living at levels that the vast majority of us would consider unacceptable.  For all their preaching and their reaction the last Government have a great deal of responsibility for this.  It is a great responsibility we regret that we had to take over but it is one that we are tackling enthusiastically.  We are planning and working towards a situation where there will be a radical improvement in that in the next four years.  There is evidence to suggest that while a rising economic tide may lift some boats there are plenty of other boats that get flooded and sink.  They are the people we are concerned about, those who have been left aside in our society and those who may be left aside if action is not taken.</P>
    <P>Any increase in social welfare benefits is not the final or radical answer to the problem.  There is need for action on a multi-fronted level.  The preoccupation with benefits, which are important, indicate the failure of the last Government to understand the depth of the problem, the extent of the inequality and the need for radical and multi-fronted action to tackle the question of poverty and inequality in our society.  Social welfare payments are the only cushion and support for a large number of our people.  Those payments are the vital life-support mechanisms for between one-third and one-quarter of the people here.  If we close off support to these people then we are coming near to closing off their basic means for survival. It is utterly erroneous and irresponsible for the Opposition to suggest that we would, even in our most desperate moments, contemplate action like that. These are desperate moments and they are as a result of a situation we inherited from the last Government.  The extent of the problem is known to the people and the Government and will become more obvious in the coming months.  However, even in those difficult circumstances, in a circumstance where we accept that there may not be too many rising tides for a long time, we are totally committed to ensuring that in real terms social benefits will rise.</P>
    <P>I was astonished last night to listen to <Col N="1877" /> the contribution of Deputy Woods in which he suggested that the burden of the Government's taxation policies would fall most heavily on the poor.  The very point of our proposed tax reforms is to ensure that those people in most need of help are the ones who shall get it.  At the poverty conference Dr. Kennedy examined our proposals and assessed that their overall impact was progressive, that it would bear more heavily on those who had and ease the burden on those who had less.  It was ironic to hear Deputy Woods attacking our tax proposals when he was a member of the Fianna Fáil Government which introduced budgets that benefited the rich at the expense of the poor, a Government which came to power on a programme that involved direct benefits to the rich at a cost to the national Exchequer, a move which limited the possibility of providing for the poor.</P>
    <P>Our shift in taxation from direct to indirect will not place indirect taxes on basic household goods essential for normal day-to-day living.  In this way we are determined to ensure that those people who spend their money in large quantities on luxury goods, and they are not few in number, will pay their share in taxation. Likewise, those people who are in the lower income sections of the community will not be faced with tax on basic household purchases and will be spared carrying the burden of increased taxation.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have laid much emphasis on the price rises there have been in many goods and commodities since we took office in June.  These have taken place and some of them have been very steep, but I refuse to accept that these were introduced entirely as a result of our economic policies.  I believe that message has gone out quite clearly to the public.  There were reports in the newspapers, even before the change of Government took place, of price rise applications sitting on various desks waiting to be imposed.  We have examples of other doubtful practices which committed the Government to economic measures which further limited our possibility for taking the type of action we would have liked to have taken.  Many of the <Col N="1878" /> increases I spoke about in the course of my first speech were sought during the period of office of the last Government. They had been recommended by the National Prices Commission but, for purely political reasons, had not been sanctioned by the Minister responsible. Indeed, in their attempt to curry favour with the electorate the last Government effectively froze prices for four or five months before the election.  I do not think that amounts to responsible economic management and I do not think it is honesty to the electorate.  When we came into Government, however, the Opposition had the audacity to attack us for what they had no courage whatsoever to do.  Their actions in this regard totally undermine the credibility of their attacks on the Government.</P>
    <P>However, they also attacked us for letting social welfare recipients fall behind. That is false and misleading.  The October increases were the first step in ensuring that social welfare recipients rise in real terms above the level of inflation.  The Government are committed to the indexation of social welfare benefits and to the raising of benefits in real terms.  It is a commitment which we have constantly reiterated and it is very damaging and irresponsible of the Opposition to try continually to put into the minds of the public that there is some question about this.  This commitment was given prior to the election, during the election and since the election.  It was given by myself three times yesterday in this House.  It is extraordinary to still find Opposition Deputies suggesting that there may be any welshing on this promise.</P>
    <P>Part of our commitment also involves the kind of understanding of the problem of poverty and of social welfare recipients that the Opposition never seemed to understand and certainly never articulated and, in this debate still fail to understand or articulate.  That is the importance of giving people a voice, the importance of making the system accessible to people.  Many of the people who are dependent on social welfare do not have a loud voice or belong to a very strong interest group.  By not being able to get the ears of the Government at will <Col N="1879" /> they often feel left behind.  It is important that they are consulted at times other than the four or five years from general election to general election.  The system as it operates, supposedly for them, is in fact very complex and bureaucratic. Many of them do not understand; the forms are unnecessarily difficult.  This sort of reform is something that we are committed to, to simplify the bureaucratic procedure, to clear up the anomalies that exist and to make sure that people know what is theirs and that the attitude to social welfare should be not that these people are beggars at the door of the Government but that they have a right and that if our society cannot provide them with employment that the least it must do is supply them with money to live on in a dignified and respectful way and whatever justice entails, not only giving them an adequate living income but also ensuring that they receive that income without any stigma or inadequacy or failure attached to it.  The party who have been responsible for running this country for many of the past 50 years must take a lot of responsibility for the shape and the atmosphere of many of the services which are crying out for change.</P>
    <P>Some points were raised last night by the Opposition speakers.  Deputy Woods spoke at length about the effect of the July budget on social welfare recipients saying that the increase in indirect tax has increased the burden on the poor.  The July budget was something that this Government had no desire to implement. There was no plan to implement it.  The Government got no pleasure out of implementing the July budget.  The need was obvious and those of us who are working from day to day with Departments can see that not only was there a need for that budget but, to be quite honest, that that budget will still leave many of the Departments in great difficulty in meeting services which were not adquately estimated for at the beginning of the year and for which even that budget, necessary as it was, will not fully fill the gap.  This is an extraordinary indictment of the irresponsibility of the previous Government which not only left <Col N="1880" /> price increases aside for a great deal of time but produced Estimates which were seriously inadequate.</P>
    <P>In bringing in the July budget the Government gave due consideration to social welfare recipients and in that an increase was given of 5 per cent to long-term beneficiaries and 3 per cent to all other beneficiaries and this was estimated on the basis that our budget at the time would raise the consumer price index by 3 per cent and would ensure that those on short-term benefits would at least maintain the standard that they could have expected prior to the budget and the 5 per cent increase effectively involved an actual increase in real terms for those on long-term benefits.  In the responses here today to individual questions during Question Time one can see that in many cases the increases to persons with large families were indeed quite significant.  If they are not significant then as much blame must go to those who set the levels for a 5 per cent increase and it would point to the need to re-examine the basic level of benefit rather than this destructive note of trying to score cheap points by looking at elements of a complete package.</P>
    <P>The Opposition speakers have commented unfavourably on the level of the October increases.  The increases provided by the previous Government in the January budget and brought into effect in April were intended to cover the situation for the year 1981&mdash;82 and to protect social welfare recipients against inevitable price increases during this year.  There was no indication that any further increase would be given later this year and if the experience of 1980 is anything to go by there would have been no increases under a Fianna Fáil Government.  They increased payments in April 1980 and gave no October increases. They increased payments by the same amount in April 1981, presumably with the intention of having no further increases in the rates until 1982.  Their comments on the increases provided by this Government must be looked at in this light.  These were extra increases which might not have been expected and would not have emerged under a Fianna <Col N="1881" /> Fáil Government.  The Fianna Fáil Government were setting inflation at a rate which looked well set to reach a figure of over 20 per cent and which left us with no alternative but to bring in a budget which, in effect, realised that direction. When we look at what actually occurred in 1980 we can receive further enlightenment about the previous Government's approach.  The increase in the consumer price index between February 1980 and August 1980 was 9.7 per cent and as I have said, no October increase in social welfare payments was considered necessary. This year the increase in the consumer price index for the corresponding period was only slightly higher at 10.5 per cent but the Government have given an October increase on this occasion and while this increase when taken on its own is fairly modest, it will, when taken with the increases which came into effect in April last, ensure that over the year as a whole, the position of social welfare beneficiaries will be fully protected.</P>
    <P>This Government are fully committed to indexation of social welfare payments and in planning their expenditure for next year this commitment will be a primary concern.  It is in the context of the January budget that rates of social welfare payments are fixed and the 1982 budget will indicate the Government's determination that the position of social welfare beneficiaries will be fully protected. More than that, this Government are also very much aware that the present level of social welfare payments is inadequate and have committed themselves to ensuring that those dependent on social welfare receive real increases in their income.  This commitment will be honoured by this Government and the October increase can be seen as an earnest of their intentions in this regard.</P>
    <P>When I started speaking I indicated that both in the short-term and in the long-term this Government are serious about their commitment to social justice and to secure, particularly for those who are dependent on social welfare and for those on lower incomes, a good standard of living.  Some of the options we have taken already indicate our commitment to this.  I have mentioned and dealt with <Col N="1882" /> the increases given in the July budget.  I would also refer to the agreement to give a double payment at Christmas.  Our decision to award double payment is an important one.  Deputy Lemass suggested last night that the Government were shamed into awarding this double payment by the fact that it had been made by the previous Government.  In fact the previous Government were forced to make that double payment by the commitment extracted from them in the second national understanding and it must be presumed that they agreed to that in view of the October increases.  This year our social welfare beneficiaries have gained from the October increases and also from this agreement to the double payment which we are extremely glad to give.  But a double payment of that nature is a short-term solution and I am especially interested in this Government's long-term commitment which I will come to later.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to the cheap fuel scheme and said he was seeking to have the value of this voucher increased to £5 per week.  The previous Government set the value in October 1980 at £2 and this Government, a year later, have set it at £4, an increase of 100 per cent. This provision to meet heating needs is only an interim measure pending, as promised in our programme, realistic heating provision for the elderly.  This is to be pressed forward as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, it was £3 before it went to £4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  But it was £2 at the beginning of 1980.  Deputies Woods and Lemass continued to refer to these mythical increases of 5p, 10p and 15p.  I have made that point a number of times and I can only put it down to the most wicked intentions of Opposition Deputies to create this myth that that level of increase has been given.  Nobody received an increase of only 5p, 10, or 15p in their pension.  These increases were supplements to other payments made and the other payments were also increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in ESB charges was <Col N="1883" /> referred to.  As the Deputy knows, the long-term recipients of social welfare payments, such as old age pensioners, blind pensioners and invalidity pensioners and others over pension age, receive a free electricity allowance, including a fixed number of units free of charge, 300 in the winter months.  This allowance is not affected by increases in charges and is additional to the increased levels of pension provided which, as I have said, represent real increases in the case of the elderly.</P>
    <P>Petrol price increases and the effect on the economy were mentioned.  Deputy Woods referred to an increase of 30p per gallon in the price of petrol between June and October of this year &mdash; from £1.90 a gallon to £2.26 a gallon.  It must be remembered, however, that the application for 16p of the increase was made to the previous Government but a decision on the application was deferred until after the general election.  Therefore, the actual increase in price under the present Government can be calculated as 20p or 10 per cent.  It may be mentioned that the increase in the price of petrol in the calander year 1980 was 33p a gallon, or 27 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to the position of social welfare beneficiaries in the light of tax changes to be made in the forthcoming budget.  In this regard the House may be assured that the Government will honour their commitments in the programme to safeguard the position of these beneficiaries.  As the Minister said last night, she will be concerned to see that further substantial increases are provided to those dependent on social welfare.  I am especially interested in the proposals regarding the child benefit scheme next year.  In her closing remarks, Deputy Lemass referred to the potential value of the children's allowance scheme. Its potential value and the importance to the mother, particularly the mother with a large family on a low income, has been recognised by the Government and it has led to one of the most progressive proposals in the Government's programme &mdash; the proposal to replace the existing children's allowance and tax allowance <Col N="1884" /> for children with a child benefit scheme. The present tax free allowance for children will be abolished and replaced by an augmented child benefit scheme, payable to all mothers of dependent children.  The substantially improved payment of £3 per week and £4 a week for the sixth and subsequent children will represent a major improvement in the circumstances of low income families.  What is involved is a radical approach which will take family income support out of the tax system, which is designed for collecting revenue and not as a mechanism for channeling support to less well-off sections of the community.  Under the new scheme State income support for families generally will be concentrated in one scheme, children's allowances, making the support more visible, more unified and of more value in its impact to those whose need is greatest.  The present system of a tax free allowance was regressive in nature, being of more value to those on the higher tax rates.  People whose incomes are below the tax threshold, the very people who need help most, get no benefit at all from these tax free proposals.</P>
    <P>There are such anomalies in our system.  There are benefits that most people presume are going to those most in need but in general are benefiting those who are better off.  This Government, in adopting such proposals, have shown their ingenuity, their commitment, and their ability to use the kind of research available in the area of progressive policies which will ensure the proper and full redistribution of wealth.  This new scheme will result in some new redistribution of income from the higher paid to the less well off, but I should like to stress that the new benefits will apply to all families regardless of the income of the household.  That is again recognising the importance of children, the maintenance of children and the role of the woman. The new benefit will represent a more realistic, independent income to the mother than the present children's allowance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass poured cold water on the £9.60.  Whatever about its financial benefit, when it is added to the children's <Col N="1885" /> allowance it will effecitvely mean that the woman will have a significantly improved disposable income coming directly to her in recognition of her role as child-minder and of being in the home &mdash; a recognition long overdue and the least that women could expect.  It will also benefit children for whom the mother still has the primary responsibility.  The constant dig that this is coming from the husband's pocket is inaccurate.  It is coming from an overall increase to the family through the new tax proposals.  Instead of directing all the increase to the husband's pay packet, some of the increase is going directly to the wife.  This will be extremely beneficial to low income families.</P>
    <P>I should like to come to the area that concerns me most.  It is the area which is in my title and which Deputy Lemass suggested only became relevant in the last two months.  If Deputy Lemass can say that, it is a shocking indictment of the total lack of knowledge of the seriousness, the extent and the history of the problem of poverty.  The appointment of a Minister for Poverty is not an indication of a new problem.  It is, for the first time in the history of the State, a recognition of a very real problem.  In the few months since I was appointed, regardless of what I have done, the acknowledgment of the problem by the creation of that Ministry and that responsibility has raised the consciousness and has developed the debate in an extraordinary way.  It is great credit to the Taoiseach that, in outlining areas of responsibility, he, and his Government should have established a whole new Ministry.  The Government's programme includes a commitment to tackle poverty in our society.  Deputy Leyden, in a previous debate, commented on the paltry amount of £100,000 which had been given to this committee.  If one expects that money to be spent on direct services, it is a paltry amount; but the Opposition do not seem to understand the importance of planning.  This agency will have both a planning and an action role.  The planning role is as important as the action role and that £100,000 is intended to establish an agency which will become the voice of the poor and a radical contribution to the whole debate on policies <Col N="1886" /> in this area.  It will influence Departments and encourage Departments who spend a great deal more money to have a poverty responsibility in the finance which is already given to them for social spending. The £100,000 can influence a great deal more than the direct budget which it spends itself and in the budget there is a commitment to extending its scope.  I consider the establishment of this committee as extremely important and I hope its role in the next few years will be one that will contribute to a radical change in our society.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the challenge involved in admitting the existence of poverty and the need for redistribution of resources from the haves and the have-nots.  In a time of recession this challenge would be resisted in some quarters but we are determined that any pressure to cut social services will not succeed or be tolerated.  An anti-poverty plan will be drawn up and implemented within the context of national, economic and social planning leading to a more just distribution of wealth and income.  The main task of the new agency will be to increase the understanding of the nature and extent of poverty through research and public education.  I hope in this task that party political divides will be forgotten, because I am sure that on all sides of the House there are people equally concerned about the problem.  Perhaps, when people are faced with the facts for the first time and with statistics and continuing pressure to acknowledge it, it may be something which will bring us together.  One of the areas in which the national committee made specific recommendations was in relation to development of constructive community action.  This will be one element of the agency's work.  The Government also acknowledge the importance of voluntary, community-based organisations tackling social problems.  We will ensure that these organisations are given proper recognition.  There is, very importantly, the establishment of a special anti-poverty unit in the Department of Social Welfare, which will extend and develop the activities of the committee.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, in the short term and in <Col N="1887" /> their commitment to long-term planning this Government have shown that they are concerned with securing social justice for those who are dependent on social welfare, for those on very low incomes and with eliminating some of the inequality and injustice in our society.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sherlock has five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful for five minutes in which to speak on this motion. A new Government comes into power and says that there is a huge deficit which makes it necessary to have a budget to reduce that deficit.  The Opposition of the time say that that is not correct, that the deficit could not be as great as that.  The fact of the matter is that the people of this country who are now very well aware &mdash; and politically aware &mdash; say that there must be a big deficit because, as far back as 1980, there were obvious cuts in public expenditure.  That was a sign that the economic situation was not by any means good.</P>
      <P>Having faced that situation, the Government went about rectifying it but, unfortunately, put the entire burden on one section of the community, the PAYE sector who are already over-burdened. They also imposed indirect taxation.  In his budget speech the Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>I also want to make it clear that I intend to ensure that other measures, such as capital taxation, mentioned by the Minister will be introduced by this Government as soon as the complex provisions to do so equitably can be framed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever the complex provisions are, the situation should be rectified now.  The way to rectify our economic situation is by capital taxation.  We had evidence in the last few weeks of the Government's determination on this question.  Five people were before the court charged with tax evasion and the amount involved was £2.7 million.  That is only the tip of the iceberg.  There is wholesale tax evasion and the machinery is not there to change that situation.  At least there is <Col N="1888" /> evidence that some steps are being taken in that direction.</P>
    <P>I am watching the situation very closely and I am inclined to the view that there is a commitment by the Government to introduce a policy programme for social justice.  In Kilkenny, over the weekend, the Taoiseach, recognising that there is such great poverty in this country, said that the haves will have to share with the have nots.  He included among the haves people in employment in unskilled jobs. I want to make it perfectly clear that people in employment in unskilled jobs are very little better off than those on social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>Next, I want the Minister for Social Welfare to bear in mind that the greatest injustice now being perpetrated by the Government on such people is that on the assessment of a person's eligibility for services, such as health services or educational grants, tax is not deductible.  You have a situation where a person who applies for a medical card under the limit which refers to that person, does not have tax deducted in assessing his or her eligibility for that service.  That is wrong. The dependants of social welfare recipients should benefit from free dental or optical treatment.  These people are not able to avail of that treatment because they cannot afford to pay for it.</P>
    <P>Finally, the motion condemns the Coalition policy for the hardship which it has imposed and there is no doubt that it has imposed hardship.  The amendment says that Dáil Éireann expresses its confidence in the Government because it is determined to secure a policy of social justice, including the issues of taxation and employment and to tackle the problem of poverty.  I was glad to hear the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, speaking on this question and I do not doubt her determination in this matter. It is in the next couple of months that the Government's progress in this direction will be measured.  The Government will not deserve to continue to be in power if they do not do something to rectify the existing injustices and do not bring in a policy of full justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister <Col N="1889" /> of State at the Department of Social Welfare on her maiden speech in the House. As we are all aware, when a Member of this House makes a maiden speech we normally do not interrupt.  However, there is a lot of material in this speech which will be quoted on many future occasions.</P>
      <P>All I say, in constructive criticism, is that it differs very much from speeches which the Minister made a year or two ago about what should be done in Government and for Government.  The motion in the name of Deputy Woods says:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the economic policies of the Coalition Government which have greatly increased prices and the cost of living and which are causing severe hardship for social welfare recipients and those on lower incomes and calls on the Government to take special measures immediately to safeguard the welfare and the living standards of these sections of the community this winter.</P>
      <P>The amendment put down by the Minister for Social Welfare reads:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann expresses its confidence in the policies of the Government, as set out in its Programme, to secure social justice for those who are dependent on social welfare.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Apart from those who are receiving social welfare, there are a number of people, as mentioned by Deputy Woods in his motion, people in a lower income group, who have a very serious problem.  Being a rural Deputy I refer to the small farmers and farmers in general, and to small shopkeepers who are practically out of business due to supermarkets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal, firstly, with the social welfare end of the problem.  As a Deputy of long standing in this House I must say that when the budget of 21 July was introduced here I was amazed that any Government made up of Independents, of Labour and Fine Gael, would bring in a <Col N="1890" /> budget which would give only 5 per cent increase to social welfare recipients and 3 per cent to others, in view of the fact that in that very budget the most severe system of taxation which could ever be introduced was introduced &mdash; that is a 50 per cent increase in value-added tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that the Coalition Government have subsidised people in the lower income bracket and those on social welfare.  She said that people in the lower income groups were not affected.  We all know that the 50 per cent increase in value-added tax affected people with families.  There was a 50 per cent increase in VAT in relation to school books and there is no point in saying that people in a lower income group are not being affected when there is a 50 per cent increase in the price of school books.</P>
    <P>We are also aware that the increase of petrol, the cost of cars, building materials, all the items right across the board that are affected by the 50 per cent increase in VAT have put the cost of living up considerably.  I hope the rocket the Americans are sending up tomorrow will take this away.  The cost of living and inflation have gone out of hand.  Everybody must be informing Deputies on the Government side of what is happening to the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I want to say, as a member of the previous Government, that Fianna Fáil decided, because we were in a recession period, that the most vulnerable section of the community were those in the lower income group and those in receipt of social welfare payments.  We did not decide on 5 per cent or 3 per cent increases but on 25 per cent and 20 per cent increases to all those people.  This ensured they got increases over and above the normal cost of living index and I am sure the Minister appreciates that.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is now discussing the estimates for the coming budget and I hope she will insist on an increase like that for the people I am talking about. We gave them this large increase last year and we gave the double payment at Christmas to the long-term social welfare recipients.  I am sure the Minister will admit that it was because of the demands made by my colleague, Deputy Woods, <Col N="1891" /> who introduced this last year, that last week she decided she would do it.  I congratulate the Minister on doing this but I must give credit to my colleague for insisting she do it.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that there is a need to meet the cost of living index and we know that social welfare recipients in general have not sufficient money to pay for ESB charges and all the other charges made on them.  One of the major problems in the Department of Social Welfare is the payment of disability benefits. Some people are waiting for two months and even three months for payment.</P>
    <P>Last Saturday a man came to visit me at my home and he told me that his daughter had called into the Department of Social Welfare because he had not got benefit for five weeks.  That man's daughter was informed in Aras Mhic Dhiarmada last week that certificates had not been sent in.  I telephoned the Department on Monday and got through to the section where I was informed that a computer was out of order.  It does not matter if a computer is out of order or if that man sent in the certificates.  He is a married man with five children who has paid his pay-related contributions and for his insurance stamps over the years, but now that he needs to get disability benefit because he has been ill he cannot get it. I know that before we had supermarkets there was not a very great problem when there were cases like this because we had family grocers.  If customers had problems they could go to their family grocers and get credit for a few weeks.</P>
    <P>That position has changed because when people do their shopping they are not known in supermarkets.  Everything is very impersonal in those supermarkets. They only want to see people with money.  If a person has not money at the check-out the goods go back into the store.  When we had family grocers Deputies were not pressurised by social welfare recipients to find out what happened to their benefits when they were not receiving payment.  They knew they could get credit from their family grocers and could await payment of their social welfare benefits.</P>

      <P>Social welfare recipients are suffering hardship at the moment. Members of the Labour Party, of the Fine Gael Party and of the Fianna Fáil Party as well as Independent Members know that this is the case because most of their time is taken up with telephoning the Department of Social Welfare and writing letters to the Department asking them to do something for the people who are not receiving the benefit they are entitled to.  I want to put it on the record of the House that I do not blame any official in the Department of Social Welfare for this problem.  I want to see a political decision taken like the one that was taken during the postal strike when the Leader of the Opposition, who was then Minister for Social Welfare, asked the various voluntary organisations to ensure that those people got the money they were entitled to.  The problem has got so serious that something must be done about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I allowed the Minister to interrupt for a minute only because my time is limited.  I would like her to come down to Carlow and Kilkenny and meet the people who have sent in certificates of illness and who are awaiting social welfare benefits for weeks.  I will send the Minister details tomorrow of people who <Col N="1893" /> are waiting three and four months for the benefits they are entitled to.  Something will have to be done about this matter. In view of the problems that have arisen I suggest that we get the voluntary organisations to again ensure that those people get the money they are entitled to.  There is the problem of the health boards paying an amount in social assistance to the social welfare recipients but now they are becoming reluctant to do this because they have paid out quite a lot of money. Some of the officers wonder if particular people have got their cheques.  We had a problem mentioned by the Taoiseach in the House on the day he was elected that the health boards had no money either in 1980 or early in 1981.  The accounts for the various Departments are not coming to light now.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has the document I have here with me, the <i>Irish Medical Times.</i> It was sent to me because I am a former Minister of State in her Department.  It might be no harm to put on record the financial position of the Department of Health in 1980.  I want to quote from the <i>Irish Medical Times,</i> volume 15, number 44, dated November 6 1981 and published every Friday:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Unspent Money Returned.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health handed back over £2½ million of unspent money to the Central Exchequer last year, it is revealed in figures just published by the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>In 1980 the Department estimated that its gross expenditure would be £721.011 million and its income £52.8 million, according to the Appropriation Accounts.</P>
      <P>To meet this it received a grant from the Central Exchequer of £668.211 million to finance the running of the health services.</P>
      <P>However, its actual gross expenditure of £72.819 million was £191,570 less than estimated and its income at £54.617 million was £1.817 million more than expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This left the Department at the end of the year with a surplus of just over <Col N="1894" /> 2½ million unspent which was handed back to the Department.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Medical Times</i> have no political associations of which I am aware.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to the question of the disabled.  When I was Minister for Labour the Government made the decision that 3 per cent of all those employed in the public service would be disabled people who were qualified to do certain jobs in the public service.  A disabled person in a wheelchair can do a certain amount of work.  A person who is disabled from the neck down as a result of an accident can do a certain amount of work.  As Minister for Labour I was glad that my colleagues in Government decided that 3 per cent of the total recruitment to the public service would be disabled people.  Unfortunately since this Government took office they have stopped recruitment to the public service with the result that the recruitment of disabled people to the public service is far below what we anticipated.</P>
    <P>Even though we are now in opposition I was invited down to a certain place in the South Eastern Health Board in my own area and I was delighted to see the development which has taken place there.  I saw a man on crutches who is working in a factory.  He was able to work on a forklift truck and was working as well as any person with the normal use of his legs.  Even though there has been a cutback in recruitment to the public service I would ask the Minister to increase the percentage of recruitment of the disabled in this Year of Disabled Persons.</P>
    <P>The Minister opened the poverty council in Kilkenny last Sunday and made a speech there.  I am sure she will get all the documentation from everybody who spoke there.  Sister Stanislaus is a very able member of society.  I congratulate the Minister on appointing her as chairman.  I can assure the Minister that she will be in her office quite often.  We talk about financial poverty but there are other types of poverty.  A man with a wife and two children with an income of £80 a week can live in comfort and happiness and with no problems while another man with a wife and two children and an <Col N="1895" /> income of £80 a week will be living in poverty.  Poverty means more than money.  It also means management.  We must educate people to use the finances available to them properly.</P>
    <P>There is also the poverty of loneliness. Old people living alone can be lonely. Sometimes a widow or a widower can be living alone and forgotten.  There is another type of loneliness.  When I was Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare I was given the title of Minister for Children.  I had responsibility for family care and the child.  I did quite a lot of work in that field.  Even with our educational system and our pre-marriage courses we are inclined to forget that 60 to 80 per cent of everybody's time is spent in the home.  When a girl is working in a factory she is working with 30 or 40 other girls.  Another girl may be working in an office with four or five other girls.  She gets married and goes to live in a large housing estate, a concrete jungle as somebody called it.  She may not be a person who will mix with her neighbours. Suddenly she feels lonely.  The day of the old family grocer has gone when he could introduce Mrs. Jones to Mrs. Murphy down at the corner and they would get to know each other.</P>
    <P>On an examination of the report of the task force we find there is a lot of work which we in this House must do.  There will be a tremendous amount of work to be done when the Minister introduces her Children's Bill this year.  She can rest assured that we will give her all the help we can to ensure that the Bill will be a proper Bill.  Many problems arise in our modern society.  Changes are taking place in our society.  How much more time have I got?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a couple of minutes. There is also the problem of young people who wish to get a local authority loan to buy a house.  Under the previous administration there were certain conditions laid down in respect of loans.  I agree that having regard to the limited amount of money available loans should not be given to every person who wishes to buy a house as in many cases these houses are converted into flats.  When the Fianna Fáil Government were in office all an applicant had to do was to confirm through his clergyman or by some other means that he intended to get married. Under the new regulations the joint income of the couple are taken into account when arriving at the income limit for a loan.  The income limits is £7,500 and it is obvious that in practically all cases the joint income of the couple will exceed that amount.  In my opinion this regulation was introduced because the Government do not wish to give loans to young people to build houses.  I ask them to withdraw that regulation.</P>
      <P>Traditionally it has been the practice that on publication of unemployment figures the Government make a comment on the matter.  Last Monday on the 6.30 p.m. radio news it was announced that 129,211 people were unemployed but the Government did not make any comment. I do not deny that when I was Minister for Labour there was an increase in unemployment but at least I gave some explanation.  In the months of June, July, August, September and October there was a steady increase in the number unemployed and the media have reported that this will continue.  The last time there was a decrease in the unemployment figures was in May, the last month of office of Fianna Fáil.  At that time there was a decrease of 2,500.  I ask the Minister present to note what I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I should like to refer to some of the points raised by speakers in the debate, particularly to points raised by the Minister of State and by the Minister and to some of the matters referred to by Deputy Sherlock.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherlock mentioned that recently some tax evaders were before the courts and he was anxious to give the Government credit for that.  I am sure the Deputy will realise that it has taken quite some time to bring these tax evaders before the courts and that the whole process started long before the change of Government.  It was something about which my colleague in the Department of Finance was very concerned during his period in office.  I would advise Deputy Sherlock to look at the reports of the Revenue Commissioners which show the numbers of people who were brought to court each year and the fact that an increasing effort has been made in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the comments of Deputy Sherlock it is obvious that he is prepared to wait and see.  He has heard all the commitments given but he realises this is not <Col N="1898" /> reflected in what is happening on the ground.  I do not think he is totally convinced.  I think the Deputy is right to listen to what is happening on the ground because the ground may open up and swallow a number of people.</P>
    <P>I listened to the comments of the Minister of State and the Minister.  In opening the debate I raised the number of serious problems which have arisen because of the measures taken by the Government in their July budget.  There is no escaping reality.  I did not try to escape from problems that existed earlier in the year and which we dealt with as well as we could in management terms and I am prepared to debate that matter with anybody at any stage.</P>
    <P>We are going through a difficult period.  My real fear is that the policies being adopted are having and will continue to have a disastrous and detrimental effect particularly on those on lower incomes and those on social welfare benefits.  I mention in particular people on lower incomes.  Deputy Sherlock recognised that it is not all a question of people on social welfare benefits.  Our motion refers clearly to those people on lower incomes also.  In his short contribution Deputy Sherlock noted that people on lower incomes are suffering especially badly.  In a way they will be the &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; people in this massive scheme the Government are attempting to implement.  They are doing this despite the advice coming from all sides, even from some leading economists who have had time to work out the real implications.  These implications were pointed out when the package was put before the electorate in the general election.</P>
    <P>It appears the Minister of State and the Minister are oblivious to all these matters.  Their point is that they have a commitment but that everything will work out right in due course.  I accept the sincerity of both Ministers in this respect but I fear it is all going wrong at the moment. Notwithstanding the sincerity, best wishes and commitment of the Ministers, this harsh reality will have to be faced in the very near future.</P>
    <P>One of the planks or platforms on which the Ministers based much of their <Col N="1899" /> case was the improvement in the children's allowances planned for next April. I am very interested in this, as I was interested in it when it was put forward as an election promise.  Apart from the fact that I felt it misled people in the short term, it is important to identify what this package means and what it will do.  It will hit those in the middle income group hardest.  The Government are clawing back a husband's tax-free allowance. Both the Minister and Minister of State made it quite clear that the child allowance is being clawed back.  There is no question about that.  It amounts to £195 per annum.  If one has four children one gets four times £195 of a tax-free allowance.  This is important as far as the working man is concerned.  Under the new scheme proposed from next April a wife will receive £3 per week per child.  That sounds very attractive and as an election promise was well presented.  I congratulate the Government on the way it was done but it was misleading.  That will come home to people when the scheme begins.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a family with four children.  They will receive £12 per week. The present position, as it exists since last April, entitles a family with four children to £33 per month.  Many people use this money to pay ESB bills and so on and if the Minister does not know that she should visit people in the north city area. Four children at £33 per month is the equivalent of £8.25 per week.  That is paid directly but, indirectly through a husband, there is a taxsaving of £195 per child.  There are many workers on the lowest rate.  It represents £3.80 per week to them.  If we add £3.80 to £8.25 the total is £12.05.  That is what the amount has been since last April.  The family are 5p better off since last April than they will be from next April.</P>
    <P>One could say that if people are paying tax they will not receive that benefit.  That was true.  However, they will still receive £12 per week.  In the last two budgets children's allowance was increased by 30 per cent.  If one takes that on top of the other, there was a 69 per cent increase in 18 months.  Suppose Fianna Fáil <Col N="1900" /> increased it by 30 per cent in the next budget, as we did in the last two because it is an area where we had a particular interest, that would mean £2.47 per week added on to £12.05.  In April 1982 a family with four children would have £14.52 per week.  If we had only increased it in the budget immediately preceding the election people would have said we did it only because of the election but we have shown our real commitment by the fact that we increased it in the budget before that one.</P>
    <P>People on the 25 per cent tax rate will be considerably worse off under the proposed package.  The Government tried not to say anything about those people but spoke about those at the bottom level.  These people will be 25p per child better off.  That is an important equation and one most people overlook.  The statements made by the Minister and the Minister of State about how wonderful this change would be prompted me to point out exactly what the position is.  A husband will have £9.60 taken from him by virtue of a reduction of £2,000 per year in his tax-free allowance and in addition will have £195 taken from his tax-free allowance for each child.  That will mean a husband will pay a great deal more tax than he does at present.  If Fianna Fáil were in office and did nothing more than we did for the last two years, a family would get £14.52 from next April whereas the present Government have promised them £12 per week from next April.  This is misunderstood by many people but it is important to recognise what is involved and the extent to which a clawback will be operated.  It will be seen because husbands are not as dim as people take them for and will recognise that their tax-free allowances are significantly adjusted.</P>
    <P>The main impact of the Government's policies will be on the poor and on families.  We will create a new poor.  At a recent conference there was mention of 25 per cent of people living in poverty.  It will be considerably more when the Government are finished.  The economic policies of the Government are hard and cold-blooded and will increase the number of poor especially those on social <Col N="1901" /> welfare and who benefited from tax improvements.  The Minister of State said that people welcomed it as did Deputy Sherlock.  However, people recognise that they will be badly affected and see no way of recouping their losses.</P>
    <P>The Minister made no reference to the £9.60.  For most no benefit will accrue to the family from this measure.  It is a circular transfer from a husband to a wife and will mean extra administrative costs. I estimate a staff of 500 will be involved and together with buildings, paper and so on the cost will be in the region of £9 million.  If it is less or more than that figure perhaps the Minister will tell us. But it is clear from the comments of the tax inspectors that they are concerned about the situation, that they see it as one which will create circular transfers.  The question is whether the provision can be applied to everyone.  The Minister of State said this evening that we can be assured that the commitment to the payment of this £9.60 will be honoured and that nobody will suffer.  However, there is considerable confusion in the matter. According to the Gaiety Theatre document, the direct payment of the tax credit in respect of wives working in the family home will be payable in full even where the present family income is below £4,000 per annum and that this will aid the lower income families not liable for tax now.  If that is the position, there are 280,000 wives who would not be liable to benefit otherwise but to pay them will cost £140 million per annum.  This represents about £200 in respect of each taxpayer.  Therefore, the honouring of this commitment will have a major impact on Government policies so far as the ordinary taxpayer is concerned.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about prices but I shall take up just one aspect of this situation, that is, the surcharge of 80 per cent imposed by the Minister for Finance in respect of the fuel variation and which is reflected in a 25 per cent increase in ESB bills being delivered now.  In effect this means an increase of from £15 to £20 in the average bill, an increase that is totally unjustified.  The National Prices Commission in their report published on the last day of April recommended a 12 per <Col N="1902" /> cent increase in this regard.  We said at the time that we did not consider the fuel variation to warrant such an increase and that we would like time to examine in detail the increase sought.  The new Government ratified a 25 per cent increase. Shortly afterwards the ESB declared a profit of £6.3 million and a £58 million cash flow.  This whole debacle on the part of the Minister for Finance, which was used in an effort to give the impression that Fianna Fáil in Government had been holding back on this increase for political reasons, was a total misjudgment on his part.  The ordinary families are the ones who are suffering now.  If the Minister of State were to visit some of the homes in any part of the country in which the families concerned are being affected by this 25 per cent increase, I am sure she would realise the hardship it is causing.  I raised this question during a television debate with the Minister for Finance and I raised it on other occasions too, but there is no rush on the part of the Government to defend the increase.  The reason is that it is indefensible.  I say this because, as we anticipated, the fuel variation costs have stabilised greatly.</P>
    <P>When the ESB annual report was published a spokesman for the company said that it might be possible in February next, on consideration of the situation, to reduce charges.  Of course it will be possible to do that next February since the increase was not necessary in the first place.  I hope the people will realise that the Government are the people who are responsible for this large increase.</P>

      <P>An upper age limit of 65 does not apply in some parts of the public <Col N="1770" /> service and where such a limit does apply (for example, for most established civil servants) the employer normally has the right to compulsorily retire an employee from age 60.  The detailed information necessary to do the costing requested by the Deputy is available to me only in respect of the civil service.  If all established civil servants were required to retire at age 60 from 1 January 1982 onwards it would cost the Exchequer an extra £40 million approximately in 1982 to cover the lump sums and pensions of those who would not normally have retired.  There would of course be a continuing extra pension cost in 1983 of about £10 million for the same group.  In the longer run when a more normal pattern of year-to-year retirements reasserted itself the pension bill could be expected to settle at a level at least 20 per cent higher than at present, reflecting the longer period for which pensions would in future be payable.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the school transport scheme the routes of special services to post-primary centres are organised in such a way as to ensure that no pupil has more than three miles to travel to a route. In order to establish or maintain a route, or a spur operating to a route, it would be necessary that there be a minimum of seven eligible pupils living three miles or more from a centre or a service route. These conditions are not fulfilled at present in relation to the area referred to by the Deputy.  According to my information, no pupil involved has to walk a distance of three miles or more to the service route.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit from 23 March 1981 and was paid from that date at the maximum appropriate rate. Payment continued, on receipt of medical evidence, to 19 September 1981 at which stage his title to injury benefit was exhausted as he had been paid for the maximum statutory period of 26 weeks.</P>
      <P>His claim from 21 September 1981 onwards was treated as one for disability benefit.  He was not, however, qualified for payment as according to the records of my Department he had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited, in 1979/80, the governing contribution year.  Following inquiries, however, has been established that he had 39 contributions paid in that year and was entitled to payment of benefit. Payment of disability benefit for the period 21 September 1981 to 6 November 1981, representing the balance due has accordingly been issued.</P>

      <P>It was decided by an appeals officer in February 1981 that the person concerned was not entitled to a non-contributory old age pension as his means, <Col N="1800" /> consisting of a holding and capital, exceeded the then statutory limit of £23 a week.  As the means limit has since been extended representations from the Deputy have been accepted as a repeat claim to pension on this claimant's behalf.

      <P>It was decided by an appeals officer on 24 August 1981 that the person concerned was entitled to a non-contributory old age pension at the rate of £0.60 per week plus £1.65 living alone allowance from 13 January 1981, increased to £5.85 per week plus £2.05 living alone allowance from 3 April 1981.  The rate payable from 2 October 1981 is £7.15 plus £2.15 living alone allowance.</P>
      <P>The pensioner's means consisting of a holding, the transfer of which was not accepted for old age pension purposes, and capital entitled him to a pension at these rates.  Arrangements are being made for the social welfare supervisor to call on him again in order to establish if further information, received recently from the pensioner's solicitors, would warrant a revision of the claim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that in some respects the service in Rathcoole and Saggart is unsatisfactory.  The most pressing problems are difficulties in making calls to and from the Naas (045) areas and delays in <Col N="1805" /> fault repairs and maintenance of overhead cable routes and I presume that it is these the Deputy has in mind.  A new exchange complex at Naas will come into service shortly and a gradual improvement in the service will ensue.</P>
      <P>A special programme of preventive maintenance is in hands for the entire 01 area.  The difficulties in the Rathcoole and Saggart areas will have particular attention as part of this work.</P>

      <P>There are 465 applications awaiting attention at Bray.  The necessary cabling to enable these applications to be met will be carried out progressively over the next two years or so and it is expected that a majority of the applications will be <Col N="1806" /> met within the next year with the remainder being met progressively over the following year or so.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works will be seeking tenders early next year for the building of an extension to the existing permanent exchange at Bray.  Additional equipment in the extended permanent exchange is expected to be ready for service about the end of 1983 or early in 1984.</P>
      <P>There is sufficient capacity in the existing exchange and two mobile exchanges for the waiting applications plus expected demand during the next 12 months or more.  The question of providing a third mobile exchange to bridge the gap until the extended permanent exchange is in service is under consideration.</P>

      <P>Discussions on extensions to the school began in 1973 and have gone on since then beset by a variety of difficulties, largely of a local nature.  Eventually, on 20 July 1981 the reverend chairman informed the Department that he would be able to get a site extension; the Commissioners of Public Works were advised accordingly on 11 August 1981.  I understand from the Commissioners of Public works that it will be necessary for their architect to survey the site extension <Col N="1814" /> offered by the school authorities before the preparation of a sketch-plan for the extension may be commenced.  I have requested the commissioners to expedite the undertaking of this survey.</P>

After the announcement of the community, youth, recreational and employment programme which was first advertised on 28 October 1981 this club collected an application form directly from my Department on 30 October 1981.  Furthermore another official application form and details of the programme together with a covering letter were sent to the club on 4 November, and I have received no notification whatever from the club involved of any dissatisfaction on their part with regard to this matter.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the upward trend in the incidence of house burglaries and other crimes in the Dún Laoghaire area this year has been of particular concern and special measures have been taken to deal with the situation through the use of additional patrols and the services of the crime task force which is based at Dublin Castle and is called out to supplement the local policing arrange- <Col N="1815" /> ments in any area of the DMA as the need arises.</P>
      <P>The strength of the detective branch serving the Dún Laoghaire area, which includes the six stations at Dún Laoghaire, Dalkey, Kill-O-Grange, Blackrock, Cabinteely and Shankill, was increased by three detective gardaí last month and three new recruit gardaí are being assigned to the area this week.</P>

      <P>Garda investigations and observations do not confirm that the position is as stated in the complaints but the Garda accept that the management and employees of the firm in question have a problem arising from the fact that large numbers of young people in the area tend to play near the premises, even though playgrounds have been provided by the corporation, and that his causes annoyance apart from the fact that there have been some incidents of vandalism and larceny from vehicles at various times.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda that special Garda attention has been and is being given to Seville Place and the business premises there.  There is a concentrated patrolling of the area by uniformed foot patrol.  In addition, the area is also patrolled by the district motorcyclists from Store Street and Fitzgibbon Street stations and by patrol cars and vans from Store Street station.  The Garda will continue to make every effort to deal with problems in the area.</P>
