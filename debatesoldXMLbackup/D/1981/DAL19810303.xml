    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to a report (details supplied) that tens of thousands of letters to constituents have been prepared by the departmental staff of Ministers and Ministers of State in readiness for an election announcement; if any such envelopes have been prepared in his Department for him or for his Minister of State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach tell the House whether the report is completely without foundation and that none of his Cabinet colleagues or his second 15 have prepared the alleged circulars for distribution in the event of an election?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware no such circulars have been prepared.  I will let the Deputy know in plenty of time when the election is coming.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to make that sort of judgment.  All I can deal with is facts and as far as the report refers to tens of thousands of circulars being prepared that report is not correct. It is without foundation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether it is open to voluntary organisations, political parties and youth organisations to make submissions to the study groups now working within the framework of an examination of the totality of the relationship between Britain and Ireland; and whether he envisaged that a contribution could be made by such bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for submissions of the kind referred to by the Deputy to be made to the study groups.  Any representations or proposals which these organisations may wish to put forward should be submitted to me or the appropriate Minister and <Col N="533" /> they can be assured of the fullest consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that if the study groups are putting forward ideas that may yet result in an improvement in relationships in these islands as between North and South or in new institutional arrangements, we should tap all the resources within the country outside political parties?  Political parties do not have a monopoly of good ideas in this area and we should make known that the Taoiseach does issue an invitation to all groups in the country to make known their ideas in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with that and I hope that this exchange will have that effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether any consideration is being given to joint defence arrangements between this country, Britain and other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's position as regards defence policy has been stated on numerous occasions in the past.  There is no proposal in existence for any change in that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that our non-involvement in any military arrangements at present confers, <Col N="534" /> in the context of our membership of the EEC, a special significance on our relationship with countries in the rest of the world and that it probably gives us a better platform from which to defend peace than any altered arrangement would?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that we are not members of any military alliance certainly enables us to play a role in the UN, for instance, that we would not otherwise be able to play in so far as peace-keeping operations and matters of that sort are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that there is, unfortunately, as far as we can see, a very serious deterioration in east-west relations for a number of reasons and that again confers a special significance?  We cannot exaggerate our importance in the world but would the Taoiseach agree that, again in the context of our membership of the EEC, we can play a role out of all proportion to our size in the world on the side of peace by retaining non-alliance status?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that we have ever sought non-alliance status.  We are not a member of any military alliance and it is that non-membership of any military alliance that makes us very valuable to the UN from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that our neutralist stance should not be confined exclusively to a peace-keeping role <i>vis-à-vis</i> the UN and that it has much wider connotations than the narrow circumspection which the Taoiseach is now implying would apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am dealing with the question of membership or non-membership of a military alliance.  I might facilitate the House on this matter by informing the House that it is the intention of the Government to put down a motion for debate next Tuesday which will enable Deputies to contribute in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that the Government's apparent equivocation on the very clear black and white situation of neutrality is leading other countries as well as people in this country to doubt this country's position which in its own interest and in the interests of the reputation of the EEC ought to be a policy of absolute military neutrality so as not to attract the hostile action of any foreign country towards this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, we will have an opportunity next Tuesday to debate these matters fully.  In the meantime I want to reiterate what I said in my reply, that there is no proposal in existence for any change in our present policy.  I might remind the House also of the provision of Article 29 of the Constitution which indicates that if the State is a party to any international agreement that international agreement must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that different and contrary reports of what is under consideration by the study group regarding a defence pact and the constitutional position of Northern Irelans are heightening very considerably the tensions within Northern Ireland and making a dangerous situation even more dangerous?  Would he not further agree that a clear and unequivocal statement by him as to whether or not the constitutional position of Northern Ireland is or will be under discussion at the study group and a clear unequivocal statement that we do not and will not form any common defence pact with Britain or any other country would lead to a very considerable lessening of the tensions and dangers within Northern Ireland at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with all these matters fully next Tuesday.  In the meantime, I wish to say that I think the process of studies which has been embarked upon can do nothing but good and will contribute to the betterment of relations between these islands, all the peoples of these islands, and that nobody has or should have anything to fear from that process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that most of the areas which have been mentioned for joint studies would be beneficial to all concerned.  The two I have specifically mentioned, the possibility of the constitutional position of Northern Ireland being under discussion and the possibility of a joint defence pact with Great Britain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that these two areas are heightening tensions to a very dangerous degree <Col N="537" /> and that, if the Taoiseach was in a position to answer and clarify this next Tuesday, would he not accept that the urgency of the matter dictates that he defuse the matter now and clarify those two positions now?  I am sure the Taoiseach appreciates that life can be lost in Northern Ireland between now and next Tuesday, so it is a matter of very considerable urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, on the one hand, is calling on me for a full statement and, at the same time, he is not prepared to wait until I have an opportunity of making a full statement. I do not think one can make a full statement on complex and difficult subjects at Question Time.  I do not accept that the process of studies which has been undertaken should be, or is, a cause for any disquiet anywhere.  I regret that Deputy Cluskey, in particular, since this process started has sought to do nothing but undermine what is an entirely beneficial process.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures for the number of persons <Col N="539" /> on the live register in 1936 are not comparable with the current figures because of the changes made in the social welfare regulations and other changes in the coverage of the live register over the period involved, in particular the operation of employment period orders between March and November in 1936.  In 1936 the total number of persons on the live register varied between 144,764 on 27 January and 67,045 in 31 August.  The figure on 29 June was 70,274.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the smallness of the enterprise and of the likelihood of an upturn in that type of market and, having regard also to the length of time it has taken to build up the necessary skills there, would it not be worthwhile for the Government to carry the factory for a year especially a year of economic depression?  I have some long experience of that industry and this experience is not related to politics, As Deputy O'Keeffe has pointed out, the time for planting is now.  Since there is the likelihood of an upturn in the market, would the Minister not agree to having the necessary finance made available to allow the planting to go ahead?</P>

      <P>Of special advantage to the sheep producers in mountain areas are the grants available under the EEC Disadvantaged Areas Directive.  These will still operate and I will continue to ensure that the form of grants payable will be to the best advantage of the hill producers.</P>
      <P>Under the Farm Modernisation Scheme producers can avail of grants for sheep wintering facilities, fencing and improvement of mountain land and lamb-fattening units.  Under the western package these grants will be continued and improved.</P>
      <P>Breed improvement schemes are also operated by my Department and county committees of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the long term it is by improved management and feeding that sheep producers <Col N="547" /> can guarantee themselves a better future and higher returns.  They should use the advice available from ACOT Specialists.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister promise that the farmers will get the full grants being promised now?  I ask the question because I heard the Minister and at least one of the Ministers of State who is sitting behind him promise the farmers in Donegal £7 per ewe whereas those farmers realise now that all they will get will be between 50p and 70p by way of subsidy.  Since they were misled on the occasion of which I speak, is it not possible that they are being misled now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the continued strength of sterling, exporters of pigs from the Six Counties to here benefit from an MCA subsidy.  This subsidy is at present equal to 18.2 per cent or in sterling £10.72 per 100 kgs live-weight. The payment of this subsidy is fully in accordance with Community rules.  However, I believe that when MCAs continue for a long time at a high rate they have a disruptive effect on trade.  It is the Government's policy to support measures for the reduction or elimination of MCAs through adjustments in &ldquo;green&rdquo; rates.</P>
      <P>There is also reason to believe that pigs are being smuggled from here over the Border to evade the United Kingdom import charge and are later sent back legitimately collecting the export subsidy. My Department are in consultation with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners about this matter and we have notified the EEC Commission of the suspected irregularity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>While there was some delay in commencing inspections, there was no delay in their completion as the full round of inspections under the 1980 cattle headage scheme in County Kerry was completed by 30 November the same date as in the previous year.  More payments arising from the inspections were made before 31 December in 1980 than in the previous year.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that many farmers, particularly in the Dingle and the Iveragh peninsulas, had to sell their cattle because they were afraid they would not have fodder for the winter?

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there were increased staff numbers in the western areas to deal with very large numbers of applications being submitted under the various schemes which are now available under the auspices <Col N="556" /> of my Department.  He will, of course, appreciate that in County Kerry the total number of applications under this scheme is virtually 7,000.  From his own experience, he will probably realise the implication of suggesting that these applications could be completed in one month.  With the best will in the world, that is not possible.  We will do everything we can to process these applications as quickly as possible.  On a year to year basis it is quite clear that we have been making substantial progress, in that practically 6,000 of the 7,000 applications were completed by the end of November.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage it would be improper for me to alter the conditions in the 1980 EEC cattle headage payments scheme which restricts participation in <Col N="557" /> the scheme to herdowners whose off-farm income did not exceed £4,175 in the tax year ended 5 April 1980.  I am, however, doubtful whether any modification of the off-farm income condition can be made without creating anomalies.  For example, if the off-farm income, net of tax, were to be taken it would tend to discriminate in favour of those farmers who have no dependants and are liable to tax and to penalise farmers with many dependants but no liability to tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</b><i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i> asked the Minister for Health the reason staff costs have risen from 41.4 to 69.3 per cent of the expenditure of his Department since 1977; how much of the difference is due to the reclassification of expenditure; and how and why such reclassification took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The percentage figures specified in the question relate to public <Col N="563" /> service pay and pension costs, as defined for budgetary purposes.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1980 certain pay costs in the health services such as the pay of personnel employed in voluntary hospitals and homes for the mentally handicapped, were not classified as &ldquo;public service pay&rdquo;.  It was decided, however, that since virtually all such pay costs are funded from the Exchequer it would be more appropriate to regard these pay costs as part of overall public service pay.  Reclassification accordingly was arranged commencing with the year 1980, and accounts for 19 percentage points of the difference between the percentages referred to in the question.</P>
      <P>The remainder of the difference arises from the fact that expenditure on pay has risen more rapidly than non-pay costs since 1977, due mainly to special pay awards for certain categories of health personnel and also because of increases in numbers employed in the health services, approximately 3,900.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
    <P>Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations, 1981,</P>
    <P>a copy of which was laid before the Dáil on the 20th day of February, 1981.</P>
    <P>In implementation of the announcement made by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement on 28 January 1981 these regulations suspend in full as from 1 February 1981 the bovine disease levies payable in respect of milk and bovine animals.  These levies amount to ½p per gallon of milk and £3 per bovine animal slaughtered or exported live and in a full year total about £10 million.  The suspension increases the prices payable to farmers for milk and cattle by these amounts and so affords relief to them in the income difficulties being experienced at present.</P>
    <P>State expenditure on the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis in the current year is estimated to come close to £26 million.  This is a very sizeable amount and can only be justified if it results in a substantial reduction in the level of disease as compared with 1980.  I am hoping that the present suspension of the levies will be an added stimulus to full farmer co-operation in our eradication programme. Such continued co-operation is vital if we are to achieve in the shortest possible time our goal of total eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis and so ensure continuance of our exports of livestock and livestock products in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of Deputy D'Arcy, our spokesman, who has left for Brussels, I am dealing with this motion on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion temporarily suspends the collection of the bovine diseases levy. Only two months ago we introduced a motion, supported by Deputy Bermingham, spokesman for the Labour Party, calling on the Minister to abolish among other things the diseases levy.  Led by the present Minister, the Fianna Fáil <Col N="621" /> Party voted those proposals down.  They voted against a motion which would have allowed fuller discussion on this in the form of a Bill.  The bovine diseases levy was introduced in 1979 when it was patently obvious to anyone studying agricultural trends that agriculture was already heading into a recession.  The Government persisted in introducing this levy against strong opposition from this side of the House.  The Government now see how wrong they were and are trying, before the general election, to backtrack on what they did.  It is clear from the announcement about this in the budget that this suspension is temporary.  The Government said that this question in common with the other concessions made in relation to rates would be reviewed at the end of this year.  This suggests that the Government intend to hold these items in suspension until after the general election in the hope that they might be elected, and then they would reimpose the levy.  If this is not their intention they would have suspended the levy for a longer period.  Anyone in the industry can see that the conditions existing in agriculture will not disappear in the next nine months but will continue for quite some time.  The Government statement that this measure is for one year suggests that their motives are insincere.</P>
    <P>When this was originally introduced I said that it was a wrong type of tax, a tax on production which discouraged further production.  Even if we are only getting rid of something which is highly objectionable in the first place, for one year, I must welcome the motion but I doubt the Government's sincerity in the matter. It is designed to overcome an immediate electoral prospect for the Government who have no intention of radically changing their ways on a permanent basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>We opposed these levies when they were first introduced. The then Minister, Deputy Gibbons, said all the things that were necessary for him to say in imposing this levy.  It was imposed as recently as 1979 and it must have been evident if any detailed examination had been done on the position of the agricultural community that it was <Col N="622" /> the wrong thing to do.  I welcome the withdrawal of the imposition but I find it hard to reconcile all the arguments that Fianna Fáil produced at that time with their present position.  That original levy was debated at length in the House and I debated it with the former Minister who said things that I do not want to repeat which led me to believe that he brought it in against his own better judgment.  It was a measure imposed on him by members of Fianna Fáil who did not see the agricultural position as clearly as he did. I am glad there has now been a conversion.</P>
      <P>It was unjust because it was not related to income.  The small farmer had to contribute to the levy the same as those farmers who had a lot of cattle.  It is necessary to help those in the agricultural industry now because it gives employment to about 45 per cent of the population. It is important to have a viable industry.  I do not believe that the Government are any different now from what they were in Deputy Gibbons' time.  The fact that after two years they come along and backtrack on this shows the level of examination and research that was done when the levy was first imposed.  This is the way the Government have been carrying on in general &mdash; covering up mistakes and doing the opposite to what they said they would do two years ago.  If I were a Minister on those benches I would be ashamed to come back and placidly contradict everything that was said on this issue.  I would be ashamed to do such an about turn and say there is now no justification for it.  The problems facing the industry were evident at that time and should have been more so to a Minister with the back-up of the Department and An Foras Talúntais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time we stated the problems and the prospects for agriculture and repeatedly asked the Government not to impose this levy.  Now the Government are saying they will do away with the levy on account of the bad state of agriculture. I am glad they now see the futility of imposing the levy and have been brought to that realisation by the stark facts of the state of agriculture.  It was wrong to introduce <Col N="623" /> the levy in the first instance.  It was not related to income and hit small farmers harder than big farmers.  I opposed it at the time.  Despite Fianna Fáil's late conversion to our point of view, I welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The motion which we are discussing, taken in conjunction with the Minister's budget speech, indicates that the Government propose rescinding the levies in respect of disease eradication for one year.  That is what the resolution means.  I know that the machinery adopted in the amendment of the regulations is to reduce the levy in respect of slaughtered animals to nil and reduce the levy on milk to nil.  However, one must bear in mind the budget speech when it was clearly stated that it was proposed to do this for one year.  The Minister's amendment of the regulations is wide enough to continue it indefinitely and I should like an assurance that this or a similar levy will not be re-imposed.  To the extent that it removes these levies for one year and indicates that the Government have had their sanity restored it is welcome.</P>
      <P>The greatest trouble with the agricultural industry for the last two or three years has been that farmers have lost confidence in the future of the industry. They are not prepared to spend money or to invest.  It is this kind of stop-go Government policy that has been the direct cause of this.  This is only one of many levies introduced by the Government since they came to office.  They introduced the 2 per cent levy, which was by far the most iniquitous, undesirable and foolish tax ever imposed.  It was only introduced when the Government started to wobble about it and in a few weeks they undertook to remove it.  The same thing can be said of the resource tax.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Surely I am entitled to adduce arguments by referring to other things.  If I am not, it means that all people coming into the House gets a pair of blinkers and looks straight ahead of them.  It would reduce intelligent argument to a farce.  I agree that if I were to spend half an hour talking about the resource tax the Chair would be right to say I was going far off the mark.</P>
      <P>Like this tax, the resource tax was a foolish and crazy tax that had no regard to the capacity of the farmer to pay.  It was introduced and is now being run away from, but not before farmers will be asked to pay £6 million in arrears.  We have the bovine levy for the eradication of disease.  Bovine disease is being eradicated, and rightly so in the national interest. The cost of doing so should be borne by the Exchequer and not by any one sector of the community.  That is why this levy should never have been introduced.</P>
      <P>Agriculture plays a very big part in our economy.  It would be crazy and very wrong not to take steps not to eradicate disease in the national herd.  Bovine disease is also being eradicated in the interests of human beings.  I always thought that it should be eradicated at the cost of the nation and not at the cost of any section of the nation.  The Government adopt this stop-go attitude in regard to farmer taxation and farming levies, and the agricultural sector do not know where they stand.  That crazy Government spent 1978, 1979 and 1980 in removing the agricultural relief grant and they drove the rates on agricultural land sky high. Now when they see the folly of their way, they scrap that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can any industry have any confidence <Col N="625" /> in a Government who do not appear to know where they are going from month to month in regard to agricultural policy, agricultural taxation and the financing of agricultural schemes?  In so far as this resolution removes these levies for 11 months, or whatever it is, I welcome it.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that that is the end of it, and that we will hear no more about this levy or this type of levy.  It is bad for agriculture.  It is bad for confidence in agriculture, and it is not good for the country.</P>

      <P>I want to thank Deputies opposite who welcomed this regulation.  There were not many specific comments which need a reply.  When these levies were introduced or imposed, farmers' incomes were in a much healthier state than they are at present.  Because of the difficulties in relation to farmers' incomes the Government have taken certain measures, this being one of them, to assist them. There have been arguments as to whether this is for one year only.  The Minister for Finance said and the Government mean that the matter will be reviewed at the end of the year in the light of the prevailing conditions.  I want to inform the House that, in the event of the Government deciding to reimpose such levies in future, it will be necessary to introduce legislation and have it approved here and in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am telling the Deputy what the position is.  I want to be quite clear and frank about it.  Legislation will be required.  We felt it necessary to do certain things and this is one in a package of measures which the Government have undertaken since last September to assist the agricultural community. This will give added confidence to the agricultural sector.  In the period when the levy was in operation, the progress made in disease eradication was phenomenal. <Col N="626" /> The incidence is almost three times less than it was in 1977.  That is tremendous progress.  All Deputies would like to see a continuation of that.  We must get these disease levels down.</P>
      <P>I replied to a question today about various impositions and 30-day tests.  It is important that we should recognise that some hardships are involved.  Not only is this in the national interest, but it is also in the interest of individual farmers to rid the country of these two terrible diseases. Notwithstanding the fact that the Exchequer will now bear the full cost of these measures, I hope the farmers &mdash; and I am sure they will &mdash; will continue to co-operate in the way they have done over the years, and continue to make progress in the eradication of these diseases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already traversed a variety of aspects of this section of the Bill.  I do not intend to become embroiled in repeating the arguments we made.  Essentially they related to three issues.  I will just mention them to refresh the Minister's memory about the issues <Col N="627" /> on which we were at loggerheads to some degree.  The definition of rape was a problem. Perhaps we can deal with that more fully on section 2.  The sticking point was the degree to which some types of sexual assault are allegedly at least as serious as the crime of rape itself but are not dealt with as such in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Secondly, there was the degree to which the Bill compounds and continues the distinction in relation to some categories of women and their right to take an action.  I refer to married women.  I tried to show some anomalies, contradictions and injustices which the Bill proposes to legislate into existence.  Thirdly, there was the question of the age of a defendant which is referred to and, in this regard, lines 20 and onwards are relevant.  I wondered why it was necessary to have any age in the Bill, and whether it would be desirable that a court should have the right under other statutes to adjudicate on what would be appropriate, taking into account the individual circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>There is another anomaly.  The age of criminal responsibility here, as we all know, is the lowest in Europe at seven years.  This Bill would seem to rule out the possibility of somebody under the age of 14 years being charged with rape which, I have no doubt in 99.9 per cent of cases, would be right and just.  There might be circumstances where that might not be appropriate, although I will admit they are hard to envisage.  It seems to me that each case should be looked at on its merits.  I wonder what the merit is in writing into law an age cut-off point in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he takes the view that the Bill deals with the issue I raised in relation to what has come to be known as marital rape.  He said it is very likely that this Bill would facilitate such a prosecution.  I should like him to confirm that for us.  I should also like him to refer to the other two points: the degree to which there is a relative weakness in respect of crimes of sexual assault, or abuse, which in the eyes of many people would be at least as serious as the repugnant crime of rape but for which <Col N="628" /> the offence would not be the same, or open to being the same and could he give us some rationale for introducing the age into this legislation?</P>

I just want to give the Minister an opportunity to confirm or otherwise the impression he gave to the House and outside the House last week to the effect that the Bill facilitates prosecution in cases of rape of married women.  When the Minister said it is likely that the Bill facilitates prosecutions in such cases, I assume he still thinks so. I thought there was a certain amount of doubt in the Minister's mind about it last week.  We did not deal at any great length with the question of age.  Indeed the Minister did not reply to points on that question. Qualms were expressed by these benches and Deputy Browne and I should like to have a comment from the Minister on it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a concern about this section which I will try to explain simply &mdash; I may be leaving myself open to a certain amount of misunderstanding in this matter.  This Bill is only about acts of sexual violation committed by a man on a woman.  However, there are institutions and places where acts of sexual brutality occur by one man on another man.  It is known that this has happened in places of penal servitude and so on. The meaning of &ldquo;rape&rdquo; in the Bill is strictly in relation to the narrow definition of the word, an act of sexual intercourse, an act of penetration of the vagina by the penis.  I contend it is time to look again at the fundamental definition of &ldquo;rape&rdquo; in the Bill.  I submit it would be best if the definition were not, shall we say, sexist.</P>
      <P>There have been acts not only in places of penal servitude but in other situations in which people have taken advantage of others younger or physically weaker which could reasonably be referred to as instances of rape.  I wonder, therefore, if the Minister would consider in relation to the first lines of the section revising or rewording the definition to allow for a situation in which the crime of rape is not merely a crime by a man against a woman but also by a stronger man or a group of men on another male who is weaker or subordinate.  Such acts do not seem to be covered in this Bill.  I admit they may be covered in other legislation in relation to indecent assault, crimes of buggery or other types of sexual crimes.  I have a certain doubt about a Bill which purports to interpret this crime as being merely one which can be committed by one sex on another.  The crime, unfortunately, perversely and sadly, is committed sometimes by males on other males and these merit the definition of &ldquo;rape&rdquo;.  Therefore we should not only restrict the term &ldquo;rape&rdquo; to the traditional notion.  I suggest there is need for a wider definition of &ldquo;rape&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Bill before us deals with rape.  The other matters the Deputy has raised, certain acts that can occur between males, adult or minor, and even between consenting males, are dealt with adequately in other legislation.  It would not be appropriate or proper that there should be provision for them in this Bill, having regard to the fact that we are dealing specifically with rape as we have known it in the common law.  We are proposing to give it a statutory definition here.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) (b) states:</P>
      <P>at that time he knows that she does not consent to the intercourse or he is reckless as to whether she does or does not consent to it,</P>
      <P>I should like some elaboration on this. The question of consent is an extraordinarily difficult area and I am not satisfied the Bill is clear.  It could be open to some degree of misinterpretation or distortion. The section states that a man commits rape if at that time he knows she does not consent to the intercourse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is fairly clear, but how can it be proved?  It posits some kind of apprehension of a person's state of mind although obviously there could be a rebuttal of the man's advances.  However, there are circumstances where through fear, blackmail or some kind of moral pressure the question of consent and the ease in ascertaining that a person was opposed to the <Col N="632" /> act no longer exists.  If a woman does not physically resist, has she consented?  I would say she has not.  She might not resist physically because she would fear not just rape but also a bad beating.  The Bill is unclear on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that a man commits rape if he is reckless as to whether a woman does or does not consent.  I have certain anxieties in this matter because we must be just on both sides.  I should like the Ministrer to elaborate on what is meant by recklessness.  Does it mean the man is to define the state of mind of the woman in a way that is beyond dispute? The phrasing in the Bill is loose and it leaves room for charges and counter-charges as to whether there was consent. A man could say that the woman did not physically resist, that there was no suggestion of rebuttal or opposition, that she participated willingly in the act and that she was now trying to disown the act because it had become public or for some other reason.  I should like to know the thinking behind the phrase used in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>If the man believes the woman consented he would seek to show he had reasonable grounds for such belief and that his belief was not something that was established recklessly.  The other point is that if a woman were forced the question of consent not being forthcoming would be automatically evident.  It is a matter for the jury to assess whether consent was given or not given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise this is a very difficult area.  I am worried about the person who is open to this charge because I realise the man would have great difficulty in proving consent in some circumstances. On Second Stage we discussed some of the myths attaching to the crime of rape.  For example, we discovered that the majority of crimes of rape were not committed by people unknown to each other, that the majority of the crimes were among people who were at least on acquaintanceship terms and in some cases were friends.   leaving open to confusion or  the question of consent, I wonder if  may be some <Col N="633" /> injustices?  &ldquo;Reckless&rdquo; is an interesting word; it implies a kind of cavalier approach to finding out if a person wanted sexual intercourse.  I find it difficult to see how a person could prove or disprove that.  I am anxious to ensure that the Bill will be as tightly worded as possible so that there will not be an injustice on either side.</P>
      <P>We know that in the majority of cases the assault takes place either in the home of the assailant or of the person being attacked or in some other location acceptable to both parties.  We know that in most cases rape is not a crime of a sudden sexual urge of some kind, that usually it is deliberately and carefully planned.  In such circumstances, where there is what we might call a relationship of some kind between the parties, does the Minister consider that the degree to which consent is to be proved leaves open the door to an injustice being done?  If a woman says that she did not consent, I do not see how a man could prove otherwise, and <i>vice versa.</i> Perhaps the wording of this section could be tightened up before Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The presence or absence of reasonable grounds for such a belief is a matter for the jury.  A man could not genuinely believe a woman was consenting if he was recklessly indifferent about whether or not she was consenting.  If a man honestly held that belief, he was not guilty and the jury would have to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for such a belief.  I do not think the Deputy need have any worry about what is proposed in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to read from the report of the Special Advisory Committee on Sexual Offences submitted to the British Government in 1975.  On the question of consent in rape there was the following comment in paragraph 20:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until the second half of the nineteenth century, the courts seem to have had no problems about what amounted to consent.  If a woman was made by the use of force to have sexual intercourse, <Col N="634" /> or submitted in fear under a threat of force, she was adjudged to have been raped.  She had not consented to the intercourse.  This is still the law and, in our opinion should continue to be the law.  In the ordinary case of rape there has been force or the threat of force.  Where sexual intercourse is procured by fraud, there is under section 3 of the Act of 1956 a special offence which we propose should continue.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 22 there is the following comment:</P>
    <P>A well known and much used textbook on the criminal law &mdash; that is a book by Smith and Hogan &mdash;is very critical of this situation.  If a woman knows what is happening to her and that is penile penetration, it is not easy to understand why the law should distinguish a mistake as to the purpose of the penetration from a mistake as to the identity of the man doing the penetrating, or should distinguish between the woman who believes she is having intercourse with her husband and the woman who believes the other party is her lover.  It is arguable that all these cases should amount to rape, or none. In all these cases the woman's consent has been obtained by statements or conduct intended to deceive.  This is what the law regards as fraud, which can take many forms.  The question arises why in rape one form of fraud should provide a defence and others not.  The two kinds of fraud illustrated by such cases as Flattery and Barrow are not the only ones.  Take, for example, the case of a homeless young woman with a child who is told untruthfully by a housing official of a local authority that he will provide her with accommodation if she will have sexual intercourse with him.  In her desperation she agrees and then finds out that the man had no authority to provide her with accommodation.  This is not rape under the present law; but it is arguable that it should be.  The difficulty lies in knowing where to draw the line.  Few would consider that a young woman had been raped if she <Col N="635" /> consented to sexual intercourse because she believed her seducer when he told her untruthfully that he owned a valuable piece of jewellery which he would give her the next day.</P>
    <P>It is not quite as simple as the Minister puts across.  In paragraph 24 the following point is made:</P>
    <P>A majority of us are of the opinion that the offence of rape should not apply when a woman has knowingly consented to the defendant putting his penis into her vagina.  Mistake as to his identity, whether as a husband or otherwise, or as to the purpose for which the penetration has been made should be irrelevant.  Nor should the use of threats or other intimidation short of threats of force amount to rape.  Most of us are of the opinion that the distinction drawn in the cases cannot bear the weight they have been made to carry....</P>
    <P>What is the situation of a defendant and a person who alleges that she has been raped, where in fact consent of some kind was obtained although the reasons for the consent being obtained may have been completely fraudulent, that is where the consent was given under duress?  The Bill does not seem to me to refer comprehensively to that possibility.  Is that consent?  Is it consent where there is a case of a woman who for one reason or another has been seduced into believing that her co-operation is in her best interest? this section is vague in that respect. I believe we will get cases where it will be impossible to prove one way or the other. If that is the case it is not good law.  I deliberately refrained from tabling an amendment to the Bill because of the genuine difficulty which exists.  There certainly is a difficulty and I am not satisfied that the Bill meets it.  In regard to section 2 (1) (b), what is the Minister's view of the situation where that woman, having been gulled into co-operating, clearly gives her consent, although under duress?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no intention to <Col N="636" /> change the law in this regard.  The law is the same as the British law and it takes into account the Morgan case.  Furthermore, where a woman had intercourse under duress, clearly consent would not be forthcoming there.  The absence of reasonable grounds for the belief by the man that consent was forthcoming would be a matter for the jury and might be evidence to suggest that the consent was not forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I will enter my uneasiness about the matter.  It is not as satisfactory and as explicit as I would like it but time will tell.  The purpose of sub-section (2) is that the jury in a rape case have to take into account that it is a defence of the crime if the accused argues that he did not believe the woman to be opposed to the alleged rape and that he believed her to be consenting.  It is also stated that it is not necessary for the man to have reasonable grounds for believing her to have consented but that such a belief is a matter for the jury to take into account in considering if a man did believe she consented. It is not necessary, according to my interpretation of the section, for the man to have reasonable grounds for believing her to have consented.  That is something for the jury to take into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about that because it might in some circumstances leave too open a situation where the co-operation and full knowledge of the woman involved was being taken for granted and where the circumstances of the trial were the ones that predominated.  It could be argued that, basically, it is a subjective test of the motives and actions of the accused whereas the woman who is surely the victim in the case is obliged to prove by forensic evidence and so on and beyond reasonable doubt that she did not consent to being raped.  The onus of proof is put on the victim which is rather novel and is not a principle to be widely embraced.  This clause could be used by a defendant as a defence against a crime even after it has been conclusively proved that he raped a woman against her will. Where there has been clear, incontrovertible evidence, satisfactory to any reasonable <Col N="637" /> objective observer that this man had raped a woman against her will, he could still enter a defence that it was not necessary for him to have reasonable grounds for believing her to have consented. Are there grounds for amending the section and tightening it up to ensure that the man in the case of an act of such fundamental, social and other importance, should have an obligation on him to insist that that consent be explicit and clear rather than have a situation where somebody who is a rapist could get off because it is not necessary for him to have had that reasonable belief according to the section?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular section is not novel and it does not propose to change the law in this matter at all.  As I already said, the presence or absence of reasonable grounds is a matter for the jury.  The absence of reasonable grounds might be evidence of the fact that consent was not forthcoming.  There is nothing new or novel about the particular subsection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I concede the Minister's point in relation to the novelty of it.  I am more concerned about the content, which is to try to get the right thing done.  There are many things in our present law which are not novel but which should be changed.  I am only suggesting that we have a section wherein somebody who has been conclusively, on the basis of the available evidence, shown to be a rapist, can appeal to the jury and could seek a direction from the presiding judge, that under this section he did not have to take reasonable precautions to ensure that the woman's consent was forthcoming.  That is a let-out in a situation where, in the past, the victim, who is the woman, has been the person who suffered most even in the context of the trial.  I am only <Col N="638" /> asking to see if we can tighten this up a little bit so that it is mandatory and obligatory for somebody engaging in this act to insist on having ascertained that his belief of her consent is well grounded.  I am asking the Minister if he will consider this, which is a reasonable objection and a point which a lawyer would be quick to pick up in his defence of the accused person.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister try to prise open his clam-like mind to the possibility that something which some of us on this side of the House might have to say would actually be worthy of some consideration between now and Report Stage, because we are, like the Minister, concerned about justice in this respect? The Minister could give us a little more co-operation.</P>
      <P>Section 3 restricts the right of an accused person to cross-examine the complainant or any other witness.  It restricts the right of an accused person at the trial for the rape offence to cross-examine the complainant or any other witness or to adduce evidence about sexual experience of the complainant with any person other than himself.  It provides for the accused seeking an application from the judge for leave to cross-examine on such matters and this decision to be made in the absence of the jury.  According to the section it is up to the judge to decide if he will consider such evidence essential in fairness to the offender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there a case here where it could be argued that a woman's past sexual history with men other than the accused is never relevant, or should never be relevant, no <Col N="639" /> more than the relationships or activities or, indeed, her list of convictions &mdash; if she was in that category &mdash; are not relevant? Ideally, there should not be any machinery in existence to permit the inclusion of a history of relations in the context of the court hearing.  Cross-examination of the complainant should relate to the parameters of the crime.  To have a section which could be used for winkling out all the old ghosts of the past, bringing out the skeletons in the cupboard which I am sure very few of us are completely without, is wrong because it has an intimidatory effect.</P>
    <P>I can envisage somebody who would wish to take a case being told by nods and winks that there were a couple of unsavoury incidents in the background which could be the subject of an appeal to the judge, under the terms of the Bill. That person could be told that if the appeal to the judge was granted the outcome would be extremely damaging to her character.  Is it not reasonable that all that should be relevant are the circumstances of the crime and those reasonably related immediately to the crime rather than a person's history which could go back for years and could be designed to show that the complainant was of a morally weak character and was prone to engage in acts of sexual licence?  The idea would be to show that the defendant in the case was probably involved in some other act other than the act of rape.  Why does the Bill allow for a woman's sexual history, or lack of it, to be paraded through the courtrooms when for any other crime it would be extremely unlikely that such evidence would be entertained?  In most cases there is no machinery for its insinuation into the case.</P>
    <P>I have two reasons for objecting to this. It is somewhat unjust in the circumstances of the crime and, secondly, we should consider the effect and potential of that mechanism of introducing matter of a damaging or embarrassing nature.  The substance of that mechanism would be likely to intimidate a person from taking a case and might lead to under-reporting of this crime even though it is widely <Col N="640" /> alleged that it is the most unreported crime of all.  What is the reason for including this provision?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The groups who had consultations with me on the provisions of this Bill did not ask for total exclusion. The reason this provision is included is to ensure, in certain circumstances, that the accused is protected and not unfairly treated by the court.  In certain circumstances, with the consent of the judge after he has heard the application in the absence of the jury, this provision can be availed of.  There are certain circumstances in which previous sexual experience is relevant.  For instance, in the case of a woman who is not necessarily a prostitute but is in the habit of frequenting licensed premises or places of ill repute to pick up men, to subsequently have intercourse with them and then demand money, the evidence might be relevant for the purpose of proving consent.  It would be part of the case for the accused that what had occurred in such a case was similar to what had occurred in the cases of other men and that because he had refused to give her money the charge of rape followed. It would be a matter for the judge to decide on the relevance of the evidence in all cases.  The judge will only allow such evidence if he is satisfied that to exclude it would not provide justice or fair play in the hearing of the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal is an improvement and that is to be welcomed. Up to now a rape trial, frankly, has been more of a field-day for the prurient rather than a question of trying to obtain justice. Usually what happened up to now was that the person victimised in the rape case finished up most victimised of all when the trial concluded.  The provision in the Bill is an advance but because of the experience in this area I wonder if there is a need for the mechanism.  The Minister has said that if there had been previous incidents where there was a degree of extortion or consentual sexual relations with subsequent extortion of money it could be argued that that was the reason why the case at issue was not rape. There is a thin line there where one <Col N="641" /> begins to say a complainant is of that nature.  It is a difficulty which troubles me a lot in a number of areas.  There is no reason to assume that a prostitute is more open to being raped than anybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my reading of it, that one argues that the sexual history related primarily to people of easy virtue &mdash; or whatever the quaint expression was &mdash; and for some reason prostitutes were more likely to be raped.  I am not an expert in this area but I imagine the contrary is true, for obvious reasons.  Does the Minister feel it is essential to have in the Bill a mechanism whereby those largely extraneous matters, particularly relating to a person's sexual history, can be dragged into court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like the view to go abroad that these matters can be dragged into court simply.  I appreciate the Deputy's remarks to the effect that this represents a significant improvement. It is a necessary and desirable improvement because the position that obtains causes many problems for the victim.  In the past certainly this caused many problems for the victim and indeed, on many occasions, prevented the reporting of rape to the Garda.  In this situation what we are doing is to provide the mechanism whereby the judge assesses the relevance or not of the particular previous history of a woman, a woman alleged to be the victim.  He does so and must be satisfied, having examined the application in the absence of the jury, that the exclusion of that evidence would be unjust or unfair to the accused.  The <Col N="642" /> proposed section would be inadequate if there was not a provision for that type of evidence to be forthcoming in certain circumstances and for the fair play to which the accused would be entitled to be provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We would be very concerned that the accused would have an opportunity as well.  But the research available, admittedly of a rather scanty nature, indicated that probably no more than 4 per cent of people who are victims of the crime of rape have been engaged in anything that one could call any kind of precipitate behaviour or behaviour which would contribute to the crime.  I wonder why there has to be this dispossition to facilitate the exploration of a person's history at all.  For example, there is a figure available to us from the American Government's Federal Commission on Crimes of Violence which reports that in the American case 4 per cent only of reported rapes involved any precipitate behaviour.  Of course that is a very difficult figure to prove and the American experience may not be the case here.  I could see the justification for it if, for example, there was conclusive evidence that in a substantial number of rape cases the behaviour, disposition, or some manner of the activities of the woman was a major or contributory factor, but the evidence is to the contrary.  Therefore, it seems that this is more likely to be an intimidatory factor against woman taking a case than anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do stress, as the Minister said, that the situation is better than it was, that at least the appeal has to be heard by the judge, has to be heard in private, and that he may decide that that exploration of her history should not form part of the case.  I have voiced on previous occasions some concern.  Shall I put it like this? Perhaps there are cases in which we are asking some of the judges to do too much for us.  Here is a case in point where we are thrusting another burden on the Judiciary, a very difficult and delicate chore.  I do not think we are going to give them any guidelines.  We are simply saying to the judge: &ldquo;You decide on the basis of what is in front of you whether <Col N="643" /> or not it is relevant.&rdquo;  What process, if any, will there be of communicating to the Judiciary the kind of guidelines or criteria on which they should make their assessment, or will that be a matter completely for themselves?  Or does the Minister envisage the problem here as being regional, or involving other vagaries, as we call them, in the manner in which the Act might be interpretated?  As we are all aware, there are sometimes fairly significant difficulties in interpretation in law. I would not like to see a pattern emerging in respect of any area of the country, any set of judges, or any Member of the Judiciary.  Are we being fair to the judges here?  Are we asking them to do too much without being more explicit as to what is meant, if the Minister thinks the mechanism essential?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, we must maintain a balance in this regard by protecting the complainant on the one hand and ensuring a fair trial for the accused on the other.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said we may be asking too much of the judge, by requiring him to decide on the question of the relevance or otherwise of particular evidence which would be raised with him, first of all by way of application in the absence of the jury.  In every court the judge, on a daily basis, has the responsibility of deciding whether or not something is admissible. Therefore what is proposed would not constitute any departure from what is established practice and I do not intend to change it in this Bill.</P>

      <P>This is the section that provides that in a preliminary examination in the District Court of a charge of rape the same restrictions on the right of <Col N="645" /> cross-examination and adducing evidence as to any sexual experience of the complainant with a person other than the accused shall apply.</P>
      <P>I want to say here again that in general we are asking in this section that a district justice will give leave only if he is satisfied that if the examination were a trial the judge would be likely to give leave.  In general I would think that it might be timely to endeavour to help our Judiciary in certain respects.  Increasingly we are asking them to undertake a major burden of legislation.  Any kind of discussion on the matter would not be appropriate here.  But here is another case of a very sensitive nature in which we are putting another burden on judges, similar to that imposed in other sections.  Of course the section says that the district justice will give leave only if he is satisfied that if the examination were a trial the judge would be likely to give leave.  This means that once again we are asking the Judiciary to make distinctions and judgements &mdash; which of course are the functions of a judge &mdash; the criteria for which are very often reluctantly communicated from a Government.  I am saying that there is perhaps growing evidence that we should try to assist the Judiciary in educating themselves, on occasion, as to what is legal, what is the state of present law and so on.  I make that point in passing, that we should be aware that we are increasing the burden on judges.  We have done that in a number of very major cases recently, including major constitutional cases, when in some instances the job of Government was almost taken on by Members of the Judiciary &mdash; and I am glad they are doing it &mdash; but I am contending that we should not increasingly foist burdens on them without realising their implications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is in certain respects quite important and significant in so far as it provides for the public to be excluded from the court during the hearing of an application under sections 3, 4 and 5, for leave to cross examine and should, in my view, not go without comment. <Col N="647" /> The motivation for it is a good one. It is presumably to try to minimise the amount of trauma and detrimental effects particularly for the plaintiff.  But we could just spend a moment or two looking at it. The section itself, even though it does not continue the practice whereby all and sundry were entitled to be there, nevertheless does cut across a fairly fundamental principle, the principle of the open court, access by the public and so on.</P>
      <P>I would like to think that we could at some stage in our development as a society grow up adequately to a situation where we did not have to have certain cases held <i>in camera,</i> where the reasons that the public are presently excluded would no longer be relevant, the reason of course being that the salacious interests of some members of the public in these matters is likely to redound to the disadvantage of the parties involved. Apart from hoping for a change in human nature, one cannot say much about that. There have been those who expressed the view that they would like to see a situation where certain cases could actually be held <i>in camera</i> on application by the victim of the crime of rape or indeed by the defendant.  Some family law cases are so held.  I wonder if there are circumstances where the arguments which could be put forward might, in the Minister's view, be worthy of being considered for that kind of treatment.</P>
      <P>I remember a case of a professional person who was accused of rape.  Those who know him, and indeed the court at that particular time, considered him and found him completely innocent.  The fact is, though, that the man is destroyed in his family, in his profession and is now practicing in some far off country.  There are therefore areas where justice may be done in a technical sense or the law is carried out, but where justice is not done in truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister would consider that there might be cases which should be dealt with by a measure going a little bit beyond what is in this section and which would actually allow, at the discretion of the judge or judges, that the case be held <i>in camera</i> in order to prevent major psychological <Col N="648" /> damage or other damage to either the parties involved or those closely related to them.  It is sad that we should have to consider that kind of suggestion but that is the way the world is at present.  Ideally I would prefer that there would be no restrictions in the courts but there are and they are there for good reasons.  Does the Minister think there is any merit in that request?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the exclusion of the public would only occur where and when the application is being made, and of course in subsection (1) there is a provision for the rights of parents, relatives and friends to remain on in certain circumstances.  The illustration that the Deputy gave of somebody professionally involved and going through a trial where he is charged with rape and being subsequently acquitted is dealt with by the provision for anonymity in this Bill.  That is one very important feature of the Bill, and I am delighted to be able to tell the House today that under the proposed legislation a person, if acquitted, will not have his name made public and all aspects relating to the relevance and inclusion of certain evidence will be raised by way of application to the judge with everybody excluded, except in certain situations the people specified.  So there is adequate protection in this regard.</P>

      <P>With regard to line 24 in section 6 (2) where the point is made that the section is without prejudice to the right of a parent, relative or friend of the complainant or, where the accused is a person under 21 years of age, the accused to remain in court, does the Minister think there is a case to be made for perhaps writing in the need to have the consent of the accused in these circumstances? Would the Minister consider that the accused might have a preference one way or the other?  It seems to be reasonable that a person, say, over 18 years of age and under 21, might if they so wished be able to dictate whether or not their parents or relatives or friends, in some circumstances at least, might or might not be in court.  It seems reasonable that they should at least be asked their view on it. Does that come into the reckoning at all?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section that provides that, once a person is charged with a rape offence, no matter likely to lead members of the public to identify a woman as a complainant may be published in a written publication available to the public or broadcast except as authorised by direction under this section. That, in a sense, is welcome.  The section seeks to try to get rid of one of the main areas of contention in these cases, which was that the woman &mdash; already victimised and brutalised by this act &mdash; found that she had to be further scandalised, as it were, particularly in relatively less populated areas and had to suffer a certain amount of curiosity or derision by virtue of the fact that everybody knew that she was the woman who took the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section will ensure that that can no longer occur.  That is welcome, because what is more important than law in these cases is the justice of it all.  I wonder if the Minister would nevertheless comment to this extent: the section deals with the anonymity of the complainant and we are told that none of the matters which might be likely to lead a person to identify a person should be broadcast.  Is it a little too loosely drafted?  Again we are back to the area of the discretion of the judge. Subsection (4) provides for a case where the trial judge is satisfied that the effect of the prohibition under the section is to impose a substantial and unreasonable restriction on the reporting of the trial <Col N="650" /> and that it is in the public interest to remove or relax the restriction.  The explanatory memorandum makes the case that, for example, the identity of the complainant may be public knowledge owing to the circumstances surrounding the offence or the subsequent investigations of it, in which case there would be no point in requiring the press to pretend to conceal her identity.  Presumably other circumstances are envisaged as well, though they are not spelled out there. Once again I am very worried lest there might be any suggestion in the legislation that would intimidate or frighten off women who might want to take an action.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (4) mentions &ldquo;a substantial and reasonable restriction&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;restriction&rdquo; is interesting because you either restrict or you do not restrict.  The restriction is undoubtedly substantial.  It is not a question really of how substantial it is.  It is either yes or no, either you allow publication or you do not.  Therefore, obviously it is substantial in all cases.  If it is insubstantial or partially substantial then it is pointless.  It has to be all or nothing.  You either restrict or you do not, and the unreasonableness of it is probably more to the point.  How reasonable something is, of course, is a subjective matter.  The point being put forward is that somehow if the name had already been noised about or had leaked out or slipped out or if it was the name of somebody in high society, there would be no point in concealment, I wonder if we are running into a grey area here.  In cases somewhat lower down the scale, for example taking a country town where it was generally assumed locally that X was the person involved, where it had been talked about locally, where it might even have been published in a local paper or magazine, is that grounds for removing the restriction?  What degree of publication is necessary to make it unreasonable to restrict?</P>
    <P>Also the point about being in the public interest is of concern in that it needs to be spelled out a little and I would like the Minister to do that.  That seems to be fairly vague and nebulous, not adequately defined in the Bill.  Conversely, maybe we should argue that if the woman <Col N="651" /> so wishes &mdash; though I cannot imagine circumstances where she might be likely to do so &mdash; she should have the right to have the restriction removed.  After all, she is ultimately the person who suffers or the beneficiary, one or the other.  It is possible, therefore, that the woman can if she wishes have this restriction removed?  It seems to me that she can by appealing to the judge or to her counsel, but I would like that confirmed.  The latter point could be important if, for example, a woman wanted to make public the inadequacies of the legal and investigative procedures and the red tape surrounding the treatment of complainants. It seems that at the moment under this Bill only the judge has the right to remove the restriction on anonymity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The section states that only in a case of public interest should the restriction be relaxed or removed and there may be situation where in the public interest it might be necessary to do that. I am satisfied that such situations would be very rare.  For example, if the complainant was the daughter of the accused you could have a situation where&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>She has not that right and the reason for her not having that right is a very good one.  In all of the public debates leading up to the introduction of this Bill one of the main points of discussion was the fact that the anonymity of the complainant was not adequately protected at all in the existing laws.  Consequently, the Bill includes that very important change.  To have a situation provided for where an individual woman could make known her identity and subsequently appear in the public media might just do the reverse of what we have been trying to do in this Bill by frightening women or creating the erroneous belief that this was the practice. For that reason it is desirable that it be excluded and that it be known to all the public, particularly any unfortunate individual who is the victim of such a horrific crime, that the victim has absolute protection where anonymity is concerned and that there is no likelihood of her name appearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a strong argument in what the Minister is saying, but I do not accept that the absolute guarantee of anonymity that the complainant requires is done an injury by considering the possibility that the name of a person who has been raped &mdash; subject to an appeal to the courts, presumably, not off the top of her head for very good reasons &mdash; could be broadcast if she wished it. That would not do the principle of anonymity any great injury.  Obviously it could be made clear that the woman feels that the safeguard which the Bill extends to her is not necessary in her case.  Ideally she should be the judge of it herself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the purpose of this section is, as I believe, to protect people, that is fine and if the protection is offered and accepted, as it would be in the majority of cases, that is to the good, but where the protection of the woman in her judgment warranted her asserting for example, the inadequacies in connection with her case, it would seem to be reasonable that she <Col N="653" /> should have her name noised abroad.  I do not think that there will be many cases of that nature, but one could envisage a situation where a woman would say, &ldquo;In the circumstances I think I am entitled at least to apply to a judge for leave to have this matter published and I believe that is in my best interests&rdquo;.  Otherwise we are tying a person hand and foot against that person's will.  The section deals with protecting people and in the majority of cases they would agree with that but there could be exceptions, not off the top of the person's head but on the person's appeal to the judge.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will agree that much of what he has said does not deal with any of the changes sought in this proposed legislation.  I might also state that we have been very concerned in the preparation of this Bill to secure absolutely the anonymity of the complainant for the very reasons that the Deputy so well appreciates and knows. Anything that would put at risk the situation that is proposed would, I am satisfied, be likely to do the reverse, to some degree, and totally in some instances.  As I have already said, it might create an erroneous belief about the actual position as to the protection which is provided in the Bill.  Furthermore, if that right were to exist for an individual woman, I can envisage circumstances where pressure could and would be applied to other women to make known their names.  If they refused to reveal their identities you might have the accusation levelled elsewhere that they did so because they had something to hide.  I genuinely believe it would not be in the best interest of what we are trying to achieve and the spirit of the law as we wish to see it enacted.  For that reason, I do not propose to make any changes in that regard in this section.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister says.  I think he is right.  I have some minor reservations but I think the weight of argument is in his favour.  I have a query about subsection (9) of the section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A direction in pursuance of this section does not affect the operation of <Col N="654" /> subsection (1) at any time before the direction is given.</P>
    <P>That seems to imply, according to the explanatory memorandum, that any liability which has been incurred by reason of the disclosure of information in contravention of subsection (1) will not be affected, if disclosure of the information is later permitted by a direction under subsection (2).  I want to confirm that subsequent approval of the disclosure would not mitigate the offence committed earlier on.  Does that mean that the subsequent approval of a disclosure would not affect the responsibility of the person or the offence would not affect the gravity of the offence if it had been committed prior to the disclosure being facilitated?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>If the identity were revealed before restrictions were lifted, liability would not be subsequently affected if the restriction was subsequently lifted.

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> This is a drafting amendment relating to the description of the classes of persons who convene courts-martial, under sections 7 and 8.  A person to be tried in an ordinary criminal court for a rape offence may apply in advance of the trial to a justice of the district court to remove the ban on the disclosure of his identity or to a judge of the High Court or Circuit Court to remove or relax the ban on disclosure of the identity of the complainant or of the co-accused.  In the case of a court martial, section 9 (2) (a) in its present form adapts these provisions so that the application is to be made to the convening officer, that is to say the officer who is authorised to convene or has convened the court-martial or his successor in office.  The Minister for Defence has advised me that the section is technically incorrect in referring to the person who convenes a court-martial as an &ldquo;officer&rdquo;, because under section 187 of the Army Act 1954 the Minister for Defence, as well as certain officers, is authorised to convene a court-martial.  That section uses the expression &ldquo;convening authority&rdquo; to cover the person so authorised and the amendment proposes, accordingly, to use this expression in the Bill. The use of this expression makes it unnecessary to refer separately to the person who is authorised to convene the court-martial, to the person who has done so and to his successor, because, owing to the structure of the Defence Act and the Rules of Procedure (Defence Forces) 1954, which provide for the procedure in relation to courts-martial, the expression &ldquo;convening authority&rdquo; will serve to indicate the appropriate person to whom the accused is to apply in every case that can arise.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister <Col N="656" /> to agree with my proposal for a significant amendment to section 10.  This section increases the maximum penalty on conviction on indictment for indecent assault on a female, which at present is two years imprisonment on a first conviction and five years on a second or any subsequent conviction, to 10 years.  I welcome the fact that the section proposes to increase the maximum penalty at least in line with the same assault on a man, which was one of these discriminations, which those of us who were concerned about getting rid of the inequalities in relation to law which adversely affected women perhaps did not refer to.  This is a case where the improvement which has been proposed is of some substance.  I am assuming for the purposes of this brief discussion that imprisonment is the right answer to crimes of indecent assault.  It is not an assumption which has been adequately borne out but we will not get into that now.</P>
      <P>However, I feel very strongly that there are certain acts of sexual violation and abuse, the gravity and repugnance of which are so profoundly unacceptable and so ugly in their nature, that they are as serious as the crime of rape.  I cannot, therefore, understand why somebody involved in this violation, this perversity, finds himself relatively better off under the law than somebody who is charged with rape.  The offence of indecent assault should be looked at again in relation to the liability for imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find myself a little unhappy talking like this but, for the purpose of consistency, I cannot understand why there should be this distinction in the terms of imprisonment liable to be given for crimes which in all their natures, in their full ugliness, are equally unacceptable and repugnant.  May be we should be talking of an offence of aggravated indecent assault or grievous indecent assault, because under present law there are circumstances under which someone having a passing or flippant sexual encounter, perhaps someone kissing a person against their will, could be charged with indecent assault.  Nobody suggests that the penalty for that should be the same as for rape. It appears that an individual who had <Col N="657" /> committed sexual assault and who was impotent, for example, or simply was not interested because of his particular fetish or perversity in what might be called traditional sexual intercourse, could apparently indulge himself in every kind of ugly and sordid sexual abuses and find that in the eyes of the law he was relatively better treated than somebody who had committed the crime of rape but without its attendant brutalities and ugliness.</P>
    <P>What I am arguing for is consistency. If the Minister does not agree &mdash; and there is some strength in his point of view &mdash; that the definition of rape should not be extended, would he then consider increasing the punishment for indecent assault in some cases to penalities which are consistent with the crime of rape?  I am sure the Minister will agree that there have been cases of crimes so repugnant in this area that some crimes of rape cannot be compared with them.  I do not understand the logic of the difference in penalties in such circumstances.  If prison sentences are the right response at all in these cases, there should be some consistency. Would the Minister consider reviewing the provision for a term of imprisonment not exceeding ten years?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal in section 10 was something that I said I would consider on foot of a demand from Deputy Keating in relation to increasing the penalty.  Ten years' imprisonment is a very substantial penalty.  Under the present operation of the system, life imprisonment is usually of seven or eight years' duration.  As a penalty, ten years is substantially greater than that though that would be reducible also in accordance with the usual procedures.  This increase in the penalty from two years to ten years is an enormous increase.  In Britain the penalty for indecent assault is two years but the proposal there is to increase that to five years.  I considered the matter on foot of a commitment given on Second Stage to Deputy Keating and I am satisfied that it would be neither desirable nor necessary to increase the penalty further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a situation that, on the one <Col N="658" /> hand, indecent assaults may be equally horrific or more horrific than the crime of rape itself; but, on the other hand, depending on a number of factors and on the circumstances that would be applicable in individual situations, we must be conscious also of the fact that indecent assault can be of a very minor nature.  I am not suggesting in any way that this crime should be regarded lightly because of its not being as horrific in degree as some other cases of this type.  All such assaults, minor or otherwise, are serious and must be taken seriously.  However, there is a rather wide scope within the area of penalty for the courts to use their discretion in imposing a penalty and ten years is the maximum.</P>
    <P>In the case of rape it might be interesting for the House to know that, while life sentence is the maximum penalty, the courts have been imposing the following penalties: in the case of one offender, 12 years; for four others, ten years; for eight others, eight years; for three others, seven years; for six others, five years; for one other, four years; for two others, three years and for another, two years.  It can be seen, then, that the great majority of those sentenced for rape, for which the maximum penalty is life, received sentences of between five and ten years. Having considered the question of the desirability of increasing further the proposed sentence of ten years for indecent assault, I am satisfied that no such increase is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not disagree fundamentally with what the Minister says but there is an element of inconsistency in respect of sentencing.  There is an interesting twist to the Minister's reply in that on the one hand it would be best on reflection not to increase the penalty for indecent assault &mdash; presumably to life &mdash; but on the other hand a life sentence turns out to be in effect less than the maximum sentence now proposed for the crime of indecent assault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong to think that that is the situation.  The maximum sentence for rape is life imprisonment <Col N="659" /> but the operation of such a sentence is such that it is reducible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>In the same way, presumably, the ten years' sentence proposed for indecent assault could turn out to be five or six years for the same reasons that would be applicable in the case of a life sentence.  Therefore, it would not be a fair comparison to say that a ten year maximum sentence for indecent assault and a sentence of life for rape are necessarily of the same duration from the point of view of the time a prisoner would spend in prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  When talking about these sentences both the Minister and I are inclined to throw out these references to sentences but we must remind ourselves that a sentence of ten years is very severe.  While many of us might have reservations about whether imprisonment is the right response at all to crimes of a sexual deviation, I would have thought that since there are crimes that are outside the category of indecent assault but which are perhaps more horrific than the crime of rape, if that is conceivable, consistency might be appropriate and that we would provide for the same sentencing to apply in both cases sentencing which would allow for greater or lesser degrees of punishment in accordance with the crime.  This would meet the point that is being made strongly and which will continue to be made, that is, that there have been and will continue to be crimes of sexual abuse resulting in physical injury.  We have had such cases recently.  After such an orgy of brutality the offence, at least on paper, is not considered as grave or as serious as the offence of rape.  I am not suggesting in any way that rape is not a serious crime. One crime could be either as serious as or more serious than the other.  Therefore, I would have thought that what would have been appropriate would have been to allow the levelling system of justice to apply.  Instead the Minister is weighting the scale of justice on one side in this Bill, a Bill which, regardless of <Col N="660" /> whether we may be of the opinion that imprisonment is the answer in these cases, is necessary at this time.</P>

      <P>I presume the Minister accepts that would be the standard recourse of people charged under the section.

    <P>Section 3 is an interpretation section and an authorised medical practitioner is defined as meaning a registered medical practitioner holding an appointment or providing services as a consultant psychiatrist in a psychiatric centre.  As I understand it, a consultant psychiatrist is a psychiatrist who specialises.  However, there is some difference between a psychiatrist and a consultant psychiatrist, just as there is a difference between a general practitioner and a consultant. The object of Deputy Boland's amendment which I am moving as spokesman on Health having exchanged spokesmanships with him, is to define an authorised <Col N="663" /> medical practitioner as a consultant psychiatrist or psychiatrist.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The conditions of appointment laid down by the Local Appointments Commission change from time to time and are published frequently in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> The qualifications required for each post are settled before it is advertised and there is no statutory provision regarding any particular qualifications.  Perhaps the Minister should define &ldquo;chief medical officer&rdquo; more specifically so that the situation that I mention could not arise. The Minister admits that in theory it could happen and, if this is so, then this is a bad Bill.  The definition section is loosely drafted and we would not be doing our duty if we did not seek to rectify this.</P>
      <P>The Minister will agree that it would be an absurd situation if the chief medical officer in charge of a registered psychiatric centre or a district psychiatric centre could not admit or discharge a patient but someone under him could do so.  It might well be that the man in charge would be very well qualified to hold the post but because he had not got these degrees he could not admit or discharge a patient while his junior could do so.</P>

The position has existed without causing any theoretical possibilities which the Deputy suggested could arise and there is no basis for them to arise because the definition is very clear. That is a most unlikely development in our existing situation and in the situation which will obtain in the foreseeable future.  If this was changed in the future it would create a situation in which the anomaly referred to by the Deputy would arise.  That would surely be taken into consideration if a future Minister or Government set about taking such a retrograde step in relation to the profession and the post of chief medical officer or medical officer in charge of a psychiatric centre.  I do not see this having any practical application but I will have a look at it in relation to the theoretical possibilities.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am glad that the Minister has agreed to give some consideration to it. The Minister leans heavily on the practical side as distinct from the theoretical aspect.  The Minister holds very strongly that the person who is described as an authorised medical practitioner should be a consultant psychiatrist and stated that he was not prepared to yield on that because there was too much at stake, the liberty of the individual and the commitment or discharge of an individual.  But when the Minister went on to define a medical officer in charge he talked about practicalities and the likelihood of this happening &mdash; of somebody getting a brainstorm &mdash; and he is prepared to leave <Col N="673" /> the qualifications of the medical officer in charge to chance.  The Minister admits that he is leaving it to chance, that he is leaving it to the wisdom of himself in the first instance and to the wisdom of future Ministers for Health.  A medical Minister for Health might consider that he knew more about what is right and good for patients and about who was better qualified to perform this function and that function than anybody else and he might decide from his personal knowledge as a medical practitioner as to what was the right thing to do.  Does the Minister think it right to leave this wide open so that a position would arise where the man in charge of the psychiatric hospital would have overall charge for the medical side of running the hospital but he would be forbidden to carry out some of the most important functions of a doctor within the institution?  The Minister concedes that that can happen.  If it happens does the Minister think that it will be calculated to promote harmony between the medical personnel in the hospital?  Would the Minister not agree that it would create medical disorder in the hospital? The Minister admits that it is open to that interpretation and I feel that it should be put beyond doubt.</P>

      <P>It would be most impractical and it would be unlikely to happen because of the terms which apply to the post and because of the situation which applies.  Even if it happened the Bill ensures that there will be a consultant psychiatrist to discharge duties.  The question the Deputy is raising is that even in the event of such a theoretical possibility from some future change, it could result in this person being unable to perform some of the functions.  The Bill still controls the discharge, the extension, the transfer and all those activities which would take place and there would have <Col N="674" /> to be a psychiatric consultant to perform those functions.  In such a theoretical situation we would be creating an office which would not have the power to do that.  The Deputy has asked me to have a look at the situation and I will do so.</P>

I have avoided to the greatest extent possible any attempt to define what is or is not a voluntary patient or to circumscribe a person who wishes to undergo treatment voluntarily by statutorily expressed admission procedure.  If I were to do as Deputy Boland's amendment suggests I would be setting a real barrier between a patient in the general hospital situation and those who wish to undergo treatment voluntarily in a psychiatric hospital.  So far as the attempt by Deputy Boland to define in his amendment the responsibility of parents and guardians for persons under the age of 16 is concerned, I do not see it as necessary to be done in this Bill. It would more appropriately fall to be dealt with, if it is necessary at all to do so, in a more comprehensive measure dealing with the problems of children. Such a measure is being considered in my Department at present following receipt of the report of the task force on child care services.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I would argue that a lot depends on whether a patient is a voluntary patient or is committed against his will. Far-reaching consequences and decisions flow from whether a patient is voluntary or not.  If a patient is admitted as a voluntary patient he can, as I understand it &mdash; I oppose this very strongly &mdash; discharge himself without any notice.  He can virtually walk out the door and I am very concerned about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We define many things under the Bill including the term &ldquo;doctor&rdquo;, &ldquo;medical officer&rdquo; and so on.  The Bill encourages voluntary admissions into psychiatric hospitals and treats voluntary patients in a different way from other patients.  Yet we do not have any definition of voluntary patient.  That is a serious omission <Col N="676" /> and it was in an effort to correct that defect that this definition was put in.  It may be that the Minister does not agree entirely with Deputy Boland's definition of voluntary patient.  It is one I adopt without qualification, but if the Minister does not accept that definition it is up to him to consult his advisers and the parliamentary draftsman and come up with a definition which will cover the point.  To leave the Bill without such a definition is going too far.</P>
    <P>As regards how a person under 16 years of age can be a voluntary patient without the consent of a parent or guardian is hard to follow.  If the Minister is seriously rejecting this amendment he should spell out the pros and cons of defining voluntary patient and not defining it.  In a system where we love definitions and where most of the Bills which go through the House work by reference to the definition section it is extraordinary to find no definition of &ldquo;voluntary patient&rdquo;.  We could have a situation where a doubt would arise as to whether a patient was admitted voluntarily or not. If that were so, the patient might be entitled to the benefit of the doubt and that could have far-reaching consequences which would not be in the interests of the patient or others.  I would like the Minister to go into this in some depth and give us the benefit of his advice for and against.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Deputy was not concerned with the Bill on Second Stage and consequently would not be readily aware of the very strong view we have in relation to the question of voluntary patient.  The purpose of the Bill in general is to reduce to the smallest portion possible the number of patients who have to be catered for under the legislation &mdash; in other words, to treat psychiatric illness as normal illness in every way possible and to encourage people to go in for voluntary treatment without stipulation or undue regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had discussions with the profession in relation to the question of notice. Amendment No. 25, which I am proposing, will give 24 hours' notice in the case of voluntary patients and this would <Col N="677" /> cover the point raised by the Deputy. This was designed to cover a situation where a patient was in a temporarily disturbed state and wanted to leave.  The 24 hours' notice would give the opportunity to enable the patient to be reasonably composed in relation to that decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Amendment No. 25 improves the position somewhat, but it might be in the patient's interest to be able to clearly define whether he was committed or voluntary. I know that it would be more appropriate to deal with this amendment and the section which it amends when we reach it, but, as the Minister mentioned it here, so did I.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as drafted, without any notice, was the most outrageous proposition I heard for a long time.  I am conscious of the words I have used &mdash; outrageous proposition.  Many people may have experience of mental illness and what flows from it in their capacity as administrators or as medical people. Members of the legal profession have experience of it too.  I had one of the most appalling experiences of my professional life in dealing with something which flowed from a person being treated casually, as I suppose a voluntary patient would be treated.  I will not spell out the details because it is not long since it happened, and some of the people concerned are still alive.</P>
      <P>When we come to deal with the Minister's amendment No. 25 I will say I do not think a period of 24 hours is sufficient. It is intended to encourage people to accept treatment for mental illness. That is good.  It is good that the padded cells have been done away with, and it is good that the high walls have been taken down.  It is also very good that the locks and keys are used to a much lesser extent than heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> Some unfortunate people are still afflicted with mental illness to such an extent that they are completely irresponsible through no fault of their own.  They are more to be pitied than anything else. They are entitled to protection for their own safety, and for the safety of others. In dealing with that sort of situation we should not have casual legislation without any proper definition of the different categories of patients who admit themselves voluntarily and those who are committed under compulsory procedures.</P>
    <P>In his brief intervention the Minister did not satisfy me that a definition is not necessary.  It could be useful to us as we go through the Bill and I should like the Minister to spell out at this stage the difference, as he sees it, between a voluntary patient and a patient who has been committed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear at the outset that the suggestion that the proposal is outrageous, even as it stands without the subsequent amendment, does not stand up.  The reason for the introduction of the voluntary patient concept is to make their psychiatric treatment and care similar to that of people receiving other treatment and care in our health services.  This is a vast progression in the services.</P>
      <P>There was a 72 hour notice which was used very rarly in practice.  It was seen to be so rarely used that it was doubted whether it was needed to have any cover of that sort.  Some people in the profession were concerned that certain circumstances might arise where a person had entered voluntarily and, therefore, they felt they would like to have some provision included.  It was on that basis that we introduced the 24 hour amendment.  In effect, it is not as outrageous as it looks in black and white.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an amendment proposing some alteration to this definition, but the definition sets out only to define a detained person, a person for whom a reception order is made, or a reception order is sought.  In that case one is talking about a person who is suffering from considerable mental disorder, or a mental disorder of a degree which requires <Col N="679" /> detention.  When we are talking about the voluntary patients we are talking about people who are not suffering from such a degree of mental disorder.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that definitions are difficult in this area.  They are also considered very difficult in the profession, and by those who have attempted to make definitions in various respects.  It would be a very rare occurrence for a person who was detained voluntarily to become suddenly a person who should be detained permanently or involuntarily.  Admittedly that can happen.  To cover what would be a fairly rare situation, the 24 hour amendment is proposed to the Bill.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Could the Minister tell us who decides and at what stage whether a person is to be admitted as a voluntary patient or as a detained patient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It occurs the other way around.  Someone seeks a recommendation for the reception of a person to be detained.  Everyone else would go to seek treatment.  They would not have the history or the experience of mental disorder of such a degree that would require detention.  That would arise within the community, or in the context of the family, or whatever.</P>
      <P>In terms of detention we are talking about approximately 10 per cent of the total number of people who would be under psychiatric care or in a psychiatric institution of one kind or another.  With the breaking down of the walls, the changes which have occurred, and with the new forms of treatment, the vast majority of people are in the voluntary area.  We do not want to define them as anything other than people seeking care and assistance from the health services. As part of that movement the major hospitals which are being developed currently and the ordinary general hospitals will be associated with this.  For instance, Beaumont Hospital will have an acute psychiatric centre attached to it to normalise and regularise psychiatric care, which is the vast majority of the care nowadays.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Am I right in thinking that anybody, no matter how ill, can become a voluntary patient in a psychiatric institution and discharge himself on 24-hours' notice, and that it is only in a case where the symptoms become so apparent and so drastic that it will be necessary for one of the authorised persons to seek a reception order?  A person could be every bit as mentally ill, but he has not reached the stage where the symptoms have become apparent, but the symptoms could break out at any time when the patient was in residence in the institution.  In my opinion this emphasises the necessity to spell out a definition of &ldquo;voluntary patient&rdquo;. Nobody likes to have a relative committed, or is that the proper term?</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Let us say &ldquo;detained against his will.&rdquo;  People do not like to have that and people would go to a lot of trouble to coax relatives to go in as voluntary patients rather than have the stigma with which mental illness is still regarded, though to a lesser degree.  People would go to considerable lengths to coax relatives to go in as voluntary patients and such voluntary patients might be only a short time in residence when it might become apparent that it would be necessary to have them to stay in the institution for a considerable time for their own benefit and possibly for the benefit of society.  That is why I suggest that more consideration should be given to this and that definitions of the various types of patients should be spelled out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The point the Deputy has made is relevant but if the symptoms have not broken out the person will not become a detained person anyway, and if the symptoms have not become apparent it would be desirable to have such persons go along for treatment and care in a voluntary way, without designation. In a small proportion of cases it would be preferable that they would come in such a way.  We want to think about people who have not exhibited such a degree of <Col N="681" /> mental disorder that would require detention, and one would want such people to go for care and treatment without any tags or designations attached.  They would come within the system and get care and treatment, and if their condition was to worsen I am sure the consultant psychiatrist would recognise that situation.</P>

The Minister said that if the symptoms have not broken out the person will not become a detained person.  There is no use closing our eyes to the fact that we have not reached the stage when all of us are prepared to treat mental illness in the family as ordinary illness.</P>
      <P>It could very well be that the symptoms could have broken out but that the outbreak would be suppressed &mdash; indeed it is more than likely it would be suppressed if the symptoms were of a violent nature: relatives would suppress it and hope to have the patient admitted quietly as a voluntary patient for a while and that, with the help of God, everything would be all right.  We must consider such a situation.  Not alone would the symptoms have broken out but they would have been known to have broken out.</P>

Currently, there are 183,000 attendances at out-patient clinics; there are 2,000 detained patients in present circumstances.  Consequently, the whole movement of the development of the service is towards voluntary treatment in out-patient clinics.  It is for that situation that the Bill is providing.  We are anxious not to make definitions of what a voluntary patient is because of the way our <Col N="682" /> psychiatric care is developing.  There are about 12,600 long-staying patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  Section 1 (1) (2) and (3) reads as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  There shall be a body corporate, to be called the Travel Reserve Fund Agency (hereafter in this Act referred to as &ldquo;the Agency&rdquo;)</P>
      <P>(2)  The functions of the Agency shall be to hold, manage and apply, in accordance with the provisions of this Act, any sums paid to the Agency under or by virtue of this Act; and the assets for the time being representing any sums so paid to the Agency shall constitute a fund to be known as the Travel Reserve Fund (hereafter in this Act referred to as &ldquo;the Fund&rdquo;).</P>
      <P>(3)  The Agency shall consist of seven persons of whom four shall be appointed by the Minister, and three by the Association, and the Minister shall appoint one member to be the Chairman of the Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is twofold.  The primary reason for the urgency attaching to this matter is the collapse of Bray Travel when 1,400 people lost an amount of money in the region of £300,000 to £400,000, not including a loss of £50,000 to the staff of the company.  That is something <Col N="683" /> that this House cannot accept.</P>
    <P>There is a precedent for dealing with this matter; I refer to the collapse that occurred in a banking situation where the Government took action.  In the United Kingdom there was a similar occurrence involving a travel agency and, as a result of a general outcry, the Government paid up.  I am the spokesman for my party to deal with such matters and when I started to investigate the situation I found that in other countries they have the protection of the central insurance agency by which everybody is covered.  I look on this Bill as stage one in a two-stage operation. The first stage will refer to bonding and the second stage will be concerned with the licensing side of the matter.</P>
    <P>We suggest that an agency be set up consisting of a chairman, four members from the consumers' side to be appointed by the Minister and three representatives from the Irish Travel Agents' Association. Because an Opposition Deputy may not take any steps that involve a charge on the Exchequer, I shall be asking the Minister to table an amendment to enable a loan to be made available to get the fund off the ground and to cover the debts of the victims of the Bray Travel collapse.  The Bill will allow payments to be retrospective to 1 December 1980 and anything since that date will be covered. Our Bill proposes to give power to the agency to collect a percentage from the tour operators and travel agents.  This would be put into the fund and would be used to cover emergencies.  In the United Kingdom in a very short time a fund totalling £20 million has accrued and this fund is self-generating.  The licensing aspect is all important.  A very close look must be taken at people who set up in business to take money from their customers. They will have to be closely scrutinised and licensed.</P>
    <P>When one looks into this question one realises how serious the matter is for the victims of the Bray Travel collapse.  In that case honeymoon couples who had saved for 15 months for their holiday were told on their wedding day that their trip was off because the travel agency had collapsed.  One can well imagine their <Col N="684" /> feelings.  They had not the money to pay for another holiday.  That was the situation of many of the people whom we met at the Tara Tower Hotel.  They were not wealthy people who could afford several holidays abroad.  They had worked very hard for the previous 12 months, happy in the knowledge that they would have a few weeks holidays in the sun, to relax from the stresses and strains of their lives. It is true that many of them have not yet recovered from the effects of the bombshell that hit them.  In this House we talk lightly of millions of pounds when we pass Estimates.  In this instance we are talking about a very small sum of money and that only by way of loan to get the fund off the ground.  I envisage that the initial loan could be paid back in due course to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the damage caused to the nation as a result of the collapse of Bray Travel.  How can overseas visitors, who might like to book through Irish travel agents, have any confidence in us?  What will their general attitude be to the Irish tourist business when they find we cannot even look after our own people?  How do they expect to be catered for if we cannot look after our own people?  We just leave them high and dry after losing their holidays and not offer them any consolation.  That will do a lot of damage to our image abroad. The most important things we have going for us are our green grass and tourism. Tourism could be a money spinner for us if we took it seriously and did not look on it as a source of revenue but as a way of life for many people with hotels and guesthouses.  If we are serious about our image abroad the Minister will agree with this simple Bill and have it implemented.</P>
    <P>Holiday booking is in full swing at the moment.  No sooner has Santa Claus gone off the television screen than we have holidays advertised.  They all offer wonderful things.  I am sure some of the people in the Gallery tonight from Bray Travel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;must be rather disappointed <Col N="685" /> in relation to what they thought they were getting.  This Bill must be implemented.  It may have shortcomings but the Minister may add to it or subtract from it if he wishes.  We have been told that some of the travel agents now have their own private bondings. However, when we examine this closely we find everything is not what it seems to be.  There is great difficulty in finding out from those travel agents how much they are bonded for and who they are bonded with.  Let us assume that one of the large travel agents is bonded for £250,000, which looks like a lot of money, but this travel agent at the peak of the season probably has from £3 million to £6 million of customers' money.  What good is £250,000 in the context of £6 million? Who is to know, taking one year with another, that the travel agent's premium is paid?  If it is not paid obviously the travel agent is not bonded.  It is too late to find out when the damage is done.</P>
      <P>This party are bringing forward a simple, centralised system because it has to be centralised and controlled by the Minister. Any tour operator or travel agent who says he is bonded is bonded for an unlimited amount of money with the agency and the customer is covered.  That is the only way we can be sure people have proper cover.  When somebody sets up in banking he cannot just go along and put a sign over his door saying it is a bank.  The Central Bank closely scrutinise that person's operations and decide whether he gets a licence.  It should be exactly the same way with tour operators. The money which those people collect now will not be utilised for perhaps six months.  They are banking their customers' money for six months.  Anybody can do that banking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bray Travel people have had six companies in operation and only one of them is bankrupt.  They have property in Cork city which does not come under the bankrupt company.  It is very easy to juggle around with companies and to get off the hook.  All this must be tidied up.  We appeal to the Minister tonight to accept this very straightforward and simple Bill called the Travel Reserve Fund Bill.  We <Col N="686" /> would like to think that a large number of young people will avail of the special facilities offered by the EEC directives and use holidays abroad to broaden their outlook and learn a new language.  Public representatives did not realise how many young people were travelling abroad until they found out how many people were looking for passports during the postal strike.  The parents of the children who were involved in the Bray Travel collapse must have suffered great hardship.</P>
    <P>Parents would think twice before they would pay out something in the region of £5,000 and £6,000 unless they were sure they would get value for their money. That is what we are talking about to-night and that is what the House is all about: we work to ensure that our citizens are protected in all facets of life.  There is much talk about other forms of protection such as the protection of property but this is something on which successive Governments slipped up.  The Ceann Comhairle, when he was the responsible Minister, at a seminar in Killarney in 1977 told the Irish Travel Agents Association, in the wake of a small collapse, that he would see to it forthwith that a bonding system would be introduced but the Department have not done anything about that problem since.  I do not think anything will be done until there is a public outcry.</P>
    <P>It is essential that such a bonding system be introduced quickly.  When one examines the operations of Bray Travel one finds that companies such as Aer Lingus, our national airline, loaned in the region of £134,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting into an area that he should not discuss.  He is referring to a matter which concerns people outside the House.  I have given the Deputy every latitude and he should not go into matters of this type because they concern other people who are not here to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I can make my point without referring to Aer Lingus.  Bray Travel had facilities not merely from people <Col N="687" /> but from semi-State bodies.  It seems strange that the owner of the company should admit to having problems and yet on the eve of the collapse send telegrams to customers seeking money for final payments, additional payments and instalments. Surely there is something wrong when that happened.  It is our duty to ensure that it does not happen again.  We must ensure that those who suffered as a result of the collapse of Bray Travel are fully compensated.  In the initial draft of my Bill I sought to have a loan made available from the Exchequer to cover that situation.  I was concerned not only about the holiday makers but the staff of Bray Travel.  I was not allowed to include such a clause and I withdrew it but I appeal to the Minister to ensure it is included in the final draft.</P>
      <P>At the outset there may be some cribbing if a holiday is 3 per cent or 4 per cent more expensive but at the end of the day everybody will be happy to pay the extra. They will be happy to do so in the knowledge that when they arrive at the airport to commence their holiday the aircraft will be there and, more important, at resorts in such places as the Costa del Sol they will not be thrown out of their hotel and driven to another airport without any guarantee that they will get a flight home. The agency I have suggested will ensure that the holiday specified in the technicolour brochures is the type of holiday they paid for.  There will be honesty right across the board.</P>
      <P>No such guarantee exists at present and I do not accept that private bonding is the answer.  It would be too difficult to police and check out.  The customer in many cases would not go to the trouble of checking out that a bond exists.  The simple method of dealing with this problem is through the agency I have suggested. That agency will also ensure that only worthy people are permitted to operate in the travel business.  At present we have controls on the price of food, drink and many other things and surely there should be control on those who handle the money of our people.  In many cases those in the travel business are the guardians of that money for months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> If the legislation I suggest is implemented without delay the agency could be set up immediately and be in operation this season.  There is a precedent for such an agency here and in the UK and we are not talking about a very big sum of money.  Many people were involved in the collapse of Bray Travel but the amount of money was comparatively small.  The reputable people in the travel business do not object to the bonding system; in fact, they welcome it.  The Bill I propose is a first step towards the introduction of that system.  Many people in the business have given a good service, are adequately financed and do a good job.  They welcome the prospect of such legislation because they see it as a safeguard. They are worried that concerns like Bray Travel can give all travel agents a bad name.  Such concerns have also given the tourist industry here a bad name.  I hope this legislation is given a speedy passage.  It is an effort by me, as Fine Gael spokesman on tourism, to ensure that the Irish tourist industry is protected and that the overseas tourist wishing to make reservations through an Irish tourist agency will be sure that his money is safe and his business properly conducted.</P>
    <P>Many irregularities have come to light as a result of the Bray Travel collapse.  I would consider it most unusual and really not a question for this Minister but for another as to why no audit took place since 1975&mdash;&mdash;</P>

At that famous dinner in Killarney in 1977, sponsored by the ITAA, a commitment was given to examine the bonding of Irish travel agents and tour operators in relation to protecting their clients in the event of failure.  Yet in 1980 alone, apart altogether from Bray Travel, two major tour operators.  Sun Jet and Star Travel, collapsed without any element of protection. It is only because of a few dedicated people &mdash; incidentally the front runners in this have been paid by Bray Travel; I suppose to keep them quiet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is completely inadequate because, if it was nearly adequate, this would not happen and continue to happen.  It might be excusable if it happened once but it is happening time after time after time.  People can set up virtually as bankers, without let or hindrance, without any control whatsoever. There is no control at all; anybody could do it &mdash; and apparently is doing it &mdash; and can then go broke leaving thousands of people without their money.  Surely to God we have a right to draw the attention of the House to these facts and to take damned good care that it does not happen again.  That is what we are talking about. We must ensure, through this Bill, that it does not happen again, by setting up a seven-man team, comprised of a chairman <Col N="691" /> to be appointed by the Minister, four people from the consumer side and three people from the travel agents who would collect from the tour operators and travel agents a percentage of their takings to set up a fund to safeguard for all time anybody who decides to take a holiday out of the country.  That is what the Bill is all about, and not alone that but also to protect people who, as happened in some cases, arrived at the airport to find there was no aeroplane, who not alone lost their deposits and their money but were also put to considerable further expense and inconvenience.  This simple Bill will ensure that such people are fully reimbursed for anything that might happen, for train fares, hotel bills and so on they may have to pay as a result of a travel agent or tour operator going wallop and letting them down.</P>
      <P>The Minister will find it very difficult to oppose this Bill.  There will be very little point in his telling the House that he will prepare his own Bill.  We have been told this since 1977 and nothing has come about.  Certainly I will not accept such an excuse from the Minister this evening because we are now well into another tourist year.  This Bill will have to be enacted now.  It cannot be described as a drain on the Exchequer.  There might be some excuse if we were making heavy demands on the Exchequer at this time in a recession, but we are not doing anything irresponsible like that.  We are merely saying: let us set up our agency; let us give them sufficient funds to start off with, plus the amount required to pay back the remaining victims of Bray Travel.  That is all we ask.  In the context of the sort of spending going on nowadays one is really talking about peanuts.  But, for the individuals who suffered, one is talking about many years' savings, in many cases, as we discovered when we met these people.  Therefore I believe we have a duty and responsibility to them to pay them back.  That is the first object of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, we have a duty to safeguard all future travellers especially the young people whose holidays have to be paid for by parents who will go without so that <Col N="692" /> their sons and daughters can learn the language, the culture and the ways of our European friends.  This is what we would hope.  In due course the Minister, in order to copperfasten what has already been done, must set up the licensing of all tour operators and travel agents because this is equally important and will ensure that there will be no unnecessary drain on the fund by people who are in the business and should not be in the business.</P>
    <P>In recommending this Bill I must say that in my dealings with the Minister &mdash; and I had some very personal dealings with him &mdash; I found him to be a most forthright man, a man who understands the ways of business, who knows how things should be done.  I hope he will live up to his responsibilities in this instance. I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>First let me thank the Deputy for his kind remarks at the end of his contribution.  I am glad he recognises that I am a forthright man and that I have some knowledge of business.  It is precisely for that reason that I must say at the outset that, as I am sure the Deputy appreciates, what he is looking for is Exchequer money. The Deputy acknowledges that it is a deficiency in his own Bill and he is asking me now to insert it for him as an amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a clear recognition that it is a total deficiency in the Bill because it is the nub of the whole debate and has been the subject of much debate for quite some time.  But let us be quite clear, forthright and honest about the situation in relation to Exchequer funds. This has been quite clearly answered by me in this House and outside it.  The Deputy says he is not being irresponsible in looking for Exchequer funds here.  Is the Exchequer to be the bailer out of every commercial business that goes bang, this week, next week, last year or <Col N="693" /> whenever?  We must remember that we are talking about a commercial enterprise where people book holidays and pay their money, to travel agents and tour operators and their plane tickets and hotels are booked in return.  It is a purely commercial situation.  When one operator collapses is the Exchequer to be called in at any particular time to bail them out because people have lost money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy knows as well as I do what the situation is.  While I recognise and share the concern of the Deputy opposite for the people who have lost their hard earned savings in this type of situation &mdash; many families have been disappointed and I know them as well because they are in my own town &mdash; and also share the same concern for the staff who lost their jobs in the situation, let us not try to hide behind a smokescreen.  Let us be factual and approach the thing in a serious, responsible manner.  I suggest that the Deputy is purely and simply exercising political expediency by rushing in a Bill here that has been taken from a British Bill, that has been edited to some extent, poorly edited when one goes down through the various sections of the Bill which I hope to comment on in the course of my deliberations.  It is purely a political exercise and, I would suggest, an abuse of Private Members' Time, to bring in a Bill that is so deficient and contradictory in many forms and which would serve one purpose only, to solve a problem. The Deputy knows that restrospective legislation is frowned upon, not alone by this Parliament but indeed by every other House of Parliament, except for very obvious, specific reasons.  I suggest that the Deputy's approach to the whole situation is totally dishonest.  I do not wish to decry the Deputy's efforts but I am forthright, I am straight and I say what I mean.  The provisions of this Bill are incompatible.  How would one reconcile the exhaustion of the proposed fund to compensate clients of Bray Travel with providing protection for future holidaymakers against further failures in the trade?  The wording of the Bill does in itself suggest that there is some other fund there, a reserve fund.  This is why I say it is taken purely and simply from a <Col N="694" /> British Bill, but in Britain other measures are in existence.  Quite clearly this Bill has been rushed in here and it has not been fully thought out at all.</P>
    <P>I have already explained that Exchequer involvement in compensating Bray Travel clients is out of the question and have given cogent reasons in justification for that line.  The present measure has the effect of raising expectations among people who, having striven hard to save for a holiday, had their efforts frustrated and lost substantial moneys in the process. It must be obvious that such expectations are not going to be fully realised and the sponsor's effort in that respect must be deplored.</P>
    <P>I believe the bill to follow very closely the lines of the UK Air Travel Reserve Fund Act of 1975.  I do not accept that the slavish application of British legislation here is necessarily the right course of action; we have an Irish situation and we should try to bring some originality into the way we deal with it.</P>
    <P>The trade here has operated regulation-free for a long number of years.  Other countries, I would say Germany off the top of my head, still operate regulation-free.  One would have thought that this problem only originated in the last year or two, hearing Deputy Hegarty refer to the measures taken under the Air Travel Reserve Fund Act of 1975.  I do not play cheap politics in this House but when I see people coming in with a rushed Bill like this it behoves me to ask who were in power here when the largest collapse in Britain occurred at a time when it was necessary to rush in that legislation in a very different set of circumstances. But I do not play politics with this type of situation.</P>
    <P>As I already said, the trade has operated regulation-free for a long number of years.  That period would have been better used if the professionalism and concern for the customer which the trade has endeavoured to project in its glossy publications had been matched by concrete and effective actions to protect the consumer. Unfortunately, such measures as were instituted by the trade proved inadequate to deal with a major collapse.</P>
    <P>The recent collapse of Bray Travel <Col N="695" /> Limited has highlighted the need for effective protection of the travelling public and I am satisfied that this requires the establishment of a scheme on the basis of law.  As I indicated in the Dáil on 18 December 1980, the day of the Bray collapse, and more recently in response to a number of Parliamentary Questions, my Department has been looking at what can be done by way of legislation.  The preparation of an outline scheme is, as I told this House not very long ago, well advanced and I will be seeking Government approval at an early date for the introduction of a package of appropriate legislative measures.</P>
    <P>The basic feature of the Bill being presented here is the provision for the establishment of a travel fund to guarantee customers against loss arising from the failure of travel organisers.  The establishment of such a fund would provide some measure of protection to customers of the travel trade and the Bill under preparation in my Department will incorporate a provision along somewhat similar lines.  However, a fund of the kind involved, while providing a safeguard against losses, would not in any way minimise the risk of future failures in the trade.  In the wake of the Bray Travel collapse I believe that the public interest requires a broader approach involving not only guarantees to the public against possible financial loss but measures designed specifically to govern and regulate the trade itself with the objective of putting the trade on a proper footing for the future.</P>
    <P>It is important in this regard to be aware of the present structure and condition of the Irish travel trade.  There are at present some 200 agencies involved, of whom about 20 are major tour organisers. Bray Travel came within the latter category and it is to that category that my Department have been paying most attention since it is through these operators that the great bulk of moneys paid for holidays flows.  While I would not wish to generalise as far as the Irish scene is concerned, I think that I can fairly say that it is a common feature of the travel trade both here in Ireland and elsewhere <Col N="696" /> to rely quite heavily on credit.  This applies particularly in the valley season when operators have to book aircraft seats, hotel space and other elements of holiday packages for the following peak. Receipts from clients are subsequently used to discharge these credits.  In circumstances where bookings fail to materialise for whatever reason, a tour organiser can find himself in a very tight cashflow situation, with consequential risks for the viability of his entire operation. A further complicating factor can be the degree of cut-throat competition between operators and a tendency on the part of some organisers to plan capacity out of all proportion to the demands of the market.  Like any other market, the Irish travel scene suffers from these drawbacks, though the degree of the problem naturally varies from operator to operator. These problems have been known to us all in a general way for some time past.</P>
    <P>The collapse of Bray Travel has highlighted the need for early action which, in my view, must go much further than the measures proposed in the present Bill.  The establishment in isolation of a travel reserve fund to be raised by means of a levy, which the trade would simply pass on to the public, would in no way help to improve the financial state of the trade or raise the fitness criteria or qualifications of new entrants.  I do not think it is sufficient simply to provide protection for the public by means of a levy that in the final analysis the public themselves would have to bear.  The time has come to subject the trade to the rigours and discipline of licensing and bonding arrangements.  The philosophy underlying the measures being prepared in my Department will be aimed at protecting the public by improving the calibre of the trade itself, guaranteeing customers against loss by bonding.  Creation of a reserve fund can, in my view, form only one part of an integrated package of measures and I would over a period see that fund operating as a back-up to the organiser's bond and not as a subsidy, as envisaged in this Bill.  It will be clear to the House, therefore, that there is a radical difference between the philosophy <Col N="697" /> underlying the present proposal and the broader measures which I will shortly be bringing before the House.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for application of the benefits incorporated therein to contracts performed on or after 1 December 1980. Clients of Bray Travel Limited who lost moneys would, therefore, be entitled to re-imbursement of such losses from the proceeds of the fund to be established under this Bill.  This would be likely to raise a number of complications.  Firstly, it would take some time to build up the fund to a level that could be regarded as adequate to deal with the failure of a major tour organiser.  Retrospective application of the benefits to Bray Travel clients could be expected to exhaust or make serious inroads into the level of the fund and leave little funds available to protect future travellers.  Holidaymakers paying into the fund would want to do so to protect their moneys and would, in my view, be strongly critical of the use of their contributions to compensate clients of a previous failure in the trade.  This is a serious point to which the sponsors of this Bill have not addressed sufficient thought.  The suggestion has been made that the Exchequer should come to the rescue in this situation and the actions taken in the UK in the wake of the Courtline collapse and more recently here in the case of the Irish Trust Bank have been cited as precedents.  There were particular circumstances involved in these cases.  In the case of the collapse of the Irish Trust Bank the question of credibility in Irish banking institutions was a major consideration in the Government's decision to refund creditors.  The measures in question were exceptional and it was made clear at the time that the Government's action did not alter the legal position which is that the Central Bank are not liable as a result of the insolvency of a licensed bank.  In the case of Courtline, the UK Government floated an Exchequer loan of £15 million to compensate persons who lost money with Courtline.  That decision was taken in the light of a parliamentary statement made by a UK Minister shortly prior to the collapse of Courtline in which the public were told not to have any qualms about <Col N="698" /> booking with Courtline.  The loan in question has since been fully repaid to the UK Government.  It is quite clear in the Courtline situation that the Minister responsible had stood up in the House of Parliament one month earlier and told the general public.  That inferred clear implication for the British Government and they accepted those responsibilities. The situation here is totally different.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Trust Bank was, as I have said, the credibility of the total banking situation.  The Deputy is trying to supply a simple solution to the collapse of a business concern and set a precedent for bringing the Exchequer into the collapse of any private business operator so that anybody can have recourse to this House and the public purse to bail out failures in the commercial world.  It is unrealistic, and the Deputy knows that.</P>
      <P>Procedures for the liquidation of companies and the treatment of creditors are well established under the Companies Acts.  If suggestions for Exchequer involvement in compensating Bray Travel clients are to be taken seriously, those sponsoring or supporting this Bill must ask themselves, is the Exchequer to become the bailer-out for creditors of companies in general who go into liquidation, and how would such action square with the normal liquidation process already established in law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making this statement I am, of course, aware that many people, after striving hard to save their money, had their plans frustrated and suffered real hardship as a result of the Bray Travel collapse.  Following the collapse I made an appeal to the Irish travel trade generally, suggesting that it would be in their best long-term interest if they could do something to ease the plight of those who had lost holidays.  Some travel agents responded positively.  Unfortunately, the funds available to the Irish Travel Agents Association were sufficient only to help ensure that the Bray Travel clients abroad at the time of the collapse got <Col N="699" /> their full holidays, and the vast majority of those who had paid for holidays lost all, subject to whatever may become available from the liquidation process which is currently under way.</P>
    <P>I would like to clear up another scare which has been created on a total misconception of what happened at the time of this collapse, referred to briefly by Deputy Hegarty.  That was the question of planes being unavailable in the event of any collapse in future.  Let me tell Deputy Hegarty that it is a condition of my Department granting landing rights to the airlines carrying those people abroad that in the event of anything such as this happening they must return those passengers to Ireland at the appropriate time.  Let me also put on the record of this House, in case some people still do not know, that at the time of the Bray Travel collapse I intervened with the airlines concerned to ensure that these people were brought back, not the following day but whenever their holidays were completed.  That has been misrepresented abroad, not by Deputy Hegarty but by others for their own reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, my point was that people could find themselves at Dublin Airport on the way out, which is the real crunch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to clear up the other point because other people have used it for different reasons &mdash; not the Deputy, as I made quite clear.  I met a deputation from the Bray Travel Action Group last week and I want to place it on record that I was highly impressed. While they would naturally welcome a situation where they would get back moneys which they lost, I must stress that one of the main concerns which they expressed to me related to the need to put the travel trade itself on a proper footing.  This is my major objective.  The second major concern of the Bray Travel group was that the Irish Travel Agents Association should again be asked if they might consider some form of refund from their own resources.  They put a plan <Col N="700" /> forward as to how this could be effectively carried out.  I have already sought a further meeting with the Irish Travel Agents Association to put this plan to them and I hope they respond positively to it.</P>
      <P>I would like to make a few comments on how incomplete and ill thought out the Bill is.  Section 2 of the Bill provides that the fund may be applied to, or for the benefit of, customers of travel organisers by whatever mode of travel but section 4 (2) makes provision only for contributions in respect of accommodation on overseas flights.  What about contributions to the fund in respect of persons travelling by surface mode?  Under the Bill, contributions to the fund are required of travel organisers defined in the Bill as &ldquo;any member for the time being of the association&rdquo;.  Does this mean that a travel organiser could avoid contributing by the simple expedient of resigning from the association and devising his own protection measures which, in the event, might not be up to scratch?</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of an agency consisting of four nominees of the Minister for Transport and three representatives of the ITAA, to manage and apply the resources of the fund.  The ITAA, being a trade association, is effectively a vested interest.  Has the sponsor of the Bill considered the implications of this?  Would it not be better to include representatives of the trade generally or, better still, that all appointees to the agency should be drawn entirely from outside the travel trade so as to guarantee complete independence?</P>
      <P>The foregoing represents a few points, some of which are small, others involving important points of principle or substance. There may well be other considerations which a longer assessment of the Bill might reveal.  It is a very complex area which calls for a very critical approach in the preparation of draft legislation to deal with the whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to repeat what I have already said.  While the protection of those buying holidays is important, the way in which we go about securing that protection is even more important.  To take the course proposed in this Bill would help <Col N="701" /> the holiday makers, even if they have to contribute themselves by increasing the cost of the holiday but it would do nothing to put the trade on a much sounder footing, which is what everybody wants, if further failures like Bray Travel are to be avoided.  For that reason I oppose the present measure because insufficient thought has been put into the Bill and because it fails completely to redress the underlying problems inherent in the travel business.</P>
    <P>The measures which I will soon be bringing before the House are of a much more comprehensive nature and will seek to prevent as well as to cure.  Prevention is always better than cure.  The points I raised clearly illustrate that the Bill was a hastily put together copy of British legislation. It is poorly edited and was brought in to deal with one situation, ignoring precedents which it would establish. It also ignores the fact that it is calling on the public purse to bail out commercial organisations.  While I would not accuse the Deputy who proposed the motion of political expediency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This has been carried on under a voluntary regulatory basis. We are always being told to legislate for this and that.  If the precedent that the <Col N="702" /> Deputy wants to establish in the Bill was to be adopted, the Exchequer would be inundated with requests for help.  This problem is not exclusive to Ireland.  Germany also had a problem in this respect and there are others.  The preparation of legislation to deal with this is very complex. My officials have been abroad to look at the various systems.  We have had discussions with the UK authorities and, as a result of their experience of the legislation which they brought in, they see certain defects in it.</P>

      <P>One must bear in mind that his Department is littered with UK legislation, whether it be air traffic regulations or air traffic control legislation, licensing of aircraft, airlines and so on, many of which emanated from the UK.  With respect to the Minister, who said there were many cogent reasons why the proposition put forward by Deputy Hegarty was unacceptable, the reasons he has given are not relevant or cogent. There is a body of consumer protection legislation in operation at present and there is no reason why this Bill should not be added to it.  The House has unanimously passed legislation dealing with consumer protection in the past two or three years.  The last Government and the present Government have sponsored this legislation.  If the Minister found any particular section of this Bill unacceptable &mdash; I regarded exclusive reference to the ITAA possibly open to amendment &mdash; he could have tabled a half dozen amendments.  The Bill will be debated tonight, tomorrow night, next Tuesday and Wednesday.  It may not go on that long, but nevertheless, it would have been possible to amend it, because if one examines the sections of the Bill with three or four amendments it would be reasonable to bring it into operation.</P>
      <P>If people must contribute because others have lost money under what are alleged false pretences, so be it.  There is no reason for someone conned in that way not to be able to go ahead with plans to enjoy the benefits of foreign travel or, perhaps, to visit a sick relative abroad or to engage in business activity on the basis of a contribution from a reserve fund of the type being proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall vividly during the last general election campaign the now Minister for Energy whining through every page of the national dailies in making his case for the unfortunate tragic and desperate small depositors, such people as little old ladies who had lost their life's savings, in the Irish Trust Bank.  Deputy Colley, <Col N="704" /> though he had no authority at the time to do so, demanded that these depositors be recouped and promised that that would be done in the event of Fianna Fáil being re-elected.  Some individuals in my constituency approached me and reminded me that the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, refused to give any such assurance.  The only reason they got the promise of recoupment from Deputy Colley was that there was a general election campaign in progress.</P>
    <P>However, Fianna Fáil were returned and they paid up, though so far as I understand the winding up problems of the ITB have not ceased.  The question at that time was not one of the credibility of the Irish banking institutions, because the Central Bank had suggested that the Irish Trust Bank should not be given a licence to operate.  Despite this, the ITB got their licence.  The question, therefore, was simply one of the then government-in-waiting, as they regarded themselves, considering it appropriate that that kind of money should be paid back to those who had lost with the ITB.  The people involved were not ordinary holidaymakers. Some of the money that had been recovered was fairly hot and could have been readily traceable as having come from the UK as well as money that was brought here from America for tax avoidance purposes.  There is no suggestion that any one of the holidaymakers who has lost money in the case in which we are talking of was involved in tax avoidance and, consequently, would not merit more favourable treatment than that meted out to the Irish Trust Bank depositors.  There is for me a certain retrospective irony in coming in here this evening and saying to the Government that what is sauce for the Irish Trust Bank goose should be sauce also for the Bray Travel gander.  I do not see any difference.</P>
    <P>There is one other more serious analogy to be drawn.  The Central Bank said that the Irish Trust Bank were made up of a crowd chancers and should not be given a licence to operate.  But, as we all know, they got their licence and went bang, taking their money out of the country, at least so far as one or two individuals <Col N="705" /> were concerned.  In the case we are talking of &mdash; and here I beg to differ with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle &mdash; the company concerned, Bray Travel, allegedly had not filed audited returns with the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism for four years.  The Government say that the responsibility is not theirs.  If the Registrar of Friendly Societies did not succeed or did not seek to obtain audited accounts from the company, the Minister of the day had an obligation to ensure that the company were not allowed to continue trading.  Now that they have gone bang, the Government wash their hands of the situation.</P>
    <P>There is a State responsibility in this regard, as much a responsibility as was the case in respect of the Irish Trust Bank.  It is fair and reasonable for the Minister to wish to draw the analogy of the two companies.  I appreciate that there are many difficulties in respect of a Government accepting a Private Members' Bill.  Naturally, the parliamentary draftsmen would wish to consider such a Bill as also would the Attorney-General. In addition, there can be financial implications at Exchequer level in respect of any such Bill.  But I do not accept that, having had due notice of this Bill, the Government should wash their hands totally of the situation.  There are 15 Ministers of State with a separate Minister for Transport.  I do not know if the latter has his own Minister of State.  I have lost track of the 32 State cars.  In any case, there are so many Ministers and Ministers of State in the current regime and there are so many advisers, semi-advisers and public relations officers associated with the Government that it should not be beyond the legislative capacity of the Government to devise rapidly appropriate legislative measures on the lines outlined by the Minister.  It concerns me somewhat that whenever a matter of this nature arises in the House a Minister comes in and uses the hackneyed phrase that the preparation of an outline scheme is well advanced and that he will be seeking Government approval at an early date for the introduction of a package of appropriate legislative measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill comes before the House as a result of a very unhappy experience for quite a number of people.  We all very much regret the failure of a very substantial travel company that was catering for a large number of people.  We know the disappointment and the setback which the abrupt failure of Bray Travel caused.  Many hundreds of holidaymakers were ready to set off at that time.  I have had some contact with a number of the disappointed holidaymakers who are constituents of mine and if permitted I should like to put on record my appreciation of the Minister's courtesy in agreeing to meet a deputation of the disappointed holidaymakers and having very constructive discussions with them on some of the issues arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we have this unfortunate situation where we have substantial financial loss for quite a number of people, the question coming before us is whether it is appropriate to bring in a Bill of this nature to seek to compensate those who suffered loss and also whether this is the appropriate vehicle to cater for any possible future recurrence.  I do not see that this is the right way to go about the matter for a number of reasons.  The first reason I want to explore is the point the Minister made and which I think can be developed, that is the whole question of whether the firms themselves who are in the travel business should accept a greater degree of responsibility for the services which they offer to the public and whether they should be charged with responsibility for providing an adequate form of insurance arrangements in the event of the failure of any one member <Col N="708" /> company.  There are other questions which arise in consequence of that but, taking that one first, my own firm view is that the provision of the privilege of forming a limited company is a very valuable concession.  It is a creature of the law and confers quite a number of important benefits on shareholders who form such a company.  In return for those benefits which the promoters and shareholders of a limited company require it is not unreasonable to expect them to discharge their responsibilities to the public and to their customers and also to the Legislature through fully complying with any legal requirements that may be laid down for them.</P>
    <P>One of the dangers with the proposed Bill is that it seems to shift too much of the onus of compensation on to the general taxpayer and I think we should avoid that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a possibility of it.  After all, if we are going to make interest-free loans, an interest-free loan is a subsidy and the taxpayer will pay the subsidy and we need not beat about the bush on that.  Apart from the amount of subsidy involved, there is also the point that it appears to be shifting the onus of responsibility away from the place where, to my mind, primary responsibility lies &mdash; with the companies involved in the travel business.  Once they acquire this valuable privilege of being able to form a limited company which gives very important protection to the shareholders it is not unreasonable to seek to ensure that in turn they give equal protection to their own customers.  Surely that is where the greatest failure has been in this area to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was said, the travel business has grown very much in an environment where the main travel agencies by and large operate on credit and therefore where they are highly vulnerable.  Having committed themselves to a particular programme, number of flights, so many hotel bookings and so on, if they fail to meet the necessary number, fail to sell to the public they find themselves in a very <Col N="709" /> sticky financial position and very often bring about their own ultimate downfall by trying to drum up business through excessive price cutting.  Therefore one necessary step is to insist on a proper scheme of insurance as a built-in part of the sales procedure for these travel companies, in that way providing the necessary insurance fund which can compensate against the failure of any one member.</P>
    <P>Insurance, while it is an important element in what I would regard as a satisfactory system, by itself is not really enough because we know from our general experience of the way in which insurance markets operate that insurance arrangements alone can also give rise to &mdash; if you like &mdash; an element of carelessness or lack of responsibility on the part of some people.  In the business it is usually referred to as the element of moral hazard, the feeling that it does not really matter if something goes wrong, that the insurance will pay for it.  To avoid that element of carelessness or indifference towards the consequences of actions because of the feeling that the insurance safety net will be there to pick up all the consequences of error, carelessness or failure, I think we must look for something more than a simple insurance scheme that would compensate for any failures or losses, for something that will cope with the consequences of failures, so to speak.  We must deal with the problems more positively and try to prevent failures of this kind.  That is the necessary other half of any satisfactory set of arrangements which would lay down an adequate code for firms which wish to become recognised as providing these services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise in this House tonight in a last ditch effort to obtain a reprieve for the Fastnet Co-op factory in Skibbereen in West Cork.  I do so in the context of figures disclosed to me today in the House by the Taoiseach for the total amount spent on imports of foodstuffs in recent years.  The reply to that question is very relevant to the subject matter before us.  The figures show that the imports of foodstuffs have gone up from £269 million in 1978 to £425 million in 1980.  In that broad context, very serious questions must be asked before a small, native food-processing plant is closed.</P>
      <P>I speak about the Fastnet Co-op in a personal sense.  It is a factory in my home town.  I recall travelling around the countryside with many other members of the community obtaining subscriptions for it when it was first formed.  In personal terms, it is not just another factory.  It was a co-operative effort in my home town, based on native raw materials produced by my own neighbours and processed by the locals &mdash; 160 in all &mdash; many of whom I grew up with.  So much for the personal view of the situation.</P>
      <P>In general terms, the Fastnet co-op was a unique concept.  It was a co-operative venture between a large, State-owned company &mdash; the sugar company &mdash; and the farmers, workers and community of a rural town and hinterland.  In Irish terms, it is not just another factory. It is a result of a unique partnership bringing about considerable employment and prosperity in an underdeveloped area.  Its closure involves a positive decision now by the Government to withdraw support, not to grant the necessary support to keep it in operation.  I am quite sure that the Irish Sugar Company would be willing to continue its support and have planting instructions for the current year issued by the co-op, provided the Government guaranteed any resulting losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea to obtain a suitable alternative industry has been given the goahead. However, so far there is nothing in the pipeline.  In the meantime, since the IDA commenced their efforts, we have had a significant new development, the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee <Col N="711" /> on Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann &mdash; The Irish Sugar Company.  It is important to stress that the Oireachtas Joint Committee is not an Opposition body.  It is a committee composed of Members of both Houses, from all parties and has a majority of Government members on it &mdash; six of the members of the committee are from the Government party and, in addition, the chairman of the committee is a respected member of the Government party, Senator Eoin Ryan.  Furthermore, it is regarded as being a very serious committee indeed.  In the compilation of this particular report, it had specialist advisers, including a lecturer in economics and a senior lecturer in accounting and finance at Trinity College. This report must be given considerable weight by the Government.  Furthermore, the Government are called upon to seriously explain themselves if they decline to follow the recommendations of that report.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be political in this contribution but, as a West Cork man, I must say that, in so far as the future of the Fastnet Co-op is concerned, the non-implementation of the report by the Government puts that Government in the dock.  I wish to refer to a few relevant sections in the report.  At paragraph 16 the report states:</P>
    <P>The cost of any obligation to maintain aspects of its food operation which are economically non-viable, but which the Government wishes to maintain for social or other reasons, should be explicitly recognised by the payment of a State subvention in compensation.</P>
    <P>Here we are talking about the food operations of the sugar company and the need for the Government to specifically recognise the social factors.  I must stress, and will stress time and time again, that there are important social factors, when one considers the location of this plant in an underdeveloped part of the country.</P>
    <P>Later on the report, at paragraph 116, states:</P>
    <P>The Committee believes it would <Col N="712" /> fully meet the Company's responsibilities to its work force to ensure that alternative employment opportunities with a roughly equivalent skill level are made available in the locality, either by another State enterprise or by an IDA-assisted industry, where it wishes to close an existing plant.</P>
    <P>Here again it is being realistic.  It states that if the plant cannot continue in operation indefinitely, efforts have to be made to secure alternative employment there.</P>
    <P>At paragraph 117, it goes on to make what I consider to be the really relevant and most important recommendation in so far as the Fastnet Co-op is concerned. It states:</P>
    <P>The Committee recognises however, from the State's point of view, not to say the interests of the work force as well, that it makes no sense for the Company to close a plant until alternative employment opportunities have come on-stream.  The cost to the State of unemployment, in terms of tax receipts foregone and unemployment benefit paid, will usually exceed the difference between the value of what the workers produce and their wage. Provided this condition is met, it is &ldquo;cheaper&rdquo; for the State to subvent the Company to maintain its plant in temporary operation rather than allowing its workers to go on the dole.  Until alternative employment opportunities are provided, the Committee recommend that the Company should receive a temporary Government subsidy to keep its uneconomic plants in operation. Unlike the present situation, however, where the State is effectively asked to take on an open-ended commitment to meet the losses due to the operation of uneconomic plants in the proposed situation there would be a clear commitment to provide alternative, more viable jobs, within a short period of time.</P>
    <P>This, then, is the centrepiece of the report of the joint committee.  It stresses the need to seek an acceptable suitable alternative.  Locally, on the ground, it is accepted that if this plant cannot continue <Col N="713" /> in operation on an economic basis, this is where we must look.  Having said that, I must say that in the context of the fact that we are producing the goods ourselves, native raw materials, it is sometimes difficult to understand how we cannot compete with the produce from other countries so far away &mdash; Israel, Kenya and so on.  Indeed, questions have been raised from the point of view of investigating the possibilities of dumping.  However, the immediate situation is that if all the experts say that this plant is not viable and cannot be made viable, the local community &mdash; workers and everybody involved &mdash; will be forced to accept that we must look to an alternative industry. The simple fact is that such is not now available and there is no guarantee of it for the immediate future.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister and his Government this question: is it not better to implement the decision of the joint committee now while, at the same time, continuing the search for an alternative industry?  There are many pluses in adopting this course of action.  The continuous employment for the work force would be maintained.  I want to put it on record that that work force have given good service and were never involved in industrial relations problems.  When talking about establishing another industry in the future, it must be an advantage to have such a good work force available.  If this report is implemented, it must be remembered that we have a highly specialised group of growers who will be able to continue in operation and provide special techniques for future projects in the same area.  There is also the question of the factory and machinery being maintained in good working order so that they can be used in future projects.</P>
    <P>The State must be seen to be discharging its obligations to a remote underdeveloped area.  Surely there is a social obligation here not quantifiable in simple economic terms?  The report of the joint committee, even in economic terms, felt that such a plant should be kept open and various minuses are set forth in that report.  I ask the Minister to look again at these pluses and minuses.  They all point to what I feel must be a decision <Col N="714" /> to maintain this plant in operation.  I would highlight the absolute urgency of an immediate decision in this regard.  We are into the planting season.  From the point of view of celery, planting instructions would have to be issued this week. The other items grown in the area, such as carrots, swedes, beetroot and so on, could wait another while, but bearing in mind the problems in arranging contracts, seeds and so on, there should not be any delay.</P>
    <P>If an alternative industry became available before such produce was processed, the Minister could bear in mind transferring that produce to another plant within the sugar company group.  There is such a factory in Midleton and there would be considerable possibilities of having the capacity in that plant used to process such vegetables in the event of an alternative coming on stream before the processing was completed at Fastnet.</P>
    <P>I feel I have put the position fairly, and in a non-political fashion make this appeal to the Minister and the Government. I am making a plea to this Government for a stay of execution, to allow a last minute reprieve.  I am not looking for an open-ended commitment; I am merely looking for a commitment to allow the work force to be kept together until an alternative opportunity is on offer.  I accept that the IDA are a good organisation but they cannot work miracles. Any alternative, once identified, would need a considerable amount of time before coming on stream.</P>
    <P>I have to contrast the borrowing of £4,000 million over the last three-and-a-half years and the small amount of money that would be needed to save this plant. One hundred and sixty jobs may not seem large in the national context, but this will be a closure of Ferenka size consequences to a small underdeveloped part of West Cork.  With a final, urgent, earnest appeal I ask the Minister to lift the axe and allow this plant to continue for one further year until an alternative industry is found.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe is, I think being a little pessimistic.  I am more optimistic than anybody about this industry <Col N="715" /> in particular, and the food processing industry in general.  I was involved in its inception and a lot of voluntary effort was put into it.  In the case of Midleton, General Costello gave us two weeks to find £20,000, and it was found.  That is the kind of enthusiasm that was generated in that area.  In Fastnet we have the best celery in the world &mdash; even better than Tuam.  This plant is in direct competition with producers of fresh celery, but when the EEC laws are tightened &mdash; in winter we import fresh celery from North Africa and other countries &mdash; there will be a tremendous future for that industry.  I am not only concerned about the factory jobs involved or the skills which took a long time to acquire, but I am more concerned about the jobs on the farms.</P>
      <P>When I was in the Beet Growers Association I remember going to these factories and seeing tractor loads of goods being delivered.  These contracts formed a substantial portion of the income of these small farmers.  The cheques were very useful at a time when there were no dairy cheques from the creameries.  I am asking the Minister, and not in a political sense, to look at this problem again.</P>
      <P>There will probably be another industry brought into this area through the efforts of the IDA but I am more concerned about holding on to what we have and maintaining the skills acquired over the years as well as keeping the canning process.  There will be a good future for this industry when the recession is over and people start buying again.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to go down and see for himself if there is any way a small sum of money would keep a co-op going.  I believe Erin Foods should have been set up as a separate entity.  At present the sugar company are looking for areas in which to economise, but this move is not a solution to their problem.  I hope the Minister will look closely at Fastnet with a very sympathetic eye.</P>

      <P>It is important to realise &mdash; and it is no secret &mdash; that the sugar company are going through a very difficult period <Col N="716" /> and that they have had very heavy losses in the last financial year.  Since they began trading in 1964 Erin Foods have accumulated losses of £24 million and these losses have been a drain on the sugar operations.  This has led to the company's present high borrowings for capital investment which could otherwise have been financed by profits.  As a result the company have begun to rationalise their food sector by reducing excess capacity and overhead costs and by developing more profitable and more marketable products.</P>
      <P>It is understood that it is in this situation that the company, not the Government, have decided to close Fastnet. They see no future for the activities carried on there &mdash; canning, bottling and air drying &mdash; because of the low margins and depressed market conditions abroad. The losses at Fastnet over the past few years have been very high.</P>
      <P>The work force on the food processing operation is at present about 50 and it is understood that there will be employment for them on food processing until about September.  There is, therefore, an amount of time available to secure alternative industry.  The sugar company have given full details of the Fastnet site to the IDA, who have given these to all their offices abroad.  A special brochure has been prepared and this will, in addition, be sent to all IDA offices.  The securing of an alternative industry is being promoted by the IDA as a matter of the highest priority, and I have written to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism seeking his assistance with the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime the sugar company have told the workers that they are prepared to negotiate early retirement arrangements with those who might wish to retire now and special severance payments, in addition to the statutory payments, for those who might wish to leave otherwise.  In the case of regular growers the company have undertaken to offer them beet contracts or to consider compensating them otherwise.  It is understood that within the next day or two discussions between the company and representatives of the workers and of the <Col N="717" /> growers will take place to discuss these matters.</P>
    <P>The Joint Oireachtas Committee report stated at paragraph 117 that the company should not close a plant until alternative employment opportunities have come on stream because it will usually be cheaper to do this than allow workers to go on the dole.  This statement is, of course, debatable and cannot be read apart from the totality of the committee's report.  Indeed, in paragraph 119 there is reference to the difficult decisions in a number of areas which are faced by the company in their attempt to restore profitability.  It is stated that Government action alone will not be sufficient to help the company through their present difficulties and that they will need the full co-operation of all concerned if they are to continue in their long-standing development role in key areas of the Irish agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>While, of course, one has naturally no desire to see any workers lose their employment, the position is that there are no funds at the disposal of the Department out of which the continuance of the operations at Fastnet could be subvented. In any event the result of such a suggestion would be that the State could be asked to subsidise every loss-making activity in the country.  I should add that <Col N="718" /> the sugar company have not asked me or the Government for funds.</P>
    <P>I regret the necessity to cease the food operations but I am confident that, given the priority which the IDA are according the matter of a replacement and given the co-operation of the Fastnet society, which is forthcoming, a suitable replacement can be found within the time available. It is important to stress once again that the co-operatives decided, although reluctantly, to accept the sugar company's decision at their meeting on 7 January last and they are co-operating with them and the IDA in efforts to secure another enterprise for the factory.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned the increase in food imports and this is a matter about which we have been concerned. However, the main increase to which he refers concerns cereals and not the kind of produce produced at the Fastnet co-operative.  The suggestion has been made that the Minister and the Government should do this or that, but the sugar company have not made any proposals to me in regard to any additional measures which should be taken and the co-operative concerned decided reluctantly on 7 January last that they would accept the sugar company's decision and that they would work with them and the IDA to secure alternative employment.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 4 March 1981.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit from 9 May 1980 to 8 July 1980.  Her claim from 9 July 1980 was disallowed following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work. She appealed against the disallowance of her claim and the matter has been submitted to an appeals officer for determination. She will be notified of the appeals officer's decision as soon as it is available.</P>
      <P>She was paid maternity allowance from 24 November 1980 to 14 February 1981. Two maternity grants payable on her insurance and on that of her husband have also issued.  If she has been incapable of work subsequent to 14 February 1981 the question of payment of disability benefit will be considered on receipt of medical evidence.</P>
      <P>There is no record of a payment of £6 to her for the period 15 and 16 January. At that stage she was in receipt of payment of maternity allowance at regular intervals at the rate of £20.45 a week.</P>

      <P>An analysis of exports according to economic sector of origin is compiled and published regularly.  This analysis is given in the following table for agricultural exports for the years requested.  Imports are not analysed in this way.  The standard classification for external trade does, however, include the category &ldquo;food and live animals&rdquo;. Imports and exports classified to this category are also shown in the following table.</P>

The bogs in question are known locally as Mostrim, Clonwhelan, Glenlough, Bardanstown and Clynan and straddle the Longford-Westmeath border.  Notice of the board's intention to acquire 1,817 acres of the Mostrim and Clonwhelan bogs was published on 12 December 1980 in the three Dublin daily newspapers and the <i>Longford Leader</i> and on 3 January 1981 in the <i>Westmeath Examiner</i>.  Notice of the board's intention to acquire about 2,200 acres of the Glenlough, Bardans-town and Clynan bogs will be published at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information is as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  The number of legal aid certificates granted up to 28 February 1981, the latest date for which such information is available, was 441.  The number refused was 23.</P>
      <P>(2)  Paragraph 3.2.3. (4) of the scheme does not exclude tenant defendants in ejectment proceedings and there is no other provision of the scheme which does so.</P>
      <P>(3)  The application of paragraph 3.2.3. (4) is a matter for determination by the board under the scheme in the circumstances of each particular application.</P>
      <P>(4)  No.</P>
      <P>(5)  On the assumption that &ldquo;qualifying conditions&rdquo; refers to section 5.1 of the scheme, the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, but the board have discretion to waive or reduce certain contributions under section 5.3.10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="580" /> (6)  No.  I am unaware of any decision by the courts which has any effect on the relevant provisions of the scheme.</P>
    <P>(7)  Yes.  In exercise of its powers to delegate under the scheme the board have authorised solicitors in centres to initiate proceedings in specific circumstances&mdash;generally of an emergency character.</P>
    <P>(8)  Up to 31 December 1980, the most recent date for which exact figures are available, an amount of £4,773.94 had been collected by the Legal Aid Board in the form of contributions from persons who have received legal aid and advice. It is estimated that close to £2,000 has been collected since then.</P>
    <P>(9)  Important changes were made with effect from 1 February in the level of the means test applied under the scheme. The question of substituting other means test criteria for the detailed provisions for assessing the means of applicants contained in the scheme is not under consideration.</P>
    <P>(10)  All applicants for legal aid are notified of the decision of the certifying committee.  I am informed that this is normally done in writing but that occasionally, for example in very urgent cases, applicants are notified orally. Every grant of a legal aid certificate is made in writing and written acceptance is essential.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Keating</b> asked the Minister for Justice if he will consider introducing legislation to provide that, where farms are mortgaged, a family home would be excluded from the scope of the mortgage so as to protect the interests of all family members.</P>

      <P>I assume that it is not being suggested that legislation should purport to invalidate existing mortgages validly granted. As for future mortgages, I have heard no arguments to support the view that a restriction on the lines suggested would be in the best interests of farm families. No doubt it is appreciated that the protection of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, extends to family homes associated with farms.</P>

    <P>Looked at in the light of the total number of children in the country under the age of 10 years, (693, 615), the figure of 173 confirmed cases over a period of almost 3 years represents an exceedingly small percentage (i.e. .00014%).</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 6 July 1979 and was paid from 10 July, fourth day of incapacity to 4 October 1980.  He was certified fit to resume work on 6 October 1980.</P>
      <P>His title to pay-related benefit in respect of that incapacity depended on his earnings for the 1977-78 tax year. These earnings were not available as the firms for whom he worked had gone into voluntary liquidation.  The inquiries to establish the amount of his earnings were difficult and protracted.  It has, however, been possible only to estimate his earnings in the relevant tax year.  Payment has now been made on this basis and a cheque covering all pay-related benefit due issued recently.</P>
      <P>He is at present in receipt of disability benefit in respect of a claim commencing 1 December 1980.  However this claim links with that ending on 4 October 1980 his entitlement to pay-related benefit is limited to one day as he had almost exhausted his title to such benefit on the earlier claim.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit from 27 October 1980 in respect of an accident at work on 26 October 1980.  Inquiries made from the employers revealed a conflict of evidence about the alleged accident and further investigation of the claim accordingly is necessary before a decision can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime disability benefit has <Col N="600" /> been awarded as an interim measure and all payments of disability benefit and pay-related benefit have been made on the medical evidence of incapacity received in respect of the period up to 17 February 1981.  If, however, the person concerned submits medical evidence in respect of a subsequent period of incapacity the question of payment will be considered as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has not claimed unemployment benefit from my Department recently.  He claimed disability benefit from 3 October 1980 but he was not qualified for payment as according to the records of my Department he had less than the statutory minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.</P>
      <P>Following inquiries his record of insurable employment for 1979-80 was recently received and, on this record he is qualified for payment from 5 January 1981.  Accordingly all disability benefit due from 5 January 1981 to 28 February 1981, less the appropriate amount of supplementary welfare allowance paid, has been issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As he indicated that he had been in employment in the United Kingdom in 1978 he has been requested to supply details of that employment so that his insurance record can be obtained from the British authorities.

On receipt of an employer's statement confirming the period of incapacity a cheque covering the period 20 November to 22 November 1980 issued on 27 February 1981.</P>
      <P>He again claimed disability benefit from 8 December 1980 and was paid from 11 December, fourth day of incapacity to 13 December.  He was certified fit to resume work on 15 December.  Two cheques for £10.23 and £19.95, issued 7 January and 9 January 1981 respectively. Details regarding these cheques have been sent to him.  If he still contends that he did not receive them replacement action will be taken immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also claimed disability benefit from 12 January 1981.  A first certificate only was received, but following inquiries the duration of his illness was confirmed by his employers.  A cheque issued on 27 February covering the period 15 January 1981, fourth day of incapacity, to 24 January <Col N="604" /> 1981, after which date he resumed work.</P>
    <P>He is not entitled to pay-related benefit as earnings in the relevant tax year were insufficient.</P>

      <P>The delay in payment of disability benefit was due to his failure to quote his RSI number on the medical certificates forwarded to my Department.  The RSI number inserted by him on the claim form did not refer to him and as a result, his reckonable earnings for 1978-79 on which payment of pay-related benefit is based could not be obtained under that number.  Following inquiries he has since supplied details of his earnings to my Department and payment of pay-related benefit due to 10 February 1981 was made recently.</P>

      <P>The European Communities (Lead Content of Petrol) Regulations, 1980, made by me on the 9 December 1980 prescribe a maximum permitted lead content in petrol of 0.64 grammes per litre.  These regulations give effect to the EEC Council Directive of 29 June 1978 on the lead content of petrol.  The directive stipulates a maximum content of 0.40 grammes per litre in the EEC generally but allows for the placing on the market here, during the period of five years commencing on the 1 January 1981, of petrol having a lead content greater than 0.40 grammes per litre without, however, exceeding a content of 0.64 grammes per litre.  This derogation was allowed because of the technical and economic problems which the immediate implementation of the lower limit would have created for the Whitegate Oil Refinery.</P>
      <P>Levels of atmospheric lead are kept under continuous review by my Department in association with Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board. Results do not give any grounds for believing that the derogation will result in levels above the two microgram per cubic metre level proposed in a draft EEC Directive on air quality standards for lead, a level which is accepted as one below which human health and the environment are not adversely affected.</P>
