      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 14, 15, 4 and 16.  Private Members' Business from 7 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. will be Item No. 26 (resumed).  By agreement, the proceedings on the Second Stage of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981 and the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) (Continuance) Bill, 1981 (including, in each case, the order naming the day for Third Stage), if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 5 p.m. today by putting from the Chair the questions necessary to bring them to a conclusion; and in the case of the Youth Employment Agency Bill, 1981, if the proceedings have not already concluded the question necessary to bring them to a conclusion shall be put from the Chair at 7 p.m. today and the question to be put from the Chair shall be (as the case may require) &ldquo;That (any motions for Financial Resolutions connected with the Bill and not disposed of are hereby agreed to and that) (all amendments set down by the Minister for Labour for Committee Stage and not disposed of are hereby made to the Bill) the Bill (as amended) is hereby agreed to and (as amended) is reported to the House and (all amendments set down by the Minister for Labour for Report Stage, including any requiring recommittal, and not disposed of are hereby made to the <Col N="1366" /> Bill and Recommittal and Fourth Stages are hereby completed and) the Bill is hereby passed&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I move, under Standing Order No. 30, a motion for the Adjournment of the Dáil to require the Minister for Agriculture to state what action he proposes to take to preserve the jobs of meat factory workers which are being lost as a result of the export of cattle on the hoof under the present system of EEC subsidy.  This must now be deemed a matter of great national urgency and importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy for having given the Chair notice about this, but I am sorry that it is not a motion contemplated by Standing Order No. 30.  Accordingly, I cannot accede to the Deputy's request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to understand how the Chair would deem not relevant an issue of the closing down of factories and of jobs being lost as a result of the system of exporting live cattle under EEC subsidy.  I understand that £280 per head is the subsidy and four cattle farmers have now collected £56 million out of this fund.  We will today be asked to vote on the motion to increase by 1 per cent the PRSI of taxpayers who will have to pay to create jobs which are deemed so important at this time.</P>

      <P>Because there are other opportunities to raise this matter, but not under this Standing Order.  I appreciate the Deputy's problems.  I have explained to the Deputy that he has other opportunities.  I am very sympathetic towards him.  The Standing Orders are for the orderly procedure of this House and Deputy Sherlock must abide by them the same as any other Deputy in the House.  The Deputy is now being disorderly. He will resume his seat or leave the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it has not arisen suddenly.  The Standing Orders are there.  The problem mentioned by the Deputy has not arisen suddenly. I would ask the Deputy to resume his seat now and I will explain it to him. I have examined it very thoroughly and with great sympathy.  Unfortunately this problem is not one covered by Standing Order No. 30.  There are other means at the Deputy's disposal and I will be glad to discuss them with him.  But this is not one covered by Standing Order No. 30. I will be glad to facilitate the Deputy in every way possible but not with regard to Standing Order No. 30.  I will be glad to talk to the Deputy about it.  But could we go on with the next item of business, please?</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, we are reluctantly accepting this Order of Business.  But I want to point out to the Taoiseach that the Minister for <Col N="1371" /> Labour this morning circulated 14 amendments to the Youth Employment Agency Bill and we have only two hours in which to take this Bill.  While we are anxious to facilitate the Government on legislation of urgent importance such as this Youth Employment Agency Bill and also the Rent Restrictions Bill I must protest that asking the House to deal with an important piece of legislation with 14 amendments in a matter of two hours is not a good way to legislate.  I want to point out to the Taoiseach that of the amendments circulated this morning one is utterly meaningless.  I would direct the Taoiseach's attention to the amendment that it is suggested be made to section 14:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (2), line 46, to delete &ldquo;or&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are anxious to facilitate the Government on matters of importance but I would suggest that this is a slovenly way of doing things.  If the Government are not prepared to do their business in a more efficacious manner than this they cannot count on our co-operation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" />&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) (Continuation) Bill, 1981 and this Bill are connected, I shall discuss them together.</P>
    <P>The need for the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981, arises out of the Government's commitment to protect tenants of dwellings which were formerly controlled under the Rent Restrictions Acts.  The rights under these Acts, which many of the tenants have enjoyed for a lifetime, have come under threat as a result of the Supreme Court's decision that parts of the Acts were unconstitutional. In the absence of action by the Oireachtas, the tenants involved, who in many cases are elderly or among the poorer sections of the community, would be faced with major increases in rents and for demands by their landlords for possession of the dwelling.  The Government recognise their duty to protect such persons.</P>
    <P>Over the years the Rent Restrictions Acts have provided a rigid control on the level of rents of certain dwellings and considerable security of tenure for the tenants.  The legislation was introduced as far back as 1915 but was not made permanent until the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, which was, in turn, amended in 1967.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that this legislation suffered from many faults.  It provided no mechanism whereby the landlord could increase the rent to keep pace with inflation and no incentive for the landlord to maintain the property as he had little prospect of ever regaining possession of it.  At the same time the tenant's interest in the property was such as to make it unlikely that the major repairs that this type of accommodation almost invariably required would be undertaken. The result over the years was wasteful deterioration in the standards of these dwellings to the stage that many of them became unfit for habitation.  This is reflected in the substantial decline in the numbers of such dwellings since the Second World War which has left our major cities with a serious shortage of private rented accommodation.  At the present <Col N="1375" /> moment there is likely to be no more than 30,000 controlled dwellings in existence, though this is only an estimate.  At this stage, of course, the controlled sector is numerically much smaller than the non-controlled private sector of rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>In retrospect it is scarcely surprising, therefore, that the constitutionality of the legislation would eventually be challenged in the courts and that this challenge would be successful.  The Supreme Court, on 29 June last, gave a judgment which effectively struck down the main portions of the Rent Restrictions code. The court held that Parts II and IV of the 1960 Act, which controlled the level of rent and restricted the landlord's right to recover possession of controlled dwellings, were contrary to the provisions of Article 40.3 of the Constitution.  That Article provides that: &ldquo;The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Part II of the 1960 Act was adjudged to be an unjust attack on such rights, being both arbitrary and unfair, in that it restricted the rights of one group of citizens for the benefit of another, without compensation, without regard to the financial capacity or the financial needs of either group, with no limitation on the period of restriction and with no possibility of review.  Part IV of the 1960 Act, which restricted the rights of a landlord to possession of a controlled dwelling, fell as a consequence of the decision on Part II as it did not have a viable statutory existence of its own.</P>
    <P>In response to the court's decision and in view of the major social implications it had, the Government introduced and the Oireachtas passed a temporary measure to protect the interests of tenants until permanent legislation could be prepared to fill the statutory void left by the Supreme Court's decision.  The permanent legislation would have to reconcile the interests of both parties, whether as landlords or tenants, so as best to subserve the common good.  The temporary <Col N="1376" /> measure, the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1981 as enacted is due to lapse on 25 January 1982 and the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill is intended to replace it.  I will refer later to my reasons for asking the House for a further three months' extension of the temporary measure.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill is to provide, in accordance with the exigencies of the common good, a measure of security of tenure for tenants of controlled dwellings, a mechanism for the determining of rent where it is not agreed between the landlord and the tenant, a rebate on the rent payable by tenants over the first five years and a means for the registration of all rented dwellings.</P>
    <P>Though it is not a lengthy Bill, the issues with which it deals are complex as the interests of landlords and tenants are often in conflict and are not easily reconciled. In addition the Bill raises constitutional questions on which advice has been provided by the Attorney General. Despite these difficulties I consider that the proposals in the Bill reflect a fair balance between the rights of the landlords and the tenants.  Landlords stand to gain substantially over the position obtaining before the Supreme Court's decision and the Bill also seeks to mitigate the most serious effects on the tenants concerned within the confines set by the Supreme Court decision and the relevant Articles of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Government have a duty under the Constitution to protect all the citizens of the State and are enjoined by Article 45 to direct their policy towards securing that: &ldquo;the ownership and control of the material resources of the community may be so distributed amongst private individuals and the various classes as best to subserve the common good.&rdquo;  The State acknowledges in Article 43 that while man has the natural right to the private ownership of external goods, &ldquo;the exercise of the rights ... ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice&rdquo;.  To this end the State may &ldquo;as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view <Col N="1377" /> to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think what I have so far said will leave Deputies in no doubt but that difficult constitutional questions are involved. The advice available to the Government is that the Bill is entirely in conformity with the Constitution.  However, the Government have thought it prudent to plan for the eventuality that the President might refer the Bill to the Supreme Court in accordance with Article 26 of the Constitution. Indeed, one could see advantage in the constitutional questions raised by the Bill being settled once and for all. Of course, a referral to the Supreme Court is entirely a matter for the President after consultation with the Council of State.  Because the President may decide to refer the Bill, the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) (Continuance) Bill, 1981, has been introduced to extend the life of the temporary measure for three months.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the main provisions of the permanent Bill, the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981.  Deputies will have an opportunity of debating the detail section by section on Committee Stage.  At this time I shall confine myself to outlining the main provisions and the purposes which they are intended to serve.</P>
    <P>The Bill ensures that existing tenants of controlled dwellings, their spouses and members of their families are given security of tenure.  The tenant and his spouse are given the right to remain in possession for their lifetimes.  A member of the tenant's family, bona fide residing with him, who succeeds to the tenancy will have a right to possession for the residue of 20 years from the commencement of the Act.  The right to retain possession is not given indefinitely to members of the tenant's family so the landlord can expect to recover possession of the dwelling at some stage in the future.</P>
    <P>One of the most criticised features of the rent restrictions legislation was that the landlord had no realistic prospect of ever regaining possession.  Therefore, he had little or no interest in maintaining the property.  This feature is removed from the proposed legislation without, at the <Col N="1378" /> same time, in any way affecting the rights of the existing tenant or his spouse to remain in possession of the dwelling.</P>
    <P>The Bill encourages the landlord and the tenant to come to voluntary agreements about the terms of the new tenancy but recognises that this will not always be possible.  A mechanism is being provided whereby the District Court will fix the terms of the tenancy, including the level of rent, in default of agreement between the parties concerned.  The terms of a tenancy, whether agreed or fixed by the Court, must be set out in writing.  While the guidelines the Bill provide where issues come before the court are not, generally speaking, being applied to agreements between the parties, the guidelines are likely to have an important influence on the terms of agreements.  Even where the landlord and the tenant enter an agreement, there is provision in the Bill for either party, after a period of time, to apply to the court to set the terms of the tenancy.</P>
    <P>The major issue which landlords and tenants must take into account in coming to voluntary agreements is the existence of a rebate on the rent payable in the initial years of the tenancy.  The Bill provides that where a rent is fixed by the court a rebate shall operate to allow for the gradual increase in the level of rent due over a five-year period.  The rent payable in the first year will be the existing rent together with 40 per cent of the difference between the existing rent and the rent as fixed by the court.  This percentage will go up by 15 percentage points each year until the tenant is due to pay the full rent fixed by the court in the fifth and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>In fixing a rent under this Act the court will take into account improvements, which add to the letting value of the dwelling, made by the tenant since 31 December 1960, the date of the coming into force of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960.  The gross rent, that is before reduction to allow for improvements, shall be what, in the opinion of the court, a willing lessee would give and a willing lessor would take for the dwelling on the basis of vacant possession and having regard <Col N="1379" /> to the other terms of the tenancy and the letting values of dwellings of a similar nature and in a comparable area.  This formula is similar to that in the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980. Either party may seek a review of the rent after five years and after each subsequent five years.  This process of review meets another of the objections in the Supreme Court's judgment to the former system of control.</P>
    <P>The manner in which rents are set is obviously central to the whole legislation. Considerable attention has been paid to the content of the Supreme Court judgment on this aspect.  The advice to the Government is that the formula for fixing rents together with the rebate provisions is consistent with the Constitution and the Supreme Court decision.  In addition, in cases where the financial circumstances of the landlord and tenant so warrant, the court, on application to it by the landlord, may increase the percentage in any year.  This right to apply for a reduction in the rebate is restricted to those landlords who did not purchase the dwelling since 31 December 1960.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the Bill provides security of tenure for the life of the tenant and his spouse and for a more restricted duration for other members of the family. At the same time and in accordance with the normal provisions of rent restrictions and landlord and tenant codes there are circumstances in which a landlord must reasonably be allowed to recover possession.</P>
    <P>Section 12 entitles the landlord to regain possession in specified circumstances set out in the section.  Examples are: non-payment of rent, a breach of tenancy obligation, the dwelling is required as a residence for the landlord, or other person living with him, or an employee, the carrying out of a scheme of property development for which there is planning approval and in the interests of good estate management.  In certain circumstances where the grounds for possession are in the interests of the landlord as distinct from faults or failures of the tenant, the tenant will be entitled to compensation <Col N="1380" /> for moving and to pay for alternative accommodation.</P>
    <P>In addition, on quitting, the tenant may obtain compensation for improvements which he, or his predecessor in title, carried out on the dwelling since 31 December 1960, which add to the letting value of the dwelling at the time of quitting. I should emphasise that repossession of a dwelling can be obtained only on foot of a court order, which the court may grant only if it is reasonable to do so and the other requirements are met.</P>
    <P>The Bill empowers the Minister to make regulations for the registration and standards of all rented dwellings.  It is my intention to have regulations for the registration of all controlled dwellings in operation from the commencement of this legislation.  The registration requirements will be central to the operation of the procedures envisaged under the Bill since a new rent becomes payable only after registration.  The regulations prescribing standards for rented dwellings are intended to replace by-laws under section 70 of the Housing Act, 1966, which are at present operated by some housing authorities.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is, I consider, a balanced approach to a difficult legal area.  It has been necessary to tread a very careful path between the conflicting demands of landlords and tenants and still remain within the parameters set by the Supreme Court decision.  Although this is a complex Bill every effort has been made to ensure that its operation will be as straightforward as possible. Much of the burden of carrying out the legal requirements falls to the landlord and this I consider only proper, given the circumstances of many of the tenants involved.  That there is a need for a number of legal requirements and procedures is, I am afraid, unavoidable if we are to ensure that the rights of all are protected adequately.</P>
    <P>I would hope that various groups and persons concerned would study the Bill and the requirements and procedures it introduces before rushing to take action. Housing authorities, a number of voluntary organisations throughout the country <Col N="1381" /> who advise on landlord and tenant matters and who do such valuable work in this regard, and the State Legal Aid Centres, will, in due course, be able to provide information and assistance to the tenants and the landlords concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with one further aspect of this matter which does not arise directly on the Bill, that is, the question of providing assistance to those tenants for whom, even with the rebates proposed, the payment of higher rents will create hardship.  On a number of occasions already the Government have indicated that in such cases assistance will be provided.  I would like now to reaffirm this commitment and assure Deputies that the Government will provide any necessary assistance to alleviate hardship to tenants on low incomes.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to refer briefly to the Government's longer term commitments to the private rented sector.  The Bill before the House, with the exception of those sections dealing with registration and standards generally, is confined exclusively to the controlled sector.  This is so because of the urgency of the matters arising out of the Supreme Court's decision, and the Government's determination to deal responsibly with an issue having far-reaching social implications.</P>
    <P>I propose when the legislation to deal with the controlled area is operative, to examine the policy options open to the Government on the wider front.  There are twin problems; first, how to improve matters in relation to existing accommodation and, second, how to increase the supply of private rented accommodation. Like many other features of the rented market, the two aspects I have mentioned pose possible conflicting resolutions and require a balanced approach.  In particular, I will be looking at those undertakings in regard to the rented sector in the Programme for Government 1981-86, which are the responsiblity of the Department of the Environment.  Before we can make headway on such longer term issues, however, it is necessary to deal with the urgent problems facing the controlled sector.  To this end I commend these Bills to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties that faced the Government when they were drafting this legislation. The Minister of State said it had been necessary to tread a very careful path between the conflicting demands of landlords and tenants and still remain within the parameters set by the Supreme Court decision.  It is open to question whether the Government have succeeded in treading that careful path.  I am glad that in reply to questions by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday the Taoiseach referred to the constitutional problems raised by the Bill.  Today, the Minister of State referred to the same matter.</P>
      <P>I hope this Bill will be tested immediately in regard to its constitutionality so that we will not have a repetition of the situation that arose in the past.  There is a strong body of legal opinion which says that the terms of the Bill are unconstitutional particularly in regard to the rebate element and to the postponing of the five-year period in regard to increases awarded by the courts.  It is thought that these matters are totally contrary to the Supreme Court decision of 29 June last.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the advice given to the Government that the formula for the fixing of the rents together with the rebate provisions is consistent with the Constitution and the Supreme Court decision.  There is a strong body of legal opinion which would argue that point.  I am not a lawyer and I do not intend to get into that.  If we are to have some order in this very complex area of landlord and tenant legislation dealing with controlled tenancies for the benefit of the landlord and in particular for the benefit of the tenant, the sooner the constitutionality of this Bill is established the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come to the contents of the Bill, the one area it attempts to tackle is the whole question of security of tenure.  When the Minister of State is replying I should like him to clarify for me the benefit to a tenant in having a piece of paper guaranteeing security of tenure if, at the same time, the tenant is unable to pay the rent fixed by the court.  At the end of his speech the Minister of State said assistance would be available to those in need. <Col N="1383" /> He did not spell out exactly the type of assistance, and the mechanism to be used.  When he is replying he should go into greater detail on this matter.  There is no point in giving people a piece of paper saying they are secure in their flat if, at the same time, they find themselves unable to pay the rent set by the court.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember exactly what is included in the Bill for the setting of this rent.  Section 6 (2) provides:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of subsection (1), the gross rent shall be the rent which, in the opinion of the Court, a willing lessee not already in occupation would give and a willing lessor would take for the dwelling, in each case on the basis of vacant possession being given, and having regard to the other terms of the tenancy and to the letting values of dwellings of a similar character to the dwelling and situate in a comparable area.</P>
    <P>In that situation we will see considerable increases in rents.  A considerable number of tenants who will be affected by this legislation are old people, retired on pension, who will find it impossible to pay the increases in rent which will result from the court decision on the formula used in this Bill.  The Minister must spell out to the House exactly how he envisages giving teeth to the security of tenure aspect.  As it stands, the Bill will create difficulties and great problems for many tenants.</P>
    <P>This Bill fails totally to honour the commitments made by the two parties now forming the Government before the general election.  The only thing consistent about the Government is that in every measure they introduced in the Dáil, and in every decision they make outside the Dáil, they break commitments made in their election manifesto.  I should like to read for the House exactly what the Fine Gael Party said in their election programme. Under the heading &ldquo;Rented Accommodation&rdquo; we read:</P>
    <P>(a)  A Fair Rents Tribunal will be established to set rents which will be fair, both to tenant and landlord.  In <Col N="1384" /> the event of the present rent restriction legislation being held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, Fine Gael will introduce legislation to ensure fixity of tenure for existing tenants, and where rents fixed in rent-controlled accommodation are beyond the means of the existing tenants a rent subsidy scheme will be introduced for tenants in possession.</P>
    <P>(b)  Fine Gael will give the right to a written lease: no rent will be payable until the landlord fulfils this requirement.</P>
    <P>(c)  Fine Gael will introduce a new tax credit for private tenancies up to a maximum of £1,000 rent.</P>
    <P>In this legislation there is no fair rents tribunal.  At the end of his speech the Minister of State referred to the Government's intention to examine the longer-term commitment to the private rented sector.  For five months the Government have had an opportunity of examining this whole area and this is the Bill we have before us today which provides that the fixing of rents will be done by the District Court.  Where is the fair rents tribunal we heard so much about prior to the election?</P>
    <P>In their document the Labour Party also promised to introduce a fair rents tribunal.  The same commitment was made in the Gaiety Theatre Dublin.  On Tuesday, 12 May last, we discussed a Private Members' Motion put down by the Fine Gael Party.  As reported at column 2691, volume 328, of the Official Report, Deputy Keating now Minister of State at the Department of Education moved the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, concerned about many inequities in the present situation offending against the best interests of both tenants and landlords, demands the setting up of independent tribunals to consider questions relating to rent and conditions, to which both landlord and tenant may have recourse.</P>
    <P>In the course of his contribution to the debate, Deputy Keating went to considerable lengths to make firm commitments <Col N="1385" /> with regard to the action the Fine Gael Party would take if elected to office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating had six proposals. Again I quote him, at columns 2701 and 2702 of the same volume when he said:</P>
    <P>The sum total of those six central steps alone &mdash; although other reforms are also necessary &mdash; would bring about a major wind of change in the area of landlord and tenant legislation. I give an undertaking that our party in Government will introduce this kind of change, based on the principles to which I have referred.  I would not feel so annoyed about all this if, firstly, I did not have the experience every week of meeting people presently living in intolerable and unbearable conditions about which we all know and, secondly, if this Government</P>
    <P>&mdash;referring to Fianna Fáil</P>
    <P>had not so cynically and so sickeningly given those undertakings.</P>
    <P>&mdash; referring to the undertaking given prior to the 1977 election.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating spoke about the need for a fair rents tribunal.  He asked for a completely new deal for tenants and landlords which would recognise any area housing between 300,000 and 400,000 people as being a legitimate and central part of the housing spectrum.  He said also that there should be a substantial grants package of not less than £35 million available to owners of private rented accommodation conditional on their maintaining their property in accordance with proper standards, existing by-laws and depending on that property being registered; mind you, £35 million.  I do not see any mention of that in the Bill or in the Minister's introductory remarks. Perhaps he is reserving it for his reply. On tribunals Deputy Keating had this to say:</P>
    <P>An independent tribunal or tribunals should be set up, and will be if there is a change of Government, to oversee fair standards of rent, conditions and interpretation of general standards in this area.  Both tenant and landlord should have recourse to these tribunals <Col N="1386" /> and they should not merely be about rent.</P>
    <P>He spoke also of the difficulties of dealing with the courts and the problems to be faced by many tenants not used to dealing with them.  He said in this respect:</P>
    <P>It is no consolation to such people to have a very small rent or to be told as they were told on a previous occasion by Deputy Barrett that they have recourse to the courts.  Anyone with any knowledge in this area knows that to refer the average tenant, perhaps a young married mother with two or three children, to the support of the courts which are in session now and again and of which many may not be in session when her need is greatest is nonsense and is completely unrealistic and naive.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us is designed to legislate for this whole complex area of the relationship between landlord and tenant in controlled dwellings.  All of the arrangements for adjudication of the problems arising between landlord and tenant are to be handled by the courts.  How does the Minister of State envisage the District Court dealing with the extra burden that will be placed on it resulting from the passage of this Bill?  We are all aware of the delays experienced at present within our courts system.  I suggest to the Minister of State that the burden being placed on the District Court, in its present structure, is almost intolerable.  We are talking here about 30,000 controlled tenancies. I would ask the House to consider the situation in which some 30,000 additional cases will come up for decision by the District Court.  They will be complicated cases because they must take account of such things as improvements effected in the properties.  Account will also have to be taken of the area in which the properties are situated, the other commercial rents available in the area and so on. Every one of these cases will be complex. Perhaps the Minister of State would tell us what arrangements the Government intend making for the handling of this extra burden being imposed on the District Court.  It is vital to know exactly how <Col N="1387" /> the courts are to handle this extra load being imposed on them.</P>
    <P>I might deal now with the question of rebates as laid down in section (1) 9 of the Bill which says:</P>
    <P>9.&mdash;(1)  Where the rent of a dwelling to which this Act applies is fixed by the Court&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the rent payable by the tenant shall be an amount equal to the rent payable by him at the commencement of this Act together with&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  in the year 1982, 40 per cent of the difference between that rent and the rent fixed by the Court,</P>
    <P>(ii)  in the year 1983, 55 per cent of that difference,</P>
    <P>(iii)  in the year 1984, 70 per cent of that difference, and</P>
    <P>(iv)  in the year 1985, 85 per cent of that difference.</P>
    <P>(b)  in the year 1986 and in subsequent years, the rent payable by the tenant shall be the rent fixed by the Court.</P>
    <P>Of course this raises the whole question of the constitutionality of this Bill to which I have referred already.  Does the Minister of State not appreciate that the implementation of this type of sliding scale, asking tenants to pay an extra 40 per cent of the difference between their existing rent and that fixed by the court, will impose a savage burden on many people on fixed incomes, many of whom, as I said earlier, will be on pension.  How do the Government intend coping with the social problems resulting from this savage imposition of the extra 40 per cent in the first year?  It is vital that the Minister spell out the Government's proposals in this area.</P>
    <P>In considering the Bill I wonder did the Government give consideration to the proposals made by the Private Tenants' Action Group, a group which operates from St. Francis Xavier's Church in Upper Gardiner Street.  I am sure the Minister is aware of this organisation. They set out a proposed charter.  For the <Col N="1388" /> information of the Minister and the House I might list what was included in that charter.  It said (a) that tenants accept the basic principle that a fair rent should be paid by the tenant to the landlord and (b) that affected properties referred to in the 1981 Supreme Court decision should be taken over by the local authority and paid for through the issue of interest-bearing property bonds or land bonds.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister given consideration to that proposal?  I see considerable merit in it.  There is a lot to be said for that proposition, the reasons for which are listed by the Private Tenants' Action Group.  For example, the advantage to tenants would be that all affected tenants would thereby be brought into the position of other council tenants whose rent is fixed according to their ability to pay and who also enjoy security of tenure. Further the tenant is entitled under the Housing Act to exercise his option to purchase.</P>
    <P>There is also an advantage to the public authority because the bond system, since it does not require initial heavy capital expenditure, avoids diverting badly-needed financial resources from already existing housing needs.  On the other hand, should rents of affected tenants be allowed to rise to market value, the local authority would inevitably incur a heavy financial burden either through having to subsidise tenants or else in the case of evictions, having to rehouse them.</P>
    <P>The Private Tenants' Action Group recognise the legitimate needs of landlords and there are advantages in their proposal for the landlord.  They say it will give the landlord a return which, in most cases, will considerably exceed his present income from the affected property.  It will also relieve him of the burden of keeping the property in good repair and help to preserve the stock of family housing. There is considerable merit in that proposal and I am anxious to hear the Minister's views on it.</P>
    <P>This Government are already considering, as can be seen from the Housing Agency Bill, the bond system to raise money for new house construction and the purchase of new houses.  Could the <Col N="1389" /> same bond system be used in the way proposed by the Private Tenants' Action Group?</P>
    <P>Failing the proposals already outlined, the Private Tenants' Action Group come up with a second alternative &mdash; that a fair rent tribunal be established to investigate all cases and fix a current rent which would be based on the tenant's ability to pay and that every year rent increases would be fixed in relation to the cost of living.</P>
    <P>When this Government were in opposition they spoke a great deal about a fair rents tribunal but now that they are in Government and are introducing legislation, there is no mention of such a tribunal.  The Minister referred to the need for long-term commitments and examination of the problems in the rented sector but did not mention a fair rents tribunal.  I suggest it is cynical for this Government to have included such a tribunal in their election plans.  A week or two before the general election was called they put down a Private Members' motion calling for a fair rents tribunal. Now they have the opportunity, after five months in power, to introduce this Bill but they are not mentioning that tribunal.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the family and security of tenure.  I am talking in particular about dependent relatives.  There is a very wide definition of &ldquo;dependent relatives&rdquo; in section 1 (2).  As the Bill is drafted there could be grounds for an accusation of unfairness to relatives For example, take a member of a family who might have supported a dependent relative for many years and now finds himself in possession of the premises with only one year to go before the expiration of the 20-year period.  It might be difficult for him to find alternative accommodation at that stage.  He might have put down roots and become attached to the home.  I am not committing myself at this stage but I have been considering an amendment to paragraph 3(3) (<i>b</i>) to read as follows:</P>
    <P>in this subsection &ldquo;relevant period&rdquo; means the period of 20 years beginning on the commencement of this Act, or five years from the death of the tenant <Col N="1390" /> or the tenant's spouse, whichever period shall last expire.</P>
    <P>I think that would be fairer and would improve the situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section dealing with registration. This was also to be included in our Bill which was being drafted prior to the change of Government.  It is important that this register should exist and I am glad it will not be only for controlled tenancies but for all rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>When legislation of this type is being drafted, while the sympathy of the House and the thrust of the arguments would be for greater protection for the tenants, it must be remembered that the landlords also have rights.  We should not pass legislation which will damage the legitimate rights of the landlord.  It is important to have an adequate supply of private rented accommodation.  In our last budget and Finance Bill we included specific tax incentives for landlords to get involved in the construction of private rented accommodation.  We recognised as a Government the importance of having an adequate supply of private rented accommodation.  This is for the benefit not only of the landlord but it is also important for those anxious to live in rented accommodation.  The law of supply and demand would mean that the more flats and rented accommodation available, the lower the rents would be for tenants.  In discussing this legislation we must recognise the legitimate rights of the landlord as well as those of the tenants.</P>
    <P>The legislation has raised as many problems as it attempts to solve.  It raises a problem as to its constitutionality and a problem with regard to the commitment of security of tenure.  While on the one hand security of tenure will be written on a piece of paper, on the other hand there is the difficulty that rents will be set, and even with the system of rebates there will in most cases be considerable increases in the rents to be paid.  In the event of the tenant not being in a position to pay the rent he or she will be liable to eviction no matter how good the intentions are with regard to security of tenure.  The <Col N="1391" /> legislation also raises problems with regard to the whole District Court process and how the District Court, as presently constituted, will handle the massive number of cases that will be brought before it.  Many complex questions will have to be decided by the District Court.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill does not meet the commitments made by the two parties in Government in their election promises and in the period prior to the election.  There is no reference whatever to the fair rents tribunal to which both parties committed themselves.  The Labour Party at the time of the election spoke of only one element dealing with the whole landlord and tenant area and that was the setting up of a fair rents tribunal.  There was not anything else in their election programme about this matter and surely they at least would attempt to honour that commitment. We will be going into the Bill in greater detail on Committee Stage when the House will be asked to consider amendments to improve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. B. Allen Mr. B. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I go into the details of the Bill I should like to remind the House of one point that must be considered in connection with its introduction. The Bill was not introduced by choice by the Government but forced on them by a Supreme Court decision of 29 July last.  The problems raised are ones that have existed for generations and have arisen because at present we have 30,000 controlled tenancies.  In approaching the problem raised by the Supreme Court decision the Government had to tread very carefully.  The Government had to strike a very fine balance between what the tenant required, what the landlord considered necessary and the constitutional position.  Since the Supreme Court decision I have asked people in my constituency for their views and I found it brought hope to landlords and deep despair, fear and anxiety to many tenants. A lot of the tenants had reared families in bad and overcrowded conditions and later had improved their homes but now found themselves facing the prospect of having to pay a huge increase in rent or, failing that, eviction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1392" /> The Government in drafting the legislation had to attain three objectives. They had to attain the objective of security of tenure for the tenant, cater for the constitutional rights of landlords and they had to frame a Bill which would pass a constitutional test at some stage.  The Government were placed in a Solomon position and the Bill they drafted has all the wisdom of a Solomonite decision. Nobody would be foolish enough to believe that the Bill will satisfy everybody. The tenants I have met in the course of my business are disappointed with some aspects of it and landlords I have spoken to are also disappointed. However, the opposing parties in this problem area should forget about the pound of flesh syndrome and accept the Bill as a genuine attempt to bring rights into the area of landlord and tenant affairs.</P>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Burke replying to the Minister's excellent presentation I scribbled down some notes complimenting him on his constructive approach to the Bill.  I was pleasantly surprised with the manner of his reply at the outset.  I noted that it was probably the first time since I became a Member that the Opposition had embarked upon a constructive approach to a very serious issue.  However, his approach took a subsequent nose-dive and the remainder of his speech was purely political footballing of a very serious nature.  I was very disappointed with his attitude from there on. I will reply later to some of the points raised by him.  For too long the fears, the prejudices and the anxieties of the public have been exploited in this House and I am hoping that the Bill will be looked upon as a genuine attempt to get out of a serious problem and will not become a political football.</P>
    <P>In my constituency a number of areas have been affected by this problem.  I have met many people and discussed this problem with them since the Supreme Court decision.  I found that 75 per cent of the people affected are over 60 years of age.  Many of the people concerned are widows and 60 per cent of them are in receipt of some form of social welfare payments, while 19 out of 20 of those <Col N="1393" /> who are employed are in badly paid jobs. In other words, those tenants are very vulnerable and must depend on Government agencies to help them overcome the problem created by the new situation.  In many cases the tenants have been in the dwellings for many years.  From time to time lukewarm approaches have been made by landlords for increased rents but these were not successful.  In the majority of cases the properties were allowed to run down so that many of them are now in a very bad condition.  The implementation of this legislation will cost the State many millions of pounds each year.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that there is reference in the Minister's brief to State aid for people who will be in distress in the new situation.  There are 30,000 controlled tenancies and, consequently, the problem is a major one.  There are two sides to the controlled tenancy situation.  First, the tenant finds it impossible to have repairs carried out while on the other hand the landlord is not in a position to keep the property in proper repair because of the low rents involved.  Very often there is a bad relationship between himself and the tenant.  There has been known frequently to be harrassment of the tenant by the landlord and in some instances there have been evictions, legal or otherwise.  These properties are often ones that were inherited by the landlords who were not in a position to maintain them properly.  Very often tenants were forced to leave their accommodation because of the condition of the property and this forced them to apply for local authority housing which had to be provided at the expense of the State. Because of all the problems involved, the housing stock diminished but I am confident that this legislation will lead to a big improvement in that situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke expressed serious reservations about the District Court procedures that are to be used in the arbitration of disputes between landlords and tenants and he reminded us about the Fine Gael commitment in their election manifesto concerning the setting up of rent tribunals.  Deputy Burke should know very well that the setting up of such a system is a complex process and requires <Col N="1394" /> a lot more time than the mere five months we have been in office.  There was no attempt to set up any such process in the many years of Fianna Fáil Government. This Government were faced with an emergency situation that had to be resolved before the middle of next month.  Fortunately, the Minister and his Minister of State set about their task in a way that I am confident will solve the problem.</P>
    <P>On my first reading of the Bill I was somewhat concerned about the references to the District Court procedures but on re-reading it I realised the protection that was being provided for tenants in this way.  They will be allowed costs because if a landlord opts to take a case to court he will have to pay the legal costs of the tenant.</P>
    <P>I welcome the powers being given to the Minister to set up a register of uncontrolled tenancies.  This is long overdue.  I welcome the Bill but I have some reservations about the District Court procedures. However, I am sure that given sympathetic handling, the problems can be overcome.  I appeal to other Members not to say anything that might increase the anxieties and fears of those tenants who are under pressure because of the changed situation.  We could make a political football of this issue but I am confident that the Bill will be accepted in the spirit in which it was presented.  It is a Bill that had to be brought before the House in a very short time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> I intend my contribution to be a balanced contribution taking into account the situation of both the landlords and the tenants concerned.  The Minister tells us that the Bill represents a balanced approach to a difficult legal problem.  I appreciate fully the legal implications involved for the draftsmen and the Government in view of the Supreme Court decision.  I say that having due regard for the judgement of the Supreme Court.  However, that judgment has caused much distress and anxiety to many people particularly since those affected are among the most vulnerable <Col N="1395" /> in the community.</P>
      <P>There is a fundamental issue involved here and it will affect the lives of between 70,000 and 80,000 people.  I would have preferred if more time had been available for the interested parties in particular to study the Bill and to make further recommendations to the Minister.  Undoubtedly, though, the Minister has had many representations on the matter but more time should have been made available for further representations.  However, I realise that the Bill had to be finalised before the end of January and this created an urgency having regard to the Christmas Recess.</P>
      <P>The Government knew the urgency of this Bill and I believe if greater effort had been made the Bill could have been circulated a month ago.  This would have given us a better chance to study it and see if it could be improved.  About 35,000 tenants will be affected by the Bill.  I do not have to tell the House that those people differ considerably from the people who live in uncontrolled rented accommodation.  The people we are dealing with in this Bill have been living in their houses for a minimum of 20 years. Many of them have been living in those houses for 40 years and their families have been living in them for 100 years. They never considered themselves in the same position as people living in uncontrolled rented accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has always been the ambition of people living in uncontrolled rented accommodation to move out of that accommodation and buy houses of their own.  We know that the majority of those people live in uncontrolled rented accommodation for three or four years in different parts of the city.  They get married and then start buying houses of their own. They never set down roots in any part of the city.  But we are speaking of a different group of people who will be affected by this Bill.  Their fathers and grandfathers lived in those dwellings, I know many of them.  The majority of the dwellings I am speaking about are in the large urban areas.  Many of those dwellings go back to <Col N="1396" /> the pre-forties.  Those families have been in those houses since the start of the century.  Their grandfathers and fathers were there before them and they became part of the community.  Their children went to school in the local schools, they participated actively in the local community and they always looked on those dwellings as their homes, although they lived in rented accommodation.  As they had a fixity of tenure they never considered they would be put in the situation they are in today.</P>
    <P>The courts will have to take into consideration many aspects in deciding the rent which those people will have to pay and also the length of the tenancy.  Many of the people living in those dwellings are old.  I am sure the Minister has got a survey from the private tenants' association outlining in detail the different categories of the people living in controlled rented accommodation, their standard of living, where they are working and their age groups.  I am sure it has been pointed out to the Minister that those people are the most vulnerable section of the community. I can only speak for this city but I am sure the same can be said for the other cities.</P>
    <P>The most important effect this Bill will have is that the people living in controlled rented accommodation will now know they have not a completely guaranteed tenancy.  I know the guaranteed tenancy will be there for the present tenants but it will not be there for the family who succeed the parents.  The son or daughter is living with the parents in many of those dwellings.  Those people will now find that when the rented period has elapsed &mdash; I know 20 years is specified but it can elapse shortly after the present tenants die &mdash; they have not guaranteed tenancy. We can visualise the present tenants in many of those houses now aged about 50 years who could live for another 20 years so that when those people die their successors could get a notice to quit the following week because the period named in the Bill will have elapsed.  That section of the Bill will cause stress to the people I am referring to.</P>
    <P>When we look at the effect of the Rent Restrictions Act it is quite obvious that <Col N="1397" /> it is the tenant who will suffer in the long run.  I know there were certain anomalies as far as the landlord was concerned, but it is obvious to me that if we look back over the history of the tenancy of those people we realise that many of the people who occupy those dwellings today would be in a better position if there was no control.  Those people would possibly be housed by local authorities.  They would have been moved out into local authority houses but because of the protection they had they stayed on in those houses.  Many of those houses are in very bad condition but those people remained in them hoping that at some time they would be able to buy them at a reasonable price.  Those who remained on in those houses will find they can only buy their houses now if they pay the market price.  Many of those people who remained in those houses would not have been able to remain in them if market values had obtained over the past 30 to 40 years. They would have been moved out to subsidised units in local authority areas. Many of the other families who moved out to local authority houses 25 years ago bought their houses from the local authorities at reduced rates.  I know people in the Crumlin and Drimnagh areas who purchased local authority houses for £1,200 and £2,000.  If rent control never existed quite a substantial number of the people living in controlled rented accommodation now would have moved out of those houses 20 years ago. They would now be in local authority houses which they had bought and they would have a guaranteed tenancy.  Rent restrictions, which many people thought was an advantage, is now proving a disadvantage. The people in controlled rented accommodation now find themselves at the other end of the scale.  This has a fundamental bearing on the type of people we are dealing with in this Bill. Those people have my sympathy.</P>
    <P>The Bill is quite specific in relation to rent and the ability to pay.  It is left to the District Court to adjudicate on the rent. It deems that a house is a vacant house and it is valued accordingly.  The section does not make a difference between a person whose family has occupied a <Col N="1398" /> house for 100 years and a person who has occupied it for three or four years.  The courts are not allowed any discretion in the matter.  Provision should be made to take account of the length of tenancy when the district justice is adjudicating on the rent.  As I have stated, in many instances families have been in occupation of premises for nearly 100 years and regard should be had to this.</P>
    <P>I presume that the decision of the District Court will be that rents should be fixed at market value because that court will have to consider the ruling of the Supreme Court.  If rents are to be based on market value, the Government will have to take positive steps to subsidise the rents.  I presume the private tenants' association sent details of a survey to the Minister with regard to this matter.  Several surveys were taken in the Dublin area but I am sure that what holds for the city of Dublin would also apply to the rest of the country.  One survey showed that on average 50 per cent of tenants were over 66 years, that 27 per cent were between the ages of 51 and 60 years, that just 10 per cent were under 50 years, that 62 per cent were females, the majority of whom were single people or widows, and that 67 per cent of people living alone were more than 60 years.  It is obvious that if the courts decide that the rent should be based on market value there is no way the majority of those people can afford to pay it.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker said the Minister was trying to get a fair balance between security of tenure and the constitutional rights of the landlord and I am sure that is what he was trying to do.  However, he has not adopted a positive approach with regard to helping these people.  We have had nothing from the Minister other than a brief statement of his intentions but he did not spell them out.  He did not do anything to allay the fears of the 30,000 people who are concerned about this problem.  He did not say how he proposed to alleviate the hardship that will be imposed on them when this Bill comes into operation.</P>
    <P>We have not been told how this measure will be operated.  Will it be done through the health boards, the Department <Col N="1399" /> of Social Welfare or the local authorities?  All we have had is a vague reference about the Minister's concern in the matter but that is not good enough. A vulnerable section of the community are worried that they may be evicted because of their inability to pay the rents that will be fixed when this Bill comes into operation.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have bought a house in the past 15 years are aware of how house prices have spiralled.  In any given year house prices have far exceeded inflation or the CPI.  In the past five years these prices have exceeded the rate of inflation by 10 or 15 per cent.  What guidelines will be used?  Will the CPI or the market value be the main criterion for deciding the value?  If market value is the criterion, I pity the personnel in the District Courts who will have to adjudicate on these cases.</P>
    <P>Much of this situation has developed because of our approach to rented accommodation.  We should have taken positive steps years ago to provide more rented accommodation.  We should not have adopted the concept that everybody should own a house.  If more rented accommodation were available it would reduce house prices because if there was not such competition many houses would not cost the peak prices now obtaining. Unfortunately we did little about the rented accommodation sector.  We know what happens when the universities and colleges re-open each year.  There is an influx of thousands of students trying to get rented accommodation and we know how impossible that is for them.  We know also that the rents they pay are much more than they can afford.  We should take positive steps to rectify the situation.  I am especially concerned about the value that will be placed on these rents.</P>
    <P>The Private Tenants' Action Group submitted their case to the Minister and they stated as follows:</P>
    <P>Current market rents are spoken of frequently as the obvious and the most equitable rent that such tenants should be asked to pay.  We disagree.  In the <Col N="1400" /> section dealing with the tenant-right, it was stated that the tenant had a basic right to continue undisturbed in possession provided that the rent was paid, which would have been presumed to have been a market-rent at the time when the contract between landlord and tenant was first entered into.  One must presume that since both freely entered upon this contract, it was considered more or less equitable by both sides.  Now since the tenant has paid the contracted rent, he must still be considered to be the rightful tenant.  In other words, he is not the same as a person who is entering upon a completely new tenancy.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court decision points in effect to the right of the landlord not to be made the sole victim of the massive inflation of the last twenty years. It follows therefore that he was entitled to a rent commensurate with the increase in the cost of living, so that his original contract with the tenant would have maintained its value.  Had government action been taken to ensure this, it is hard to see how the present crisis could have arisen; it is hard to see how the original rent, controlled so that it kept pace with the cost of living, could have been unjust to the landlord.  Had this been done, the landlord would have no possible ground for complaint; and (what is more important to note now) the tenant would not be made the victim of a property-inflation that far outpaces the overall increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>It should be faced squarely that if the new rent to be paid is full market rent, then the tenant is victimised financially, just as the landlord was prior to 1981.  Whether the tenant can pay a current market rent is not at issue, be it noted.  He is still unfairly and exclusively (in relation to the landlord and in comparison with owner-occupied houses) singled out to bear the burden of the contemporary house-property inflation.</P>
    <P>It should be clear, therefore, that to set a new rent at full market value level would be to victimise the tenant.  Furthermore, it would amount to treating <Col N="1401" /> the tenant as though he were entering upon a totally new tenancy, and therefore it would be ignoring the tenant's basic rights as tenant: viz. the right to continue undisturbed as tenant provided he paid a rent which would have been a market rent at the outset of the tenancy.</P>
    <P>The only equitable solution to the problem of fixing new rents for the affected tenants is to take the original rent agreed upon by the landlord and tenant and work out (through reference to the CPI) what that rent would amount to in 1981 figures.  Note that this would presume that every year, from the inauguration of the tenancy to 1981, the landlord received the full increases that he could have received, had rent been tied to CPI increases.</P>
    <P>This is probably the fairest way of dealing with this section.  Some landlords may have owned property for many years but others have purchased during the past four or five years hoping that something like this would happen.  Some landlords have, on the other hand, been victimised by rent control and I hope the District Court will take into consideration the different situations of landlords who purchased houses in recent years and those who have owned property all their lives. It will be interesting to see what decisions the court will make.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Government are reneging on their promise to establish a rents tribunal.  The previous speaker said that it would take a long time to establish it but there was no indication or promise in the Minister's speech to establish a rents tribunal.  The Minister simply looked at the 1941 Act and decided to ask the District Court to deal with this matter.  Enormous problems will be created when an avalanche of applications descends on the District Court.  I do not believe the court have the personnel or the expertise to deal with thousands of applications.  All landlords have a right to seek redress and will apply immediately and there will be many disputes regarding the input of tenants.  Of course, tenants will dispute the claims of the landlords and <i>vice versa.</i> A proper <Col N="1402" /> rents tribunal should be established by the Government side by side with this legislation.</P>
    <P>I disagree with bringing old people into the courts.  Many of them have never stood in a court in their lives and that environment is not suitable for thrashing out arguments between old age pensioners and landlords.  For many of these old people the thought of appearing in court is shattering.  Under the present system they can be picked at random to serve on a jury and I have had to approach the registrar on numerous occasions to gain exemptions for widows and old age pensioners. This is an example of how they view the courts.</P>
    <P>We should have a different environment altogether for old people.  There is no doubt that the landlords will be able to claim the increase without facing the court.  I hope that we will have a different format that will make it easier for the tenant to tell the judge or whoever would be presiding at the tribunal exactly his or her side of the story.  It is important that the tenant give evidence before the respective courts.  Some of the Ministers now on those benches gave an undertaking that that would be the case.  The Government have reneged on that undertaking. Certainly confusion will arise in the District Court when this avalanche of applications comes before them.  I cannot see how they will be handled.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned yesterday that he expected this Bill to go to the Supreme Court.  I would like to put on record that I know the implications of it and I know also the difficulties of drafting a Bill which tries to guarantee certain rights to tenants and the constitutional rights of landlords.  It is not easy.  Where the rights of landlords are enshrined as they are in this Bill, the Government must be charged with the solemn obligation of protecting other people who will be affected.  I am not making a case for those who can afford the increases, I am making a case for those who cannot afford to pay the rent increases which will be imposed, the old age pensioners, widows, old people living alone.  In many cases in these old dwellings the mother and father have died and the last member <Col N="1403" /> of the family has stayed on in the house. Many such people are not married, the majority are in the lower income group and many suffer ill-health.  I hope the Minister will spell out here this evening what provisions he intends to make to allay the fears of these people who are really worried about what their position will be when this Bill comes into effect. They are realists and they know what their incomes are.  Many of them are on social welfare, long disability benefit and assistance.  They know what they can pay, and they know that their rents will be increased substantially.  That will worry them every hour of every day until the Minister comes forward with some positive proposal to relieve that situation.  I am disappointed that such is not mentioned in the Bill.  The Minister must appreciate fully that such people cannot meet rents at present day values.  Everyone realises that, but the Minister here this morning made only a vague reference to it without spelling out what he is going to do.  I would have thought that the proper course would be to let the rent tribunal handle all these matters.  They would be in a position to investigate the means of each applicant and to direct the local authorities, health boards, corporations and so on as to what subvention or subsidy should be given to a tenant. They would have the machinery.  Here we have merely a fragmented statement from the Minister with no firm commitment as to what he is going to do.  That is lacking in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned tenancy during the life of a tenant and his spouse. If he has that guarantee and the Minister comes in with complete subsidisation that is all right.  However, I am not happy about the relative period which obtains in the Bill especially if a son or daughter has married and settled in that house.  If the husband or wife dies in maybe 20 years' time that person will have only a year or even less to get out of the house because the relative period will have elapsed.  An investigation may be worth while to see if that can be remedied.</P>
    <P>A submission from the private tenants' association suggests that local authorities <Col N="1404" /> should consider whether it is reasonable to allow tenants to purchase these houses.  The Government will have to make up their minds that many of these tenants will not be in a position to pay and they will have to be housed by the local authorities.  Local authority houses recently built in the centre of the city cost something in the region of £30,000.  I am referring to the Coombe, the markets and places like that.  The Minister can work out for himself what the rents of such houses will be.  The Minister should look at this matter to see if this is practicable and wise for people to purchase many of these houses.  A look at the CPI and inflation over the past 20 or 30 years may reveal that the cost is not as high in relative terms as it might seem.  I hope that he will look at it to see if there is a possibility of these houses being bought by the occupants.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981, refers to a phasing-in operation from 40 per cent, 55 per cent, 70 per cent, 85 per cent, moving into the full amount in 1986.  This year the tenant will have to carry a 40 per cent increase.  Unfortunately the full impact of the increase will become operative in 1986 and in that year also the incomes will be due for review because the five years will have elapsed.  Therefore, the income review and the impact of the full rent will come together.  That will create hardship in 1986.</P>
    <P>Is it advisable to have a five-year rent review at all?  I know that in commercial business reviews occur all the time and there can be huge jumps, perhaps in the region of 70 or 80 per cent in the rents of many commercial businesses in the city today.  Commercial businesses can deal with that situation.  Provision is made during the three or four years leading up to it, in the course of their costings in anticipation of this review and they are better able for the impact than a private dweller.  A gradual process would make things much easier for the tenant.  A five year review creates problems for the weaker section of the community.  The review could preferably have been phased in the drafting of the Bill, avoiding the sudden impact of a five year <Col N="1405" /> review.  A CPI of 15 per cent or, worse still, the 20 per cent inflation rate which we have been experiencing, would involve a doubling of rent over that period.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with a landlord's power to recover buildings under certain conditions for family reasons and so forth.  This complete section is contained in the 1941 Bill.  A condition is Section 12 (e) of the present Bill is that the landlord requires vacant possession to carry out a scheme of development of property which includes the dwelling and has planning permission for the scheme.  I know of a case at present where a landlord who has a scheme of development has acquired three houses over the past four or five years, but in between two of these houses there is one house occupied by a widow and her two children.  Two of his houses have been de-tenanted and he has allowed them to go into complete disrepair. In this section, in respect of recovery of possession under paragraphs (d) and (e) the landlord must pay such sums as the court considers reasonable to meet the expenses incurred by the tenants in quitting the dwelling, together with a sum not exceeding two years' rent of alternative accommodation which is reasonable and suited to the residential need.  What will this widow's situation be?  Will it be the duty and obligation of the landlord to purchase a house suitable to her requirements? What obligation would that section place on the landlord?</P>
    <P>There was a case to be made for the landlord's point of view, but this Bill has caused frustration on all sides.  It was a difficult Bill to draft.  Those affected by it have been caused the greatest amount of mental anguish.  I hope that within the next week the Minister will be able to allay the fears of thousands of people affected.  He must spell out his intentions, as he did not do in his ambiguous and brief statement today.  He should spell out, on this very sensitive issue, how he intends to subsidise these tenants.  The quicker that is done the better.  Otherwise many of these people will have a very unhappy Christmas in consequence of this Bill.  Having enjoyed protection of tenancy during their father's and grandfather's <Col N="1406" /> time, they will find their rights being taken away and be completely unable to meet the conditions which will be imposed upon them.  The Minister must show a proper commitment by indicating in plain language his intention to ensure the protection of these people. When the Bill goes through the House next week I hope we will not have to spend Christmas explaining to these people merely that the Minister envisages certain reliefs as regards certain things and nothing more.  That is not good enough.  Having brought the Bill to the House, the Minister must fulfil his obligations to these people.</P>

      <P>First and foremost, I welcome this Bill and compliment the Minister on the introduction of the Temporary Rent Restriction Bill which enables people to assess the whole situation. Nonetheless, I would be less than honest if I did not say that I have some reservations and it is for that purpose that I rise to my feet.  The mechanism by which these reservations can be met is available.</P>
      <P>This Bill would afford tenants, particularly older tenants of long standing in the private sector, some measure of security which they now see threatened.  I do not on this occasion wish to become involved in a personal attack on Members of the Opposition, but if they criticise legislation it behoves them and everyone else to offer a reasonable alternative.  I have not heard any reasonable alternative to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am mainly concerned about section 9 of the Bill, where scales could be introduced over a period of five years.  I intend to move an amendment before the Bill is finally passed.  There could be a situation where, within this period of five years, the rent could be increased by 100 per cent.  This would be unacceptable to people on a fixed income, social welfare recipients, pensioners who would not have the benefit of clauses to insure against inflation.  For that reason it should be set down that 10 per cent or 15 per <Col N="1407" /> cent of their income &mdash; and I would be opposed to anything higher than that&mdash; should be the maximum that they would have to pay in rent.  An amendment of this nature would go a good way towards allaying the fears of people who now feel threatened.  It is significant that of the few people we have here today, three on the Government side are from the Cork constituency.  This gives an idea of the magnitude of the problem in this area. People are facing Christmas in a very worried frame of mind.  I have no doubt that the Minister will respond to the pleas made on their behalf.  Some of them have lived up to 70 years in these dwellings, some having been born in them.  Some have spent their life savings in upgrading them and making them more comfortable. I know of many such cases.  There are some dangers in section 6 which provides for the fixing of new rents by the courts.  It creates an open-ended situation which could very easily be abused.  So I would like to see some amendment to that section.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the explanatory memorandum that the Bill is founded on important principles in the Constitution, particularly the rights of private property.  I feel that the Bill leans a little too much towards the interests of private property. I accept that in the past property has been allowed to run down because of the very low rents paid by some tenants.  Consequently local authorities were expected to pick up the slack by housing people who were living in very poor conditions in the private sector.  Over all I welcome this measure.  I appreciate that the Minister has had very little time to come up with something that would be acceptable to both sides.  But I have no doubt that he will listen and respond to the needs of the weaker sections of our community.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been levelled at the Coalition partners that we have reneged. That is a rather emotive term in this context of dealing with a very sensitive area.  It does not become Members of this House to speak in this manner because many of the people we are dealing with are old and, in many cases, infirm.  There is a need for both sides to put their heads <Col N="1408" /> together and come up with an acceptable solution.  There has been no reneging on the part of the Labour Party.  I admit that I was one of the people who opposed entering into a Coalition.  But from my experience to date I have found that our partners have behaved in an honourable manner and I expect them to continue to do so.  At the end of the day I sincerely hope that we will come up with something that will be acceptable to both landlord and tenant.  If we can do that we can say that justice has prevailed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most complex legislation that has been brought before the House for some time.  It is complex because of the Supreme Court ruling and because of the terms of reference laid down in the Bill.  We on this side of the House gave an undertaking that we would not hold up the Bill unduly.  Therefore we are not in a position to go into it in as much detail as we would like.</P>
      <P>First, I am not happy about the fixing of rents by the District Court because the people in the courts are legal people who generally deal with law and not rented accommodation and different types of accommodation.  This is a very broad area.  There are many types of accommodation, luxury accommodation, grade A accommodation, grades B and C and so on down the scale.  In addition the landlords will probably be in a position to hire the necessary legal people to look after their interests, whereas the tenants, which include pensioners and people on low incomes, may not be in that position. Such people have probably never been in a District Court at any type of hearing before and will be reluctant to go to court, but will have no alternative if they are not happy with their position.  I do not wish to cast aspersions on the courts, but I am not happy that the legal people and the Judiciary will be able to handle a situation like this.  This legislation is new; it is on a new issue &mdash; accommodation, where people live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are the courts in a position to judge what is a fair rent?  I believe that a tribunal with the necessary qualified people might be a way around that.  If it is left to the courts there will be an avalanche of <Col N="1409" /> cases before them and they will become bogged down and other essential matters before the courts may not be dealt with as urgently as will be required.  There may be anything up to 30,000 cases before the courts in any one year.  It is difficult to know what the actual number will be but, judging by the backlog of other work, we will be putting an extra burden on the courts and that is something that must be looked into.  I have grave reservations in this matter.  I have explained the reasons for my reservations in detail.  I believe the courts may not be able to cope with the situation.</P>
    <P>It is easy for people to accuse this side of the House of not putting forward alternatives. When a Bill is introduced every Member has an obligation to examine the measure to see exactly what is involved. We may be asked later by constituents why we put this extra expense on the taxpayer because any legislation passed here can be contested in the courts and it is our duty to ensure that we do the very best we can to see that everyone gets fair play.  In the case of those on low incomes the Minister said some kind of help would be given.  He did not spell out from whence that help would come, whether from the health boards, the local authorities or through social welfare. There are many on low incomes, such as old age pensioners and others, and as a result of the court decision they are faced with an increase in the first year of almost 40 per cent.  When the Minister comes to reply I hope he will tell those on low incomes what financial help will be forthcoming to enable them to meet this increased burden.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party in their manifesto said they would bring in a fair rents tribunal and introduce a new tax credit for private tenancies up to a maximum of £1,000 rent.  It seems now that has gone out the door as well.  It is no longer on. I do not know what the position of the Labour Party is in all this.  They are in coalition and therefore they must share some of the blame.  Fine Gael have backed away completely from that manifesto promise.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a register by local <Col N="1410" /> authorities is a good idea.  I welcome it. Provision is made for that in this Bill. The fixing of rents is a very difficult matter. I appreciate the position but I know there are many people in rented accommodation for a number of years who are very worried about all this.  They fear they will not be able to meet this commitment. They do not even know what the extra sum will be.</P>
    <P>According to the Bill it is the District Court which will deal with these cases. Landlords will be in a position to avail of the best legal brains.  It is also very difficult to visualise the kind of rents because they will very from county to county. They will also vary from the point of view of the actual accommodation.  Of course with the introduction of the register by local authorities we will know exactly who has accommodation and what type of accommodation it is.  I believe that when this Bill becomes law certain sections of it will be brought to the courts for decision and I am glad that that will be the case.  But if that is to be the case it should be cleared up as quickly as possible and the matter put right.</P>
    <P>I should like to have spelled out also the amount of subsidy that will apply to tenants and the categories that will be involved.  This is an involved matter. Many tenants will be in need of financial help and a good case can be made for all of them.  They will need help to pay their rents, whether that help will be from the Department of Social Welfare, the health boards or local authorities.</P>
    <P>Before we left office the legislation we brought in was in the form of an enabling Bill.  I hope that the legislation now before us will spell out exactly what is involved.  I hope some of the anomalies I have referred to will be ironed out. What will be the position after five years if rents are to be increased, and I have no doubt they will be?  Should such increases not be part of the CPI?  When the Bill goes into Committee I suggest an amendment should be introduced fixing future rents and the affected tenants should be told what to expect in the future.</P>
    <P>Another matter to be considered is the variety of types of accommodation.  In <Col N="1411" /> Dublin a lot of the rented accommodation will be grade A luxury apartments. In other parts of the country, however, the accommodation will not be so good. Will there be scales of rents to correspond with the types of accommodation?  I have reservations about the ability of the District Court to deal with this.  Without meaning disrespect to that court, I do not think it will be competent to deal with the many complex situations that will arise under the Bill.  The court will have to deal with constitutional matters among other things.</P>
    <P>Another problem will be in regard to tenants.  Many old people who will be affected have never been in the District Court and would hate the thought of having to be.  Many tenants will be old age pensioners and the cost of these proceedings will be high, the cost of getting legal advice and of being represented in court.  Another vital matter arises from that.  Those people will be in the low income bracket.  Will they have the right to free legal aid?  I hope the Minister will make this clear when he is replying.  I have looked through the Bill and I do not see any provision for free legal aid.  I have not much sympathy for the owners or landlords who will be well able to pay legal people to represent them.  As I said at the beginning, this Bill involves many complex matters, particularly because of the Supreme Court ruling.  The rights of both tenants and landlords must be looked after and we must ensure that the Bill which we pass will be fair to the underprivileged particularly, people who are not in a position to enter into major financial commitments.  Therefore, their position in the future will have to be spelled out in the Bill.  If not, there could be different interpretations of how it should be done.  Legal people will put up all kinds of arguments.  They are very good at that.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the points I wished to raise.  I am not knocking the Bill in any way.  I understand fully that the necessary legislation had to be introduced to protect people in rented accommodation. Between now and next week we may be able to put down amendments to make <Col N="1412" /> the Bill more workable.  We want the Bill to work and to be fair.  We will not oppose for the sake of opposition.  If we see something wrong we will oppose it, and we approve of the good provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamBurke" hpid="Mr. L. Burke Mr. L. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I am very glad to have this opportunity to speak in support of this Bill.  As the Minister pointed out quite rightly, the rent restrictions legislation had many faults, not least of which was that it did little to encourage growth and development in the private rented sector which is the important part of our national housing stock.  The Bill, which deals almost exclusively with the controlled sector, provides a right balance between the interests of landlords and tenants.  On the one hand, landlords are assured of a reasonable return on their investment.  On the other hand, tenants are provided with protection against unscrupulous landlords seeking exorbitant rent increases for the purpose of regaining possession.  The terms of the tenancy can be agreed between the landlord and the tenant, or set by the court in default of agreement.</P>
      <P>The security of tenure provision in the Bill will do much to relieve the anxieties of tenants of controlled dwellings especially in the Power Street and Dillon's Cross area of my constituency in Cork city.  It is noticeable from the news reports that the Bill has not found favour with the landlord or tenant organisations. This may be a good indication that the Government have struck the right balance between the conflicting interests of the two groups.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, this Bill raises a number of complex constitutional questions.  He may be right in saying there would be value in having the matter decided once and for all by the Supreme Court.  From what has been said, it seems that reference to the Supreme Court is a matter for the President, so we will have to wait and see what happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the Minister's commitment to provide assistance for tenants suffering hardship following rent increases, and I welcome the rebate provision in the Bill. These are very important indications of <Col N="1413" /> the Government's approach in this area. Many tenants of controlled dwellings are poor and will need help.  It is reassuring to know the Government have the interests of these people at heart and that they will be helped where help is needed.  The rebate provision will go some way towards cushioning tenants against the immediate effects of higher rents.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the rebate provision and the assistance to be provided by the Government, I am happy that the proposals we are debating are a fair and reasonable solution to what we all agree is a complex and difficult area with far-reaching implications for the welfare of the large body of tenants involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ClementCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister and the Minister of State on the introduction of this important Bill.  I wish them both success in their endeavours in a very difficult and complex sphere.  My concern is directed to the implications in the Bill for people in my constituency.  When the Minister is replying I should like him to give us whatever statistics he can in relation to the figure of 30,000 dwellings mentioned.  I may be misquoting the figure.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the degree of involvement of the local authorities in formulating and tabulating an assessment of the register contained in the Bill.  I am disappointed that the Government did not adhere to the promise in their election manifesto to establish a fair rents tribunal.  Many people, particularly the old and the less well off, have not got great legal minds and they may have difficulty in understanding the implications of the Bill.  A previous speaker welcomed the attempt in the Bill to alleviate anxiety. A large number of elderly people will be very anxious about its implications. The Minister should endeavour to allay those fears and anxieties by providing well documented and easily understandable information for these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that the tribunal is not the operative factor in the rent assessment and that it has been handed over to the courts.  I am not casting aspersions on the courts, but there are those who would say that this legislation is being given into <Col N="1414" /> the hands of people who will have a vested interest in its financial aspects. The implications for elderly people who are not legally minded and even for the general public could be frightening in some instances.  Since the decision has been taken to refer the assessment to the courts, I would ask the Minister to assist these people in every possible way.  There will be degrees of difficulty.  There will be those who will be in a position financially to obtain professional advice and aid, but there will be a large number of people who will not be in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>This gives rise to the question of the ability of the courts to handle this matter. There is also an encroachment on what is accepted at present as a very slow-moving machine.  What additional personnel will be involved?  Earlier somebody raised the question of the ability of a judge to assess rents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there never was any plan to set up a sales office in Letterkenny. If my proposal to set up a headquarters in Letterkenny, to which services could be devolved from Dublin and Sligo, is what the Deputy is referring to, I should say it is not a sales office as such.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy it was not a sales office as such.  I believe the setting up of the office has the goodwill of many members of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in both the postal and telecommunications sections.  But, as I explained to the Deputy on a couple of occasions over the last few days, both services are going semi-State during 1982.  The Deputy will appreciate also that members of different unions are very sensitive about demarcation lines and do not want to see any other branch of the Department taking over work they might want to do.</P>
      <P>For the Deputy's information, as far as the office in Letterkenny is concerned, agreement in a general way was reached by the members, but there was sensitivity about a telephone officer coming into the county.  The post office clerks made the point clearly that the work being done at present in Donegal as far as contracts and sales are concerned should be continued by them.  I respect that decision and their concern about bringing in an outside union.  If one is to decentralise services to Donegal &mdash; a proposal with which I think Deputy Reynolds is in general agreement &mdash; then a telephone officer must go with the transference of the files.  The work I was transferring to Letterkenny is being done by a telephone officer in the Sligo office and the work I want them to do in the Letterkenny office would amount to nothing more or less than what he would be doing with files from Donegal on which he is now working in Sligo.  I thought that it was a reasonable position for me to take up.  But I appreciate and acknowledge publicly that at this time it is not opportune for me or any other person in my position to try to negotiate a new arrangement with any union in view of the forthcoming separation of the postal and telecommunications services.</P>

      <P>In view of what the Minister of State has said now, would he agree that in retrospect it was ill advised of him to get involved in this area of high sensitivity, he now freely admits it is? While it may be logical to set up an office in Letterkenny, it may not be logical to <Col N="1418" /> do so in the Fine Gael headquarters there.  Surely he will admit now that in retrospect he should have consulted the telephone officers' union as well when the project might have got off the ground despite its location and political impact.</P>

      <P>As I explained to Deputy Reynolds, when one starts talking to unions about demarcation lines one discovers it is a very sensitive issue.  I have spoken with the telephone officers' union, I have spoken with all the unions and there is general acceptance that the people of Donegal want this type of service. There is general acceptance by the workers in the post office on all sides that it would be a good idea.  Working out a <Col N="1419" /> formula of words and getting agreement to do it is what is at present inhibiting progress.

      <P>RTE are aware that reception in the areas in question is less than satisfactory, but their priority in the Donegal area is to replace the present obsolete 405-line monochrome single channel service from the Fanad, Moville and Letterkenny transposers with a two channel 625-line colour service.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two Departmentally staffed exchanges in the constituency&mdash;Donegal and Ballybofey.  There are 36 full-time and 20 part-time staff at Donegal and 13 full-time and six part-time staff at Ballybofey.</P>
      <P>Operator services will be retained at Donegal on an interim basis after automatic service is introduced in the area. The volume of operator-assisted traffic there will, however, be greatly reduced under automatic conditions and there will, therefore, be a substantial reduction in the number of staff according as automation proceeds throughout the area dependent on Donegal.</P>
      <P>Ballybofey manual exchange will close when it is converted to automatic working and operator requirements will cease.</P>
      <P>Full-time staff who become surplus to local requirements will have the option of transferring to another exchange or resigning.  Full-time staff transferring will be paid a resettlement allowance and those who opt to resign will be paid compensation.</P>
      <P>Part-time staff are recruited locally for specific exchanges.  It may be possible to offer a small number of them working long hours employment at another exchange but other night staff will have their services terminated and be paid compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already visited the <Col N="1423" /> telephonists in Donegal town and have spoken to them.  As the Deputy acknowledged, when exchanges are made automatic one of the prices that has to be paid is major redundancies of telephonists. That is to be regretted but it is the price of progress.  Most of the people working on switchboards in our telephone service appreciate this and, recognising the great services that have been provided by them, the Department have entered into one of the most generous schemes of redundancy payments ever negotiated with a trade union.  Most of the people who will become redundant are satisfied the money is right but I acknowledge that most of them would like to continue at work.  I have talked with the operators in Donegal; I have an invitation to meet the operators in Ballybofey and I hope to do that as soon as I can arrange a suitable date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not normal for this type of information to be given in the House.  Apparently some Deputies yesterday took exception to the fact that I was acting according to convention.  Generally the terms of agreement are that six week's pay will be paid to all telephonists for every year they have worked, up to a miximum of two years.  A sum of £500 will be paid as a displacement allowance to any girl who opts for a transfer.  Any request for a transfer to a particular exchange will be conceded as far as possible. The unions have a major say in this.  I cannot guarantee anything other than working out some arrangement with the exchange to which the person requests a transfer.  Seniority is another factor.  If a senior person in Donegal town opts to go to Sligo, the line of promotion is a point of contention.  It is a human matter.  I want to pay tribute to the union representatives and members of my staff who negotiated this deal.  In the circumstances it is a very generous one.</P>

Is he aware that out of courtesy and in fear that he might not get the contract he supplied a bond from the Insurance Corporation of Ireland and that it was sent back to him by the Department?  Does the Minister of State not think now that he should understand and comprehend that that is not the manner in which the operations of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have proceeded?  If he says it was wrong in the past it is a reflection on the Department. Secondly, does he think that the people are not aware that it is part of a telecommunications delay tactic in implementing the five-year programme when a Government of six months say there has been a delay of six months in installation and building while they have done nothing?  Would he care to comment on that?</P>

      <P>11 July is not mentioned. I cannot confirm that.  I can tell the Deputy that there are 36 area headquarters placed for contract.  Works are progressing in most of them and some are finished and 26 remain to be dealt with. The question deals with Ennis as one of the 26 remaining to be dealt with.  The first estimated cost of all these headquarters is now out of date.  Among other things, consideration is being given to a new costing of these works and whether, with the experience gained in establishing other area headquarters, more can be provided at a lesser cost.  Some have accommodation which the staff admit is <Col N="1435" /> elaborate.  In other words, for the amount of money involved we may be able to have a much better programme finished much faster.</P>

Others will be brought in again and others brought in from other areas to use the headquarters, but the original plan was to accommodate 240.  I am told by the engineers that they are looking at Ennis and the other 25 area districts to see, from the information they have obtained from the use of the area headquarters now built and in operation, and about to be taken possession of, what facilities would be necessary, what we can afford to pay and how fast we can get the job done.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the reason a person (details supplied) in County Dublin who paid his telephone account in full on 6 October 1981 was disconnected notwithstanding payment of his account on that date; if he is aware that the service was reconnected on 19 October 1981 and that a reconnection fee of £10 was charged; and if the subscriber will now be credited with the £10 already debited to him.</P>

      <P>This subscriber's final notice to pay his account within seven days issued on 16 September and as payment was not received instructions to withdraw outward telephone service were issued on 7 October.  This was done on 9 October.  The subscriber paid his account on 6 October but this payment had not been brought to account before the disconnection instruction issued.  In the circumstances the charge of £10 for reconnection of service is being waived.</P>

Because of cabling and other infrastructure needs that is not always possible.  In this case there are difficulties.  This application was made in January 1981.  This may be a lame excuse but there are people waiting in this city for seven years. I will have instructions given to the engineers to see if there is another way of providing a service.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ClementCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned I was referring to the legal involvement in rent assessment.  I referred briefly to the fact that in their <Col N="1485" /> manifestos the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party assured the electorate that a fair rents tribunal would be set up to assess rents.  That function is now being handed over to the courts.  Many people will express their discontent about that. It will also create a further problem for the courts which, as we all know, are slow-moving.  Shifting this serious problem over to the courts will be a very expensive exercise.  When the Minister is replying I hope he will be able to give us some information on the effect this will have on the courts, and on our overworked and over-taxed system.  I hope he will also be able to give us information on the costs involved.</P>
      <P>A court case can be a very harrowing experience even for people in public life and people who are familiar with the law but, for elderly people and those who are not well off, it can be a very expensive exercise and a difficult and harrowing experience.  It may be felt, as it was felt in relation to other Bills and other inquiries, that this is another bonanza for the legal profession.  It would appear that this will emerge from the Bill.  I wonder have the Government any idea what this will cost the taxpayer.  A number of people will have to get either State aid or free legal aid, at the expense of somebody, in their endeavour to secure their rights in the courts.  Have the Government any idea what is involved here?  I hope that when he is replying the Minister will refer to this matter.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the reference in the legislation to the year 1941. Why was that year mentioned?  Why should this not apply to all premises?  I know it is a complex problem.  I can visualise the difficulties which will emerge because of that isolated aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer now to security of tenure. It is written into the Bill that the tenant and his or her spouse are entitled to remain in possession for life.  In the existing legislation there is a very wide definition of a member of the family.  I can see a problem arising for elderly people who had somebody looking after them for one, two or three years prior to the figure of 20 years mentioned in the Bill.  The person may be a prescribed <Col N="1486" /> relative.  Such people could find themselves with no place to go.  The Government should amend the Bill to cover such problems.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the hardship which will be caused to elderly people, and that gives rise to the question of the degree of subsidy which will be offered to them. For example, people may go into court and find that their rent is to be doubled or trebled as a result of a hearing.  Within a five-year period they will have to carry a very heavy burden.  To protect them the period should be extended beyond the five years mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are cooperating with the Government in attempting to solve this very serious problem.  Both sides of the House feel this is a wide-ranging problem which must be solved.  We are not in one camp or the other, in other words, that of the landlords or the tenants.  We are aiming at finding a fairly balanced solution for both groups.  I should like to add to what previous speakers have said about the necessity for this Bill.</P>

      <P>There are two Bills being discussed by the House, one dealing with rent restrictions and the continuation of the position as it has been since last July until 25 April, and the other dealing with private rented dwellings.  It is hoped that both Bills will go through both Houses of the Oireachtas and, if necessary, will be referred by the President, to the Supreme Court to judge on their constitutionality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In legislating for this area it is essential that this House achieve a balance between the rights and interests of landlords and the rights and interests of tenants.  The Housing (Private Rented <Col N="1491" /> Dwellings) Bill, 1981 is an attempt to find that balance of interests, to protect both sides in this type of situation and to provide legislation which falls within parameters set by constitutional provisions relating to both private property and the common good.  I would draw the attention of the Minister to certain aspects of the Bill and certain modifications that could be made to it as it progresses through the House that would to some extent tighten it up while continuing to maintain the delicate balance between the rights and interests of tenants and landlords that must be preserved.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill applies to the area of houses that come under rent restrictions legislation and also lays down minimum standards to be applicable to all private rented accommodation.  The section confers power on the Minister to make regulations in this regard.  This section could be tightened up.  The intention of the section is to protect the interests and rights of tenants.  Any such provision if it is to have teeth and to be effective must have proper enforcement mechanisms to ensure that those who do not comply with the statutory minimum standards set can be required to do so under the terms of the relevant legislation. As the legislation stands, effectively the obligation would be imposed on the housing authority or the local authority within whose area a particular building is situated to ensure that the minimum standards are complied with.  That procedure will not result in the legislation ensuring that minimum standards are fully and properly complied with in future.  All of us who are members of local authorities and those Members of this House who are not but who have continual contact with local authorities know how overstretched local authorities are and the extent and great expansion of work that has fallen to the officials in the various local authorities and the great dedication of these officials in carrying out their work.  Speaking as a member of Dublin County Council I pay tribute to the officials of the housing section of that council who, no doubt, in the context of <Col N="1492" /> this Bill would have the obligation to ensure that these minimum standards are fully and properly enforced.  When one looks at the amount of private rented accommodation available in Dublin city and county one realises that it is not possible, unless we were to create and expand greatly a form of housing inspectorate within the local authority, for these minimum standards to be enforced properly and fully in the way set down in the Bill.  We should have a second look at this.</P>
    <P>The local authorities should continue to have a role, but an obvious way which would involve far less cost to the State and far less administration would be to confer a right on tenants to enforce such statutory minimum standards as the Bill intends to impose.  If this right was conferred on tenants then the tenants living in these houses would have a real interest in ensuring that the houses are looked after and maintained properly and that landlords comply with minimum standards, as I believe the vast majority of them do.  I suggest that the Bill be amended by the insertion of a clause to the effect that such minimum standards as are laid down in the Bill or imposed by regulations should be implicit terms of any tenancy contract or agreement concluded between a landlord and a tenant. That would afford the tenant an opportunity of enforcing directly such minimum standards without having to depend on the local authority.  It would save the State money in that if proceedings of some nature were to be brought under this legislation the vast majority of cases would be brought by tenants.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the present financial circumstances and the great difficulties we are facing in the future.  We have heard from both sides of the House in recent debates on economic issues about the need to ensure that the non-productive sector of the public service is not expanded at this time because that would only incur debt that this country can ill afford.  Nevertheless, unless we provide a series of house inspectors as I have suggested I would be very worried that the intent of section 14 &mdash; which is good <Col N="1493" /> and the Minister is to be congratulated for what is in the section and such minimum standards are long overdue &mdash; would not be enforced.  If it is to be enforced it should be possible for tenants to enforce it.</P>
    <P>Another means of ensuring that the provisions of this section are enforced is by making it possible if a landlord has not complied with minimum standards for a tenant to obtain damages in court against the landlord.  At present this section merely provides for a fine of up to £500 for non-compliance.  That is not the correct way to deal with this.  In this area the system of prosecution does not work effectively and we have seen that it does not so work in the context of other legislation produced by different administrations that has come out of the Department of the Environment or the Department of Local Government as it was known formerly.  Criminal prosecutions in these circumstances are not effective if they have to be instituted by a local authority.  This provision in section 14 would work far better if it conferred the right on a tenant to enforce the minimum standards and enabled the court before which such proceedings could be brought to order moneys by way of compensation to a tenant upon the landlord being found to be in breach of his obligations.</P>
    <P>A provision in section 3 of the Bill enables the tenant, if he wishes to do so, to surrender the dwelling to the landlord. This has happened in the past and it will happen in the future, and, no doubt, for sound reasons, economic or otherwise, landlords and tenants will opt out of the provisions of the Bill and tenants will be paid compensation for vacating a house of which a landlord wishes to acquire possession.  In some instances tenants may voluntarily return possession of a house for specific reasons, and this has happened even under the old legislation, although rarely.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to another matter of concern that should be clarified to avoid unnecessary litigation under this Bill when enacted.  As the Bill stands at the moment a tenant can effectively surrender his or her interest and the tenant in a marital <Col N="1494" /> situation can be either the husband or the wife.  Under the provisions of the Bill, upon the death of a tenant spouse the remaining spouse will take over or acquire the deceased spouse's interest. We have other legislation which is relevant in this area.  We experienced difficulty in the past with legislation of a technical nature in this whole area of rented accommodation and the legislation applicable today is one of the most difficult and technical areas of law.  Far too often, legislation is drafted concentrating on the direct problems identified with this area, without regard being had to existing legislation which has some implications in the area.</P>
    <P>In this regard I draw the Minister's attention to the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, under the terms of which a spouse cannot dispose of a family home without the consent of the other spouse. A family home can be any type of home. It does not have to be a home being purchased on mortgage, or fully paid for. It can be a rented house, which a husband has rented for his family and which falls within the ambit of this, or any other legislation.  This Act, while expressly providing that a tenant may hand over his interest to a landlord, does not expressly say that the tenant does so validly and legally if he has a spouse and if the rented accommodation is a family home, the consent of that spouse should be sought. My belief is that two married people act together and such consent will be required by lawyers acting for landlords in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>There has been much difficult litigation under the Family Home Protection Act. Indeed, there have been two important High Court cases in the past week, concerning the area of judgment mortgages. What I see as a complex area merits trying to avoid creating any further complexities or difficulties, if they can be avoided.  I urge the Minister to look at this issue.  It would be simple to amend this section of the Act to provide that the consent of the spouse would be required to hand over tenancy of the type of dwelling which comes within the ambit of the Act.  Such provision could avoid unnecessary court procedures and litigation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1495" /> The main tenor of the Act is to ensure that the rights &mdash; as they should be &mdash; of the tenants in these houses are protected in the sense that they have the security of knowing that accommodation in the house &mdash; many of which have been family homes for 20 to 40 years &mdash; will continue to be available to them and that their interest in it should be protected.  This is based on the premise that this accommodation will continue to be of a rented nature.  While the Act provides a mechanism for renegotiation of rents, it provides no mechanisms, other than under other circumstances in which a tenant could lease or surrender a tenancy.</P>
    <P>Take the position of a tenant who has been living in such a house for fifteen or twenty years, has no intention of moving, has complied with all the conditions of his tenancy and, indeed, has a good landlord who is willing to allow him to continue to live in the house and to negotiate a reasonable rent.  The Act envisages that that rental situation will continue.  It is fair to say that many tenants live in rent-controlled accommodation who, over the years, have been anxious to purchase the house from the landlord. Indeed, Members from all sides of this House must come across the situation where a tenant purchased such a house from his landlord prior to the recent Supreme Court case, at a sum greatly below the true value of the House.  I am aware of a number of instances where such negotiations were taking place prior to the Supreme Court declaring the rent restriction legislation unconstitutional. Such negotiations abruptly came to a halt, pending the introduction of this legislation into the House.</P>
    <P>We could usefully include an additional provision in this Act of a mechanism to enable tenants to purchase the house in which they reside, if they so wish &mdash; a mechanism which would not only be in the interests of tenants but of landlords as well.  If a tenant wishes to purchase a dwelling, as the Act stands at the moment, if he negotiates with the landlord and the landlord and tenant cannot reach agreement as to what price should be paid for the house, there is no mechanism <Col N="1496" /> whereby such agreement could be arbitrated.  We could very usefully look at the possibility of including a purchasing mechanism in the Act which sets down procedures in the case where, if the landlord and tenant agree, in principle, to the house being sold by the landlord to the tenant &mdash; and I do not think that we can force the sale &mdash; the one outstanding issue is to agree a price.  One could usefully include in this Act a form of arbitration clause which would empower the court having jurisdiction in the context of the Bill &mdash; the District Court &mdash; upon hearing proper evidence in relation to valuation, to fix an appropriate price to enable such a sale to take place.  That would be in the interests of both parties, landlord and tenant.  That aspect should be very seriously examined and it would add something to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Two aspects of the Bill have been referred to.  One is that the Bill is effectively &mdash; except for section 13 and 14 &mdash; confined to those forms of dwellings previously known as rent-controlled dwellings.  The second aspect is the method of rent fixing set down in section 9 of the Bill.  It is not my intention to refer to these in any detail, as the Minister has indicated that there is a possibility that the Bill, as a whole, will be referred by the President to the Supreme Court to judge on its constitutionality. They are the two particular aspects of the Bill which the Supreme Court might wish to have regard to and about which, it is fair to say, there are conflicting legal opinions but which provisions, one should say in fairness, seek to strike the balance which the Supreme Court has previously intimated, in its judgment, should be struck in this area.</P>
    <P>One aspect should be referred to in the context of section 9 and that is the rent fixing mechanism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a general point which I wish to make in this area, but it <Col N="1497" /> is relevant to the whole Bill as such, as opposed to individual sections.  It reflects upon the whole Bill.</P>
      <P>In relation to section 9, which lays down the rent fixing mechanism, the Minister has mentioned that financial assistance will be or should be available to tenants in the event of there not being circumstances to meet the amounts of rent which the court may fix.  That type of mechanism is already available under the supplementary welfare allowance system. Some criticism has been voiced of the Bill in the context that there is no such mechanism in this Bill.  It should be pointed out to Members opposite who made that criticism that it is not necessary that such mechanism should be in this Bill.  Supplementary social welfare allowance legislation under the Social Welfare Act, 1981 specifically lays down a procedure and circumstances in which persons in need can seek supplementary welfare allowance payments for rent.  To have included such provision in this Bill would have been to duplicate social welfare legislation. There is a provision under the social welfare legislation, but most people are unaware of it.  It needs to be highlighted that this legislation is available. The section concerned with the fixing of rent is effectively concerned with the present lettable value of the premises. But there is one provision in it that I, as a lawyer, would say the courts will have difficulty in enforcing and dealing with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand why it is in this Bill. It is very much part and parcel of the intent of the Bill, which is to strike a balance between landlords and tenants. Subsection (2) of section 9 has a general provision which permits the courts, in certain circumstances, to look not merely at the premises concerned and the lettable value of it but to look at the general financial circumstances of both the landlord and tenant concerned to adjudge, if asked, whether particular proportions of rents should not be payable by the tenant in certain circumstances.  It is a curious provision.  I am not sure how it will work in practice.  I am concerned about it because it seems &mdash; and I say this because it is an area I am familiar with &mdash; to be translating something that is already difficult <Col N="1498" /> in the area of family law into the area of landlord and tenant law.  It smacks somewhat of a maintenance action between landlords and tenants, which is a similar to a maintenance action between husbands and wives.  I understand what is behind that section and the intent of it, which is to strike a balance. But it is a section I am somewhat concerned about in the context of the manner in which the Act will operate.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of the legislation being referred to the Supreme Court, I think the Minister should be congratulated on his statement in relation to this and on his intent to do this.  It is in the interests of landlords and tenants that there be a clear legal statement as to whether or not this Bill is constitutional so that upon its coming into operation there need be no long-drawn-out court cases or disputes about that and so that this House is fully aware of the position and whether matters have been fully dealt with.  Because of the complexity of this area it is a procedure worth using and one that has been used by past administrations from both sides of the House to deal with other difficult legislation about the constitutionality of which there has been a degree of uncertainty due to previous court pronouncements.</P>
    <P>In this regard I would to some extent repeat a plea I made when we had the first Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) Bill before this House in July last.  That is that the first Bill, the Bill that extends the time of the existing provision to 25 April, be extended somewhat further; because, on the basis that this Bill would pass through the House this side of Christmas, the next step will be that the case must be dealt with in the Supreme Court.  It would take a minimum of 60 days for such a case to be processed.  Under the constitutional provisions the Supreme Court has an obligation to produce a decision within 60 days.  If one presumes that the decision will be that the Bill is constitutional the Bill will be then signed by the President and come into force and we will just about make the 25 April limit date.  If the court judges the Bill, or indeed a section of the Bill or a small portion of the Bill, <Col N="1499" /> to be unconstitutional &mdash; and one must be aware of the possibility that that could happen if one is to be realistic about it &mdash; it means that this matter will again come before this House and the effect of that will be that we will have to again extend the existing provision and have a further temporary provisions Bill before us.</P>
    <P>To avoid that happening I would suggest to the Minister that the Bill that intends to continue the present temporary situation continue it up to the end of July and that it contain an additional section to enable the Minister, by statutory instrument, effectively to repeal the Bill or, if that is not possible constitutionally &mdash; and it may not be &mdash; that the second Bill contain a provision to the effect that upon its coming into force the temporary provisions Bill would cease to exist.  It sounds somewhat involved but what I am getting at is that in the event of this present Bill not being judged constitutional, in the event of this matter having again, through no fault of Deputies on either side of this House, to come before this House, that this House should not have to have another temporary provisions Bill coming before it and, in the event of the Supreme Court seeing difficulties with this Bill, there is no doubt that these difficulties could be remedied and dealt with by legislation passed certainly no later than the summer holidays. We should have regard to the possibility of that situation and we should extend the temporary provisions Bill in the manner I am suggesting.</P>
    <P>I am saying this not simply for legalistic reasons but for practical reasons.  I, like many other Deputies, have had many letters from tenants living in private rented accommodation that was formerly rent controlled.  That is the accommodation we are concerned with here.  Many of them are elderly people who are concerned about the implications of what is happening.  It is generally not fully understood that as things stand at the moment their position is protected.  I am anxious that in the event of this Bill or a portion of it being found to be unconstitutional we do not create a lot of unnecessary <Col N="1500" /> alarm to these people and that we will be in a position to assure them that they have still the protection that the Oireachtas wishes to give to them.  In that regard I believe that an extension of the temporary provisions Bill would effectively do that and safeguard their situation.</P>
    <P>There is not a great deal else I wish to say in the context of the Bill.  It is a technical measure and, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle pointed out, some of the matters that we want to deal with would be better dealt with on Committee Stage.  I would like to make two further points.  One relates to the court that is to determine all matters under the Bill.  As the Bill stands at the moment it is the District Court.  I envisage that there could be certain difficulties in that at the time when it is expected this Bill will come into force there will be a massive increase in the jurisdiction exercised by the District Court under the Courts Act, 1981, and one would hope that the District Court would be in a position to deal with the great mass of claims that could come before it under this legislation &mdash; I am concerned particularly with the Dublin area in that regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has referred to the necessity to look generally at this whole area.  I fully accept that this Bill is effectively a temporary or an emergency measure to deal with this whole question of rent controlled premises and the recent constitutional pronouncement in relation to them.  It is fair to say that we need comprehensive legislation to deal with the whole area of private rented accommodation.  In reality there is very little logic in distinguishing between accommodation that was previously rent controlled and accommodation that is not rent controlled.  We should &mdash; and I hope we will in the short term &mdash; have legislation to deal with the whole of this area.  I welcome the Minister's statement that this whole area is being examined and I would hope that we would have the consolidation Act clearly setting out the rights and duties of both tenants and landlords throughout the rented residential accommodation area in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>In the context of the courts I would <Col N="1501" /> expect and hope that such legislation should provide for the creation of rents tribunals which I think would be a simpler, less expensive and better way of dealing with the whole question of fixing of rents.  I am somewhat disappointed that this Bill does not provide for rents tribunals.  It is fair to say that in the amount of time available and in view of the speed with which this Bill would come into force it would not be possible to have them set up and working.  But I would hope that in the consolidating legislation the Minister referred to in his opening remarks we will provide for such rent tribunals.  They would be of assistance to both landlords and tenants in that they would avoid much of the present difficulties and expense attached to litigation and would result in a single tribunal or court developing a degree of expertise in this area so that matters could be resolved far more speedily when disputes arise.</P>
    <P>Finally, I congratulate the Minister on trying to achieve a very difficult balance by providing the type of legislation the Supreme Court suggested.  I would be happy if he would look at some of the suggestions I have made.  The intention is right and all that is needed now is for us to do all we can to make the Bill operate efficiently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There is agreement to conclude the debate at five o'clock and so I shall try to be brief.  It is accepted by all parties that some attempt must be made to deal quickly with the problems arising from the decision of the Supreme Court in the area under discussion. While the general purpose of the Bill and its general spirit are something we can recognise and accept I must add my concern to that already expressed on particular features of the measure. Deputy Shatter touched on the point of surrender tenancies and the need to ensure the rights of spouses are not adversely affected by any action on the part of one party to a marriage.  That is a point worth noting.  My general remarks, however, will centre around the mechanism of using the District Court in respect of some procedure to determine some of these matters relating to rents <Col N="1502" /> and the finding of a balance of interest as between landlord and tenant.</P>
      <P>First of all, I can see why this legislation is designed to deal with just one category of rented accommodation because of an element of unconstitutionality.  For a different reason I would question Deputy Shatter's comments in that area.  What I would be concerned about is that legislation dealing with this particular problem and, therefore, abolishing rent controls as they exist for this category in this form, might be construed as accepting abolition of all rent control over all rental accommodation.  As I see it, it is still perfectly valid, should the Government so wish, to bring in a general form of rent control applicable to all rented accommodation. If that is not feasible I would think that the whole basis of price controls must be unconstitutional.  I have never seen any suggestion to that effect and I assume that it is permissible, therefore, under Article 43, to regulate the exercise of individual property rights and to take account of the common good and it is, therefore, permissible to have general price controls applying to any one service or product or item such as a lease of accommodation.</P>
      <P>The reason we have this legislation before us is because we have discriminatory legislation applying to just one category of rents.  I accept we should eliminate discriminatory action of that kind and I am quite happy that the District Court should be the court to decide, for reason I shall come to later, but I am very unhappy with the suggestion that the court should proceed to decide in some cases whether a rebate is to be allowed taking into account the circumstances of the tenant.  This seems to me to be totally unconstitutional because, if it is unconstitutional to discriminate for a block of rented accommodation, it must be still more unconstitutional to single out individual landlords and say that, because of the circumstances of individual tenants, they should bear the cost of subsidising such tenants' accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a lawyer but I have to say that most lawyers are not economists and are liable to get themselves tangled up when they tackle financial matters.  If there is <Col N="1503" /> a case for dealing with hardship that could arise for some tenants, then the logical approach would be the one touched on in the Minister's opening statement, namely, the provision of some form of rent subsidy.  The actual method whereby to apply that subsidy, whether through supplementary welfare benefits or something else, is a matter that can be teased out.  To me, that is the correct way to resolve the problem.  If landlords have a constitutional right to be treated equally they should be treated equally and matters should be decided on the circumstances of landlords as a class and not on the basis of the individual circumstances of their tenants.</P>
    <P>Tenants have certain property rights conferred by this Bill but it seems to me, if this Bill is passed and landlords are able to secure the full market value for their accommodation, that too could give rise to some form of discriminatory benefit. In equity I would have thought fair treatment of all concerned would require that only landlords who had bought their premises before these rent restrictions come into force would be entitled to be compensated in full &mdash; in other words, to be able to acquire the full rent and full market value of their accommodation. Now anyone who bought rented accommodation from, say, the 1960s bought premises that were rent controlled premises and this Bill will confer on him a speculative profit by allowing him to capture the full market value of the premises. To me, as an economist, that is one area that needs to be carefully examined.  It is an area we might wish to take up on the next Stage.</P>
    <P>It seems to me there is a more general problem arising out of the operation of the courts in this area.  It may have been touched on by other speakers.  First of all, who is to bear the costs in so far as costs arise for tenants who must be represented? If we are concerned about hardship it seems logical to make some arrangement to meet the financial costs of court representation and court appearances for such tenants.  There is then the question of the handling of the volume of work which will arise.  How will the courts <Col N="1504" /> deal with a substantial number of referrals? They are already clogged up in handling existing business.</P>
    <P>On the question of striking what may be regarded as a fair rent, there is an inflationary bias built in in the way in which courts tend to tackle economic matters.  According to the Minister's opening statement the court will be asked to arrive at a rate that would be paid by a willing lessee or lessor.  Inevitably, it is fair to say from our experience of the way courts decide on prices for compulsory acquisition of land, they invariably arrive at the highest open market price for that type of property.  Therefore, what will happen with this legislation is that invariably the courts will tend to strike the highest prevailing rent for that category of dwelling.</P>
    <P>That, almost certainly, is not the kind of rent that would emerge on a free market because if we were to abolish all controls tomorrow and have 30,000 tenants seeking to rent accommodation on the open market they would not be able to pay the high rents now being paid by tenants of uncontrolled dwellings and therefore it would not be feasible for landlords to let on an open market all their accommodation at current prevailing market rates.</P>
    <P>It is a quite complex technical matter to estimate what might emerge as rents in such cases, but there are techniques applied by the economics profession for handling such matters.  By the crude rule of thumb it would be better to suggest that a closer approximation to a fair market rent would be a rent half way between the amount being paid currently, on average, and the rents currently prevailing on the open market.  I would suggest that would be a more accurate indicator, certainly much more accurate than the rent currently being fetched on the open market.  It would take me too long to elaborate on the reasons for that.  I simply make the point that there will be an inflationary bias built in if we just leave it to the courts, to judges, who, whatever their other estimable qualities may be &mdash; and they have many &mdash; do not have any particular background of expertise on technical economic issues of this nature and <Col N="1505" /> they should not be required to decide such issues.</P>
    <P>I suggest, therefore, that that aspect of the Bill be looked at seriously because we have enough inflationary pressures operating in the economy without adding to them unnecessarily by legislation passed here.  I would have thought that that danger of inflationary pressure would be further aggravated if, I believe to be the case, it were found that this five-year rebate were deemed to be unconstitutional because it might discriminate selectively against particular landlords.  If you have to move to the payment of what the court would regard as full market value rents and if that had to be met in part or substantially by some form of subsidy to tenants in cases of hardship, it will be underpinning an inflationary impetus.  I suggest, therefore, that the whole question as far as fair market rent is concerned should be looked at in much greater detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to sum up the debate on this legislation for my Fianna Fáil colleagues.  I will say quite bluntly that we are not in favour of this legislation because there is a lot more we dislike about it than we like about it, but our sense of responsibility to thousands of tenants throughout the country puts us in a position of going along with it.  There is fear and there is shock and worry among the tenants throughout the country about this question.  Would not you be worried if you were to have your rent increased by 1,000 per cent or even 2,000 per cent?  If you are paying £1 and suddenly you find yourself paying £10 or £20, you would be shocked, because there is inflation for you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, therefore, there is extreme worry among people who had managed on a budget who will suddenly find themselves faced with 1,000 per cent rent inflation. We on this side have grave reservations about a number of aspects in the Bill and about a number of principles in it, but we will go along with it to try somehow to dampen the worry of many tenants and to get some legislation on the Statute Book before the Supreme Court decision will become operative and landlords <Col N="1506" /> can charge whatever they wish or evict people on to the streets.  It is our sense of responsibility that allows us to go along with the Bill.  We would not like anyone to think we are happy with it, however.</P>
    <P>We have heard lawyers and economists, but I will take a political stance for the moment.  I have here the Fine Gael manifesto with which they approached the Irish public last summer.  On page 35 they promised quite clearly to establish a fair rents tribunal.  That tribunal is not mentioned in the legislation.  They also promised that they would introduce a new tax credit for private tenancies up to a maximum of £1,000 rent.  That is not covered in this legislation.  The manifesto also stated that existing tenants, if in difficulties, would have a rent subsidy scheme.  This morning the Minister made some reference to this, but the manifesto clearly suggested that an across the board rent subsidy scheme would be introduced for tenants in possession.</P>
    <P>I am raising these points now lest people would feel that we on this side are allowing the Government to run away from their commitment in that contract with the Irish people last June.  There is no provision for a fair rents tribunal in this legislation, though it was specifically promised by the present Government.</P>
    <P>Our party are happy to go along with this legislation in order to allay the genuinely held fears of tenants throughout this city and the country.  Deputy Shatter made a point that there is a housing crisis, an accommodation crisis in the country and this city which I do not think any political party have faced up to fully.  For example, a family came to see me yesterday who had 17 people living in a three-bedroomed house.  An hour later a group representing a number of families came to see me.  In every one of those families there were between 12 and 20 people living in three-bedroom houses in Dublin.  There are more than 6,500 people on the corporation's housing list and many more on the county council list.  There is a housing crisis which has to be tackled by co-ordinated action.  There are more than 133,000 people unemployed at the moment and many of them <Col N="1507" /> are unemployed building workers.  On the other hand we have thousands and thousands of unfortunates in this city, in particular, who are looking for houses. We have unemployed workers and we have people looking for houses.</P>
    <P>It should not be beyond the imagination of the Department, the Government and politicians in general to devise a scheme which would give those people employment building those houses which the people of the city and the country could occupy.  There is a need for houses and a need for jobs.  All that is missing is the spark of finance in the whole accommodation area, be it rented or owned, which can come from the financial institutions or a more imaginative approach on the part of the Government.  To say we have up to 20,000 people, perhaps, in this city looking for houses in 1981 is a scandal.  It does not reflect any credit on any politician and, at the same time, we have people unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Chair may feel that the 1963 Planning Act is not directly relevant to this Bill.  I suggest the whole area of accommodation, be it rented or owned, is dealt with broadly under this Bill.  In 1963 a planning Bill was enacted.  Have we not progressed one inch in virtually 20 years of observing Irish planning in that we have not had a thorough co-ordinated planning Bill since then?  It says very little for all of us that we have not advanced beyond that.  There are a thousand loopholes in it.  The 1963 Planning Act is a shambles.  Coaches and four are being driven through it.  We need a new planning Bill.  That can be discussed and I intend to raise it on another occasion.</P>
    <P>More imagination will have to be brought into the whole area of providing rented and ownership accommodation for the people.  The old static system we have been using up to now is not good enough.  If at all possible the Department should try to give a lead in finding some imaginative answers to an age-old problem. That is what leadership is about. That is what government is about.  We do not like this Bill for a number of reasons. I will give them very quickly.</P>

The District Court is not the place to handle this type of problem.  Other family cases, social cases and juvenile cases will be held up while there is a squabble in the District Court over the next couple of years between auctioneers, valuers, solicitors, accountants, and so on.</P>
      <P>On the question of subsidising people in hardship &mdash; and I am speaking personally &mdash; of course people should be subsidised if they need it.  I am totally opposed to subsidising people across the board in any scheme like this.  We should subsidise people who need it.  In no other circumstances should we hand out State money apart from the basis of severe need.  Perhaps we can take that up on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of who will bear the <Col N="1509" /> cost when we go into the District Court and evaluate the cases, if I am paying £2 a week rent and suddenly I have to pay £20 a week rent and I am earning £3,000, £4,000 or £5,000 a year, can I afford to employ solicitors and auctioneers?  Who will pay for all that?  What scheme will pay for all that?  That is another reservation we have.</P>
    <P>Another problem we have is the question of phasing in increases over a five-year period.  If I am paying £40 a month rent and suddenly it becomes £100 a month, I understand the difference of £60 will be phased in over five years.  By the time the five years are up and I have covered the gap of £60, will the market value not have gone up by a further £50 or £60?  Are we not again into the spiral of trying to catch up on it?  Will we not have another Bill in five years' time to try to catch up?  How can you catch up on inflation in five years?  That is a very difficult mathematical problem.  Perhaps it should be spread out over seven, eight or ten years.</P>
    <P>I want to make a suggestion to the Minister.  Many people can afford to pay higher rents.  Many people could afford to buy out these premises.  I imagine most landlords who own controlled premises would be quite delighted to sell them to the tenants.  Rather than having the State paying out more subsidies to people who do not need them, would it not be better for the State to bring in a loan scheme to enable people in these premises to buy out their houses at a reduced figure?  If you are a landlord and you have tenants like that, I reckon you would want to get out of a house like that.  The tenant should be encouraged to buy the house to prevent the State from getting bogged down in further subsidies which it can ill afford.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I have left the Minister very little time.  I could go on for another half an hour but the Minister has asked for a few minutes and I will be glad to give them to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret we do not have more time to deal with this rather important Bill on Committee Stage.  I said on Second Stage that I looked forward, as did many of my colleagues, to having a worthwhile debate on many details of this Bill on Committee Stage. But because of the way it has been introduced among other items to be cleared before the recess we are regrettably deprived of that opportunity.  Had we longer to discuss it I believe we would make it a better Bill.  Because of this I do not intend opposing the motion except to say that I have grave reservations about section 15 which is I think the section imposing the levy.  I would have grave reservations from what has been said in this House today on Second Stage because I posed some questions to the Minister on what exactly was happening this money.  The Minister for Defence replying yesterday evening confused the issue for me when he said it was the Government's intention to increase the figure this year to 40,000.  I welcome that proposal but I want to know how it can be achieved within the present structures. I am fairly satisfied now that the levy is <Col N="1513" /> in substitution for Exchequer funding.  I am satisfied that it is the Government's intention now to save substantially on the Exchequer's funding of all these schemes by applying the 1 per cent levy to it.  It must be remembered that we are entitled under many of these schemes to 5 per cent ESF assistance which of course makes more funding available.  I would be satisfied were I absolutely sure that that 1 per cent was in addition to the existing Exchequer funding, that on top of that there would be the Social Fund contribution.  I believe it is not.  I believe we will see a transference of funding arrangements, perhaps from many of the AnCO functions, from Exchequer responsibility, as at present, to the 1 per cent levy.  Of course this is the reason for the Financial Resolution before us &mdash; the 1 per cent levy on the worker, from whom it will be easiest to collect.  Of course it will apply to the farmer in the tax net, to the self-employed and to all other sections of the community.  That 1 per cent constitutes a very substantial contribution.</P>
      <P>The question should be posed: can we be certain that all of this 1 per cent levy will go to the worthy causes intended here?  I heard a local radio commentator last week make a reference to this Bill. He was lining himself up for an interview and his comment was that it was intended by way of this Bill to provide 20,000 jobs. It is amazing how people do not bother to check their information.  Of course that is not the position.  It is merely providing for 20,000 extra training places, work experience places, places in various schemes whether they be environmental, educational or otherwise. Therefore we should not run away with the idea that there are 20,000 jobs here, because there are not.</P>
      <P>We are not opposing the motion.  Perhaps we would had we adequate time to discuss Committee Stage but time is short and, for that reason, we are not opposing the motion but are going on to discuss the Bill in the limited time available to us.</P>

      <P>The basis of this article is the result of a meeting of Employment and Labour Minister and Social Affairs Ministers yesterday in Brussels when they discussed a letter from Commissioner Richard to the President in Council, Mr. Tebbit.  It has not gone before the Commission as such but it is his proposal for very radical changes in the Social Fund.  We have put in strong reservations about any changes.  It will have to be discussed by the fund committee and the Commission as a whole and a final decision will be taken by the Council but I felt it my duty on behalf of the Government and the country to indicate <Col N="1516" /> our strong reservations in this whole area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain to the House the feeling of the Council on this matter?  In view of what appeared in the press today, I presume there was discussion at the Council meeting.  I understand the Minister's reservations and I read about them.  Is there any danger that the Council, as they have done on other occasions in respect of various schemes and because of proposed cutbacks in the budget, might reduce the age limit from 25 years to 18 years?  From my own limited experience, I know that generally there is a chat among Ministers about matters of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to be concerned about a very radical proposal such as that put forward.  The basis of the proposal is the fact that unemployment in all member states of the Community has increased dramatically in the past few years and now approximately 10 million persons are unemployed.  Certain countries who had not experienced the real problems of unemployment, as we have had for many years, are now feeling the effects of the recession in their countries and certain of their areas and regions are suffering high rates of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the wish that the basis on which money from the Social Fund would be distributed would be changed from a regional basis to priority for unemployment black spots and that Articles 4 and 5 under which we qualified for Social Fund assistance would be disregarded and replaced by a new system based on unemployment levels and levels of income.  This is the proposal from Commissioner Richard to the President in Council and it was right that we should have resisted that proposal immediately and strongly.  I think it would be dangerous for me to accuse any particular member state of pushing this proposal but undoubtedly it is attractive to certain countries.  There were strong reservations from almost all member states <Col N="1517" /> about such a radical change without knowing the full repercussions.  Certain countries whose problems approximate to ours are strongly opposed to any change.  We are at an initial stage but there is a need for concern.  If the proposal by the Commissioner were adopted, a scheme like this could be affected by the amount of revenue that could accrue to it.  There is no use in my trying to hide that fact.  I put in a strong reservation about this whole move and, as a result, Commissioner Richard has agreed to come to Ireland to discuss the proposal on 15 January.  The Irish Commissioner has also been informed of developments in this area but I am sure he was well aware of them in any event.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 44 and 45, to insert new subsections as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (2) of this section, the functions of the Agency may be any or all of the following:</P>
      <P>(a)  to act under the Minister as a body having overall national responsibility for the furtherance of the employment of young persons;</P>
      <P>(b)  to advise the Government or the Minister on the Agency's initiative or at the request of the Minister on policy for the creation of employment for young persons and related matters;</P>
      <P>(c)  to review the effectiveness of youth employment work experience and training programmes with particular reference to their impact on disadvantaged youth;</P>
      <P>(d)  to extend existing youth job creation, training and work experience programmes, with particular attention being given to disadvantaged youth;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e)  to arrange for assistance to be given to voluntary, social or community <Col N="1518" /> organisations, to provide employment for young persons where this is not possible under existing programmes;</P>
    <P>(f)  to arrange assistance for young persons with the establishment of an enterprise in areas other than those in which existing bodies operate; in particular to promote, through education and publicity, the concept of self-help and enterprise amongst young people, either individually or in co-operative endeavours;</P>
    <P>(g) to carry out and administer youth employment and training schemes not provided for in existing programmes;</P>
    <P>(h)  to prepare and maintain a register of unemployed young persons who are available for employment.</P>
    <P>(i)  to co-ordinate and integrate the various schemes for the creation of employment of young persons, to ensure there is no duplication between them and, in this connection to set general standards for the various schemes in relation to such matters as the ages, wages and allowances of participants;</P>
    <P>(j)  to identify areas outside the scope of existing programmes into which Government aid to young people could be extended;</P>
    <P>(k)  to examine the possibility of improving the access of unemployed young persons to a range of educational and training courses in the private and public sectors by means of a voucher scheme for eligible youth;</P>
    <P>(l) to submit views to the Government as appropriate, on educational policy and its effectiveness in preparing young persons for working life.</P>
    <P>(4)  In subsection (3) of this section `existing schemes or programmes' means those provided by An Comhairle Oiliúna, the Industrial Development Authority, the National Manpower <Col N="1519" /> Service, county development teams and other such appropriate bodies.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate we have not more time to discuss this matter.  What we are proposing is largely in line with what was proposed by the Minister on Second Stage.  He said the agency would be set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis but we would prefer that the agency be established with the terms of reference as outlined.  All the various paragraphs in the amendment are extremely important and I cannot see any reason why they should not be included. I do not know what time would be required other than for typing the additions into the Bill.  It would give the impression to people that there is a greater commitment by the Government. The Minister owes it to the young people to strengthen the agency.  For example, paragraph (h) makes provision to prepare and maintain a register of unemployed young persons who are available for employment.  That is a major exercise.</P>
    <P>In my time in the Department of Labour we made some progress in compiling statistical data but we did not do enough so far as young persons were concerned.  I am sure that the Minister is fully aware of the many Deputies making representations to him and to the National Manpower Service.  When that service goes to look up A, B and C it transpires that they are working.  We are talking about an area of much physical work to be done.  Registers have to be compiled, updating is necessary and extra staff are needed.  Our party leader, Deputy Haughey, on Second Stage laid emphasis on the necessity to make staff available.  That is just one of that wide-ranging number of areas that would give the agency a more meaningful basis.  I cannot accept from the Minister that they are not necessary.  The only suggestion I make to him is that if he thinks that my amendment does not go far enough when it comes before the Seanad, as I understand it will tomorrow, it can be improved or strengthened there.  It is important that he accept it and if it is accepted this House <Col N="1520" /> will be seen to be committed to an agency who are trying to do something for young people.  If my amendment is not accepted this agency could well end up as just a window-dressing exercise.  There is no worthwhile argument against it.  The Minister accepted on Second Stage that these were terms of reference.  I do not disagree, but I refer to the statistical information.  It must be tackled and obviously the figures vary from week to week.  His acceptance of the amendment will show the Minister's goodwill.  I will not waste time on it because others may wish to contribute.  I tell the Minister that he should accept the amendment as it is and if refinement is needed let that take place in the Upper House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I add to Deputy Fitzgerald's request that the Minister consider accepting this amendment.  I do not doubt the honesty of the aspirations enshrined in section 4 which are the principal objectives of establishing, developing, extending, operating, encouraging, supervising, co-ordinating, integrating and so on.  I suggest that it is not specific enough.  It contains a certain amount of gobbledegook.  In comparison Deputy Fitzgerald's submission spells out far better the type of thing the Youth Employment Agency should be doing.  As I said on Second Stage, if we do not spell out the precise job they have to do we will be passing a Bill designed to inaugurate a super-dole system, perhaps allocating £90 million for schemes and areas of which this House has not more detailed knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) (d), of the amendment recommends particular attention being given to disadvantaged youth.  I make a special plea.  There are disadvantaged in every group in society.  We are inclined to think of young people as being a huge group all with the one problem.  That is not the case.  There are severely disadvantaged young people under the wide umbrella of young people.  The insertion into the Bill of the Words &ldquo;disadvantaged youth&rdquo; will give this new agency a specific task to show positive discrimination, as it were, towards that group.  I need only mention to this House the sight of eight-or <Col N="1521" /> nine-year-olds trying to sell newspapers on the streets of this city to give an example of the kind of disadvantaged young people we have.  I am not sure whether they would come under this Bill, but I would like somebody to look at this because everybody thinks that somebody else is looking at problems of that kind while these young people are still on the streets selling newspapers.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) (e) of the amendment proposes to provide employment for young persons where this is not possible under existing programmes.  It is not clear from the Bill whether the Minister intends the agency to employ people directly at any stage.  If the Minister intends the agency to employ people directly at any stage that should be mentioned in the Bill, otherwise they should be excluded specifically from directly employing people.  In regard to subsection (3) (f) Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned the concept of self-help and enterprise among young people, either individually or co-operatively.  It is important to enshrine in legislation like this the whole idea of the co-operative movement and the type of work that young people can help to provide for themselves by co-operative endeavour, as Deputy Fitzgerald says in his amendment.  I like that phrase, which would be a healthy one to have in legislation such as this to enshrine the concept of saying to young people, &ldquo;The State will do its best.  The State will try to provide employment, will give the money, but do not sit there and let the State do everything.  Try a little bit of self-help, enterprise, co-operative endeavour&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The idea of formulating a register under subsection (3) (h) of the amendment is excellent and it will be a pity if it is not inserted in the Bill.  This refers to a register of unemployed young persons who are available for employment.  A breakdown of that figure and a detailed register of it would be invaluable to employers.  The final part of this, subsection (3) (1) provides for submission of &ldquo;views to the Government, as appropriate, on educational policy and its effectiveness in preparing young persons for working life.&rdquo; That may be envisaged by <Col N="1522" /> the Minister and I am not saying that it is not.  I am not saying that any of these are not envisaged by the Minister and I am sure that most of them are envisaged by him.  However, when we go to the trouble of providing legislation like this it is no harm to write into it the specific ideas we have in mind.  It would be a healthy thing to write into a Bill such as this that this body who are in close touch with the problems of young people would have the specific responsibility of feeding that information back to the Government of the day and the Departments so that they can get their educational policies the better to allow for job opportunities.  I join with Deputy Fitzgerald in asking the Minister to consider some of these changes.  I stress that I am not accusing the Minister of not having these ideas in the Bill.  I am sure he is quite prepared to say to me that they are all in there, but I would like to see all that spelled out in the interest of young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many of the points raised by Deputy Brennan and also with Deputy Fitzgerald's amendment. The idea in this section is very good but, as Deputy Brennan said, it is not specific enough.  It is all very hazy and we are not quite sure what exactly is meant.  Deputy Fitzgerald's amendment would indicate clearly the exact direction in which the Youth Employment Agency should be working.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the last section of Deputy Fitzgerald's amendment which deals with the effectiveness of our current educational system in preparing young people for work.  At the moment our system of education is far too academically based and does not allow young people the necessary scope and does not prepare them adequately for the working life that they endure when they leave school or our educational service.  Far too many of our young people are not in a position at the moment to get employment, not only because jobs are not available but because the type of training and educational experience they have does not prepare them for work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During second level school, for example, <Col N="1523" /> I would like to see much more emphasis on giving some sort of training on how exactly to cope with interviews, how to go about finding the sort of skill that suits them and so on.  I know that career guidance is involved in most of our school curricula, but in order that it be effective the Youth Employment Agency should have a role in assessing our educational system and making recommendations about it to the Government and the various Government Departments in order to ensure that that system prepares our young people adequately for employment, and not only that but that our educational system prepares young people for the life they will lead after they leave school.  Many young people when they come out of education leave their homes and go to cities like Dublin, Limerick and Galway.  They move far away from family and friends and they find it extremely difficult to cope with life outside school.</P>
    <P>Any agency which has as its basis the employing of young people and providing them with secure incomes and a means of looking after themselves must also have, as an integral part, a way of assessing our educational system to ensure that it adequately prepares young people for a working life in the world.  Many courses could be integrated into our curriculum which should be part and parcel of it &mdash; for example, the teaching of politics and civics and all the subjects so important for young people to be aware of.  The Youth Employment Agency has a role in gearing our educational system towards life in Ireland and, more particularly, work in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan referred to the underprivileged section of our community &mdash; disadvantaged youth.  I also plead on their behalf.  Many come from insecure homes and, indeed, from institutions. Very often they are not capable of holding down an ordinary job entailing the normal working hours which many of us have to work.  Their insecurity has left them with very many chips on their shoulders. These young people should be helped in a very special way by the Youth Employment Agency.  This section of the <Col N="1524" /> Bill should incorporate their needs and aspirations, making sure that they, above all else, are helped.  Many are turning to the taking of drugs, which is now a serious problem among our young population. The youth agency should help such people &mdash; people who have to sell newspapers at a very early age to earn an income, young people begging on our streets, perhaps forced there by irresponsible parents, children of seven, eight or nine years of age going around the pubs of this city trying to find money for themselves and their parents.  They are a very special category of our society and the Youth Employment Agency, whose whole emphasis is on finding employment for young people, must look after these people in a very special and unique way. Their insecure family background makes it very difficult for them to secure employment.  Many of the schemes incorporated in this section by Deputy Fitzgerald in his amendment would go a long way towards helping the disadvantaged youth of our towns and cities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little concerned that the section, even as amended, is not specific enough and the guidelines in it are not adequate for the purpose of ensuring the essential measure of control of the activities of the Youth Employment Agency.  We must have a great care here that the agency will operate, on the very substantial public moneys which hopefully will be ploughed into it, in the way that the Oireachtas would have in mind in passing this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard estimates of the amount which might be made available under this scheme being put as between £60 million and £72 million per year.  That is a very large amount of public funds.  For that reason I wish that the section provided a greater measure of control.  My fear, in a nutshell, is that, as the scheme will be directed towards the training of young people, you could have a situation where certain private sector interests might see an availability here of £60 million or £70 million and might proceed to set up spurious training centres with the object and intent of hiving off these large slices of <Col N="1525" /> the public funds in a manner which might not be to the best advantage.  The existing training facilities should be very much expanded and the main drive of the agency in the use of these public funds should go towards the expansion of existing organisations which have the experience and potential capacity to do this work.  On the industrial side, in particular, I refer to AnCO and CERT which are doing magnificent work and, no doubt, could use a substantial injection of funds.  In the agricultural and horticultural section, ACOT also are an organisation which could be a beneficiary of such substantial funds.  Likewise, there are training facilities available in many companies in the State sector, such as CIE, Bord na Móna, the Sugar Company, Aer Lingus and others.  Those in-company training facilities should more appropriately be the recipient of substantial amounts of these public funds.</P>
    <P>It is essential that this scheme be rigorously controlled and, having regard to the extent of the public moneys involved here, that in some form or another the expenditure of these moneys be answerable for in this House.  Under the present structure envisaged in this section, that would not be possible.  The <i>modus oper-andi</i> here would be a separate company and, no doubt, if any Member of the House attempted to raise questions about particular expenditure he would be faced with the answer that is usually put forward regarding semi-State bodies and an adequate answer about the expenditure of those moneys would not be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Care must be taken also because the emphasis is on training.  The Minister must exercise control, if indeed he has adequate power &mdash; and I have doubts about that &mdash; to ensure that unscrupulous employers do not use any scheme arising under this Bill as a means of obtaining cheap labour, or deferring the taking on of staff which they would otherwise need. If that was seen, or even thought, to happen, it would bring the agency and the excellent idea which it embodies into disrepute.  A very substantial measure of control is required.  Would the Minister consider at some stage making provision <Col N="1526" /> that the expenditure of finances by that agency would be subject to question in the House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing the amendment but, let me say immediately, it is not because I do not agree with any of the provisions in that amendment.  It is simply because I hope to persuade the Deputies that this amendment would be more appropriate in the memorandum and articles of association.  We are dealing here with the agency as it hopes to operate and it will take its guidelines from its memorandum and articles of association.  In that memorandum, the principal objects, as Deputy Brennan listed today are to develop, extend, operate, assist, encourage, supervise, co-ordinate and integrate, either directly or indirectly, the training and employment of young persons over 15 and under 25 years.  In my introductory statement on Second Stage I already indicated that the memorandum and articles of association of the agency would incorporate the points in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (i), (j) and (k) in Deputy Fitzgerald's amendment.  I think Deputy Brennan had the impression that it was Deputy Fitzgerald who included these?  If he is under that misapprehension I want to tell him that they were already intended to be part of the memorandum.</P>
      <P>I have some difficulty with paragraph (h) in Deputy Fitzgerald's list, which is to prepare and maintain a register of unemployed young persons who are available for employment.  This relates to the administrative matters of the agency. Such a register would be prepared and maintained by the National Manpower Service.  I suggest that this is the way the agency will decide to operate this area of its administration.  The National Manpower Service is the Government's employment service and I propose to use, as fully as possible, the existing administrative structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of play was made of this in the Second Stage speeches of the Opposition.  The Opposition Deputies said we were likely to set up a great bureaucratic body with this agency.  In <Col N="1527" /> order to avoid this it is appropriate that an agency within the Department already operating in this area should do this work.  It is my suggestion that the agency continue and, if necessary, be strengthened for that purpose.  The National Manpower Service has offices in various places throughout the country and has staff throughout the country.  It would be a bureaucratic nonsense to set up a parallel body doing the very same work.  I am sure Deputy Fitzgerald is aware of the work done by those individuals throughout the country.  He has said, and I am inclined to agree with him, that perhaps records are not as fully up to date as they could be.  If that is a weakness it must be corrected and I am sure the agency will certainly be very quick to point out to a body like the National Manpower Service that they have their facts wrong or that they are not complete, if that is the case.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs (a) and (b) provide that the agency act under the Minister as a body having overall national responsibility for the furtherance of the employment of young persons and advise the Government or the Minister, on the agency's initiative or at the request of the Minister, on policy for the creation of employment for young persons and related matters. These will obviously be the functions of the agency and I consider that it is unnecessary to spell them out in the Bill.  In view of the Opposition's suggestion, I intend to have these included in the memorandum and articles of association with the other items listed in the amendment, with the exception of paragraph (h).  This should meet the reasonable objections that could be raised by the Opposition and I believe that this is the best way that it can be done.</P>
    <P>This agency is set up on the basis of attracting people of the highest calibre to operate it.  I hope that Deputies on all sides of the House will agree that these people will be of the highest calibre and will see that it is so.  If we lay down every control possible in this Bill there will be no flexibility whatsoever to deal with problems which arise and require a great deal of ingenuity to solve.  I do not think <Col N="1528" /> anybody need worry that the Minister will spend money in such a way that the young people will not get the full benefit of it, because the board obviously must adhere to the tasks set out in the memorandum and articles of association.  There are opportunities for Deputies to raise in this House problems they might find in regard to the operations of the agency. These include Question Time, Private Notice Question, Private Members' Time and so on.  All these are available to them if they feel there is a need to question the operation of the agency at any time.  I would hope that the Opposition would not press this amendment.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point in regard to the number of people who will be trained and where they will be trained.  I set that out in my speech, and we intend to extend the operations in this field of training and job creation.  It is envisaged that up to 16,000 of the 20,000 jobs will be taken up by an extension of the various schemes at present operating in this area. Therefore nobody need be concerned that there will suddenly be a rash of bogus schemes put forward or that the agency will be too weak to see through these. The main emphasis will be on extending existing schemes.  Over three-quarters of the work experience schemes or training created for young people will go to those existing agencies.  I would ask the Opposition not to press this amendment but to accept that the list in the amendment will be included in the memorandum and articles of association.  But I would not agree with paragraph (h) being included for the reasons I have put forward, namely, that this is an administrative problem and I do not wish to set up an additional bureaucratic structure that is not necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Time prevents us from pushing it further.  I have no doubt that my colleagues would like to go through every single one of those paragraphs because they are all extremely important.  I am sorry that the Minister has taken that view because his colleague, Deputy Taylor, has the same reservation that I expressed at the outset: I do not believe that having them in the <Col N="1529" /> memorandum and articles of association is sufficient.  They should be well teased out and gone into in greater detail than time allows and they should be included in the legislation being passed by the House.  I do not want to delay the House because of the time strictures and the fact that we have a lot to do yet.  But I do want to make one point because of the Minister's reference to it.  That is in relation to paragraph (h), preparing and maintaining a register of unemployed young persons.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's reference to the National Manpower Service.  On Second Stage I asked if this agency was really necessary and if the National Manpower Service could have done the job.  I want the agency to work, but I do not want it to be just a scapegoat or just appearing to be doing something.  I want it to be effective.  I asked questions that have not been answered.  I wanted to know where does the agency stand in relation to AnCO, CERT and all the others.  I want to see the training numbers increased by 20,000, and more if it is possible.  But, having had some experience of that Department and having been the Minister who initiated the work experience programme, I want to point out that we were gravely concerned, even dealing with smaller numbers, about abuse of the scheme.  That danger becomes all the greater with greater numbers.  There is a danger that the scheme will be abused, not by those participating in it but by those who would like to avail of it for other reasons.  This is a real danger that the Minister must be aware of and pay particular attention to, and the agency will have to pay attention to it as well.</P>
      <P>Because of the time strictures I will just make those two points.  I would have preferred if the amendment had been accepted and if we could have teased out other details and difficulties.  Perhaps this might be done in the Seanad.  I have no alternative but to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I sit down I would refer to one other item raised by one of my colleagues: in this Year of the Disabled there should have been a specific reference to disabled persons.  Even &ldquo;disadvantaged <Col N="1530" /> youth&rdquo; would have covered the situation.  I accept what the Minister says with regard to his intentions in relation to the articles of association.  He says he will include them but I would prefer to have it stated specifically in the legislation before the House.  I accept the Minister's point and I have no option but to withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (5), lines 17 and 18, to delete &ldquo;such bodies representative of young persons as the Minister may determine&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the National Youth Council&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assumed from the election manifesto of one of the parties at least that when youth were being represented that representation would be from the National Youth Council.  That does not appear to be the position in the Bill.  On the Second Stage I pointed out that I did not see the necessity for representation by the Department of the Environment.  That is no reflection on the Department.  I felt Environment probably would be the Department in which some schemes would be set up or operated but I did not see it as a Department with a direct input such as some other Departments would have.  I am not changing the total numbers involved.  If I were to do that I would be supporting three members from congress and three members from the employer bodies.  On the congress side <Col N="1531" /> you would have craftsmen represented. Likewise, it is vitally important that apprentices be represented together with the general working unions, the white collar unions and, of course, the public service unions.  Congress should have three.  The employer bodies should have three because there are the Federated Union of Employers, the Confederation of Irish Industry and the Construction Industry Federation.  I had no intention of affecting the total.  I am being very reasonable in all this.  May I say here the National Youth Council is an umbrella organisation and for that reason they should nominate members to the agency. Again, I think Finance should be represented. I thought the tripartite committee did great work and should be reflected in this.  If Finance does not have representation there may not be quite the same commitment from that Department.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why an agency is being set up without the real job-creating Department in the whole productive area and that is the Department of Industry and Energy.  I am not critical of the agency and the proposals I have made would improve the content of the Bill and the framework and format of the agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  In setting up this agency we decided to have an agency smaller than the usual semi-State boards.

I do not say other boards did not work efficiently and well but extending the numbers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Youth Council will be represented.  I fully appreciate the work done by that council.  I am anxious to see young people from rural areas being part of the representation.  I do not like giving instructions and I do not intend to give instructions but I am <Col N="1532" /> very anxious that there should be representation from rural Ireland on this agency.  I ask Deputy Fitzgerald to accept that I am not excluding the National Youth Council, but I want the council itself to decide who the representatives will be.  If they have to go outside their own ranks there is nothing to prevent them doing so.  I hope to give them flexibility by indicating two representatives from youth as part of the agency.  I am anxious to spread representation as widely as possible and I believe it is important that rural Ireland should be represented.</P>
      <P>With regard to substituting Finance and deleting Environment, I would remind Deputy Fitzgerald that on the Second Stage he spoke about the cold hand of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>He is back now to the old days when he was in the Department of Finance and he wants to give Finance representation. The real reason for this is that the Department of the Environment with their environmental improvements schemes will, we hope, play a very big part in extending schemes for this agency.  This is the Department that controls the local authorities.  The local authorities will be very concerned with the work of the agency because of the interest in youth problems by local representatives throughout the country. Accordingly, I believe the Department of the Environment should have membership of the board because we feel their views should be available to the agency. It would be a mistake to substitute the Department of Finance for the Department of the Environment.  As the Deputy has said, the Department of Finance have certain controls anyway and they are listed in other sections.  All Departments can make submissions to the agency.  We can consider the inclusion of the Department of Industry and Energy, but I want to be left with as much latitude as possible. In other words, I do not want to over-populate the agency's membership <Col N="1533" /> of eleven with too much Departmental representation on the board.  If I were to accept the amendment, the balance in favour of Departmental representation would be too heavy.  I ask the Opposition, therefore, to accept the reasons for my not accepting the amendment.</P>

I could say that so much money would be spent by the agency in each year, but practical difficulties would present themselves.

It should be made clear to the public that at all times the entire amount of the levy will be applied for the purpose of providing employment for our youth.  The public are inclined to be cynical about this and to get the impression that some of the money will get deflected elsewhere and not be applied for the purpose for which this specific levy has been designed.  I accept the Minister's comments in regard to the practicalities of collection and so forth.  There will have to be publicity from time to time so that people paying the levy can be assured regularly that it is being applied specifically for that purpose.

      <P>This section deals <Col N="1536" /> with the powers of the Minister as a shareholder.  As far as I can see, this section gives the Minister the only power he has under the Bill.  It enables him to exercise direct control over the affairs of the agency.  In my view &mdash; and I would ask the Minister to have a think about this &mdash; it is a very inadequate degree of control.  It gives him control only in his capacity as a shareholder which for practical purposes means only at the annual general meeting.  So far as the day to day or month to month activities of the agency are concerned he will have no power at all.  I would have thought that he should have power in special circumstances to issue directives to the agency on critical matters which could arise from time to time.</P>
      <P>It is conceivable &mdash; I do not think it will happen; it probably will not happen &mdash; that a situation could arise in which the employment of young people in a particular industrial concern could be a possible source of an industrial dispute. One could envisage a situation in which the workers in a plant might regard youth employment as affecting in some way members of the union operating in the plant.  I am sure great care will be taken and that this will be unlikely to happen. If an emergency situation arose, I would have thought the Minister should have power to issue a specific directive.  That power is not given in this section.</P>

      <P>We passed section 8 under which the agency will submit a plan to the Minister and, on the basis of that plan, the Minister will advance money. The agency will not run amok and do certain things without the Minister's knowledge.  He will have approved their plan.  This is the normal type of section for an agency like this.  It covers the power of the Minister as a shareholder. They will not run amok and do anything they like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Taylor has raised a very important principle.  I do not share his point of view completely, and yet I am not sure what the Minister has in mind.  At one time I was responsible for setting up a number of companies of this <Col N="1537" /> kind to do particular jobs.  Government Departments are very busy places.  There is a lot of different types of work to be done.  Ideally when you set up a company and appoint a number of responsible people as directors should you not assume that they will apply themselves to seeing that the job is done in the optimum way.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is tied in to important decisions of the company this brings in one of the great dangers I always see as a socialist, that is, the danger of bureaucracy and the delays of bureaucrats.  They are perfectly responsible.  I am not criticising them in any way.  Once the Minister is brought into make day to day decisions, or even important decisions other than a decision to give power and money to the company and tell them to get on with the job, where does he stop?  Where does he cease to interfere?  What powers are we giving to the directors of this very important company?  Where do we draw the line?  Once you start saying there shall be delimitations in the power of the directors, would they not have to be specified in the Bill?</P>
      <P>Are we not being rather vague about it?  Should we not say to them: &ldquo;This is a very important job.  You are all very responsible people with considerable experience in all the aspects of the operation of this type of company and you must be trusted&rdquo;?  If you do not trust them, where do you stop?  It will create serious dangers for the Minister because he will be called by us to account for day to day running matters of the company and he might not wish to do that.  It might delay the progress of the company.  It is a matter of policy.</P>

      <P>I was not making the point that the Minister should have responsibility for the day to day running of the affairs of the agency or that his <i>imprimatur</i> would be required.  I was saying that I would have thought there should have been a reserve, that in an appropriate emergency situation he would have a reserve of power to issue a directive to the company possibly regarding their expenditure of funds in a particular way or something of that sort.  If he <Col N="1538" /> is answerable here to some extent, why not?  After all, we are talking about the annual expenditure of £60 million or £70 million of public money.  This is the place where it is right and proper for the Minister to be answerable.  It is the only place he can be made answerable.  That is the point I was trying to make.</P>

      <P>I find that the two Deputies are at odds and I am in the middle.  I did not want the Minister to have so much power that he could jump in and interfere when he thought fit.  In setting up the memorandum and articles of association of the agency we tried to give them the dynamism and flexibility to go ahead and deal with the great problem of unemployment among young people. We said that when the agency have their plan of action, they should bring it to the Minister and he will give them the money to go ahead and do the work.  I do not want to limit them in any way in doing the job as specified in their memorandum and articles of association.  They are the guidelines on which they must do their job.</P>
      <P>The board will consist of responsible people who will have the trust of the whole House and the public in general. We have to give them the flexibility to tackle the problem.  I would not like to impose my will on them as Minister, and I would not like to see any successor of mine impose his will on them and insist that his views were taken into account. We could have brought in a Bill like the Bill which set up the IDA with everything set down, tying them down very tightly. This problem requires a quick solution. We need a flexible and dynamic agency who know they have not got somebody looking over their shoulder all the time, or likely to withdraw finance simply because they do not seem to be operating in the way the Minister feels they should. I believe that is the best way.  I want this agency to be a success and not just because the Minister feels they should operate in a particular area or direction.</P>

I sympathise with the Minister in his dilemma.  For instance, does one give all this money to a group?  Then to what extent are they answerable to us, to the Committee of Public Accounts or, for instance, will they be subject to parliamentary questions?  The House will know how we are told: &ldquo;This is a semi-State company and you cannot put down a question.&rdquo;  Will we be able to find out if we feel that something is going very wrong?

    <P>The thrust of these amendments is to do what Deputy Daly wants, that is, to ensure that the accounting is as extensive as we can make it.  The report will be as full as I believe Deputies would require. I cannot in the amendment specify how the report should be compiled.

I am not totally satisfied that the report the Minister has in mind in this amendment is the type I want to see.  Perhaps he could elaborate somewhat further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a limited company under the 1963 Act.  There is a particular accountancy meaning to the term &ldquo;report&rdquo;.  It can be as little as three lines signed by the auditor of the company, that the auditor is in fact reporting.  It is significant that there is no mention of a report in section 12, unless I have missed it.  I know the Minister has amended the section to include the word &ldquo;report&rdquo;&mdash; income and expenditure account and report.  We are suggesting that, in addition to the ordinary three or four line accountancy report to the Comptroller and Auditor General, who would obviously audit it, there be a report outlining how successful the agency feel they have been, how many jobs they have created, all the various reports we feel this House should have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is particularly important in view of the points raised by Deputies Browne and Mervyn Taylor.  We are giving here a figure of the order of £90 million to a private, limited company.  The State is the shareholder, but it is simply a private, limited company.  They can tell the Minister to get lost for 12 months and spend those £90 million virtually in any way they like, although they must take heed of the Bill.  But under the 1963 Act it is a private, limited company.  Because the Minister is a shareholder and not a director, we are anxious that he exercise some type of day to day control over the taxpayers' money, that at least the form of reporting be laid down specifically in the <Col N="1542" /> Bill to include a wider area than the broad, three line accountancy report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>When we became aware that the word &ldquo;report&rdquo; was not mentioned in the section we introduced this amendment to overcome the problem. I can assure Deputies opposite that it will be a very full report of the activities of the agency.  Such a report is mentioned in legislation in respect of other agencies and of State or semi-State bodies.  I can assure the Deputies that it will be what they require &mdash; a full report of their activities and accountability for them.</P>
      <P>With regard to the last point made by Deputy Brennan, if he reads section 12 (3) he will see that it says:</P>
      <P>The Agency shall on demand furnish to the Minister such explanations as the Minister shall think proper to require in respect of any balance sheet or income and expenditure account furnished pursuant to this section.</P>
      <P>This gives the Minister power to find out exactly what is happening with regard to accountancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would expect that, in addition to the balance sheet, there would be recommendations from the agency and priorities for action in other areas.  For instance, would we have a full account of their activities for the period covered by the report, the number of meetings held, the items discussed, various statistics and so on with which they would deal?  I feel it is too vague.</P>

      <P>We can take it then that we do not have a right of access, through <Col N="1543" /> parliamentary questions, to the day to day workings of the agency, through the Minister, because subsection (3) says:</P>
      <P>The Agency shall on demand furnish to the Minister such explanations as the Minister shall think fit to require in respect of any balance sheet...</P>
      <P>Therefore, what is the procedure whereby Deputies can discuss the whole enterprise?  Is it on the annual report? Certainly we cannot do it in the interim, as Deputy Brennan said.  Is that true?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the day to day operation of the agency is for the agency.  We do not want them to be harried every minute and hour of their day because a Deputy may feel that they are not doing what they should be doing. Nevertheless I accept Deputy Browne's concern.  As I have said, in relation to AnCO I have answered several questions in this House.  That body has never refused to give me any information I sought.  I would understand that that would be the position with the agency, that if and when a Deputy had a problem, I would seek information from them and would furnish it in the form of a question asked, if that was the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been our experience during the years that we cannot get information. The Minister's attitude has been that he does not want to interfere with the day to day working, that he has no part in it and, therefore, that he is not in a position to give us information.  I shared completely his attitude on these matters up to the recent disclosures in relation to a number of semi-State companies.  I wonder if this Government or the former Government have learned anything from the fact that a number of semi-State companies have behaved in a very questionable way in regard to the spending of money.  Should we not take special precautions in a section like this to ensure that this does not continue?  Did any of us learn anything from past experience?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I am reluctant to comment about companies in the <Col N="1544" /> purview of another Minister or to start a discussion in that area.  We have provided in section 12 that a report and audited accounts will be available annually.  I believe the report of the agency will be a full one, and I can assure the House that is the situation.  Perhaps in his earlier days Deputy Browne would not have liked to see the Minister's hand being laid too heavily on an agency such as this and he might have liked the agency to be allowed to do its work in as free a manner as possible.  However, because of recent disclosures he appears to be changing that view in the light of what may have happened elsewhere.  I hope he will accept that the people involved in this agency will be committed people and that the way it has been set up will ensure they will do their job.  I think the companies the Deputy had in mind are in the State trading area, but this agency is not in that line of business.  It will have a lot of money to deal with but the strictures we are putting on it in respect of accountability to this House and the public are adequate, so that the public need not be afraid their money is being used badly or for a purpose other than was intended.</P>

      <P>It should include comprehensive details of expenditure of the agency.  There is a basic difference between this agency and the semi-State companies.  For example, CIE are a trading organisation and one could understand that the Minister for Transport would not wish to be answerable for the trading activities of such a company. However, this agency is different.  It is a spending organisation and it will be spending a very considerable amount of money.  When we realise that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs can be asked <Col N="1545" /> a question regarding the cost of erection of a telephone kiosk in a village, it seems not unreasonable that the Minister for Labour should be answerable about how £5 million allocated to a certain scheme was spent.  There seems to be a reluctance on the part of the Minister to accept that degree of accountability.  I ask him to reconsider it and, as a minimum, to ensure that full information regarding expenditure is given in the annual report.</P>

      <P>We are opposed to this section.  As I said earlier, it is <Col N="1546" /> unfortunate we did not have enough time to debate the sections leading up to this section.  This section is imposing a 1 per cent levy on all incomes.  One per cent on the self-employed will yield approximately £8 million; 1 per cent on rents and other property income will bring in approximately £500,000; the levy on farmers' income will bring in about £7,500,000; the levy on corporation profits will yield about £10 million and on all dividends it will yield about £1,500,000. That brings the total of revenue from those sources to £27,500,000.  Then we must add the largest contribution of all, the amount from the PAYE sector.  Taking the Minister's figure of £63 million as the total, an amount of approximately £35 million will be obtained from the PAYE sector.</P>
      <P>We have a fund of £63 million to which we add a considerable contribution from the European Social Fund.  I will spell out clearly why we are opposing the section. On Second Stage we asked that we be told specifically that this money was in addition to Exchequer funding already made available by successive Governments for the training, work experience and general development needs of young people.  It is obvious that this is no longer the case.  It is obvious that this levy of 1 per cent is an imposition of tax on workers, on the self-employed, the farming community and business people.</P>
      <P>Those workers, those people generally, from now on will provide the funding for training.  How do I figure that out? Deputy Taylor said that the income was in the region of £72 million.  That probably is generally right, as the Minister has said approximately £63 million, so we will accept that.  To that we add for some of the operations a 55 per cent contribution, for others perhaps less, but a contribution to most of it from the European Fund. Even if we are very conservative and say only £37 million, it is still somewhere around £100 million of funding for what we are talking about tonight.  From what the Minister for Defence said last night on Second Stage it is obvious that this levy is going to fund all the schemes, existing and new, engaged in the training of young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1547" /> We have so much in this Bill and I am sure my colleagues have a lot to say and our time is so restricted that I cannot go further.  I am satisfied now from what the Minister said last night and from the figures available to us that this Government are transferring the funding provided from Exchequer sources at present to funding being provided specifically by a levy imposed on all persons.  Additional activity, yes, but obviously the money is being provided to cater for both additional and existing schemes, therefore it is a hidden tax on all working people. The only people who will not contribute to that levy are those who can successfully avoid or evade payment of the taxation. We oppose the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the remarks of Deputy Fitzgerald.  In principle the idea of an across-the-board levy on all employees is bad.  It is an unfair way of taxing people and it has no regard to one's ability to pay.  It takes no regard of the outgoings a person may have, his number of dependants and so on.  This across-the-board idea of taking 1 per cent away from somebody's income before that person gets his hand on it is bad and, as Deputy Fitzgerald said, is another attack on some of the unfortunate people who are taxed so heavily at the moment. In particular it is going to hit very heavily the PAYE sector who are carrying more than their fair share of the tax burden.  It is all the more serious that such an amount of money should be taken away from all the taxpayers of the country and that, as we established earlier on Committee Stage of this Bill, we as parliamentarians have no direct say in how this money is spent.  We do not seem entitled to ask Parliamentary Questions on how such an amount of State funds are to be expended.  That is regrettable, given that this money is to be taken across the board.  Obviously it will increase from year to year as the unemployment figure rises and as the number of young people in our population increases and more of them will come to the age when they will be seeking employment.  It will not be long before this figure increases from 1 <Col N="1548" /> per cent to 1.5 per cent, 2 per cent, 3 per cent and so on.  As parliamentarians we should have more say in how the agency will expend these funds.  The principle is bad.  This is another form of taxation and it is a dishonest way for the Government to try to find funds for this agency which, on the whole, is very welcome.  The idea of a levy is a bad one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to oppose this section mainly because we find it to be a dishonest step to suggest that this Bill will magically put at the disposal of the Government a sum of £90 million which is now fresh, suddenly available to fund employment here.  If you stop anybody in the street outside and say, &ldquo;Would you mind giving 1 per cent of your wages to find jobs for young people?&rdquo; the person will say, &ldquo;Of course I do not like it but I will do it&rdquo;.  People will be very glad to say that they will do so.  However, what has emerged on Second Stage of this Bill is emerging again today.  The public have the impression that this 1 per cent is fresh money for new schemes, and that is not accurate. The public are misinformed about the situation.  We on this side of the House say that this should be called honestly and openly what we believe it to be, a new tax.  It is raising tax on people's incomes.  It is income tax to fund employment. That is what income tax is for in any case, but we should be open and honest about it.  A glance through the various Estimates will reveal what kind of figures are there already for new schemes.  You will see figures like AnCO £44 million, CERT £1 million, pre-employment courses £3 million, environment £3 million, community schemes of various sorts £4 million and so on.  Before you start putting in others you will arrive at £60 million or £70 million going into new schemes from the State.  One would be very suspicious when the new tax raised by this 1 per cent goes straight into the Exchequer that that money is to be used just to fund existing schemes.  If there is a small increase surely those increases would have to be granted anyway in the normal course because of inflationary trends and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1549" /> A figure of about £10 million, it seems, is being taken from Irish industry on this level.  I mentioned on Second Stage that if we are taking £10 million out of Irish industry to an extent that will damage the competitiveness and performance of Irish industry, then we want to be sure that in spending that money through this agency we are at least providing more jobs than may be affected by taking that £10 million out of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The key to this section of the Bill and the whole Bill as far as we are concerned is how much of that proposed £90 million or £60 million or whatever the figure turns out to be when collected will be spent on specifically new schemes or even an extension of existing schemes and how much of it will be funding what we are already committed to.  If it is funding what we are already committed to, then all we are doing here today is debating a Finance Bill, raising new tax to fund Government schemes in the ordinary course. That is the kernel of it.  The Minister should come clean and tell us honestly and openly if it is a new tax for totally new projects or if it is just bailing out the Government because of existing difficulties. I will leave it at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is where we loop the loop in this legislation.  There is no doubt that you can do almost anything in regard to shifting schemes which are already funded through various Departments into the Youth Employment Agency.  On Second Stage we found that the Minister for Finance has already hived off to the two youth employment schemes and the youth employment enterprise scheme the sum of £200,000, money which has been lying idle and has not been spent at all in spite of the price level that we have.  This money standing awaiting the setting up of an agency while these schemes could be under way at present through the Department of Finance bears out what could happen if this shifting of responsibility for schemes which are already in progress is practised by the Government. This bears out what Deputy Brennan has highlighted.  Indeed, we could see a curtailment through the co-ordination which the Minister is talking about of the very <Col N="1550" /> activities we are trying to promote here. This is a dangerous situation and we on this side must oppose this measure.</P>
      <P>I am opposed to the levy especially when I consider the dramatic steps being taken in Germany, for example, to encourage firms to provide training for young people.  Here we are imposing levies which will be detrimental in the long run.  Money was provided up to now from the Employment Guarantee Fund and that may well be withdrawn if companies are obliged to pay this levy.  We are concerned about this sleight of hand.  It will be damaging to the whole concept of the Youth Employment Agency if it is practised and encouraged by the Government. I have already had an indication, from the reply to my Parliamentary Question of 25 November, that this is already taking place.  The whole question of the levy, the operation of existing schemes and the setting up of the new agency reminds me slightly of the £9.60 a week about which we heard so much.</P>

      <P>This is another example of the danger of rushing through legislation in a few hours.  There are very many defects which have been pointed out by Deputy Browne, and even Deputy Taylor.  We would have liked to tease these out in great detail, if we had had <Col N="1552" /> the time.  I said, in opening the Second Stage debate, that it was a Bill which lent itself to a very useful, worthwhile Committee Stage debate.  You can see, even from the presence on our side of the House, the interest in it &mdash; which would have been far greater had we had time to devote to it.  There were only two short hours and for the first time we are now told that corporation profits tax are not included.  Can the Minister explain to the House why they should be excluded? Why are the PAYE worker, the farmer, the self-employed shouldering the burden of all this levy?  Deputy Brennan put it very well when he said that the majority of people one met in the street would be willing, because of the unemployment situation, to contribute 1 per cent, but now the plot thickens.  We had convinced ourselves, from the inadequate flow of information to us, that it is merely a change in the funding of existing schemes from the Exchequer &mdash; revenue which was being provided for it &mdash; to a specific 1 per cent levy for the existing schemes and additional new schemes.  It is, in fact, a Finance Bill with which we are dealing here &mdash; a selective Finance Bill.  Deputy Browne is in the House but I am amazed that Deputy Kemmy is not.  I would like to hear if they are aware that this legislation does not include corporation profits tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that people would pay a contribution on the basis of their income as assessed for tax, on corporation tax which is a separate tax &mdash; not corporation profits tax which was abolished in about 1976.  That is a different thing.  Would the Minister not agree that the idea behind the scheme is that people who are in employment should contribute in an attempt to create jobs for those who are not in employment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Brennan and Deputy Fitzgerald have said, nobody has <Col N="1553" /> any objection to funding a scheme to help the unemployed to find a job, particularly young people who have difficulty in obtaining employment.  The average PAYE worker, if told, as we are told now, that he must pay 1 per cent of his income by way of a levy to fund employment when the banks and all the other profiteers who make tremendous profits every year are making no contribution, would consider that an absolute disgrace.  It will not have the acceptance of the vast majority of the people, who are already overtaxed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a Bill in front of us.  We dealt with the first section which set out those people who are going to pay the levy and this passed over without debate at that stage.  All the people are listed there in the Bill.  I cannot understand how anybody could be in any doubt that this was a 1 per cent levy on personal income, on PRSI obviously, taking in those people covered by the Health Act. They are clearly listed and nobody could be in any doubt.  It was never intended that the levy be extended into the profits of business.  It was a personal levy and so it was always explained and brought before the people at the general election. Anybody who has approached me &mdash; and various bodies have &mdash; has been satisfied on this point of what exactly I was setting out &mdash; that this was, at all stages, a 1 per cent levy on personal income.  Nobody has been misled, except the Members opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1554" /> One may or may not agree that the operation of the youth levy should be obtained on personal incomes or from general taxation, but the method put forward by the Government is that it should be a levy, which has a number of attractions. We are asking the people to pay this levy for a number of reasons.  There is a serious youth unemployment problem which will cost money to solve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asking those who are employed to contribute from their incomes to solve these problems. There is complete transparency in what is being done with the proceeds from the levy.  In my First Reading speech, I left nobody in any doubt as to how the schemes were being financed.  I clearly stated it in my Second Reading speech, and no one in this House at this stage can say that I have not given full information at all stages.</P>

      <P>I protest in the strongest possible manner.  Here is a Bill of extreme importance to every Member of this House and of extreme importance to the unemployed young people.  If ever a Bill needed a worth while Committee Stage, this did.  It did not get it in the two hours available.  There were many reservations expressed even by Members on the Government Benches on some sections of it.  This section is one that we are absolutely opposed to and would be voting on, given the opportunity.  The only option open to us is opposing the Bill in its entirety and we are reluctant to do that because any contribution towards helping young people, even though it be <Col N="1556" /> confined to training and work experience as it is in this Bill, we are prepared to support.</P>
      <P>We could have spent several hours on this section alone teasing out the problems. This involves a transfer of funding for youth agencies, training and work schemes, CERT, environmental schemes, National Manpower Service schemes, from the workers of this country. I cannot force a vote because it would be interpreted as a vote against the entire measure.  But I want it recorded here that we are opposed to the 1 per cent hidden taxation being imposed in this Bill.  It is another Finance measure.</P>
      <P>Question &ldquo;That all the amendments set down by the Minister for Labour on Committee Stage and not disposed of are hereby made to the Bill, that the Bill is hereby agreed to and is reported to the House, the Report Stage is hereby completed and the Bill is hereby passed&rdquo; put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I have only eight minutes and I will be as brief as I can.  I am glad that the Minister is here tonight because I hope to be able to impress upon him that, as a decent man, he should change the decision made on 23 July.  It is discrimination against single women and single men and it is discrimination against the young couple of Ireland who are looking for loans from the local authority.  I pointed this out forcibly last night, and with the few minutes at my disposal I want to impress it on the Minister because I want an answer.  The Minister of State spent all his time last night telling us he had no money.  He mentioned that Deputy Burke brought in the £3,000 mortgage subsidy scheme in the middle of the financial year and it was not provided for in the Estimates.  But the Government have provided money for higher education and that was done in the middle of the year with no vote; the county councils were told to pay out the money and they would get it back next year.  So there is no point in talking about Deputy Burke introducing the £3,000 mortgage subsidy when he did.  It is a useful subsidy and it is a shame to do away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the biggest discrimination of all has taken place in regard to local authority loans.  I want clarification.  But apparently the Minister is not going to listen to me; I am not important enough.  I will have to stop until the Minister is ready to listen.  I am looking at the Minister.  He is sitting there and he is a decent man and I want him to hear what I have to say in the few minutes.  He could not possibly <Col N="1559" /> hear what I have to say and be talking at the same time.</P>
    <P>The position is that according to the decision of 23 July and the answers I have got to Parliamentary Questions the two names have to go on the application form.  I want the Minister to clarify this. The matter was debated at length in Galway County Council and most of the councillors were opposed to this ruling. The Fine Gael members were unanimous that it was unworkable.  It was discrimination. We always advise young people who are getting married to have at least half their houses built before they actually get married.  Now the two names must appear on the application form and the two incomes are taken into account. The two names have to appear on the title.  The Minister is not listening.</P>

If they are earning anything at all they have to earn over £7,000.  If one party is under 21 years then they cannot get a loan.  I have known of refusals where the boy was 22 and the girl was 19.  She was not entitled to get a loan.  I may be told that that is the business of the Department of Justice but it is the Minister who made the regulations and he should have discussed them with the Department of Justice.  This should be changed.  If they have a right to vote at <Col N="1560" /> 18 they should have a right to get a loan at 18.</P>

As far as I know, apart from professional people and those in the Government service, everyone else is in temporary employment.  Every other week this factory and that factory is closing down. How is one to define temporary employment? I think the Minister said temporary employment was not taken into account.  I ask the Minister to define temporary employment now.  If the total income is over £7,000 the applicants are out.  I pointed out last night that a father may give a site to his son who is marrying a girl down the road.  The son may change his mind but, if he wants to get the site, he must marry the girl.  This is discrimination and I would ask the Minister as a decent, honourable man, to change this. If he will not change it will be please define temporary employment and will he have the same system in every county? There are not too many here in the House to hear me.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to proceed, with Deputy Mitchell on his feet protesting.  I regret Deputy Mitchell's behaviour.  I do not blame him for leaving the Chamber in protest because Deputy Mitchell and other Fine Gael Deputies are totally embarrassed about this embargo on single people.  When discrimination of this kind has been perpetrated surely Deputies like Deputy Mitchell cannot justify it.  They are not prepared to justify it.</P>
      <P>I ask how could Deputy Peter Barry, who has been a TD for years, stand over this form of discrimination?  I was not surprised at the furore caused by Deputy Gay Mitchell because I am sure if he had stayed he could not in conscience vote for the Government amendment.  Perhaps some of the other Fine Gael Deputies who have been speaking out about this deprivation of single person's rights will come in here and vote for the amendment. Unfortunately Deputy Sherlock was suspended this morning.  On RTE news at 6.30 tonight he sided categorically with the Opposition against the Government on this issue.  I am not alleging anything sinister, but I suggest that if he had not been suspended he would have voted here tonight for our motion.</P>
      <P>Never before in the history of the State have a Government practised such discrimination against single people.  During the general election campaign the people would not believe that a Government would discriminate in such a way.  They thought that the incoming Government would support and help young people, but one of the first acts of the Government was to stop young people from getting these loans.  I will refer to the Circular, B.C. 6/81, dated 29 July 1981 and headed &ldquo;Mortgage Subsidy and Ordinary S.D.A. Loans&rdquo;.  It was from the office of the Minister for the Environment and it stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be noted that eligibility for the <Col N="1566" /> mortgage subsidy and ordinary local authority house purchase loans is being restricted to married persons and persons about to marry.  Where a couple propose to marry within twelve months, they may obtain approval to the payment of a loan and mortgage subsidy, provided that the application for the loan and subsidy is in their joint names.  At the approval stage, a statement of intention to marry will suffice. Payments will not normally be made until evidence of marriage (e.g. marriage certificate) is available.  Payments of the loan and subsidy may, however, be made before the marriage if the local authority and the Department, respectively, are satisfied that the couple have made arrangements to marry within twelve months of the payment and the mortgage is executed in the joint names of the prospective husband and wife.</P>
    <P>A further regulation was circulated without a debate in the Dáil and was implemented by county councils as per instructions. In due course a letter was circulated to people who had applied for loans in the following form by Roscommon County Council:</P>
    <P>Referring to your application to this Council for a loan of £14,000 for the purpose of providing a dwellinghouse it is noted that you are single.  In the case of single persons loans are now confined to those who intend to marry within twelve months.  In order that your application can be considered, please submit a Certificate from a Clergyman stating that you intend to marry within twelve months.  You must also submit the P.60 for year ending 5/4/81 for the person you intend to marry.</P>
    <P>On receipt of the above documents your application will receive further consideration.</P>
    <P>We, in Roscommon County Council, discussed this issue &mdash; all other county councils received the same circular &mdash; and I thought it would be impossible for Government councillors to support the circular requirement.  However, as recently as 18 November last a new circular <Col N="1567" /> was issued from Deputy Barry's office, reference H/4/81.  It is in relation to the assessment of income tax for SDA loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  Tonight Deputy Callanan sought clarification on the requirements.</P>
    <P>In the new circular the Minister says that strong representations were made to him that some local authorities were taking into account the joint income of intending spouses.  It was his view that there was no justification for that if employment of a temporary nature was involved.  If the county council were satisfied on that ground they could ignore the income of one of the people who were proposing to marry.</P>
    <P>This is another vague request to the local authorities.  What is a permanent job?  What is a temporary job?  Realising the strong objections which have come from right around the country to his first circular on 18 November, to some extent the Minister watered down the initial embargo on single people proposing to marry.  In this new circular he told the local authorities that, if one of the spouses was in a temporary job, the income could be ignored.  Soon after the marriage that person would leave the job.</P>
    <P>What kind of a situation arises when the Minister puts forward this proposal and it is implemented by the local authority? There has to be policing to discover whether the applicant has a girl friend. He then has to receive a letter from the local parish priest or the reverend minister, whichever the case may be.  He then has to go back to the local authority and they may decide that he intends to marry. He then has to provide the P.60 for his girl friend.  If their joint income is above £7,000 they will be deprived of a local authority loan.  The new requirement will mean that the county council will require a detective agency to investigate whether the spouse has a permanent or temporary job.  What is permanent and what is temporary?</P>
    <P>If a gentleman or a lady was engaged to a Member of this House would the Minister regard the Member's job as temporary or permanent?  I would not regard it as permanent.  If Government Deputies are <Col N="1568" /> engaged to be married will their incomes be ignored for loan purposes on the basis of the job being permanent or temporary?  That is a very good question.  In many cases this job in the Dáil has been very temporary for many people.</P>
    <P>How could a local authority implement this circular?  I will be seeking detailed clarification from the Minister to guide the local authorities.  They will require the Minnie Brennans of this world to find out whether the job the boy or the girl is engaged in is temporary or permanent. As Deputies know, Minnie is a character in &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; and she is a local sub-postmistress.  She may be involved in providing information for the local authorities and the Minister.  The local authorities are extremely upset about this situation because it is very embarrassing for them.</P>
    <P>At one stage courtship was a very straightforward matter between a boy and a girl.  They proceeded to the day when the question would be popped. Now the question is: &ldquo;Where is your P.60?  How much are you earning?  Would the two of us get a loan?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Did you apply for the £9.60?&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a problem which would arise after they got married. This is before they even get to the church. The question is: &ldquo;What is your income?&rdquo; That is a very impertinent question to ask your girl friend.  The girl friend may decide: &ldquo;This business is getting out of hand.  He did not pop the question.  Why should he ask me that very impertinent question?&rdquo; That is what he has to ask her.  The Minister is laughing but this is his own circular.  It was not composed in the Gaiety Theatre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>If it had been composed in the Gaiety Theatre when the Coalition parties got together, there might be an excuse for it.  Maureen Potter will have a field day in &ldquo;Gaels of Laughter&rdquo; this Christmas when she deals with this aspect <Col N="1569" /> of courtship 1981, Irish style, courtesy of the Coalition.</P>
      <P>They proceed to discuss the question of the P.60.  At that stage he may not have asked her whether she would marry him.  He has to find out whether they are eligible from a financial point of view to build a house.  They get the P.60 and discover that they are not eligible for the £14,000 loan because their joint income is over £7,000.  They have two choices: whether to call the whole thing off and get somebody else, or she may decide that her job is temporary and apply to her employer to state that her job is temporary. That is another aspect of the whole silly affair as a result of the circular issued to the local authorities.</P>
      <P>He then has to go down to the local parish priest or reverend minister.  Visualise the situation when a decent Roscommon man, west of Ireland man or Irishman says: &ldquo;Father, I am going with a girl and we intend to get married.&rdquo;  The priest says: &ldquo;That is fine.  What can I do about it?&rdquo; He says: &ldquo;I want you to fill up a letter and sign a form and give it to me because otherwise I will not get a county council loan.&rdquo;  I suggested recently that we should have a standard letter which the parish priest or the reverend clergyman could sign.  Has the Minister got that letter available to circulate to clergymen? I want a few copies to give to the local clergymen in Roscommon because they do not know what it is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They go to the clergyman and he probably does not even know them.  They tell him they intend to get married within 12 months.  Presumably the reverend minister or the priest will give them a letter. They then proceed to the county council. All things being equal, the letter provided, the guarantee of marriage on the table, the P.60 in order, and if not the P.60 the girl friend or the boy friend says the job is temporary, and they get approval for the loan.  At that stage they are informed that the loan will not be paid until they get to the church on time. After the marriage ceremony they are provided with a certificate which they submit to the local authority.  Then the loan may be paid provided that the local <Col N="1570" /> authority have the money to pay it.  It might be some months afterwards.</P>
    <P>It seems the Minister has some discretion. He can decide whether to pay the loan prior to the marriage date.  There is something in the regulations which states that the council, in consultation with the Minister, may decide &mdash; and I presume he will get many of these requests and representations from his own party &mdash; to expedite the whole process and that the local authority will be allowed to pay the loan slightly before the marriage date.</P>
    <P>What happens if the marriage is called off?  Will the loan be withdrawn?  Will the young couple be brought before the courts?  In our time in Government we brought in legislation banning breach of promise actions.  This is a new type of action 1981 style.  It is the new shotgun method.  The couple have entered into a binding agreement not only to marry but to build their house and get a loan.  What kind of pressures is the Minister placing on young couples who propose to marry, build a home and raise a family?  He is putting immense pressure on them.</P>
    <P>Mind you, this pressure may be beseeched when the situation arises for a possible annulment in due course.  It is possible to say &mdash; and the Church courts are quite clear on these issues &mdash; that there was pressure on the couple to force them into a marriage which was not voluntary. Surely there is no worse pressure than financial on a young couple which forces them to marry.  I believe the Minister is putting that pressure on young couples today, which is a very serious and onerous responsibility.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister I think he will have to change the rules.  This motion has proved a very useful exercise in highlighting the injustices perpetrated in those circumstances.  Having heard the arguments advanced by this side of the House I believe the Minister will find himself in a situation in which he will amend the regulations, restoring the situation to that obtaining when we left office in July last.  The situation then was clear-cut&mdash;young people were given loans under Fianna Fáil.  Young people are deprived of loans under the National Coalition Government.</P>

      <P>I want to deal with the situation in which a person has no intention of marrying.  This is a very serious situation because somehow it is implied in this circular that the provisions apply to young people only in the 20 to 25 age group and that they can somehow delay applying for a loan.  Many people in their forties and fifties have applied for loans. Many of those people are single and will never have an opportunity to own their home under the present administration. I raised this issue before in the House.  I raised it also on many occasions in Roscommon County Council.  I said I was launching my little crusade to change the rules in this regard and I am appealing to the Minister to help me in this crusade. There was a major crusade launched by the Taoiseach some time ago in relation to the Constitution.  In this regard the same Taoiseach, chairing a Cabinet meeting, decided on these changes which discriminate totally against single people. What kind of an attraction is that to the single people of the Six Counties to tie in with us down here?  That is absolute discrimination against single people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with the situation in which a single person, who has no opportunity to marry, applies.  How can the Minister advise that person?  Must he or she decide to live in inadequate housing? The applicant may be male or female, a spinster or a bachelor in the old Irish terminology.  They have no opportunity <Col N="1573" /> to marry and they are being deprived not alone of wedded bliss but of a home to live in.  Surely that type of discrimination is totally unfair.  I have many people coming to my constituency clinics appealing to me to endeavour to change this situation. All I can do is use this House in an endeavour to change the regulations.  I believe the Minister is a reasonable man and will come round to our way of thinking, restoring the situation to what it was prior to the change of Government.</P>
    <P>Speaking last night at a function opening the headquarters of the Educational Building Society the Minister said there was a significant downturn in the number of houses built in the last nine months of this year compared with the same period in 1980.  I have here the <i>Irish Independent</i> of today according to which he said that in 1981 20,445 houses were built as against 21,766 in 1980.  Surely this is an indication of the effect the circular is having on the house purchasing and building situation and indeed its disastrous effects on employment and unemployment. Many people who would otherwise be building throughout the country have ceased, which has a major effect on the building industry.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I have not more time because I have many more things to say on this issue.  I can say only that approximately 40 per cent of loan applicants are being affected by this circular, 40 per cent of people who applied who were single, or single and about to be married&mdash;it was 43.4 per cent in the last quarter of 1980, and that figure is taken from the housing loans statistics 1977 to 1980.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to change that circular.  He has made a mistake.  Let him be man enough to admit it, change the rules and restore the situation to that obtaining when we left office this year.</P>

      <P>I want to say something about that first, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and <Col N="1574" /> then say something about what happened in your absence when another Deputy was in the Chair.  This debate this evening did not start until six minutes past seven, by that clock there, because Members of the Opposition Party tried to continue into Private Member's Time the debate on the Youth Employment Agency Bill. I asked the Chairman at the time if that would come out of their time rather than out of the Government's, and he would not give me any undertaking in that regard.  I repeat my case to you now, Sir, that the time taken was taken by Opposition speakers depriving the Government of their five minutes between 8.10 p.m. and 8.15 p.m. this evening.  I am asking now if you will cut down the amount of winding up time for the movers of the motion to ten minutes to allow us on this side conclude our contribution.</P>

      <P>I want to protest also about what happened when Deputy Callanan sat down at about 7.15 this evening.  Deputy Mitchell and I were sitting on this side of the House.  You were not in the Chair at that time.  It would be an exaggeration to say before he sat down but, as Deputy Callanan sat down, Deputy Leyden rose to speak.  The normal courtesy of this House is that speakers alternate between the sides.  Deputy Mitchell, who was the next speaker on our side, was under the impression that Deputy Leyden was making an inquiry or raising a point of order. Deputy Leyden then launched into a contribution to the debate &mdash; which I enjoyed very much &mdash; depriving Deputy Mitchell of a chance to speak.  That is over now and nothing can be done but I want to protest that the normal courtesies were not observed.</P>

      <P>In defence of the Acting Chairman, I must say that his problem was that he looked towards the Government benches and saw a Minister and a backbench Deputy, neither of whom offered.  Traditionally the Minister would get precedence over the backbench Deputy, and he thought the matter had not been settled by them. When neither of them offered he did what was required of him, namely, he called Deputy Leyden who was offering. That is as the Acting Chairman saw it, and rightly so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that later. The amendment in my name reads as follows:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and to substitute:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;takes note that because of the inadequate provision made for expenditure on housing by the Department of the Environment in 1981, the Government were compelled to confine, at this stage, house purchase loans and the <Col N="1577" /> mortgage subsidy to those most in need&mdash;namely married people, those about to be married and special categories of borrowers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When I speak about an inadequate provision for housing, I want to place clearly on record that I mean not only an inadequate provision for house purchase but also massive underprovision for local authority housing.  This underprovision was made not through bad or incorrect estimation but in the clear knowledge that the minimum required was far greater than that provided.</P>
    <P>The amount provided in the public capital programme for local authority house-building in 1981 was £108.5 million. This was increased in May on the eve of the general election by the provision of an extra £2.5 million for the Cork area where there was a danger of imminent lay-offs because of lack of finance. The total inadequacy of the increased provision of £111 million can be seen when it is compared with the actual expenditure of £113.6 million on the programme in 1980 and when account is taken of the fact that house-building costs increased by nearly 23 per cent between mid-1980 and mid-1981.  The Government provided £2,500,000 million less for house-building in 1981 than they did in 1980 despite the fact that there was an increase in house-building costs of nearly 23 per cent.  That was the concern shown by the then Government for housing the people.  It was a disgraceful performance and I would be ashamed to say I was a member of such a party.</P>
    <P>When I took up office on 1 July I found that 75 per cent of the total capital made available for 1981 had already been drawn from the Local Loans Fund and that some authorities who had extensive house programmes in progress had absolutely nothing to draw.  The consequences of this were that many managers were contemplating putting contractors on notice that they would not be able to honour certificates of payments in the second half of the year.</P>
    <P>When I became a Member of this House ten or 12 years ago there was a Fianna Fáil Deputy who was very fond of starting each speech, irrespective of the <Col N="1578" /> subject under discussion, by saying he remembered that when Fianna Fáil came back into government Dublin Corporation had not the price of a bag of cement. Deputies opposite will know who I am talking about.  When I came back to office this year, not alone had they not the price of a bag of cement but they had not paid for last year's cement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was genuinely surprised to find that the situation was so bad.  I was even more surprised to find there was no apparent intention on the part of the former administration to do anything about it.  In other words, the local authority housing programme was collapsing to a level which would see the completion of only about 3,000 houses in 1982 and no action was taken to avoid this.  I find it hard to reconcile this lack of concern for those in the greatest need of housing with the solicitude for families in need housing so regularly expressed since July by Members on the other side of the House.</P>
      <P>Immediate action was called for and I am glad to say the Government did not delay in deciding on my recommendation to provide an additional £30 million for the programme.  This was an increase of 27 per cent on the existing provision and represented an increase of almost 40 per cent on the capital provided for the programme in 1980.  The enormity of the problem left by the previous Government can be gauged from the fact that even with this massive increase in finance a number of local authority programmes are still in difficulties.  Present indications are that completions this year will be at the lowest level for 10 years and that the programme had been run down to such an extent that it will take quite some time to get it back on a good footing.</P>
      <P>I admit I am digressing now but I was interested to see that Fianna Fáil Deputies like to be called former Ministers. They do not like to be called Opposition spokesmen, frontbench spokesmen or shadow Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>On the private housing side, when we took office we found that the previous administration, with great publicity, had produced what they called the Housing Package, 1981, with new higher income limits and new higher loan limits for local authority house purchase loans schemes, a new special loan scheme for tenants and those on the waiting list and a new mortgage subsidy scheme. Although fully aware that the package would cost substantially more this year, the former Government made no provision for it.  All they gave were promises with nothing to back them up.  Although local authorities were informed of the details of the new package and given the go-ahead to accept and approve applications under the new limits, they were not informed of any increase in their capital allocations to enable them to meet the new demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was very good reason for this. The Government did not authorise any extra financing for the purpose. The provisions would remain as they were in the public capital programme.  There were plenty of promises, programmes and publicity but no money.  Deputies are aware that the major part of the finance <Col N="1580" /> which local authorities issued to applicants approved for house purchase and reconstruction loans comes from the Exchequer through the Local Loans Fund.  The 41 local authorities were informed in February last of their allocation for the year, the amount which it was expected would be available to provide for internal resources and the amount up to which they could draw from the Local Loans Fund monthly to finance payments as they arose.  This form of allocation was decided upon at the start of the year because even then it was felt that the overall provision was already tight, many local authorities would find it difficult to manage and a monthly allocation would help them.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, as I have said, in May 1981 the last Government announced their housing package, 1981, in which they decided to increase the local authority loan limit to £14,000 and the income limit to £7,000 and to phase out the low rise mortgage scheme but at the same time to introduce a new special scheme for tenants and those on the waiting list, with a maximum loan of £18,000.  It must be clear to all Deputies, as it was clear to the last administration, that the consequences of this decision must have been to increase the demand for money in the current year over and above that which would arise because of the lower limits. The increase in the income limit from £5,000 to £7,000 made very many more eligible, while the increase in the loan limit was in itself of the order of 16 per cent.  At the same time a new scheme with maximum loans of £18,000 for which no provision had previously been made was also introduced.  Notwithstanding, the previous Government were aware that the effects of the proposal would require an additional £9 million in 1981. What did they do?  Nothing.</P>

They showed the people what great housing administrators they were, but failed to give any indication that the necessary finance for the scheme had not been provided.  This scheme applied to first-time owner-occupiers of grant-type new houses.  This is the famous mortgage subsidy scheme.  Do they remember when that was launched?  They had a great night then.</P>

      <P>This is the housing mortgage subsidy scheme which was referred to first at the gathering of the Fianna Fáil at their Ard Fheis in the RDS last March. Deputy Burke, then Minister for the Environment, got up on the rostrum &mdash; I saw him on television &mdash; and he said what he was going to do about this and that, it would apply to people in certain categories, there would be a three-year mortgage subsidy, and he was cheered loudly by a thronged hall.</P>

      <P>He got down off that rostrum and went out to the press corridor where they asked to speak to him about this new scheme.  It seemed a very generous scheme.  How was it to be paid for?  Without batting an eyelid Deputy Burke said that the money would be borrowed. The story of the Fianna Fáil's life over the last few years is, &ldquo;Oh, the money will be borrowed.&rdquo;  Who is to pay for the borrowing?  Is Deputy Burke serious?  He gave a long lecture here on Fianna Fáil's commitment to thrift.  A major portion of his speech was taken up with thrift and the dedication of the Fianna Fáil Party to thrift.  You will understand, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, when a subsidy like this is introduced it is part of the current budget and must be paid for annually. This is the very reason, the number one reason, why the Fianna Fáil Party find themselves on that side of the House instead of on this side.  They continued to borrow extraordinary sums of money to pay for the current deficit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I must take issue with some contributions to this debate.  On a couple of occasions yesterday the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Burke, spoke unctiously about Fianna Fáil giving encouragement to home ownership with special emphasis on encouragement to thrift.  He was the man who was going to borrow the total money for the mortgage subsidy scheme.  There was no question of thrift last April, but everybody should practice thrift now that they are in Opposition.  Could any contribution by a representative of the most profligate Government in this country's short history sound more cynical and insincere? There is little evidence in the financial policies of the previous Government of the thrift so warmly commended.  Why did other members of that Government not give effect to the concept of the thrift he recommends so warmly now in Opposition?</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke's heart bleeds also for the problems of the unmarried applicants for SDA loans who were rejected because they were unmarried or not contemplating marriage within a reasonable time.  As a former member of Dublin County Council Deputy Burke must be aware that that council and a number of other councils throughout the country before any letter was issued from my Department in July last had decided as a matter of policy that house purchase loans should be advanced to persons who were unmarried and not contemplating early marriage only in quite exceptional circumstances.  This was the policy of Dublin County Council of which Deputy Burke was a member.</P>

A number of other counties have been pursuing precisely that policy for a number of years and Deputy Burke was a member of Dublin County Council when they were doing it.  Yet he comes in here, as he did last night, and attacks the Government for adopting exactly the same policy.  Either he has a short memory or he is a hypocrite.  I do not think it could be both.</P>
      <P>I want to say a word about the building societies subsidy because Deputy Burke was critical about the termination of the subsidy to the societies on 1 September last.  The first thing Deputy Burke did when he became Minister for the Environment was to remove the subsidy which was being paid to building societies.  That was the first thing he did when he was made Minister in September or October 1979.</P>

      <P>In 1980.  The first thing he did was to remove the subsidy that was being paid then to building societies. A short memory or the alternative?  I do not know.  You have to answer that for yourselves.  The Fianna Fáil Party collectively have a short memory.  I am not sure if Deputy Leyden did, but other speakers spoke about the home improvement grants.  Did any one of them open his mouth when those grants were wiped out completely by the last Government after being in existence since 1924?  Since that time some form of home improvement grant scheme was in operation in this country and this great, big-hearted &mdash; when in Opposition &mdash; party never let a geek out of them about it.  Deputy Burke is probably not a member of the county council now.  Indeed, he was a member of the county council when this happened. <Col N="1585" /> pened.  Does the Deputy remember Offaly County Council?  He was part of the decision to wipe out the home improvements grants &mdash; Deputy Callanan in Galway County Council and Deputy Leyden in Roscommon County Council.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be diverted from the subject.  I am very short of time.  On another point raised by Deputy Callanan, I want to say quite clearly that the early age at which people are tending to marry is of concern to many of us and the difficulties which this causes when people under 21 enter into a contract.  Of course, the law says that they can enter into a contract, but can opt out of it again?  The contract is not binding until they are 21.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a problem which has to be tackled in a whole lot of other fields besides housing, but it does crop up in housing.  I made representations to other Departments concerned to have the law changed generally on the point. If that does not happen within a reasonably short time, because of other demands and other priorities, if I have a Housing Bill to bring in next year &mdash; and I think that will happen &mdash; I will include some clause which will cater for that situation. This is an important point and I accept its validity at the present time.

They wrote to the Minister and asked, when assessing people's incomes for loans &mdash; Deputy Leyden sees now what I am speaking about &mdash; what should they do?  The Department, on behalf of the Minister, wrote back that there was no justification for not including the total income of that couple when assessing their means for a loan for a house.

      <P>Up to now, both incomes are being taken into consideration where single people are concerned. This is in operation in my own county of Laois-Offaly and throughout a lot of the country.  Let us not get away from that. However, I want also to point out that any county council may now alter a policy of its own accord as regards who gets the loan and who does not.  That is a matter for the county council and for the manager of the day to decide.  We have had a situation where, beyond doubt, local authorities were advised that joint incomes came into the mortgage income. That has been the situation up to now and certain categories may qualify.  I am amazed that the Minister for the Environment is putting the onus on the clergy to decide who will be married and when they are going to be married.  The clergy have intimated to me that this is putting them in a very difficult position.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that they are being made judge and jury on this.  That is not good enough.  It is not right or proper.  However, that is the situation now.  There are many more implications.  These persons who are going to marry must get into their own name the land on which they are going to build.  If the marriage falls through &mdash; and many a marriage has fallen through because the man may not go ahead or the lady may say the marriage is not on any longer &mdash; what then is the position in regard to the title of the site?  What a legal wrangle we will have then and who <Col N="1589" /> will win there?  Everybody knows who, but I will not mention that now.  I have followed what the Minister of State said last night and also listened to the Minister for the Environment stating that when we left the Department the finances necessary were not available.  When one brings in a new scheme one is unable to say what the demand will be like.  But let me remind the House that when the last Coalition Government were in office they did not raise the income level for SDA loans or the SDA loans themselves. When we came into office we had to rectify all of that.  Since I came into Dáil Éireann there was never a year when there was not a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of the Environment and every other Department.  There is no point in Government spokesmen saying that they were left without the money to do various things.  It is not rubbing off any more on the public and it is not rubbing off on me either.</P>

    <P>What financial institution would give a bridging loan to a couple on the basis of a promise of marriage?  I have no doubt that there is none that would.  Now the joint income of both parties is taken into account so that it will be over the £7,000 limit and a loan will not have to be granted.  We on this side of the House believe, without a doubt, that the SDA loans are about to go completely.  Their days are numbered.  The Government only have to bring regulations and stipulations so that very few people will qualify. If a couple go into rented accommodation when they get married they are paying at least £25 a week.  If they then go ahead and get a local authority loan they will have to raise a bridging loan as well and will then find themselves paying out £50 a week between paying for the flat and the bridging loan.  How could any young couple do that?  These young couples will have no alternative but to go on the local authority housing list and ask the corporation or the County Council to house them.  If they got an SDA loan they would pay the interest on the money and pay the charges and there would be no cost to the Exchequer.  Earlier we were accused of borrowing.  We did borrow but it was for productive purposes and <Col N="1590" /> we make no apology for that.  We borrowed to give money to people to build their own houses and they paid the interest on the charges.  What is wrong with that?  We borrowed no more than the Coalition as to the rate of GNP when they left office in 1975.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words also on the housing package that we brought in.  We brought in a subsidy to help newly weds and those about to be married in the first few years when payments would be severe.  In rural Ireland, if a young man wants to get married, he will do the best he can.  He may be lucky enough to get a plot from his father or his in-laws to build his own house.  What position is he in now?  I would have to advise him not to go ahead because he will not be able to raise the money from the local authority. His hands are completely tied.  If we had been left in office we would have made the necessary money available both for local authority housing and for SDA loans.  We would not have interfered with the system that was in operation.  It was a good system.  But now what is taking place is discrimination of the highest order.  When one has to bring in the clergy to adjudicate on who is going to be married and who is not going to be married it is getting a bit highhanded altogether, with all due respects to the Government.</P>
    <P>There is going to be an enormous number of new applicants on the local authority and corporation housing lists throughout the country.  There will be four applicants for every house built.  I am not surprised in view of the policy of the Government before the election when they said they were going to cut the capital programme.  Everybody knows what that means.</P>
    <P>There have been some U-turns in regard to a number of Departments.  I hope that there will be a U-turn now and the Government will revert to the policy that we were implementing before we left office.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned home improvement grants.  We did away with home improvement grants and I will explain why.  We decided that the money available should be put into new housing <Col N="1591" /> to house newly weds and those about to be married.  That was a reasonable thing to do because some people were getting home improvement grants for what I would call luxury extensions.  I would like to deal for a moment with the home improvement grant that the Government brought in.  There are so many conditions in it that very few people will get approval.  There is a means test on that. There is nothing included for new roofs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I asked a question about phone tapping and the investigation into it.  I asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he had received a final report from the study group which investigated allegations by the General Secretary of Fine Gael about phone tapping. It had been the subject of numerous Parliamentary Questions in the autumn of 1980.  The Minister's reply was:</P>
      <P>The report of the detailed examination of the complaint made was received.  It was not possible to establish by whom or in what circumstances the overhearing complaint had been carried out.</P>
      <P>I submit to the House a letter sent to me when I was Minister of State in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Deputy O'Keeffe, now a Minister of State, wrote the letter to me.  The letter is dated 8 March, 1981.  He wrote:</P>
      <P>Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>For some time past I have been investigating on behalf of the Fine Gael Party the tapping of phone conversations of Peter Prendergast, our General Secretary.</P>
      <P>That, I suggest, is not overhearing.  I am aware that Mr. Prendergast, now a senior adviser to the Government at an astronomical fee, made a statement to the effect that on Friday, 21 November 1980, he had two detailed important phone conversations with Mr. John Bruton, T.D., then spokesman for Agriculture on this side of the House.  Mr. Prendergast said: &ldquo;I now have reason to believe that both conversations were listened to by a team of people, working together, and that notes were made of specific aspects of the conversations held.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We were then in Government.  While serving to the best of my ability in an honoured position in that Government, I deliberately upheld the respectability one must try to maintain for the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I do not see the same effort forthcoming from the present outfit in that Department today.  Suddenly, when they grabbed power, they changed alleged phone tapping by a team working together and notes made of specific aspects to overhearing.  That does not show much respect for the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the section of the staff working in the exchanges by people like Deputy O'Keeffe and Mr. Prendergast who now assumes the honour of and the cash for an alleged job with the Government.</P>
      <P>In November last year the public relations section of the Fine Gael outfit who were over here started on a nice little propaganda job.  They started talking about culling.  They said they were phone tapped.  I will give the names used by Mr. Prendergast.  Willie and Frank were alleged to have tapped the telephone. Then we had references by Mr. Prendergast to the fact that in that phone tap &mdash; it was not an overhearing; it was deliberate &mdash; Bruton was mentioned when he heard them whispering when he put his hand over the phone in this House.  He could hear them saying, &ldquo;Bruton&rdquo;&ldquo;agriculture&rdquo;, &ldquo;three types of culling&rdquo;, &ldquo;this is important&rdquo;, &ldquo;they have a programme prepared&rdquo;, &ldquo;the price fixing mechanism&rdquo;, &ldquo;there is no tone on it now&rdquo;.  That means Mr. Prendergast had discovered that Willie and Frank were listening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> Later we discovered two ladies were accompanying Willie and Frank.  I could not describe to this House the words described by Mr. Prendergast in his statement which I read and of which I was careful to keep a copy.  Some of them were four letter words which I do not use.  Suddenly we discovered another fellow called Gerry McMahon.  I may seem to be funny in the way I present this but it is not my fault.  An intensive Garda investigation was pursued, according to Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my best.  Deputy O'Keeffe and the Garda could find nothing. Numerous questions were put down here over the winter and then withdrawn. I said they must make a formal complaint to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs before we could investigate it.  The documentation arrived in a letter from Deputy O'Keeffe.  I wrote to him and told him I had started the investigation as promised.  He was given the results of that investigation which were of absolutely no use to him because there was no more PR in it for him.</P>
      <P>Then he put down the Dáil question again which he had withdrawn so often during the winter.  I answered it and I said if he had any more information I would have it investigated.  Not satisfied with that, he pulled out of the bushes again more of this type of stuff and I said I would have it investigated.  I meant that and I did it.  I now want to know from the Minister what was the result of the second investigation.  I asked the most honourable and honest people you could find who work in the Department to go through the investigation again and they did so.  I asked for that report.  Now the allegation has been changed to &ldquo;overhearing&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we should know&mdash;it is vital for many reasons and certainly from the security point of view, from the point of view of the users of the telephone service, and most emphatically from the point of view of the staff of the Department who have a very onerous and risky <Col N="1598" /> job to do &mdash; the result of that investigation. In <i>The Irish Press</i> of last Thursday the heading was &ldquo;Phone tap of the Fine Gael Headquarters Confirmed&rdquo;.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> the heading was &ldquo;Prendergast Phone Calls Overheard&rdquo;.  The only person who had it right was that very respectable writer Olivia O'Leary.  The new Fine Gael propaganda machine is headed by Mr. Henaghan and another man from RTE at an exorbitant cost when money is so scarce.</P>

      <P>I want to protest.  If Deputy Killilea sought information and expected me to give it to him he should have given me the time allotted to me.  He has taken two minutes of my time.  Unfortunately the Minister has another appointment tonight and cannot be here.  Since the foundation of the State the position of the Department has been, is now and will always be, that if an individual makes a complaint about phone tapping or some intrusion into his private affairs on the telephone the Department must accept it and act accordingly.  They did that on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me read to the House what Deputy <Col N="1599" /> Killilea said to Deputy O'Keeffe.  He said that with further reference to his letter concerning allegations of tapping the telephone conversations of Mr. Prendergast, General Secretary of Fine Gael, he was writing to let him know he had asked his Department to carry out a detailed investigation into the matter.  The investigation had already begun and he expected that a senior officer would be in touch with Mr. Prendergast as part of the examination.  He said he would write to Deputy O'Keeffe further when the investigation was completed.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Killilea is accusing people of making that allegation for political reasons  what is he doing tonight?  He told us he is in possession of a letter which is departmental property.  He has abused the Official Secrets Act and he is not entitled to have that letter.  I want to know how many more letters he took out of the Department.  I will report this to <Col N="1600" /> the Ceann Comhairle's office.  I will ask the Attorney General to investigate it.  If Deputy Killilea wants to know how much public relations cost while Deputy Reynolds was there I will tell him because it cannot stop&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 6 of 22 October 1981, my Department are responsible only for the cost of the provision of certain facilities and services required by the tribunal in connection with the holding of the inquiry.  The cost of these facilities and services in the current financial year is estimated at £600,000 approx.  Some additional expenditure will arise in 1982 in connection with the preparation of the tribunal's report, but this expenditure is not expected to be substantial.</P>
      <P>As regards legal fees, the Attorney-General is responsible for certain fees payable out of public funds.  I am informed by the Attorney-General's Office that it is not possible at this moment to give the overall figure for legal fees as there are still fees outstanding, the amount of which is not yet ascertainable. A total of £307,456.50 has been paid to date, and with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report a statement of the names of the recipients and the amount involved in each case.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit from July 1980 to 11 May 1981 after which his claim was disallowed when he was considered to be capable of work by a medical referee.  He claimed and received supplementary welfare <Col N="1455" /> allowance from 16 May 1981 to 3 October 1981 at the rate of £34.10 weekly.  On 5 October 1981 he claimed unemployment benefit at the employment exchange, Waterford.  His claim was allowed at the maximum rate appropriate to a married man, £41.70, and all unemployment benefit due to date has been paid as weekly payments became due.</P>

      <P>The person concerned originally claimed disability benefit from 24 May 1980 to 14 June 1980, after which date she was certified fit to resume work. She was not entitled to payments as, according to the records of my Department, she had not the required minimum of 26 paid contributions to her credit since her entry into insurance.  The claimant was requested to furnish particulars of her previous employment but failed to do so.  She again claimed disability benefit from 8 September 1980 to 13 September 1980 and following inquiries regarding her employment it was established that she had in fact sufficient paid contributions to qualify for benefit.  Due to an oversight, however, payment only issued in respect of the second claim.  A cheque <Col N="1456" /> for the arrears of benefit due from 28 May 1980, fourth day of incapacity, to 14 June 1980 has now issued.  Her entitlement to pay-related benefit in respect of this claim is being investigated and any benefit due will issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The person concerned had been in receipt of unemployment assistance since 24 July 1981 at the rate appropriate to a single person with means assessed at £10.20 weekly derived from the value of board and lodging in his father's home.  Following receipt of information that his circumstances had altered, his case was reinvestigated by a social welfare officer and in the light of inquiries the assessment of his means was reduced by a deciding officer to nil with effect from 14 October 1981.  Accordingly the person concerned was entitled to unemployment assistance at the full weekly rate of £20.35 from 14 October 1981 to 21 October 1981, after which he ceased to sign as unemployment.  The arrears due were paid to him on 26 November 1981.</P>

All disability benefit and pay-related benefit due to 7 December 1981 has been paid.  The delay in payment was due to the fact that the number of a final certificate submitted by <Col N="1458" /> another claimant was misread as referring to the person concerned and payment of benefit was accordingly terminated in error.  In view of his age and the nature of the incapacity it has been decided to pay him on a weekly basis in future in order to avoid interruption in the payment of benefit.</P>

      <P>It is a statutory condition for entitlement to pay-related benefit that the combined sum of flat-rate unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit may not exceed 85 per cent of a recipient's average weekly earnings.  As the amount of flat-rate unemployment benefit payable to the person concerned exceeds 85 per cent of his earnings (£58.85), pay-related benefit is not payable to him.</P>

      <P>The person concerned became entitled to United Kingdom child benefit, with effect from 29 September 1980, under EEC Regulations, which provide that family allowance shall be the responsibility of one member state only.</P>
      <P>The award of child benefit was notified to my Department by the Department of Health and Social Security in October 1981, and consequently payment of children's allowance was discontinued from November 1981, and the United Kingdom authorities were requested to release the appropriate arrears of child benefit.</P>
      <P>It has been confirmed by the Department of Health and Social Security that all arrears of child benefit due to the claimant for the period 29 September 1980 to 6 December 1981 will be issued this week, and that future payments will be made at four-weekly intervals.</P>
