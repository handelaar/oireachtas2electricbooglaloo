      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: No. 7 (Resumed), No. 8 (Resumed) and No. 9 (Resumed).  Business will be interrupted at 3.30 p.m. to take No. 9 and the order will not be resumed thereafter.</P>

      <P>If I were allowed to conclude not only would it be within the Order of Business but it could be extremely constructive and in the best interests of the country.  Could I ask the Taoiseach, in view of that and of the question of a relationship between Ireland and the UK, this part of Ireland and the North, but within the present constitutional position of Northern Ireland, with the exception of a possible departure <Col N="1840" /> on neutrality and defence, in what way does the Taoiseach's policy towards Northern Ireland differ from that of his predecessor.  Deputy Jack Lynch, which this party could support?  If there was clarification from the Taoiseach and he confirmed what the Minister said last night, this party might then be in a position to support the Taoiseach's policy.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will not raise a point of order while the Chair is speaking.  The point I am making is that if Deputies wish to ask questions they can ask them in the usual way.  I want to make it clear that I am not obstructing Deputies in legitimately following any matters they want to raise in the House.  I am trying to ensure that we will not have a chaotic situation on the Order of Business.  If any Deputy were <Col N="1841" /> allowed to rise here and simply say: &ldquo;This is a very important matter I want to raise on the Order of Business&rdquo; we would have chaos.  I am sorry, but I cannot allow it. It is not in order.</P>

      <P>Is the Chair suggesting that a possibility of my party being able to support the Taoiseach if he is, as would appear, pursuing the same policy as his predecessor, is not a matter of national urgency?</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Deputy, I deprecate the frequent efforts being made by various proposals of Deputies to raise matters on the Order of Business which they must know very well are not in order.  If Deputies wish to raise matters they have a variety of ways in which they can do it.  They can raise matters by parliamentary question, they can have motions discussed for three hours in Private Members' Time, they can discuss changes in the law, if they wish, by introducing Bills and they can have them discussed for six hours.  I am not obstructing any Deputy from pursuing matters at the proper time but in so far as the Order of Business is concerned I have laid down what I believe is in order.  I propose to <Col N="1842" /> adhere to that until such time as the House decides to change it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Section 2 of the Courts Bill is the section which increases the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from £2,000 to £15,000.  I am afraid that it will be difficult if not impossible for litigants with no money or limited means to arrange for the attendance of expert witnesses from the city of Dublin in various circuit courts throughout the country.  It would be particularly difficult or impossible to arrange for the attendance of busy medical consultants whose first duty is to be available in their hospitals.  The Minister said that he did not see any such difficulty.  From experience I know that it is very difficult to arrange to have witnesses in country circuit courts because it means a considerable absence from their base.  As Depcan <Col N="1845" /> console themselves with the realisation that I cannot be in two places at the one time.  I was at a meeting of the Council of Ministers.  If I did not attend those meeting we would not have made the progress we made with regard to the Celtic Sea and the herring ban which we hope will be lifted this year.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Collins for raising this matter now, thus giving me a second chance to explain it to the House.  I was surprised that the Opposition did not accept my invitation to raise the matter seeing they considered it so urgent last Thursday.  I find that interest in the fishermen's problems which appears so urgent in the afternoon wanes once nighttime comes.  Nevertheless, I am glad to deal with the matter today.</P>
      <P>I notice the Deputy made copious use of a document presented by the salmon and inshore fishermen in order to make his case.  He said also that 1,000 tonnes would not be enough, but the fishermen indicated that as a last resort 1,000 tonnes would be sufficient for the needs of the 500 people whom the Deputy mentioned. Deputy Deasy spoke of a disastrous year, but we must remember that the volume and the value of landings in the past year was the greatest we have ever had.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to loan repayments, every case will be considered individually and loans will be recast three times if necessary.  The EEC regulation to close the Celtic Sea for herring fishing was taken on 1 March 1977.  That was during the ministry of that intrepid soldier, sailor, yachtsman and would-be commodore, Deputy Donegan.  I am sure he is well known in the Dunmore East and Waterford areas, not alone for the closure of the Celtic Sea but also for other exploits on the seas off the Waterford coast.  His period as Minister was shortlived and after the general election in 1977 it was left to the incoming Minister, Deputy Lenihan, to apply the regulations and impose penalties in Irish law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not criticising the former Minister <Col N="1846" /> for that decision.  It would have been very irresponsible of him if he did not close the Celtic Sea, but it would be equally irresponsible to open the Celtic Sea before a reasonable improvement in stocks has taken place.  The reason given for the closure is the reason given by ICES, namely, the depletion of our stocks.  In 1977 the stock of herring in the Celtic Sea had fallen to 6,000 tonnes. Today it is not much better at 13,000 tonnes, the estimated figure at 1 April 1980.  Scientists reckon that the biomass needed for regeneration and complete recruitment would be in the nature of 40,000 tonnes of herring to allow for normal fishing and to allow each herring to spawn at least once.  In 1977 our fishing efforts there were very dependent on three-year old herring.  Every year the fisheries have been monitored.  Our biologists have examined the stock each year and have taken larval tests and young herring tests.  I am friendly with the biologist concerned and have kept in close contact with him on this matter.  Early last year the state of play appeared to be good.  The recovery rate was quite good despite illegal fishing.  I can give details of this matter privately to the Deputies opposite if they are interested.</P>
    <P>There was also the matter of bi-catch damage.  Last year a bi-catch was allowed of 5 per cent for mackerel and 10 per cent for sprat fishing.  One of the first things I got done at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in December 1980 was a ban on bi-catch and foreign vessels were singled out, as they were by Deputy Deasy tonight.  The allegations made, of which the Deputy claims to have proof, have never been substantiated.  Despite numerous boardings by the Navy they have never found evidence to suggest that there were herrings on board that were caught illegally.</P>
    <P>In February 1980 I indicated that my chief aim was to have the Celtic Sea opened and I was optimistic it would be done.  I raised it at every meeting of the Council of Ministers I attended and in January I raised the matter of compensation during the term of the Italian Presidency. The proposal for compensation <Col N="1847" /> arose when I was dealing with the question of having juries provided in Circuit Court cases.  I pointed out that we are now changing the jurisdiction from £2,000 to £15,000.  This is a very big extension of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>It is my view that, when we are dealing with cases of that magnitude, it is necessary to have them heard before a judge and jury.  Juries are composed of ordinary citizens.  They have a grasp of what is happening and they understand ordinary day-to-day living better than some of our judges who are better off than many members of juries.  Where desired and requested by plaintiffs, and by defendants if necessary.  Circuit Court cases should be tried before juries.  Dealing with this section the Minister stated that at present there is a very strong lobby in favour of the total abolition of juries in civil cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to say arises from what the Minister said.  This is Committee Stage and the matter should be teased out and discussed at length if necessary. The Minister spoke about the strong lobby in favour of the abolition of juries.  I want to put on record who is leading this strong lobby.  It is being led by the insurance companies in Ireland. They are a multi-million pound lobby with plenty of muscle.  While it might be in their interest to have juries abolished, it is certainly not in the best interests of the ordinary private citizen.  The jury system is the safeguard of the ordinary citizen. The total abolition of the jury system in civil cases, in torts and running down actions, would be detrimental to the administration of justice.  We will be putting down amendments on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>We are moving from a jurisdiction of £2,000 to a jurisdiction of £15,000.  The only people who will benefit from this are the insurance companies, and not the ordinary citizens.  It is our duty to protect people who are not in a position to help themselves.  The insurance companies are well equipped to look after themselves. The only way to protect the rights of the ordinary citizen is by retaining the jury system.  On the other side of the coin we have this strong lobby with plenty of muscle. The Minister should take his courage in his hands and come out clearly and decisively in favour of the retention of juries in Circuit Court cases and in all cases.</P>
      <P>On this side of the House we are very much in favour of the continuation of the jury system.  This party will fight to maintain it.  I hope the Government party will ensure that it is retained in these cases. It is absolutely essential because, the day we do away with juries in civil cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have already said it is not relevant to section 2 because no change is proposed <Col N="1849" /> in section 2 in relation to juries in the Circuit Court.

      <P>The Minister made a statement.  We should have a clear statement from the Government on this matter.  I have stated quite clearly that we on this side of the House are in favour of the retention of the jury system.  I hope we will have a similar commitment in a firm statement from the Minister giving the views of the Government party on this matter.  Too many people at present have come out more or less in favour of this lobby.  It should be nipped in the bud at this juncture.  It is in the interests of the ordinary citizen of limited means who may be taking on financial institutions such as insurance companies that the jury system be retained.  That is why I would be very much in favour of it and feel it should be restored in the Circuit Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Again the Deputy raised the question of consultants.  Without wishing to repeat myself.  I stated yesterday that I was satisfied from a number of sources and investigations that many consultants <Col N="1850" /> involved in Circuit Court hearings are from local hospitals in rural areas where accidents may occur in those areas. The Deputy said in the House yesterday evening that in Dublin an easily availed of facility existed under which consultants were, so to speak, on the ground or could be contacted at half an hour's notice.  In the type of specialised consultancy requirements also referred to yesterday evening, where for instance one would be seeking consultants' advice in a case where brain damage had occurred, I do not think that type of case would be found in the Circuit Court anyway, because with the extension of the limit of jurisdiction to £15,000, as proposed in this Bill, it would be most unlikely that such a case would be heard in the Circuit Court in view of the fact that the claim would most certainly be in excess of that amount and, consequently, the hearing would be elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Concern has been expressed by several Deputies about the trial of civil actions by jury.  The present position is that the High Court only has power to try such actions by jury.  The right to jury trial in Circuit Court civil actions was abolished by the Courts Act, 1971, principally because it was a right that was seldom exercised.  It is worth noting that the same Act also increased the tort jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to its current limit of £2,000.  The new level of £15,000 proposed in this Bill has been arrived at partly on the basis of the considerations set out in the committee's report and partly to take account of the increased maximum amount which can be awarded in fatal accidents to a deceased's relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no proposals to alter the position as regards civil juries either in the High Court or the Circuit Court.  As the Courts Committee brought out and as some Deputies mentioned the present situation is that legal proceedings arising out of many motor accidents may be taken in the High Court only because of the Circuit Court's present low monetary limit.  These range from cases where there is serious disablement or death, where a person with dependants is involved, to <Col N="1851" /> cases where the damage involved may be only the writing off of a car.  I am sure Deputies will agree with me that the more serious the accident and its repercussions on the victim and his dependants, the more important it is that it be heard in the High Court where the option of a jury trial is available.  On the other hand, in less serious cases, where the injuries are not of a lasting nature, where medical and other expenses arising out of the accident are very clearly defined, where the victims' earning capacity is temporarily impaired only, the amount of compensation being claimed is not likely to exceed the Circuit Court's new limit of jurisdiction.  Quite often the only point at issue in such cases is whether one or the other party to the action is liable.  Such cases can be as well decided by a judge sitting alone as by a jury but at considerably less expense both to the litigants and taxpayers.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that concentration of tort cases in the District Court and the Circuit Court might create difficulty in the provision of the necessary medical evidence because some medical consultants might be reluctant to travel to various venues around the country rather than to the High Court in Dublin.  The committee have said, and I am in agreement with them, that they are not satisfied that there is real substance in these objections because experience has shown that in many cases in the High Court consultants come from outside the Dublin area.  In the case of road accidents patients are more frequently than not treated in local hospitals by local consultants except in cases which develop very serious complications where it may be necessary &mdash; as, for example in the case of severe brain injury, to which I have already referred &mdash; to send cases to specialist units in Dublin.</P>
    <P>After all, we are talking about a limit of £15,000 in the Circuit Court and in some cases the amount at issue is likely to be in excess of that figure.  I am satisfied, however, that what is proposed in the Bill is appropriate to the nature of the cases concerned.  In particular I would not see any merit in providing for the <Col N="1852" /> restoration of jury trials for some cases in the Circuit Court.  I am aware also that there is a strong body of demand for the total removal of the right to jury trial for neligence cases in the High Court &mdash; I am in agreement with Deputy Enright when he referred to that strong lobby here yesterday evening &mdash; or otherwise, that the jury should have no say in the determination of the amount of damages.  This is a far bigger issue than was raised by the Deputies who spoke on the Bill and I do not propose to go into the merits of the issue on this occasion.  Clearly it is outside the scope of the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested here this morning that the Government proposed the abolition of the jury system or intended to seek its abolition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not say that.  I am saying that I would be nervous and I wanted a statement from the Government to ensure that they were committed to the retention of the jury system.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Bill we are not dealing with the removal or abolition of the jury system.  That has been dealt with already in the Courts Act, 1971.  We are dealing with the Circuit Court, which does not have a jury system since then and, as Deputy Fitzpatrick stated here yesterday evening, had not a jury system to any large extent prior to 1971.  Deputy Fitzpatrick rightly made that point yesterday evening.  Also it must be noted that prior to then the demands made for juries in the Circuit Court were very few. At some stage I will be in a position to give the House figures in that connection, that is, of the number of juries that sat in the Circuit Court.  I want to put it clearly on record that this Bill does not propose to abolish the jury system.  Certainly, from the Government's point of view no suggestion or interpretation could be taken from anything I say here that the question of abolition of the jury system is a matter for consideration at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to a comment made by Deputy Fitzpatrick in relation to <Col N="1853" /> the list system.  This is not a function of the Minister for Justice.  I agree with Deputy Enright that difficulties arise in that connection.  I further agree that the new administrative arrangements being considered at present might go some way toward álleviating the situation.  At the same time it is primarily the responsibility of the county registrar, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, in many instances in consultation with the judge, who might wish to be accommodated or to be accommodating. As was suggested here by Deputy Enright, the Local Bar Associations and county registrars should take note of the point made and take it up seriously.  I am satisfied that there is enormous room for improvement in this area but, other than to make a comment of agreement, I cannot enter into an area in which the Minister for Justice has no function.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point as yet not referred to, might I ask the Minister to comment briefly on what appears to be another area of dissatisfaction or, at the very least, an anomaly?  This relates to the proposed increase in jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in this section in relation to property, under which it is proposed to increase the present poor law valuation limit of £100 to £200.  My understanding of it is that, as a result, by far the greater number of properties in the country would come within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, that virtually all property would fall within the ambit of that court.  However, the Bill says that the jurisdiction which the court would have in the area of award of damage in contract in tort would be limited to £15,000, but the area with which it can deal in relation to property appears to be virtually unlimited.  For example, take a farm of the value of perhaps £750,000, perhaps even £1 million, depending on where it is situated and the price per acre. Is that an anomaly?  Is that a contradiction? I cannot see the logic for it.  I should like to know if the Minister can and, if so, I should be grateful if he would let me know what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>All we have done in this regard is to increase the valuation limit <Col N="1854" /> from the old figure of £100 to a figure of £200.  The tort limit has been increased from £2,000 to £15,000.  I note the point the Deputy made in relation to the anomaly <i>vis-à-vis</i> the value of land in, say, an estate worth so much.  I am sure that when the limit stood at £100, as it still does, there was a situation obtaining in which there was an apparent anomaly. The reality is that we have updated the jurisdictional limits in both cases.  This also has been the subject of very definitive discussion by the Courts Committee and we have no reason to refuse what is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In this context I am going to leave out the question of discussion and so on.  It is the Minister's job to take decisions and I do not think we should fall back on therapeutic supports from discussions and rules that none of us knows anything about.  If, as the Minister has implied, an anomaly existed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our job to get rid of such anomalies and make improvements. Does it seem logical that on the one hand a court's hands are tied in certain areas with which it must deal to the sum of £15,000 while in the area of property courts can deal with almost unlimited sums?  I have just mentioned that, although I do not expect the Minister will do anything about it.  A farm of 300 or 400 acres would certainly qualify.  It seems to be illogical and contradictory. I am not concerned what it was in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister has washed his hands of the question of free legal aid. He has said it is not relevant and for that reason he does not propose to deal with <Col N="1855" /> it.  The fact of the matter is that we are changing the venue of a great number of court actions from Dublin to rural Ireland. I concede that in a number of cases it will be more convenient to people living in rural areas where the witnesses are all local but it will be inconvenient, very expensive and to the great disadvantage of a percentage of litigants where the expert witnesses are based in Dublin. That cannot be denied.  That argument is increased as are the difficulties I have spoken of because there is no free legal aid.  The Minister cannot run away from legal aid and deal with one part of this problem without dealing with the other.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed indirectly to take away the right to trial by jury by forcing litigants to litigate in a court where trial by jury does not prevail and by changing the tribunal which will hear the case from a court where there is a jury to one where a jury will not be called.  From my experience I can say that it is not to the advantage of the litigant where the system of free legal aid does not operate.  The change of venue in some cases away from Dublin, where consultants are available, and the change from a jury to a non-jury court in my opinion plays into the hands of big business and wealthy litigants.  It is to the disadvantage of the poorer litigants or the person without money.  It would not be too bad if the State introduced a system of free legal aid such as that which operates in the jurisdiction across the water.  Then if a person had a <i>prima facie</i> case he could bring it to the court and have his expenses and costs guaranteed before he started.  That person would not be at the mercy of the multi-million pound insurance companies referred to by Deputy Enright.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it comes to litigation we are talking about men of straw and people without much money.  Very few people can afford to finance out of their own funds a High Court or Circuit Court action that will go on for a number of days.  Were it not for the fact that the legal profession here operate as far as running down actions are concerned by and large on speculation &mdash; I am not using that in any <Col N="1856" /> offensive way but they operate on the basis that if they win the action they get paid and if they lose they throw the papers in the waste paper basket &mdash; very few actions would be taken.  A learned senior counsel who has since died told me many years ago that no matter what he was sued for in the High Court he would settle because he could not afford to have an action going on for several days.</P>
    <P>A big proportion of the litigation here is known as running down actions and the more cars we have on the road the greater the likelihood of more such actions.  Litigation here takes place between a poor litigant, one of limited means or one who cannot afford litigation, and on the other hand multi-million pound insurance corporations. Under the terms of the Bill we are making it more convenient for the multi-million pound insurance corporations and more expensive and difficult for a percentage of our people.</P>
    <P>I accept that in some of the cases the venue will be transferred to within 150 yards of the local surgical hospital where the surgeon can be got.  In such cases the surgeon can attend at the court within less than five minutes.  However, on the other hand the venue of trial is being transferred from the Four Courts, where consultants can attend within less than 30 minutes, to places that will be 150 miles from the city.  In such cases consultants will have to leave Dublin the night before and may have to hang around the court all day without the case being heard.  In my opinion that is to the advantage of big money and to the disadvantage of the ordinary litigant.  It will be to the disadvantage of the provision of justice for all.</P>
    <P>The State is prepared to do that to facilitate a loud lobby but is not prepared to talk about free legal aid to help poor litigants.  We do have a form of minimouse free legal aid system which operates in the area of family law at five venues some of which are 100 miles apart. The views I expressed are sincere and I speak as one who has had a long and varied career in the courts.  I spent most of my professional life as a solicitor engaged in court work and I do not have any vested interest at present.  If a change is not made the fears I have expressed <Col N="1857" /> will come to pass.  The only way of being sure about it is to leave the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court lower than it is now. When the Minister is asked for an example he adverts to the increase in the compensation for mental distress.  It is high time that the £1,000 figure was increased because that figure was fixed many years ago.  The Minister is aware that fatal accidents form only a fraction of the running-down actions.  Though some of my professional colleagues may not agree with me.  I believe it would be better to reduce the jurisdiction to a figure lower than that proposed.  We should not in any way play into the hands of multi-million groups who will use every trick, albeit legitimate tricks, in the book.  For example, they will refuse to settle cases, thereby allowing cases to continue knowing all the difficulties there are for the people concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has made a valid point because there are bound to arise situations in which insurance companies who, by reason of their expertise in this whole business and their constant communication with many of the top surgeons in this city, will be in a position to make arrangements beforehand with certain surgeons, many of whom have been engaged professionally by the companies down through the years so that quite a relationship has been built up between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surgeons acting for insurance companies are guaranteed their fees whereas litigants of limited means would not be in a position to guarantee a fee to any surgeon. The cost of bringing a surgeon from Dublin to the west or to the midlands for a day is in the region of £250 to £300. That is a considerable amount for a litigant of limited means.  The Minister understands the position fully.  He has told us that he is aware of the problems of the list system.  Any serious effort to tackle this system should involve the arranging of a conference between the parties concerned &mdash; the Department of Justice, the county registrars, the judges. the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society.  The aim should be to take <Col N="1858" /> the chance element out of the situation. Provisional lists should be arranged about six weeks in advance with a view to county registrars having a two-week period in which to say whether they expected a case to go on.  There could then be a further review two weeks beforehand.  We must aim at streamlining the courts system, but the situation outlined by Deputy Fitzpatrick will continue and there will be insurance companies who will be in a position to have the best of both worlds while the litigant, the ordinary person, who wishes to have his case heard in court will be at a disadvantage. That is not good enough.  Therefore, if specific days could be arranged for the hearing of cases, the ordinary person would benefit.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to this area as being quasi-judicial, an area in which he is limited in regard to what he can do.  I accept the goodwill of the Department in this matter.  I accept also that the Minister has no wish to interfere in the running of the courts but there is a great need for the setting up of a conference with a view to streamlining the mechanisms of the system because there is a serious state of disorder in regard to cases at present, especially so far as the Circuit Court is concerned.  With the extension of the jurisdiction, the situation in the District Court will be even worse.  It is a ludicrous situation to have perhaps 300 cases listed for the one day but that is what is happening. The Minister must take steps at the earliest opportunity possible to put the administration of the courts on a business-like basis.  Only the Minister has the power to do this.  All that is needed is a little coaxing and a proper approach by the Department.  The buck stops with the Minister.  Therefore, he must take steps to remedy the situation of serious disorder that exists at present in the courts.  The situation can be compared with a lottery in that nobody knows whether a case will go ahead on any day. It is unsatisfactory to have all the people listed waiting on the same day to have their cases heard.  One can visualise the sort of situation that would arise on any one day on which all of those involved with each of 300 cases showed up at court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1859" /> There would be the solicitors, the barristers, doctors, engineers and so on for each side.</P>

      <P>We are very much in favour of the general approach.  We are on Committee Stage and that is why we <Col N="1861" /> are examining it and, if we are picking holes in it, it is part and parcel of our responsibility to do so.  There is one thing I would like to bring to the Minister's attention at this stage.  Now it is going to be made much easier for hire purchase companies to bring actions in the Circuit Court and get judgments for quite large sums of money, say, £10,000 relating to a tractor or machine or some type of motor car.  Previously actions for amounts of over £2,000 had to be heard in the High Court but now it is possible to bring actions for up to £15,000 in the Circuit Court.  The proofs in the Circuit Court and the High Court are very similar and there is a tremendous amount of care taken by our High Court judges to make sure that the proofs are in order and that the case is fully and adequately heard. My worry is that there will be a vast increase in the number of hire purchase companies and credit companies bringing actions and getting decrees against private individuals.  While ease of access to the courts is very desirable, it might place people, who might eventually be in a position to pay off the debt or restrain the hire purchase company from obtaining a decree immediately because of the time span involved in High Court cases. in the position of having decrees granted against them in a matter of two or three months.  In this time of recession I would hope that while it would not be made any harder for companies to have access to the courts, I would hope that it would not be made easier.  I would like the Minister's views on that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The form of words used in sections 3 and 13 as they stand at present is such that the Circuit Court has full jurisdiction to hear the matters referred to under the Married Women's Status Act, 1957 and the Family Home Protection Act, 1976.  The defendant or respondent in proceedings in the Circuit Court under either of those Acts may, if the valuation of the land exceeds £200, exercise an option to have the proceedings transferred to the High Court at any point in the proceedings.  It is conceiveable that a defendant or a respondent could, as a delaying or obstructionist tactic, hold off making such an application until after the commencement of the hearing.  I assume that the Deputy's intention in putting down these amendments was to prevent this.  These amendments have been discussed with the parliamentary draftsmen who gave the alternative amendments Nos. a1 and 5a which are in keeping with the spirit of the Deputy's amendments.</P>
      <P>In the case of amendment No. 2, however, the form of words used in the section is quite different.  Section 4 of the Bill has been drafted on the lines of section 6 of the Succession Act, 1965 which it amends.  This in turn uses a formula which is used in section 22 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961. The effect of this formula is to exclude from the Circuit Court cases concerning estates where the valuation of land exceeds £200 unless the necessary parties to the proceedings sign the consent prescribed by the rules of court.  This consent may be signed either before or during the hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the signing of this consent is to allow proceedings which have been initiated in the Circuit Court to continue in that court even if it transpires either at <Col N="1863" /> the preliminary stages or at the hearing itself that the valuation of the land involved is over the limit set in the section. I will grant that this possibility is remote but it is nonetheless worth catering for.  If Deputy Keating's amendment in this case were to be accepted, then the opportunities for retaining such a case in the Circuit Court would be limited.  If it emerged during the hearing that there was over £200 valuation of land involved the Circuit Court judge would have no option but to transfer it to the High Court.  The amendment in effect would abolish the consent jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in such cases.  There could consequently be delay, inconvenience and expense to all parties as well as needless use of court time.  If this amendment were to be accepted it would follow logically that section 22 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961 would also have to be amended similarly in order to maintain consistency.  This section of the 1961 Act relates to a wide range of jurisdictions which are limited by factors other than land valuation and the circumstances under which the Circuit Court may exercise them.  Thus, acceptance of the amendment would involve a far-reaching change in the practice and procedure in the Circuit Court well beyond the scope of the amendment as it is framed.</P>

      <P>On section 3, the amendment put down has been accepted, I believe, by the Minister and I am quite happy with his form of words which is at least as good as ours.  The main point is that it would help to resolve certain situations that could occur which were not obviously spelled out or intended by the section.  It has been represented to us as a general comment in relation to section 3 that one might consider whether or not it is necessary at all.  I wonder if there is an argument.  The Incorporated Law Society, for example, make the point that it may in fact be more of a hindrance than a help to getting fairly speedy and just resolutions or decisions.  Is it the case that it could be used in this way and is there <Col N="1864" /> a justification for suggesting that it need not be in the Bill at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>This section amends the Married Womens Status Act, 1957, to bring the limits beyond which proceedings under the Act may be transferred from the Circuit Court to the High Court into line with the new limits in equity specified in section 2 (1) of the Bill.  Under section 12 of the Act, either the High Court or the Circuit Court may determine any question arising between husband and wife as to title to or possession of any property irrespective of the value of that property.  If proceedings are initiated in the Circuit Court and the value of the property is over £2,000 or the rateable valuation of the land is over £60, then the defendant or respondent can apply to have the proceedings transferred to the High Court.  The section now proposed removes the limit on personal property and increases the limit on the rateable valuation of land to £200.  This is in line with the limits for equity cases recommended by the courts committee in their 20th report although not the subject of specific recommendation.</P>
      <P>In relation to the rising of the land valuation level to £200, I might refer to a point made earlier by Deputy Keating. He mentioned an anomaly on a previous section.  Where equity is concerned it is a question not of determining the amount involved or the amount of poperty involved but one's right to shares or who owns what of that amount and is different from the other actions in tort where the question of fault must be determined. For that reason I made the point that there is no anomaly.  I am just recapitulating so as to inform the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This is for me one of the first fundamental areas of disagreement with the Government in regard to this Bill.  This section deals with divorce and gives jurisdiction in divorce actions to the Circuit Court, that is, of course, divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> as we have it in this country.  As far as I am concerned the question of divorce generally could be classified as coming under the heading of family law and would therefore include for the purposes of this discussion not only the matter of divorce but also matters of custody of children, maintenance of children, maintenance of spouses and various relevant issues in the general area of family law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We argued very strongly on Second Stage &mdash; I restate it briefly now &mdash; that the adversary system of the courts is anathema to, the antithesis of, what is needed where a marriage is in difficulty &mdash; and there are enough of those.  I can think of no less helpful arrangement for trying to bring about an improvement in a marital relationship than the traditional adversary system of the courts when it deals with what is one of the most intimate, profound and significant human relationships.  The approach which is appropriate in dealing with, relatively speaking, inanimate matters of property or other areas of justice, that is the system <Col N="1866" /> with prosecution and defence putting each other as it were in the dock, with witnesses being cross-examined and interrogated for the purposes of eliciting support for particular viewpoints is a reasonable one in many respects in the majority of cases.  It is not what should happen in dealing with questions relating to marriage.</P>
    <P>In my view experience alone has already shown that the courts are totally unsuitable for resolving a significant number of disputes arising under family law, that is the courts as we know them. This adversary system has, by and large, served us well in regard to other matters but it is not suitable for family law matters. Implicit in that system is one side propounding its own best points in the dispute and attacking the weaknesses of the other side.  Translating this into a dispute between a husband and wife makes clear the criticism of using the adversary system or the courts system in this country for resolving family disputes.</P>
    <P>For example, one has the situation where a husband through his lawyer attacks his wife in the dispute, referring to weaknesses which the husband alleges the wife has been guilty of.  If the husband instructs his lawyer to the effect that the wife has committed adultery, then attack by way of cross-examination is made on the wife at the hearing.  Whether or not it be true it hardly conduces towards ever effecting any reconciliation or, if reconciliation be impossible, it hardly conduces to the husband and wife meeting the consequences of the break-up in a realistic and reasonable manner. Although the break-up may be inevitable, frequently it is not possible to say that the relationship has come to an end. There may be children and the question of custody, maintenance and so on is a continuing factor.  Just because the marriage breaks down it does not mean an end to the dispute nor indeed to the relationship in many cases.</P>
    <P>If one accepts as a general proposition that the reconciliation of the parties in a marital dispute is something to be aimed at if at all possible and responded to sensibly and courageously if it is not, one <Col N="1867" /> can readily see that the adversary system not alone does not help to bring this about but is a factor which may make it irreconcilable.  A situation where reconciliation may have been possible has now become permeated with unforgettable, traumatic, deeply psychologically wounding allegations and counter-allegations. Even if that is not so, it conduces towards ensuring that the parties will fail to deal with the ensuing matters of maintenance of the spouse or custody and access to or maintenance of the children in a reasonable fashion.</P>
    <P>It is therefore proposed that these disputes should be taken out of the traditional court structure and should be the property of family courts specially equipped to deal with the difficulties people have today in marital arrangements and to deal with these problems sensibly, with a full range of what we might call social care network available to guide them, not as a major confrontation about issues of inanimate property but as a most fundamentally important discussion about how to rebuild a relationship which is in trouble, if that be the will of the parties involved.</P>
    <P>In so far as it seeks to extend this jurisdiction in relation to divorce <i>a mensa et thoro,</i> this section is a very bad step in the wrong direction and this party oppose the section outright.  The general subject covers a very big area and will give rise to considerable difficulties.  In my view the whole question of dealing with family law disputes and family law generally should be a matter for a different Bill and a different approach, but I will not go into it in detail now.</P>
    <P>The reality is that no such Bill has been introduced and I trust the Minister will not give that rather limp and late response in relation to the abolition of criminal conversation, which was abolished in the country he mentioned nearly 100 years ago.  Will a Family Law Bill deal with these matters?  That is not a Family Law Bill; it is a misnomer.  But at the same time we should be thankful for small mercies.  I want to discourage the Minister from making it appear that family law was a subject already being discussed <Col N="1868" /> in a fundamental way in the Bill he introduced which deals broadly with criminal conversation and one or two related matters.  That is relevant but very peripherally.</P>
    <P>It seems pointless, as submitted here, to change the jurisdiction with regard to family law matters because of the court facilities.  I will not labour the point, but can the Minister envisage a situation where the relationship of a couple, tragically for them and their offspring, has gone wrong?  It is only that kind of relationship which comes into the courts because relationships which are terminated with the agreement of both parties do not come before the courts.  We are talking about people who are already in conflict.  Our job should be to act as a healing agency for such people.  We should give counsel, wisdom and justice, not third rate court conditions and rapid dispensation of law, which in many cases is very far from justice.</P>
    <P>I would not be satisfied that the matters under discussion in this section would be adequately or properly dealt with in the context of the present manner of operation of the Circuit Court.  It would be unreasonable to expect hard working Circuit Court judges, limited as they are in terms of numbers and resources, to deal with these matters.  It would be unjust &mdash; and I am primarily concerned about this &mdash; to the growing thousands of families who are in such difficulties to fob them off in this way.  That is not to suggest I am happy about the way they are being dealt with at the moment, but the response in this Bill is not the appropriate one.</P>
    <P>We will be talking in the context of such cases about dissolution, issues relating to children's futures, issues which for the average person will probably be the greatest step he or she can take in a lifetime, and a particular response is appropriate.  If there is anything this country can do, surely it is to learn from the experiences of other countries, I do not suggest that many of those experiences are necessarily appropriate here. However, one thing is becoming clear and that is that there is an unprecedented degree of marital difficulties at present <Col N="1869" /> and our response does not meet the real problems involved.</P>
    <P>Will these courts have the facilities necessary to deal with such cases?  Could anyone envisage a proper assessment of such a hearing where the various issues relating to all members of the family will be dealt with, where there will be adequate support agencies involved, not just as witnesses attesting to the fact of the alleged moral culpability of one party or the other, but in giving their assessment in a constructive round-table way as to how best to regenerate that relationship? Our approach should be permeated by compassion, by understanding, by giving time, by caring deeply, by not being rushed by a list of other cases and by investing a great commitment of personal and human resources in what is one of the greatest challenges of western society &mdash; the breakdown of marriage.  Does the Minister seriously suggest that this proposal would do anything other than damage the prospects of such regeneration of those relationships?</P>
    <P>How could we honestly expect parties to belabour each other across a court room, hawking out each other's excesses, warts and flaws &mdash; and which of us does not have them &mdash; and expect, once the judge has deemed the case to be closed, that these parties will somehow magically resume a relationship and go off happy, their children rejoicing in the new relationship which has been created by this environment?  It could not happen like that, but let us at least endeavour to see that this procedure is given a chance.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this section be withdrawn from the Bill on the basis that there is an urgent need for a proper family court system.  I would not call it a family court but some kind of family tribunal arrangement which would not be based on mutual hostility and adversity, on who gets the best lawyer to eke out the dirt about the other party, on who can avail of private detective agencies and electronic aids with a view to incriminating the other party.  That is not what justice should be about, especially when it comes to family protection and family law. Would the Minister agree between now and Report Stage to reconsider this section? <Col N="1870" /> I honestly believe it is misguided, not because anybody is being malevolent about it but because we have not yet come to grips with the real problems of marital difficulties in a number of respects.</P>
    <P>This morning we are talking about how to respond to that problem in a way which would bring the parties together and get justice for each party.  I am not suggesting that if a husband or a wife &mdash; and more usually the wife, unfortunately &mdash; wishes to assert his or her rights in certain respects that he or she should not get them, but that that should be done with the least likely damage to whatever embers of a relationship remain and with a view to rebuilding that relationship if it be to the benefit of the children or the family as a whole.  For the most part that would be the case.</P>
    <P>I made some comments on Second Stage, which I intend to repeat when appropriate, regarding my concern as to how the courts function and some of the injustices which have occurred.  I feel great trepidation about asking the existing structure, which is geared to dealing with issues of property, to deal with something which is of fundamental importance to the happiness of human beings and the welfare of the country.  I believe that our response should be much more comprehensive, caring and just.  My colleagues have spoken about the provision of legal aid and the undoubted discrimination which exists at present.  The basic ground rule is that a person who has money has a better chance of getting the law to operate for him than a poor person.  All these points apply here also, except that the implications are more grave.  How can the Minister justify asking a woman to equip herself adequately to deal with the situation confronting her under this section?  Many women are impoverished and do not even know what their husbands earn.  I know this section is wrong, and the Minister also knows it; yet we carry on this hypocrisy.  All around us we see families in difficulty and our response is to tell them to go to a solicitor and to the courts.  That is not the answer and anyone in this House who says otherwise <Col N="1871" /> is a hypocrite.</P>
    <P>I have said before that there is room in this area for all parties in this House to work together.  The happiness of families and the relief of the stress endured by some families are matters on which no political party should seek to gain political advantage.  We would be very pleased to discuss with the Minister and his representatives, as well as with representatives of other parties and interests in this House, ways of getting us out of this morass and of helping people.  I do not pretend that there is a great lobby for this or that there would be a great voting response, but it would be the right thing to do.  It would be a good thing if we were to co-operate in this way at certain times rather than put our finger in the air at all times to see which way the wind is blowing.</P>
    <P>There is no more fundamental issue in the area of social justice or family law reform than the problem of marriage difficulty. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the exclusion of this section.  I urge him to embark on a new approach to family law which would primarily involve caring for families and would not treat people as if they were items of property or chattels.  Our approach to human issues must be different to that applied to issues relating to land or compensation. I again appeal to the Minister to reconsider the wisdom of excluding the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has dealt in depth with the area of family law.  I should like to state that I am concerned about the discomforts, hardships, stresses and abuses experienced by men, women and children because of occurrences and certain disadvantages that prevail in this area.  The section with which we are dealing is not intended to introduce changes in that very complex and difficult area.  It proposes to provide easier access to court for people who could not heretofore obtain a legal remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section confers on the Circuit Court jurisdiction to hear and determine proceedings for divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> which is commonly known as judicial separation. <Col N="1872" /> Its principal effect is to relieve the spouses of the duty of co-habiting, but it is not irrevocable and the marriage still subsists.  Jurisdiction to grant decrees of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> was originally exercisable by the ecclesiastical courts. This jurisdiction, along with other jurisdictions in matrimonial matters, was transferred by section 7 of the Matrimonial Causes and Marriage Law (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1870, to the Court for Matrimonial Causes and Matters established by that section.  The Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland), 1877, transferred the jurisdiction to the Probate and Matrimonial Division of the High Court of Justice set up under that Act.  The jurisdiction was further transferred to the High Court established under the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, by that Act, and to the present High Court by the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961.  The form of proceeding for divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> in the High Court is complicated and costly, and has been the subject of criticism from many quarters, including the Courts Committee and Deputy Keating.  The committee have been very critical of the facts to which I have referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>They are right.  It does not mean we should replace one wrong by another wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with two different things and that is where I differ with the Deputy.  The committee recommended that jurisdiction in divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> be vested in the Circuit Court and the section now proposes to do that.  In fairness Deputy Keating should not seek to exclude this while presenting the case for an area of substantive administrative and legal changes which it is not intended to provide for under this Bill.  This is a matter in which we are actively engaged in another connection, through the Law Reform Commission. In this section we are attempting to allow the bringing of an action in a particular court to which there is less costly access, avoiding the complicated legal requirements which cannot be met <Col N="1873" /> by most people in going to the High Court.</P>
      <P>In this situation it is intended that one can proceed by civil bill in the Circuit Court.  The Circuit Court has jurisdiction in the area of a number of family law matters.  It is a further extension of the logic of the Government that we should find in that court the greatest possible family law package of remedies.  There is a very important and significant area of family law requirement, commonly known as judicial separation.  By providing a facility in the Circuit Court for this action we are putting into the court an action that can have many other aspects and complications in relation to barring orders, maintenance and so on.  These can all be related matters to the action itself and they would have to be discussed in the context of the action at its hearing. It is of vital importance that we ensure the maximum cohesion so far as the court is concerned in relation to the hearing of the family law package and ensure that it is all together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to a certain lack so far as the courts were concerned.  I have always believed a court to include more than the furniture.  The Deputy did not specifically mention the judges but I take it that they were included in his comment.  I am satisfied there is an adequate capacity among judges of the Circuit Court to hear these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In that context I was not talking about the calibre of judges.  If I wish to comment on that matter&mdash; and I will&mdash;I will make my comment without any ambiguity.  I was referring to the physical facilities in courthouses, where families can sit and have consultations. The Incorporated Law Society, a body not known for being provocative in these matters, have said that the facilities are very poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an amendment with regard to accommodation.  It was suggested yesterday that, for the purpose of avoiding repetition, we should not deal with the question of accommodation. When the Deputy referred to the court I <Col N="1874" /> took it to mean that he included the judges but that matter has been clarified now.  A point made outside this House is that the Circuit Court has not heard this type of case before and that judges would not have the necessary experience.  I am satisfied that once given the task these eminent and qualified men will be quite capable of dealing with the matter.  I want to put that remark on the record of the House.  I genuinely thought the Deputy was referring to that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>As I do not wish to indulge in repetition, I will not go into the matter in detail.  There is a fundamental difference of opinion here.  I accept the Minister's integrity, as I accept that he considers the view he is putting forward to be the correct one.  Quite honestly I do not think the Minister is correct. His answer is based on underlining the wrongs and injustices that exist at High Court level, namely, the costs, difficulty of access and so on.  I agree with him on these matters but indentification of deficiencies or problems in that area can point in many directions.  The sensible way is not to compound those errors and not to recreate them at Circuit Court level.  Rather we should introduce a system that is geared specifically to recognising the innate nature of problems in this regard.  Other responses are possible. To talk about easier access is like asking a brain surgeon who may wish to use a sledge hammer to carry out a heavy operation to use instead a knife and fork. I accept that my analogy may not be the best but the point I am getting at is that the problems involved are increasing in number, that they have detrimental effects on our society but they have not been dealt with.  They are not being dealt with adequately now.</P>

      <P>I am trying to point out to the Minister that this section is likely to recreate many of the wrongs that are presently operating at High Court level in relation to family law cases.  The Minister has said this is not the way to deal with the matter.  I accept it is not but the Minister should have legislation to deal with it, then we would know that there was an integrated comprehensive approach.  This Bill stands in isolation as the Minister's contribution to family law reform and it must be judged as such. When other legislation is introduced, we will know more.  However, at this point it is a little extreme to expect us to believe there will be major innovations in that area in the apparently brief life remaining to this Dáil.  I can certainly guarantee the Minister some action in the next Dáil.</P>

      <P>I hope some of us might be here as well and I hope the country is the better for whoever is here.  We should consider some sensible way of dealing with family law cases.  I am mentioning the facilities and some qualms that one has about some judges.  That is insignificant unless one is the unfortunate person who is affected.  The fundamental point is that the adversary system is destructive of relationships.  It operates fine where no relationship is relevant but when the marriage is at issue, when relationship is at issue, the adversary system is wrong and the court system is wrong.  So it does not matter which court one is talking about.  If the relationship exists on the basis of mutual adversary, that point must be considered.  A different consultative, <Col N="1876" /> counselling or some other supportive forum, where people are not automatically and by nature of the court process at loggerheads, is needed in family law cases.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to consider this matter.  I know that he could argue technical or some smaller advantage in having expanded jurisdiction and people having greater access.  Access in the first place did not help.  We are only pretending now to each other that we are doing something positive about it and perhaps we will go home this evening thinking we have done something positive about it.  I believe we are simply continuing a wrong and one could argue that, by virtue of the increased access, it will be more extensive. I know that is not what the Minister wants and it is certainly not what this side of the House wants.  We want to do something about healing, which is a very important word in this context.  Courts do not heal, they settle.  That is the point.</P>

      <P>This morning we are transferring the existing powers from the High Court to the Circuit Court.

      <P>This became law under the Matrimonial Causes and Marriage Law (Ireland) (Amendment) Act, 1870. This morning we are transferring that right from the High Court to the Circuit Court.  I find it hard to understand that in 1870 they were not very much in favour of family law.  I believe it is very important that some special arrangements are made in relation to family law and that specific judges and specific persons are assigned to hearing family law matters exclusively.  In regard to matters of this nature, which will come before Circuit Court judges, this section will prove unsatisfactory and I do not believe there will be any positive improvement here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1877" /> Deputy Keating dealt very fully with regard to the confrontation which exists in the courts.  The existing structure of our court system for hearing family law matters is very unsatisfactory.  In all those cases there is a plaintiff and a defendent and only the bad points of a marriage which has lasted for five, ten or 15 years, are brought forward.  There is happiness and unhappiness in every marriage. There is goodness, generosity and charity as well as mean advantages taken in every marriage.  When difficulties arise all the good points are forgotten and only the hurt is brought to the attention of wife, husband and children.  It is a great tragedy to see this happening.  We should try to overcome such a fundamental problem. It is in the early stages of a marriage that problems arise and an effort should be made at this stage to try to bring about some kind of reconciliation.  If the situation progresses, relationships deteriorate. Solomon with all his wisdom would not be able to solve a lot of the marriage problems.  I do not believe that legislation will be the answer, irrespective of what Bill the Minister brings in.  I doubt if anybody in the House has the answer.  I do not know if a Minister for Families or a Minister for Children is the answer. The only thing the Minister can do is to try to provide some place where an effort can be made at reconciliation and where the couple can get together to see if they can re-build some of the bridges which have collapsed.  We will have to provide over the next few years some type of special courts, such as family courts or family tribunals, at District Court and High Court level, whereby these matters can be dealt with by experts.  We also need the necessary back-up facilities to advise families in difficulty.  If this matter were fully investigated and if some Government had the courage to provide the necessary finance to establish such courts or tribunals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Deputy, I am afraid we are going off on a tangent on this section.  The section deals specifically with the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  The amendment of the 1870 Act <Col N="1878" /> is not to be discussed under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In this instance judicial separations will come up in the Circuit Courts and a situation could arise where a family matter would be included in a list of cases to come before the Circuit Court.  If that case is listed first, the people involved will be called in to the judge's chambers perhaps and the case will be heard.  If the people in the locality did not know that there was a problem in this family they would be well aware of it before the day was out as everybody would be sitting outside waiting for the case to be finished.  There would be pressure on the judge to hurry the case because of the people waiting outside and he might give a rash or hurried decision. That is an unfortunate situation.  All we are doing here is updating something that was passed away back in 1870.  Little progress has been made this morning if that is the best we can do.  The Minister has the goodwill to approach this in a more generous way.  We should have specialist judges to hear these types of cases. That would go a long way towards solving this problem.  A lot of finance will be needed to provide these facilities but the benefits that will follow in relation to improving family relationships is all important.  The Minister should take another look at this because the Minister is not just dealing with this section but with further sections.</P>

      <P>We will deal with the other sections later but they are closely related.  We need specialists in this field. A marginal improvement has been made by having women judges but greater effort should be made.  In all the courts only about five per cent of the judges are women.  There should be much more woman involvement in family matters and in cases dealing with divorce a mensa et thoro.  Judges often have meetings at which they discuss changes in legislation and so on and it would be an advantage if women had an opportunity to put forward their views.  The change made this <Col N="1879" /> morning is very small; it is marginal in remedying the situation.  The matter has not been tackled in relation to family courts and family tribunals and that is where it should be tackled.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The purpose of section 5 is to vest in the Circuit Court jurisdiction to deal with the only form of divorce we have, that is, divorce <i>a mensa et thoro.</i> This is yet another transfer of jurisdiction of the High Court to the Circuit Court. In an earlier section we added enormously to the volume of work to be done in the Circuit Court by increasing the jurisdiction in the action which is the greatest source of litigation, the running down action, from £2,000 to £15,000.  I was shocked when I saw this section.  It is often said that the purchase of a house is probably the single most important contract that a person will ever enter into. I believe that the most serious contract that an individual enters into is the contract of marriage, which is a very serious contract.  While the contract covering the purchase of a house, a motor car or any other commodity may affect a person's material needs and comfort, a contract of marriage will affect a person's happiness in life for the duration of the marriage contract.  This section is a downgrading of the marriage contract because it deals with the jurisdiction of a marriage contract. It is a downgrading of the importance and of the solemn nature of the <Col N="1880" /> marriage contract by reducing it from a higher court to a lower court.  Deputy Enright and Deputy Keating have made the case about the family law courts, and so on.  I gather from the Minister's intervention that he has them under consideration. That may be so, but why start tinkering around with the jurisdiction in divorce cases <i>a mensa et thoro</i>?  This Bill will become law six months after it is signed by the President.</P>
      <P>We are piling more and more work onto the Circuit Court in section after section.  So far as I know, we have made no arrangements for an increase in court accommodation, in the number of judges in the Circuit Court, in the staff in the Circuit Court offices, all of which will be necessary if this Bill is not to become an agent of chaos.  I have no doubt about that.  There will be no change in the procedure in the Circuit Court.  It will be about the same as it is now.  A divorce case will be listed as one of perhaps ten cases to be heard during the day.  It could be followed by an application for a person to get back his driving licence, or by a running-down action, or a slander action, or an action about a certificate of reasonable value in a building contract, which we added on to the work of the Circuit Court last year.  There could be a mixed medlay of all sorts of actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A divorce case is a sensitive action about difficulties which have arisen between a man and a woman in the course of the marriage contract.  The thing is absolutely absurd.  As things stand, disputes between spouses, or between the parties in an action like that, are heard by juries in the High Court. For some years back we have had men and women on juries.  We are taking away a right from those people, but not in so many words.  We are invading the right to trial by jury in these actions by stealth. We are not saying we are doing it.  We are increasing the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from £2,000 to £15,000 and imposing penalties on people who take a chance and litigate in the High Court, but get awards only within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  We are driving these people into the Circuit Court where they lose the right to trial by jury.  Under this <Col N="1881" /> section we are also taking away the right to trial by jury in this very sensitive type of action.  The Minister says that not too many people avail of the right to trial by jury in this type of case.  I understand there are not many of these cases.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Cavan-Monaghan):</i> At any rate the right is there and we are taking it away and not saying a word about it.  As has been said, this Bill is not really an effort at reform. Various reforms are necessary in this field.  There is the reform which was mentioned recently where marriages are annulled by the majority Church and people are still married according to the law.  The Minister might do better to deal with that complex situation rather than messing around from one court to another.  He should leave the jurisdiction in the High Court where it stands at the moment as an indication that the Legislature still regards a marriage contract as very important, as a contract that is suitable to be dealt with in the highest court in the land.</P>
      <P>There is a difference in the way in which things are done in the Circuit Court and in the High Court.  In the Circuit Court a number of actions are listed for the day to make sure that there is a day's work to be done.  It is assumed that an action will take an hour or an hour and a half, but it could take the whole day. People involved in later actions are hanging around to see whether the first case will be disposed of.  In the High Court once a case is started almost invariably the other people are excused for the day. They are told they are not required.  They go home and the case at hearing is heard in peace and quiet, and with patience and due consideration.  There is more of a rush in the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Enright said, troubles and disputes in family cases may not be known about but, when Mr. and Mrs. X are seen in the hall of a Circuit Court, and then adjourn to the judge's room, it will not be long before the news gets around that all is not happy in that family. That is a source of embarrassment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1882" /> There is a major issue here.  The lowest court in the country is the District Court. The next is the Circuit Court and the court of general and unlimited jurisdiction is the High Court.  Down through the years it has always been the practice that matrimonial matters were dealt with in the High Court only.  That should still be the case.  When we come to a later section of this Bill I will want to know what real arrangements the Minister has in mind for handling the increased jurisdiction which he is giving to the Circuit Court. Will he appoint more judges?  Will he provide more accommodation to house the judges and litigants?  Will he provide more staff in the Circuit Court offices?  If he intends to do all this, will he do it within six months because this Bill will become law within six months?</P>
    <P>Section 31 (3) provides that sections 2 to 17, 19 (2), 20 to 23 and 25 to 27 of this Bill shall come into operation six months after the date of the passing of this Act. As far as I can see, the entire Bill, with the exception of section 24, which is concerned with the registration of District Court decrees as judgment mortgages, will come into operation six months afterwards. One would not be sufficiently brave to bring that into operation until one had made some arrangements.  That just could not be done; it would not work. But the rest of the machinery for chaos which this Bill is, unless there is some preparation made for it, will be let loose on the country six months after its passing. Those are my serious reservations on the section.  First of all, the principle of the thing is wrong.  It is downgrading the importance of the marriage contract, and that is wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>An indication of the seriousness and complexity of the substantive issues to which Deputy Keating has referred in relation to family law matters is that they are with the Law Reform Commission who are considering a number of aspects, including procedural matters. The Courts Committee also have a very definite and responsible interest in the area of reviewing and providing for procedural aspects.  Consideration of <Col N="1883" /> such matters on this section is not desirable or necessary.  The section with which we are dealing attempts to provide easier access to an existing legal remedy.  Deputy Fitzpatrick contends that it is a downgrading of marriage to reduce judicial separation cases to the lower court, a downgrading of the contract of marriage, to which he rightly referred a one of the most, if not the most important contract that two people can enter into.  However, it is a question of providing a facility that exists in the High Court in a lower court, thereby ensuring easier and cheaper access for many people.  The right of trial by jury is there for those who wish to avail of it in the High Court.  It has not been abolished and there is no intention so to do in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I have some figures I can give the House of the numbers of petitions for judicial separation.  In 1975, the number of petitions for judicial separation amounted to 43; there were five decrees, non-jury, High Court.  In 1976 there were 37 petitions, five decrees, non-jury.  In 1977 there were 29 petitions with two decrees, non-jury, and in 1978, 39 petitions, three decrees, one refusal: all non-jury hearings.  This is clear evidence of the fact that all of these petitions &mdash; I must also point out that there was a considerable number not proceeded with &mdash; that were heard without a jury in the High Court.  This is a clear indication of the fact that there is a certain intimacy &mdash; as I said earlier when dealing with another section &mdash; related to these matters that makes people anxious to &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Is the Minister saying that none of these at all was tried by jury?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I make the point only in so far as it clarifies the position on the question of the demand for juries.  The Deputy contended it was a downgrading of the status of marriage to take the action of judicial separation, as it is commonly known, into the Circuit Court.  On the one hand, the Deputy described it as a downgrading.  On the other hand, the Deputy suggested that <Col N="1884" /> the absence of a jury in the Circuit Court is of considerable disadvantage.  On the basis of the facts I have given and of the knowledge available to me I would contest what the Deputy says so far as the numbers of persons who have availed of the High Court facility have sought to do so in the absence of a jury.  I am quite certain the same would apply in the Circuit Court which is, if you like, in itself being upgraded to deal with this particular action.</P>
      <P>The more general questions of the establishment of special family law courts and procedures have been referred to also by Deputy Enright and the fundamental issue of the suitability of the adversary-type tribunals for the hearing of such matters have been raised both by him and Deputy Keating.  The Minister for Justice has spoken at length, in reply to parliamentary questions, on this topic since coming into Office.</P>
      <P>Indeed, it would be no harm to cover some of the ground again in the context of this Bill.  First of all, let me say that the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure have under examination the question of establishing special family law tribunals.  The Law Reform Commission are also considering the appropriate type of structure to deal with these types of matters.  Secondly, the proposals in this Bill will go a long way toward making less formalised procedures available to many litigants in the family law area. Furthermore, there has been, and continues to be, substantial expansion in the welfare officer service attached to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to point out amongst other things, the valuable back-up services available in family maintenance cases where the District Court clerk can act as go-between for the payment of maintenance.  Whatever the practical difficulties that must be faced in relation to the proper hearing of family law cases in any court.  I am absolutely clear that there is nothing inherently inappropriate in giving the Circuit Court the widest possible jurisdiction.  This matter was covered specifically by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, in paragraph 17 <Col N="1885" /> of their 20th report, which stated that these lower courts:</P>
    <P>...are better geared to cope with the frequency with which several applications in the same case tend to recur because of changing circumstances. There is also the considerable advantage of local venues and the additional advantage of appeals by way of complete re-hearing to the appropriate appellate jurisdiction instead of the present costly and time-consuming system of appeal to the Supreme Court. If any particular point of law arises in respect of which the opinion of a higher court should be sought, the existing statutory provisions with regard to the stating of a consultative case are available to the District Court, the Circuit Court, and the High Court hearing an appeal from the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House also that the jurisdiction proposals in this Bill are based on a report of a committee of the highest calibre, chaired by none less than a judge of the Supreme Court.  This committee is in an ideal position to judge which business should be taken in which court.  I am confident that the Circuit Court would be capable of handling this business competently and carefully.  I am looking at various methods of reorganisation of business in the courts.  The possibility is open to us to re-arrange that all family law business be concentrated in one or two venues in each circuit.  There is no question of the institution of marriage being downgraded.  The position of marriage is constitutionally guaranteed and marriage still subsists even after a decree of <i>a mensa et thoro.</i></P>
    <P>Deputy Enright referred to the inexperience of members of the Judiciary or, to put it another way, their possible inadequacy in dealing with delicate and sensitive matters of family law.  To suggest that the Circuit Court should not be given this jurisdiction because of its inexperience in such matters is unsound in logic. It is tantamount to saying not to give divorce to the Circuit Court because it has not got that jurisdiction already.  To carry this type of argument to its logical <Col N="1886" /> conclusion is to make a plea for no change in this area.  The Circuit Court has not got experience in such matters because it does not have the jurisdiction.  The only way it can gain such experience is to give it jurisdiction.  That is sound logic.</P>

I understood that the Deputy was suggesting inexperience or inadequacy on the part of some members of the Judiciary to deal with such cases and I was anxious to refute that.  Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke about the requirements that would arise on the appointment of additional judges for staff and so on.  I should like to tell the Deputy again that whatever is needed by way of additional judges or court staff to deal with the proper functioning of the Circuit Court will be provided as required.  The Minister made that commitment in the course of his Second Reading speech.  I want to assure the Deputy that whatever is required by way of court staff or judges for the proper implementation of the legislation and the subsequent running of the Circuit Courts will be provided.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Is the Minister aware that in many areas consultations can take place only in the public hallway or on the steps <Col N="1887" /> of the courthouse?  Does the Minister appreciate that the first time a barrister who is conducting the case has an opportunity of meeting the party involved is on the morning of the case?  Some of the courthouses are unbelievably bad, while others are quite good.  The Minister, and the Government, can appoint judges pretty quickly but the Circuit Court staff cannot be appointed as speedily because they must be trained.  However, when it comes to providing rooms for consultations and buildings the record of the Government is not that good.  We are aware that the provision of such facilities takes time.</P>
      <P>The Bill will come into effect six months after it is signed by the President. The general assurance given by the Minister of State that everything needed will be provided as soon as required cannot be taken seriously because we know that with the best will and all the money in the world&mdash;neither are available at present&mdash; it will take some time to build or extend courthouses to provide consultation rooms.  We are shifting to the Circuit Court considerable additional jurisdiction. To exercise that jurisdiction in any sort of reasonable way the least that is required is a room for consultations.  Such rooms are not available and nobody seems to know who is responsible for providing them.</P>

It is because of the failure to provide such courts that I am anxious to have special sittings of the District Court to hear complaints under consumer legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last seven or eight years quite an amount of excellent consumer legislation was passed but that will be worthless if we do not make some special arrangement for the hearing of complaints brought under that legislation.  There is not much use in passing such legislation if complaints brought under it cannot be heard in court.  The provisions of that legislation are not being utilised because people are not prepared to sit around for hours and have their cases listed with criminal and property cases.  Special sittings of the District Court should be arranged to hear such complaints.  The good consumer legislation will be useless unless we make such facilities available. I hope that those facilities will only be necessary for a short period while the Government are deciding on what to do <Col N="1889" /> about the establishment of consumer courts.</P>
    <P>My first priority would be the setting up of consumer courts but I am beating my head against a stone wall in looking for such courts.  That is why I am asking for special sittings of the District Court to hear consumer complaints.  Let us proceed along those lines for the present and then at a future date we could have consumer courts, but it is necessary to move now to bring about a situation in which matters of this nature would be heard on specific days in the District Courts.  It is important that the courts be convenient to the people.  In regard to the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act we find that people are reluctant to have their cases heard under the present procedures and that is why I am asking the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In anticipation of the enactment of legislation now before the House, my Department have been considering ways and means of improving the organisation of the District Courts in order that they be in a position to cope with the increased jurisdiction that will be conferred on them.  Plans are well advanced for the enlargement of the Dublin Metropolitan District Court with a view to providing greater flexibility in the disposal of District Court business in Dublin city and county.  Plans are well advanced also for the reorganisation of a number of provincial District Courts with a view to relieving pressure on some justices. My Department will consult closely with the President of the District Court, with justices, with the local legal profession and with the Garda with a view to ascertaining what further improvements can be made.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright's suggestion that different days be set aside in each District Court area for the hearing of different categories of business as well as his other suggestions for the more expeditious disposal of court business will be borne in mind when the administrative arrangements necessary to implement the new jurisdictions are being made.  The various interests concerned will be consulted.</P>

      <P>In regard to the extension of the jurisdiction of the District Court it has come to my attention that there appears to be a movement under way to discontinue many District Courts in provincial areas.  For instance, I understand that there are plans to discontinue three of the seven District Courts in my county. Is it not strange that the Minister should be extending the jurisdiction of the District Court while at the same time reducing the number of sittings?  Is it envisaged that what is to happen in Offaly will happen <Col N="1891" /> nationwide thereby bringing about reduction of about 40 per cent in the number of district courts?  If this is to be the case the result will be a sizeable reduction in the overall number of District Courts.  I should like the Minister to deal with this question so that we may know what the position is.  If any such plan is envisaged, it would be bound to meet with widespread opposition because people would not wish to have to go to the larger centres to have their cases heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the District Court.  Already the District Court in the larger centres must deal with a large number of motor accident and of criminal cases.  What would be the point in adding an extensive amount of litigation to the courts in these areas and thereby aggravating further the already overloaded situation?</P>
      <P>I understand that alterations are taking place in a number of court areas and that while this is happening consultations are under way with the Department and with the district justices involved in regard to moves to the bigger centres.  Any such procedure would result in denying people the right to have their cases heard in their own areas.  The people in many smaller towns &mdash; those with populations of fewer than 3,000 &mdash; are anxious to preserve their identity, to preserve their existing facilities and services, and they would be very much against any move to take the courts away from them.  I hope that the Minister will be in a position to deny that there is any such move.  If my information in this regard in respect of Offaly is correct, we could expect that on a nationwide basis the number of District Courts that would be discontinued could very well be as many as 100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take big counties such as Mayo, Cork or Kerry and if we withdraw 40 per cent of their District Courts, litigants would have to travel very long distances to court and in this way they would be involved in substantial expense and <Col N="1892" /> inconvenience.  Such a situation would be particularly difficult for elderly people or for those of limited means.  This is very hard on elderly people and people of limited means and the Minister is also withdrawing a facility from the towns.  I would like a clear statement from the Minister indicating his views on this because I have met a number of people in Offaly who are up in arms over the attempt to take away Banagher court, Kilcormack court and Dangan court. There is widespread opposition to this. Perhaps the Minister will look into the matter to make sure that it does not happen and that it does not happen on a national scale as well.  I am quite sure that a lot of people will call to the Minister about this if they feel they are going to lose this facility.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The District Court is going to continue to be a court which is neither fish, flesh, nor good red herring.  I see at the bottom of section 6 that there is a proviso that the decision of the justice in the District Court in a case in which the question of title to land is in issue shall not operate as an estoppel or as a bar to a suit in any court in relation to such land. That is not new.  I know it is not new because there was an old provision that it had some sort of jurisdiction up to £10 valuation years ago but it did not interfere with the title to land.  I wonder will this not create confusion here because one could be dealing now with a fairly sizeable bit of land with the subject matter of the action amounting to £2,500 in value.  That does not necessarily mean the value of the land.  It could mean a right of way because a right of way does <Col N="1894" /> not seem to be excluded here.  It is a bit vague.</P>
      <P>Somebody might take an action which is decided one way or the other and, in 10 or 15 years somebody will think that he has won in the District Court and that he has acquired the right to do what he is doing and it will turn out that because of this proviso the action for damages about the land has not operated as an estoppel or a bar in any court in relation to the land.  In ordinary language that means that it does not affect the title to the land.  It would be better not to extend that jurisdiction at all or to extend it in a full-blooded way so that it would be an estoppel and would establish title to the land.  It is quite unsatisfactory at the moment.  It is following something that was there for 50 or 60 years or more since the Courts of Justice Acts were brought in.  The Minister should study it and, &mdash; I do not intend to be a bit offensive in this &mdash; get to understand what is involved there because it could lead to complications.</P>
      <P>We are, in section 24, giving the right to register a District Court decree as a mortgage on land.  That is the first time that that jurisdiction has ever been conferred on the Circuit Court.  I may be anticipating something but, as far as I know, the procedure in registering a Circuit Court decree as a mortgage was that it had to be registered in the Central Office in the Four Courts.  But here we are going to skip that and we are going to register in the District Court instead of in the Central Office although there is no machinery or procedure in the District Court for registering such decrees as mortgages because the District Court is not a court of record.  It may be that what I am talking about now could be better dealt with when we come to section 24, if I am here.  But I am concerned about the proviso to section 6 in regard to actions about land because it is vague and uncertain and will create uncertainty and we should not do that especially in regard to a thing that is as sacred as land here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We are happy to accept the section in general, but there is one reservation that must be entered.  We are dealing with a fundamental area here, the rights of people to a home or what is to them a home, their accommodation. That is in the context of the whole question of rent restrictions, letting of property <Col N="1897" /> and so on, because there is considerable litigation in relation to the Rent Restrictions Act 1960 which affects a great number of people and consequently it is a good argument to make that facilities regarding and access to the District Court should be available if, indeed, you want to get the best manner of dealing with it &mdash; another day's argument.</P>
      <P>In the present District Court as we know it, the district justices are burdened with so many cases that there can be circumstances in which the concept of the District Court &mdash; which I presume was to dispense fairly rapid and reasonably-priced justice &mdash; might somehow conflict with the need to give extensive time in some cases to an area which is fundamental, the question of a home.  If there is that problem &mdash; I put it forward tentatively as something that could arise &mdash; then we need to be concerned.  I know there is the safeguard of a rehearing in the Circuit Court but that is open to the counter-argument about costs and legal aid and so on that we made earlier.  Does the Minister share any of my qualms about the vital area that this constitutes and whether the District Court might not in some circumstances be the best forum in which to deal with such an area?</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I see that the Supreme Court yesterday reserved its decision in an action concerning the constitutionality of the 1960 Act.  If the Supreme Court decides in a certain way the operative sections of that Act will be blown sky high.  I do not want to anticipate the Supreme Court decision but have the Government given any consideration to this very important issue, the position of people who will find themselves homeless if the Supreme Court decides in a certain way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>This section increases the jurisdiction of the District Court under the 1960 Rent Restrictions Act where an order for the recovery of possession of a rent-controlled dwelling is being sought. The 1960 Act gave the court jurisdiction in such cases either where the parties <Col N="1898" /> were agreeable or where the rateable valuation of the dwelling did not exceed £10 or the annual rent did not exceed £53. These figures were increased by the 1971 Courts Act to £25 rateable valuation and £315 rent per annum.  The section now proposes to raise the rent limit to £2,500 per annum in line with the rent limit in ejectment cases proposed in section 6. The courts committee made no specific recommendation to this jurisdiction. While it is acceptable that controlled rents under the Rent Restrictions Act rarely in practice exceed the present limit of £315 per annum, this limit is being increased to £2,500 in order to keep it in line with the courts jurisdiction in ejectment proceedings.  The increase to this figure renders it virtually unnecessary to alter the rateable valuation limit as the new rent limit would encompass all rent-controlled premises.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the fact that the High Court recently found that the main provision of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, was unconstitutional. This decision is at present under appeal to the Supreme Court, and Deputy Fitzpatrick has drawn this to the attention of the House.

Not even days should be lost in that case and if necessary we should have a Bill in this House the next day, if that is the way to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Section 9 seeks to extend the jurisdiction of the District Court under the Rent Restrictions Act.  The Minister's party undertook, prior to the eventful day in 1977 when they came back to power, to set up what might be called rent tribunals or a tribunal to deal with rent and conditions. The section here refers to this area and constitutes what surely must be Government thinking at this time.  I wonder is it an indicator that the formal proposal &mdash; the undertaking of which I can give chapter and verse if necessary &mdash; is in abeyance or is no longer relevant.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3.</P>
      <P>In page 6, paragraph (a), lines 13 to 15, to delete &ldquo;for further periods of not more than 12 months but not exceeding 12 months in respect of any one renewal&rdquo; and to substitite &ldquo;a renewal being for a period not exceeding 12 months&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment.  The existing section 22(4) of the Family Law Maintenance of Spouses and Children Act, 1976, gives the District Court power to make a barring order.  The new sub-section proposed here was drafted on the same lines as the original, merely substituting <Col N="1901" /> the words &ldquo;not more than 12 months&rdquo; for three months wherever they occur.  This gives rise in the last few lines of the subsection to an apparent tautology which is removed by the amendment. The amendment does not affect the principle that each renewal must not exceed the maximum and only one renewal can be granted at a time.  It should be noted that the existing subsection in conferring a power on the District Court to give a barring order for three months does not make it clear whether this period is a fixed period or is to be regarded as a maximum.  The subsection now proposed allows orders to be made for any length of time up to the new maximum of 12 months.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;or of any&rdquo; in line 19 down to and including &ldquo;District Court&rdquo; in line 21.</P>
      <P>I will not delay the House unduly.  In line with our thinking in relation to the section relating to divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> it follows that we would consider that the District Court is not the appropriate forum for settling questions of guardianship of infants.  For that reason we wish this to be excluded from this section.  I feel more strongly about this action than I did about the earlier section because we are dealing here with infants whereas in the earlier section we were dealing with adults of presumed sound mind and mature commonsense who were able to speak for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be unfair, but it must be said that for a variety of reasons, often outside the control of the courts themselves and the personnel associated with them, there are areas of dissatisfaction associated with some District Courts.  I <Col N="1902" /> suppose that in any human institution that will be the case.  There is concern about some of the actions, decisions and the disportment of the personnel involved in handing out those decisions and those associated with the processes, in a minority of District Courts.  That is bad enough when we are dealing with matters of relatively minor material issues and when adults are involved, but does the Minister honestly believe that the District Court, as good as it might be at its best, is the right forum for dealing with the guardianship of infants?  I do not believe he could.  It was never intended that the District Court would deal with this kind of matter.  One should look at the statistics in relation to the numbers of cases which go through the courts at District Court level.  The reality is that there is a recipe in the District Court for cheap and rapid dispensation of the law.</P>
    <P>Guardianship of infants is an issue which is becoming increasingly common in terms of disputes and does not lend itself to anything other than a commitment of as much time, effort and resources as is necessary.  We are talking about assigning to courts, in which for the most part there is confidence, a vital matter &mdash; the future of young children.  I do not think this section is adequate and I would not accept it under any circumstances. I consider it to be misguided and it should be repealed.  I believe young people and children in this country have not had strong enough representation. They did not have anybody battering on the doors of Leinster House to have their voices heard.  Men and women, mothers and fathers, who understand the needs of young people and children, would not support the idea of questions relating to the guardianship of these children being dealt with in the way proposed here. Accordingly, I propose that the amendments put down to these three sections be made and wherever the phrase &ldquo;Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964&rdquo; arises that it be deleted.  I do not do so with any other feeling but one of sincere and profound concern.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider my remarks between now and Report Stage &mdash; or before committing himself to the <Col N="1903" /> inevitability of including my amendments in these sections now &mdash; that he consult with expert opinion in the area, and familiarise himself with the comments in the media today in relation to existing courts dealing with children.  As far as I am concerned our attitude in this area is very inadequate, disgraceful would not be too strong a word for it in some respects.  It is not right that children and their futures should be used like pawns in any kind of game of clearing up administration or extending jurisdiction where there is any evidence indicating that hardship or distress would follow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us both make a resolution to do better.  I have made the point on section 12 that the District Court is not a suitable forum for dealing with guardianship of infants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if I were to concede, which I do not, that jurisdiction under the Guardianship of Infants Act should not be conferred on the District Court, as section 15 proposes among other things to do, the amendments now under discussion would not be acceptable because they propose to delete references not only to the District Court's jurisdiction but also to the Circuit Court's <Col N="1905" /> jurisdiction under that Act.  I would like to remind the House that under existing law, the Circuit Court already has the same jurisdiction as the High Court under Part II of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.</P>
      <P>The Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, provides at present that a barring order shall expire whenever the Circuit Court makes an order under the 1964 Act.  The first of the amendments now before us would remove this important provision resulting in a significant diminution of the Circuit Court's powers when determining questions of the guardianship and custody of children.</P>
      <P>As regards the other two amendments under discussion, I have said already that the aim of this Bill in the area of family law is to draw together the various jurisdictions in such a way as to provide a forum where the whole range of remedies which the law provides can be obtained on one application, and to make it easier for applicants to do this.  Section 16 allows an applicant or plaintiff to take the full range of actions in his local District or Circuit Court venue, or, if he wishes, to go to the defendant's or respondent's local venue to initiate proceedings.  In practice, the local venue will be the same for applicant and respondent in many cases; but where one party has moved from the locality or is working away from the locality, it could cause hardship, or indeed discourage the taking of action in some cases, if the party wishing to start proceedings was obliged to do so other than in his local court venue.</P>
      <P>I should mention also that this rationalisation has been sought by many interested parties and has been recommended by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, which is an eminently qualified body chaired by a judge of the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>It would defeat the whole purpose of the provision in section 16, designed as it is to offer litigants a choice of venue, to omit from the range of jurisdictions covered by it the one relating to the very important questions of the guardianship and custody of infants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5A)  Any such order made under subsections (4) and (5) of this section may be terminated by the Circuit Court or District Court on the written application to it by the parties in respect of whom the order was made.</P>
      <P>(5B)  Any such order made by the District Court or Circuit Court shall be enforceable by means of the arrest of a person in breach of any such order.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential purpose of this amendment is to make the barring order a more sensitive and effective instrument for dealing with the problem of marital difficulties. The purpose of the first part of the amendment is to try to ensure that where a barring order has been obtained and subsequently both parties agree that a reconciliation is possible the order could be removed by a written application to the Circuit Court or District Court by the parties in respect of whom the order was made.  The right to protection exists but when both parties consider that the barring order is no longer necessary the court would have the right to adjudicate as to whether its continued existence is necessary. This would prevent the couple from being separated by a barring order when <Col N="1907" /> they wished to be reconciled.  I would ask the Minister to consider this point because it does not seem to be covered in the section.  Sometimes people cool off after a barring order has been made and they realise that with the right counsel there is a prospect of reuniting.  We should try to facilitate them in that regard.</P>
    <P>The second part of amendment No. 5 is more important.  The Minister knows there has been widespread agreement about the ineffectiveness of barring orders.  In layman's language, a barring order is an order obtained by a wife to prevent continued violence or brutality to her or her children by her husband.  I have no doubt that a woman would go to court to seek such an order only in the most extreme circumstances.  It is not a step lightly undertaken.  It leaves one open to intimidation and to abuse, physical and otherwise, and it is a most unfortunate step for any person to take.  Therefore, it is a matter of grave importance. There is much evidence available, whether from the Incorporated Law Society, the various associations representing women's interests or from public representatives, that barring orders do not work.  All that happens is that the barred party comes back the next night in a drunken condition, kicks in the door and carries on as he has done before. Last week a woman came to my clinic who was brutalised each night by her husband and against whom she has obtained a barring order.  I am requesting that such an order be made effective.</P>
    <P>There is no other way of doing that other than by giving the Garda the power to enforce the order.  That plea has been made by many bodies and the Minister should not have any difficulty in accepting it.  I do not suggest that the form of words in our amendment or the exact proposition contained in it is the best answer.  All our amendments are meant to be taken in the spirit rather than in the letter.  The problem exists and the answer is to make the barring orders effective. Senior members of the legal profession have admitted that it is a waste of time to <Col N="1908" /> grant barring orders.  Some people will respect the order but that kind of person is not the individual about whom the problem is the most serious.</P>
    <P>Arguably, we need here the power of arrest, or at least giving the Garda Síochána or some other appropriate agency &mdash; although I presume gardaí are the only people entitled to have such a power &mdash; the right to insist on the order being effective.  If the person mentioned in the order puts his foot inside the door, he is subject to immediate arrest.  What happens at the moment?  The woman goes back to court but in the meantime the beatings and the brutality continue. Such a barring order is not worth the paper it is written on and all of us know that.  I have tried to identify the problem and to offer some suggestions about how it might be dealt with.  The more rapidly and effectively it is dealt with the better. I should like to hear the Minister's comments on the two points I made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The first sub-section which the Deputy proposes to insert relates to the procedure to be followed in order to discharge a barring order.  This is already catered for by section 22 (2) of the 1976 Act, which provides that either spouse may apply at any time for the discharge of a barring order.  The District Court Rules provide for the issue of a summons in that event which would result in a court hearing at which both parties have an opportunity to put their views before the court determines the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say at the outset that the present procedure in my opinion is not only adequate but appropriate.  Accordingly, it seems to me that at best the Deputy's proposal in this regard is unnecessary.  It may be that the Deputy intends that a barring order should be discharged automatically by the court without any consideration of the issue once both parties have signed letters requesting it.  Under the present law a barring order may not be set aside unless the court is satisfied that it is proper to do so, and that the safety of the spouse who applied for the order or of any dependent child will not be prejudiced by the discharge of the <Col N="1909" /> order.  I am quite satisfied that this is in the interests of all the persons concerned as far as the protection of the wife and children is concerned.  There is a real possibility that under physical or emotional threats the wife could be forced into a hasty decision to sign an application for the discharge of the order.</P>
    <P>In my view it is far better and more in keeping with the purpose of the whole barring order remedy that the court and the parties should have the opportunity of deciding the issue at hearing.  I do not accept that in a case where the parties are genuinely agreed to termination of the order this will prove any real hardship.  If the two spouses appear before the court the matter can be disposed of easily. Even if this involved some inconvenience, I am convinced that the involvement of the court is an essential protection for the spouse who may have been pressured or who has acted hastily, and for the children.  For that reason I cannot accept the first paragraph of the amendment.</P>
    <P>As regards the second paragraph, I must say straightaway that it appears to be technically defective.  The Deputy appears to be confused as to the function of arrest.  Arrest can be no part of enforcement procedures, whether for breach of a barring order or otherwise.  It is a procedure for bringing an accused person before the courts on a criminal charge.  Since contravention of a barring order is made a criminal offence by sub-section (3), enforcement is by means of criminal proceedings in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>What the Deputy may have in mind is a power for gardaí to arrest without warrant for this offence.  On a number of occasions the Minister for Justice has dealt with this issue publicly and has pointed out that the provision of powers without arrest of itself alone would not necessarily solve the problem.  For one thing, arrested people can normally get bail.  In addition, giving such a power does not touch other aspects of the problem such as what may happen while the case is awaiting hearing.  These are among the matters which the Minister has at present under examination in relation <Col N="1910" /> to the whole barring order procedure. As has been stated on a number of occasions, consultations have taken place with all bodies concerned, including women's organisations and the Garda Síochána.  The present position is that the Minister expects to bring his proposals in the matter before the Government in the near future.  When I say &ldquo;near future&rdquo; I mean weeks rather than months.  I cannot at this stage disclose the nature of these proposals, nor can I forecast the Government's reaction.  I can say that given Government approval of the proposals there should not be any problem with regard to finding a suitable legislative vehicle for the proposals.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of informing the House that if these proposals makes sufficient progress it may become preferable to take the provisions about barring orders out of the Bill now under consideration and associate them with the further proposals which may be approved by the Government.  In that event I would need to move a suitable amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said, that it might be better to have the physical presence of both parties before the court.  It was never the intention that the court would decide on a slip of paper.  It was not the intention of the amendment that a written letter with two signatures would be produced and the court would decide on the written evidence. The intention is that the application would be considered and that both parties would be summoned in.  At present if parties wish to be reconciled they are not prevented from doing so.  I gather that the Minister accepts that barring orders are a problem.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This section deals with the Family Home (Protection) Act, 1976, and it proposes to amend section 10 of that Act. Can the Minister tell us what is the effect of this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>This section increases the jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts under the 1976 Act.  Proceedings under that Act include proceedings, with the consent of a spouse, for the sale of the family home and to prevent disposal of household chattels by a spouse.  Section 10 of that Act gives the Circuit Court full jurisdiction to hear and determine proceedings under the Act but provides that if the land to which the proceedings relate have a rateable valuation of more than £100 or if the personal property involved exceeds £5,000 in value, the proceedings must be transferred to the High Court if the defendent so requires.  Paragraph (a) of the subsection now proposed increases the valuation limit to £200 and removes the reference to personal property.  This increase was not the subject of a specific recommendation by the Courts Committee but is in line with the increase in the equity jurisdiction of the Circuit Court proposed in section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> In effect what we are providing <Col N="1913" /> in section 13 is that the Circuit Court shall continue to have jurisdiction in relation to the 1976 Act.  It apparently shall have unlimited jurisdiction in regard to the family home, by consent, but in cases where the PLV exceeds £200 the defendant can apply to have the action transferred to the High Court and it shall be transferred thereupon without prejudice to anything that has been done in the Circuit Court, subject to the right to vary in the High Court.</P>
      <P>When I go back to section 5 which deals not with the house but with the relationship between the parties to the marriage, I find that the Bill is not conferring any right to one of the parties to have the action transferred to the High Court.  This section simply confers concurrent jurisdiction on the Circuit Court to try an action for divorce <i>a mensa et thoro.</i> In section 5, if a party brings an action for divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> in the Circuit Court the other party has not got a right to say he or she wants to have the action transferred to the High Court. When the Minister comes to a house, which I pointed out in my earlier remarks is much less important than the contract of marriage, he recognises the High Court is a superior forum which one of the parties might want to avail of, but he gives the right in this section to one of the parties to have the action transferred to the High Court.</P>
      <P>I should like an explanation as to why an action about the family home should be treated as more important and as qualifying for hearing in a tribunal of a higher status than an action concerning the very existence of the contract of marriage.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick is making a comparison between matters that cannot be given expression in monetary terms on the one hand and between matters which can be given expression in money terms on the other hand.  Section 5 has stood part of the Bill since this morning, and in section 13 the plaintiff may be pursued in whichever court the defendant chooses to take the action. That situation applies in section 5 as well.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> That is the point I have been making, that a house is being dealt with in money terms &mdash; it is something anonymous. Yet the Minister treats it in a more elevated way and regards it as more serious and as being entitled to be adjudicated upon in a higher tribunal.  He actually gives the party who is being sued a choice of courts, as between the Circuit Court where the action may be brought and the High Court, whereas in relation to an action for a permanent judicial separation, divorce <i>a mensa et thoro,</i> which is a permanent judicial separation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> It cannot, in the Minister's own language, be adequately dealt with by the payment of money by one party to another because personal relationships exist, which as I said this morning, are far more important than an action about a house or a mere chattel.  Yet in the Bill the Minister promotes the less important of these two rights of action to a higher tribune than the more important, which is the divorce action.  It is very difficult to <Col N="1915" /> understand the reasoning behind that.  I have no objection to the Minister, in section 10, giving the choice of the court which will have the right to hear the action.  I am only pointing out the inconsistency. It is very difficult to understand and the argument that the Minister put forward, in reply to the point which I raised, is the strongest possible argument in favour of my objection, that money cannot compensate the person who has suffered the wrong in the case of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>, but money can compensate for the sale of a house or chattels. Therefore, the action which the Minister proposes to confine to the Circuit Court, if it started there, is the more important action, the action which should have a choice of tribune.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I went to considerable lengths this morning to explain what the jurisdictional changes in the Bill were intended to mean.  In this section, I wish to restate that we are raising the jurisdictional limits again.  We are not changing the law as it stands.  We are simply raising the limit.  This particular section does this in the context of section 10 of the 1976 Act, which gives the Circuit Court full jurisdiction to hear and determine proceedings under the Act.  It also provides for much the same as section 10 of the 1976 Act, which also gives jurisdiction to the District Court to hear and determine proceedings relating to the removal of household chattels from a family home, where the value of the goods involved does not exceed £1,000.  Paragraph (b) of the section now proposed increases the limit to £2,500.  This increase was not the subject of a specific recommendation by the courts committee any more than the increase from £100 to £200 valuation was a recommendation of the courts committee, but is in line with the general increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we make comparisons between section 5, which deals with a judicial separation, and a question of equity in section 13 which raises the valuation limit from £100 to £200, it is an unfair comparison <Col N="1916" /> and is likely to misrepresent the purpose of the individual sections in the Bill: section 5 which we should not be discussing and section 13, to which we are contributing.  In relation to increasing the valuation limit to £200, as I have already stated, we are dealing with property and equity, where we have to decide such questions as ownership or part ownership, who shares it or who has the right to share it.  That is much different from going into the Circuit Court or the High Court and making an application for a petition for judicial separation which is the prevention of a marriage contract to operate in full, but at the same time in no way undermining or dissolving that particular contract.  I do not think Deputy Fitzpatrick intends to confuse the House or the public but he is being a little unfair when he makes comparisons about two matters which are not comparable.</P>

      <P>Under section 7 of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940 local authorities are empowered to serve a fire precautions notice on the proprietor of a potentially dangerous building requiring him to refrain from using the building or a specified part of it for any purpose specified in the notice either absolutely or until specified precautions are taken to the satisfaction of the local authority.  There is provision for an appeal within fourteen days to the District Court which may confirm, modify or annul a notice.  No appeal lies from a decision of the District Court.  A fire precautions notice does not take effect until after fourteen days have elapsed or until an appeal to the District Court is decided.</P>
      <P>There may also be cases in which the powers available to local authorities under other enactments would be appropriate, including in particular, the provisions of section 27 of the 1976 Planning Act under which the planning authority, or any other person, may apply to the High Court for an order to prohibit the continuance of an unauthorised development or unauthorised use.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying that local authorities cannot immediately close premises deemed to be unsafe by their fire officer under existing legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot immediately, no, but, as I have answered to the Deputy, they can give a fire notice and within 14 days, unless the notice is appealed through the District Court, then they close.  However, it would be fair to assume that the Deputy's question might have referred to a communication that I forwarded to the local authorities with regard to inspection rather than closure. Immediate inspection was what I <Col N="1923" /> understood.</P>

      <P>The existing powers are provided in section 7 of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

      <P>Arrangements should be made for immediate inspection of all potentially dangerous buildings, such as dance halls, discotheques, night clubs, and other places of public entertainment in which large numbers of people may be placed at risk in the event of fire.  Any premises which fails to meet requirements should also be closed using existing powers pending the taking of remedial measures.  Department circular letter will follow.</P>
      <P>That went to each county manager and assistant county manager.  I am sure the Deputy will join with me in congratulating the local authorities for the way they responded to that request.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I am delighted to <Col N="1924" /> be able to tell the House that, for example, in Kerry virtually all places pf public resort were inspected.  Some need a second inspection.  Last week 90 premises were inspected, over 50 stiff warning letters were issued and one fire precautions notice was served.  The situation is similar in Cork and in Kilkenny.  One hall has been closed by agreement.  The same applies in Galway.  In Mayo, 14 fire precautions notices were served and only four have been appealed.  In Wexford the situation is again the same, of the local authority responding and responding magnificently.  I take this opportunity today to thank the local authority staffs throughout the country for the work which they have done.</P>

In view of the fact that he has not announced any proposals to change the legislation and that quite a number of these premises still remain open, does the prospect of <Col N="1925" /> another disaster or danger still hover over this country if the state of places of public entertainment appears to be as dangerous or the people involved as remiss as these inspections have revealed?</P>

Pending the enactment of enabling legislation now being prepared, they have, however, been asked to have regard to the requirements of the regulations as if they had statutory backing, as have all other bodies concerned in their operation.  Local authorities have been requested in particular to have <Col N="1926" /> regard to the requirements of the draft binding regulations in dealing with applications for planning permission and bylaw approval and to obtain an indication from applicants of the extent to which the requirements of the draft regulations have been taken into account in the preparation of their proposals.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the proposals the Government have to implement the suggestions contained in the report on the fire services, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>As regards the report on the fire services which was published in July 1975, I would remind the Deputy that it comprised a majority and five minority reports, and that there were differences between the different reports on imporant issues in the area of personnel matters, including recruitment and reporting relationships.  While every effort has been and is being made to secure acceptable solutions on such issues through the relevant conciliation machinery, difficulties arising from conflicts between the different staff interests and aspirations have been encountered and have prevented the attainment of the progress sought.  But the matters will continue to be actively pursued through the conciliation machinery under which local authority personnel issues are dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the other recommendations in the majority report, action has also been taken on virtually all of them.  For example, arrangements were made in September 1976 for the carrying out by local authorities of the local reviews of the fire service as recommended in the report.  Capital investment in the fire service was significantly increased in 1978 and has been maintained at a high level since.  I recently announced the introduction of a 50 per cent subsidy on fire service capital investment.  The Fire Prevention Council were established in July 1978 to promote fire safety.  The central training programme has been considerably expanded to supplement local training and special attention has been given to breathing apparatus courses.  Guidelines were issued in 1977 for planning of retained fire stations and in 1980 for recruit training.  A pilot study on fire service telecommunications was completed last year and action has been initiated <Col N="1930" /> with a view to implementing the improvements it recommended.  Work is well advanced on the preparation of a number of other guidelines.</P>
    <P>One of the main recommendations of the report suggested that the fire-fighting provisions of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940 should be reviewed.  Various other recommendations also involved amendment of the law, including a number of those concerned with fire prevention.  Preparation of proposals for new fire service legislation has been proceeding for some time and I am glad to say that the general scheme of a Bill was recently approved by the Government and work on drafting it is now under way.  While I cannot give details of the Bill at this stage, the recommendations of the report have been taken into account in its preparation.</P>

      <P>In the course of his reply the Minister referred to courses in the use of breathing apparatus and also referred to retained stations.  Can the Minister state what steps, if any, he has taken to have courses in the use of breathing apparatus made available for the personnel in the retained stations in County Dublin as well as courses in the use of breathing apparatus for certain of the full-time personnel in the Dublin city fire service?</P>

      <P>There seems to be some misunderstanding about this question and some view that there is in some way a hold-up in the Department with regard to the training in the breathing apparatus. This is not so.  There was a recommendation in 1976, which was eventually cleared in 1978, and there is no outstanding sanction requested by Dublin corporation in my Department.  I accept that <Col N="1931" /> there is some disagreement between Dublin Corporation and the county council.

In addition to the foregoing, staff in other sections of my Department are engaged part-time on work relating to fire safety.  For example, staff in the personnel area have overall responsibility for personnel aspects of the fire service; staff in the housing and planning areas have an input on such matters as building regulations, and technical officers have appropriate responsibilities on relevant engineering, architectural and planning aspects of fire safety.</P>

I answered questions yesterday with regard to the extension to the handicapped and some arrangements that I am making there for improvements at the polling stations.

I feel strongly about it, as do many of our exporters who would be out of the country for a general election and as do many commercial travellers who are down the country on business at a general election. If I was to extend the postal voting to the numbers of people who request it, it would involve about one-fifth of the people on the live register and, with the proportional representation system we operate, any abuse of the system would have a major impact on the results of the election.</P>

Would the Minister not concede that representations have been made often enough and, as this would not involve any more than 1,000 people at the most, would the Minister consider this matter and accede to this reasonable request especially as the facility is available to members of the armed forces in the Lebanon and to members of the Garda throughout the country?</P>

      <P>The gross provision for construction and improvement of public roads contained in the 1981 Public Capital Programme is £60 million which is offset by receipts of £0.56 million from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund.  The full amount of £60 million has been provided for grant expenditure on road improvement works.  An additional sum of £20 million has been provided for grant expenditure on maintenance works, which does not come within the Public Capital Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On foot of that provision of £60 million I have allocated grants totalling £67.149 million to road authorities for improvement works, of which £37.697 million <Col N="1942" /> have been allocated for the national primary system; £9.632 million for the national secondary system and £11.186 millions for specific main, county, county borough, borough and urban roads.  A sum of £8.634 million is included in the block grants allocated to road authorities, which supplement the amount of their own resources applied to the maintenance and improvement of main and urban roads, and to the improvement of county roads.</P>
    <P>The tabular statement shows the grants I have allocated to each road authority for improvement works on the national primary system; the national secondary system; specific roads other than national roads; and the total of block grants allocated for works on roads other than national roads.  Improvement grants relate to particular road and bridge projects at particular locations and mileage of roads is accordingly not a factor in these allocations.</P>
    <P>While the full provision of £60 million will be paid to road authorities in the year in respect of expenditure incurred by them on grant-aided works, I am not in a position to anticipate the precise expenditure which will be incurred by each authority on particular works. Following is the statement:</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the number of taxi plates to be issued this year; and if he will make special provision for handicapped drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the question as to taxi plates relates to the issue of new taxi licences issued to the owners of such vehicles during the grant period which ends on 31 August 1981.  Each local authority concerned has the function of determining the number, if any, of new licences which the Garda Commissioner may grant in respect of a particular area during each grant period.  I understand that Limerick and Galway Corporations have determined that no new licences should be issued for these taximeter areas in the current grant period and that determinations have not yet been made for the Dublin and Cork taximeter areas.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, the granting of taxi licences is a function of the Garda Commissioner, subject to the limit decided by the relevant local authority as to the number of new licences which may be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The holder of the taxi licence is not necessarily the driver.  The commissioner is also responsible for granting licences to drive small public service vehicles, including taxis and, before doing so, he must be satisfied that the applicant is a fit and proper person to drive a small public service vehicle.  The driver of a taxi, as a public service vehicle, is statutorily obliged to carry out certain duties.  These duties include giving reasonable assistance in the loading, unloading, and carriage of luggage, taking all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of persons, including handicapped persons, in, on, entering, or alighting from the taxi, and giving all reasonable assistance to <Col N="1949" /> any person having authority to examine the vehicle.  I have no proposals to modify the standard of service which is necessarily required from drivers of public service vehicles in the interests of safety and service to passengers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware that many areas of the west, particularly those bordering on official Gaeltacht areas, are discriminated against in relation to assistance for improvements in infrastructural facilities in the area of roads, houses, etc.; and if he has any proposals to improve this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Gaeltacht areas receive specially favourable treatment in respect of new house and house improvement grants, local authority house purchase and improvement loans, roads and sanitary services.  Certain non-Gaeltacht islands off the west coast are also favoured as regards new house and house improvement grants and loans.  It is not correct to suggest that areas bordering on Gaeltacht areas are discriminated against in regard to assistance for infrastructural facilities relative to any other non-Gaeltacht areas of the country and consequently the question of altering the present arrangements does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there is a significant difference in the level of facilities provided in regions bordering official Gaeltacht areas?  Does he consider it is just that, because an incentive is offered to retain the language, a higher level of grant should be given in the official Gaeltacht areas than in the areas bordering the official Gaeltacht areas where the geography of the terrain is exactly the same?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Gaeltacht areas a higher rate of grant is given especially for new house and house improvement grants and loans in order to make life easier and to encourage people to live in those areas.  I do not think they are discriminated against in any way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>For instance, in the Ballycroy area in Mayo, which is not in the Gaeltacht, there is a very significant difference in the road structures as against those in the Gaeltacht areas officially bordering it.  That is entirely due to the level of assistance given for carrying out improvements within the Gaeltacht area. Does he think it is fair that that should be so because of the incentive given to retain the language?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot make the whole country a Gaeltacht area.  Specific conditions are laid down to qualify as a Gaeltacht area.  I understand those areas are looked at occasionally and then the Gaeltacht areas are determined.  How far would the Deputy suggest we should expand those areas?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I moved the adjournment of this debate last week I was referring to the general conditions in Leinster House.  I complimented those involved on the good features that exist here and I complained about the changes that are needed.  We in Fine Gael find it hard to get the necessary telephone extensions on request from whatever section is supposed to deal with this matter. Due to some rearrangement of the staff that is taking place at present in our rooms and in the rooms on the second floor of the old building a request was made for more power points but there is some delay in providing them.  The Minister of State should investigate those <Col N="1982" /> matters and have them attended to.  I am of the opinion that the general condition and cleanliness of the House should be attended to.  Some of the facilities opened here recently, such as the bar, were left unfinished.  In the bar a radiator is propped up and is not connected while another radiator is still in the condition it was when delivered to Leinster House by the supplier.  The person responsible should attend to these matters.  This House, the home of the national parliament, should in general have a better standard of cleanliness than at present.  I hope this matter is looked into.</P>
      <P>I am particularly interested in the question of arterial drainage.  It seems that the Government do not have a commitment in that direction because the amount of money being spent on one aspect or another of arterial drainage or on cost-benefit analyses or surveys has not increased to keep pace with inflation.  In fact, the amount has been reduced somewhat. I note that in 1980 £105,000 was provided for arterial drainage surveys and that this year it is proposed to spend £110,000.  In 1980 £95,000 was spent on comprehensive drainage surveys, including cost-benefit analysis and cost-benefit investigation, and this year it is proposed to spend £100,000.  The scene is the same in relation to arterial construction work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister of State is aware, over two years ago we got a package of £42 million from the EEC and it was decided then that £28 million would be spent on field drainage with the remaining £14 million being spent on arterial drainage.  It was also stated at the time that every pound we spent on those schemes &mdash; we are not too concerned with the £28 million now because field drainage comes under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture &mdash; would be matched pound for pound by the Government.  I should like to know where the £14 million was spent or how much of it has been spent to date?  Did we back it pound for pound? When the scheme was announced the people of Galway complained that not one shilling that was allocated for arterial drainage would be spent in that county. We are also under the impression that that money is not being backed pound <Col N="1983" /> for pound.  I would not totally rely on what we get from the EEC.  As far as arterial drainage is concerned we should have a special allocation annually of about £20 million.</P>
    <P>It is hard to identify who is responsible for the running of the Office of Public Works.  If it is being run by the commissioners I am not happy that it is being run in a proper fashion.  The Minister of State should introduce a certain amount of imagination and his own thinking into the working of the Office of Public Works in relation to arterial drainage.  I cannot say that that was done by his predecessor. Have the Government a commitment or a will - they must also have the political conviction - to carry out arterial drainage schemes?  I am a farmer from an agricultural area where an extensive arterial drainage extension was carried out and I am in a position to state that the benefits from such work are enormous.  If we are concerned to increase agricultural production here the natural thing to do would be to remove the water from our land.  If that is done those whose land was flooded will be in a position to avail of the other grants available.  If the arterial drainage scheme is not carried out it will not be possible for the farming community to avail of the field drainage grants.</P>
    <P>It was represented to us in the House, and reported in the newspapers by Deputies Geoghegan-Quinn and Hussey and by every Minister or Minister of State west of the Shannon, from west Cork to Donegal, the great work the promised £300 million would do for our infrastructures and so forth.  We were told that some of it would be devoted to arterial drainage and that the work would start on 1 January this year.  We do not know where that money is going to go and unless we have a definite programme to carry out drainage work close to all our rivers, big and small, a lot of the money we are supposed to be getting from the EEC will go towards field drainage.  Even if we had an announcement to the effect that the money was on the way, we could think in terms of spending it, though I suspect that a large portion of it will be diverted towards farm drainage.  However, <Col N="1984" /> if the Office of Public Works fail to do the groundwork in advance, the farmers will not be in a position to avail of this money.</P>
    <P>Because of the size of the Estimate for this office &mdash; almost £68 million &mdash; I suggest that a Minister of State from some other Department be appointed to the office in addition to the one there already and that this additional Minister be made responsible for arterial drainage and for drainage generally.  Indeed, I would go further and suggest that that drainage which is undertaken by local authorities under local improvement schemes be transferred to a section of the Office of Public Works which, if my suggestion were to be adopted, would be dealing exclusively with drainage while the other section of the office would deal with such matters as buildings, the restoration of ancient monuments, archeological finds and so on.  I might mention that I was pleased to hear today on the news bulletin that there has been a further find of a large number of objects at Derrynaflan. It would be much more satisfactory for the office to be divided into two parts as I have outlined with, of course, that part dealing with drainage working in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture where necessary.</P>
    <P>So far as drainage is concerned, this whole area could usefully be categorised in three parts.  Basically the three categories involved might be one dealing with schemes of 100,000 acres or more, another dealing with schemes of between 50,000 acres and 100,000 acres, and yet another dealing with schemes of up to 50,000 acres and which would include those small schemes that now come within the ambit of the local authorities. I suggest also that a complete survey be carried out of the entire country with a view to ascertaining the needs within each of the three such categories.  The primary necessity is to identify the problem. The Office of Public Works seem to be reluctant to do this, but it is necessary that it be done.  It is possible that at some stage in the future we will receive a flush of money from the EEC.  It is possible also that with a change of Government here, with a new Government who would <Col N="1985" /> have a definite policy, we could get back to the days when there were a few pounds to spend.  Perhaps we will be granted a specific sum of money from the EEC for the specific purpose of drainage, but if such money were to come our way now we would not be in a position to use it because of the failure of the Office of Public Works to do the basic groundwork. If the Minister of State were to do little else during his tenure of office but to ensure that this groundwork is carried out and that drainage is divided into the categories I have mentioned, he would be doing a good day's work.</P>
    <P>At least the Minister should try to do something in this whole area of drainage during his time in office instead of allowing the Office of Public Works to continue in their happy-go-lucky way without having any particular commitment to arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>I hope that, when replying, the Minister will be able to tell me how much of the £14 million we received from the EEC has been spent on arterial drainage, in what areas it has been spent and whether we backed it pound for pound.  The amount being spent in this area decreases each year in real terms.  I suspect that we are not living up to the conditions under which the £14 million was paid to us.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of specific items in the sphere of arterial drainage on which I should like to comment.  Generally speaking, the arrangement whereby maintenance work is undertaken by the Office of Public Works but paid for by the local authorities has been satisfactory, though there are a few exceptions in this regard.  Before Christmas I referred here to the condition of the Cregg river at Corrandula, County Galway. This river is very much silted up with the result that the arterial drainage scheme that was undertaken there in the past is not as effective as it would be otherwise.  I was promised by the Office of Public Works that maintenance work on the river would be undertaken in 1980 but that has not happened.  This work would involve cutting weeds and generally clearing away the silt.  But it was not done.  I talked about it in the House last year.  I talked about it when the Supplementary <Col N="1986" /> Estimate was introduced before Christmas and no effort has been made since.  I can appreciate that this is a difficult time to carry out maintenance on that river.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem in the Tuam area regarding a tributary of the Clare known as the Nanny.  Work was done on part of the Nanny under the Connaught-Clare drainage scheme and stopped in about 1960 for the simple reason that the Nanny was and is being used as a water supply for the town of Tuam. But between the Office of Public Works and Galway County Council we are getting nowhere.  Much effort has been made by politicians of all parties to get the Office of Public Works and Galway County Council together on this matter with a view to draining the river.  Years ago money was allocated for it.  I assume that it was spent in another direction since the Nanny could not be drained at the time.  The people in that area are getting very militant because so many years have gone by.  This drainage scheme has been closed down since October 1964; that is a long long time and still we are getting no co-operation between the Office of Public Works and Galway County Council with a view to completing the drainage of the River Nanny.  I would ask the Minister of State to pay some attention to what I am saying and to get something done about it this year.</P>
    <P>Since I came into this House I have contributed to this debate in one way or another.  I have talked about the Dunkellin and I am going to talk about it again now.  As far back as 1972, almost nine years ago, the then Parliamentary Secretary in charge of that office, the late Deputy Lemass, put it in writing that work would start later that year.  This is 1981 and nothing has happened yet.  We were informed in 1980 that there was a lack of engineering staff in the Office of Public Works.  Generally people make a laugh out of the Office of Public Works. Whether it was the commissioners or the present occupant of the post who made that statement, they are only making a laugh of themselves by saying something like that.  These are basically two small rivers with a total catchment area of <Col N="1987" /> 91,000 acres, about 14,500 acres of which are severely flooded.  The average farm size in the area is about 35 acres and the number of farmers is 2,700.  Perhaps the Minister might tell me what effort has been made since we last talked about the Dunkellin with a view to recruiting the necessary staff with the necessary expertise to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of the Dunkellin.  I listened to the Minister recently here in this House and there was an announcement that we were getting about £400,000 from the EEC for cost benefit analysis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know he should not but I do not mind the interruptions if I can get some information from him and that is a difficult thing to do.  There was talk about this £400,000.  I cannot see anything wrong with spending a certain amount of that on a cost benefit analysis of the Dunkellin.  But the Minister cannot sell this dummy forever.  He cannot play the three card trick forever as far as the Dunkellin is concerned.  The Government either have the political will to do <Col N="1988" /> it or they have not and it is quite obvious that they have not.  The Minister might have a look at it and &mdash; wonders never cease to happen &mdash; he might do something about it.</P>
      <P>I will go on now to talk about the Shannon and this £400,000.  Did we request money from the EEC to survey a few rivers or was it specifically to survey the Shannon?  I would be inclined to think that it was specifically to survey the Shannon. I do not think the Government have the slightest notion of doing anything with the river Shannon but this is not a bad time to talk about it.  There are a few influential people in the Cabinet who started this off.  The present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Reynolds, started it when he made a statement in Longford to the effect that the time had come to do something with the river Shannon.  If it was after an election rather than in the run up to it those on the banks of the Shannon could, as far as the Minister was concerned, float down along it and he would wave them goodbye.  But it is different on the run up to an election and it is a good red herring to wave.  The promise made in the 1964 by-election in Roscommon was that the Shannon would be drained.  Of course Fianna Fáil could hardly have been expected to carry that out at that time because they did not win that by-election.  But if they had won the by-election, would they have carried it out?  They were still in office many years after that and nothing has been done about it.  I doubt if this £400,000 will ever materialise from the EEC.  Even if it did materialise I doubt if it would ever be spent on a survey of the Shannon because the Office of Public Works are spending quite a lot of money on the development of the Shannon as a tourist amenity.  If there was £400,000 for a survey of the Shannon and if, as a result of that survey it was found that it was feasible to drain the Shannon, surely when we do not have enough engineers to carry out a cost-benefit analysis on a small stream like the Dunkellin where are we going to get the personnel, suddenly, to carry out a survey of the River Shannon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely if the engineers are not available for the Dunkellin they will not suddenly <Col N="1989" /> become available for the Shannon?  I think that is a sensible question and perhaps the Minister would get an opportunity to explain this to me.  You have them for the Shannon certainly because it suits Deputy Reynolds, Minister for Transport, to talk about the Shannon now in the run-up to an election which must be held before June 1982, so as to convince some people around that area that you will be doing something about it.  The Government could not care less if this job were never done and the Office of Public Works have no commitment to arterial drainage.  They have no notion of doing anything with the Shannon or with many other schemes but it is a useful gambit at present.</P>
    <P>In my capacity as representative of the Fine Gael point of view on the Office of Public Works I have visited Clare and West Cork, Longford and around that area and I found there is an immense amount of work in regard to arterial drainage in all these places that the Board of Works could undertake if they were prepared to do so.  There is the Claris river in Longford, the Scariff, the Inagh and many more in Clare.  There may be a change in the future but I doubt it very much.  This concerns myself; the Finney river was surveyed in connection with the Corrib-Mask-Robe drainage scheme and as a result of the cost-benefit analysis it was decided, according to a letter I have here, that the re-examination of the channel confirmed that conclusion of the scheme could not be justified because it was a very steep river, subject to floods and the survey showed only a small area of damaged lands.  There is a drainage scheme at present in progress there and it would require little effort on the part of the Office of Public Works and minimal expense to have some sort of drainage job done on the Finney river.  Perhaps as a result of what I have said here today the Minister will consider including it in his list and stop talking about the Shannon which he has no notion of doing.  He should spend £10,000 of this money on the Finney and that will satisfy the people in that area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1990" /> At Ballyconneely, Co. Galway, there are people living in a house adjoining a little river which drains Truska Lough into the Atlantic.  As a result of the water flowing past the house the foundations have been undermined.  The people there maintain that the Office of Public Works are responsible and I would ask the Minister to get them to have a look at it with a view to having something done pretty quickly.  I think the office are legally responsible and if they do not do something soon they may be held legally responsible for the consequences.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works deal with piers and harbours.  In part of the new constituency that I represent at present and hope to represent after the election there is a complete lack of commitment by the Office of Public Works along the coast of Connemara as regards piers and harbours.  There is need for dredging at Clifden particularly to remove the silt.  It is necessary to provide a jetty there both for tourism and for the fishing industry. The harbour is so bad at present that one could only get in something like a currach. Facilities have been promised at Cleggan Pier but to date nothing has happened apart from lock gates which were provided when another administration was in power.  There has been a large find of magnesium on Boffin Island and the local people think that Cleggan should be used when the mineral is brought to the mainland and they think the Office of Public Works should do something in that connection.</P>
    <P>There are also piers at Leenane, Rossroe, Renvyle, Ballinakill, Cleggan, Clifden and Roundstone all of which need dredging, Letterard, Carna, Kilkerrin and Lettermullen and right around to Rossaveal.  Works require to be carried out there as no money has been spent there for some time.  I have covered a lot of ground but if a certain amount of money could be spent on a few of these places it is very necessary that it should be done in the interests of fishing and tourism.  In some cases only slipways are required and perhaps a couple of pilot lights.  Ladders are available in some cases but they are totally unsafe as they are almost rusted through.  Some of the <Col N="1991" /> places I have mentioned are in the Gaeltacht and it is up to that Department to provide the moneys and up to the Office of Public Works to carry out the works. In Galway we thought that when we had a Minister for the Gaeltacht resident in the county we would be on the pig's back but we have found it more of a hindrance than a help to have that Deputy in the office she holds as Minister for the Gaeltacht. There seems to be less money spent in the Gaeltacht than ever before.</P>
    <P>There are many other things I should like to mention but time does not permit. I would ask the Minister to pay great attention to what I have said.  Finally I refer to the fact that we introduced a National Heritage Bill which was defeated because of Government opposition to it; it did not include this, that or the other thing.  That was in June 1980. The Minister then told me on behalf of the Government that they had their own National Heritage Bill which would be much better and it was ready and would come into operation soon.  How much further has the Minister got with that National Heritage Bill or with legislation in that area?  Our Bill was not a bad one. The Minister could not find very much wrong with it except that it lacked a few things that only Fianna Fáil could put into it.  With the whole Civil Service at his command what is holding up the Minister's own Bill which was almost ready last June?  We are still waiting to see it on the Statute Book.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. McEllistrim)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies who contributed to this debate for their wide-ranging and in the main constructive comments. Arterial drainage figured largely in these comments and all the schemes mentioned, namely, the Shannon, Dunkellin, Suck, Little Brosna, Nore, Barrow and Blackwater rivers, the Laune, Fergus, the Inagh, and Scarriff are indicative of the scope of the problem of arterial drainage throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the views of the Deputies in regard to the importance of arterial drainage.  At present my office have three <Col N="1992" /> arterial drainage schemes in progress and I hope before the end of the year to have two further schemes &mdash; the Boyle and the Bonet &mdash; commenced.  This will be one of the most extensive arterial drainage programmes in progress at any one time in the history of the State.  I might also add that I am making every effort to improve on this situation.  However, in the long run one must come back to priorities of staff and money.  At present staff is the bottleneck.  The Shannon not alone requires the assignment of large numbers of engineers and other staff by the Office of Public Works but the allocation of staff by the ESB and An Foras Talúntais, who have agreed to co-operate in this survey.</P>
    <P>We have been trying continuously over the past two years to recruit engineers and the position at present is more hopeful than for some time past.  I am sure the Shannon survey will start this year.  As Deputy Donnellan realises, we got a £400,000 grant this year, 40 per cent of the cost, and we will have to meet 60 per cent of the cost.  Two years ago my Department made a request to the EEC for this grant.  I should like to inform the House that the Minister for Finance has sanctioned the cost of the survey of the Shannon and I am sure Deputy Donnellan and his colleagues will welcome that.</P>

      <P>Deputy Callanan and Deputy Donnellan mentioned the problem of the drainage of the Dunkellin river.  The design of a drainage scheme for this river is in hands at present and the Office of Public Works are continuing discussions with interested parties in regard to the environmental aspects of this river.  Once the design has been completed a cost-benefit analysis will have to be carried out and the remaining statutory requirements of the Arterial Drainage Acts will have to be complied with. Deputies may be assured that every effort will be made, having regard to other commitments, to bring the matter to a conclusion as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised several points to which I would like to refer &mdash; the deposition of spoil, cutting of trees, loss of water to wells and the pegging of drains. Generally speaking every effort is made to deposit spoil as equitably as possible between holdings.  In this context it has <Col N="1994" /> become practice to have prior consultation with the landowners involved so that where possible amicable arrangements can be reached.  Machines usually operate from the bank which causes the least disruption and minimum interference with permanent features such as hedgerows, amenity land, tillage land and so on.  Very few mature trees are cut down during drainage works.  Every effort is made to save them.  They are removed only where necessary, that is, where they occur close to the banks of the channels which are to be deepened or widened.</P>
    <P>Regarding loss of water to wells, the commissioners cannot accept liability for the behaviour of wells fed from unknown, undefined underground sources.  They are not unmindful of the hardship caused by loss of water and they are at present reviewing their responsibility for such loss where such might be attributable to their works.  Kilmainham village is a case in point and calls for special attention.  Very generous assistance has been offered to the residents and the problem here is well on the way towards a satisfactory solution in negotiation with the residents.</P>
    <P>It is incorrect to assume that because a drain has been pegged it must be included in a scheme.  All tributaries in a catchment which appear economic to drain are pegged and surveyed.  They are subsequently examined in the course of preparing the scheme and, if found uneconomic when comparing the cost of works with the expected benefit, are omitted from the scheme as exhibited. Landowners should check the drains included in a scheme at the time of exhibition. Extra drains that may not have been pegged are sometimes included in a scheme at a later stage on the presentation of landowners if following examination they are found to be economic.</P>
    <P>In the Mornington area of the Boyne scheme a particular problem has arisen in that the complex of drains serving the area was designed to give relief from flooding to agricultural land.  Since design, extensive housing development has taken place and the commissioners must of necessity re-examine their proposals for the area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1995" /> Regarding Navan the best that can be done will be done for the town but, as the Deputy said, total immunity from flooding cannot be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the flooding problem at Duleek from the River Nanny but the commissioners have no power to carry out works of a piecemeal nature to relieve flooding in a particular area of a catchment. In common with almost every other catchment in the country, many requests have been received for the advancement of the Nanny in the priority list on which the national arterial drainage programme is based.  However it must await its turn for treatment in the programme.  Any change in the lists, for whatever reason, involving the advancing of some schemes at the expense of the displacement of others would give rise to strong protest from areas adversely affected by the change.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also raised the subject of compensation and I should like to outline what is involved in the processing of a claim.  A scheme for compensation for loss or damage as a result of drainage works can be processed only when works on the holding in question have been completed and a proper assessment of both damage and benefit can be made. The processing of a claim often involves the preparation of detailed engineering and valuation reports and lengthy negotiations. Whilst every effort is made to settle each case as expeditiously and amicably as possible delays can occur. That is where negotiations break down. If the Deputy can provide details of the delays he mentioned in his speech I will be more than happy to have the matters investigated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty raised several matters, among them the question of fishery harbours.  The policy in this regard is a matter for the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.  An internationally recognised expert carried out a survey of the whole coast and recommended major fishery harbours at five centres, namely, Killybegs. County Donegal, Rossaveal. County Galway, Castletownbere, County Cork.  Dunmore East, County Waterford, and Howth, County Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1996" /> The Office of Public Works were asked to undertake the provision of these harbours and this programme is now nearing completion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister concludes the Deputy will be entitled to ask a few brief questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>A programme of improvement works to smaller landing places throughout the whole coastline is under way and this is also being carried out in accordance with priorities laid down by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.</P>
      <P>A suggestion that the cost of maintenance of arterial drainage and coast protection works be a State charge was also made by Deputy Hegarty.  This is a matter of Government policy as it would involve changing the law and as such it does not come within the ambit of an Estimate discussion.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary also spoke about progress on the Maharees coast protection scheme.  I am glad to say that Kerry County Council have issued a satisfactory prohibition order.  The Commissioners of Public Works are at present processing the council's application and Deputy O'Leary may be assured that as long as I am in the Office of Public Works it will be processed as speedily as possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hegarty also referred to the privacy of people using social welfare offices and Deputy Keating mentioned conditions in employment exchanges where people must queue to do their business.  Basically this is a matter for the Department of Social Welfare but I assure Deputies that I will co-operate with the Department in any provision they propose for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the matter of access to public buildings for disabled persons.  Deputy Callanan also spoke in this context.  I appreciate fully the need <Col N="1997" /> for access to public buildings by the disabled and works to provide such access are undertaken by the OPW and are going on continually.  These works are carried out in conjunction with other minor maintenance works as they become necessary.  In addition, when new buildings are being planned provision is made for access by the disabled.</P>
    <P>The matter of works needed at schools and Garda stations was dealt with by several Deputies.  When a large number of buildings need attention the problem must be tackled in an orderly way by way of a planned programme.  The minor works needed at schools and Garda stations are being dealt with in this way and good progress is being made.</P>
    <P>Specific mention was made by Deputies Enright and Keegan of Balnahown national school.  A contract for the school was placed in December 1980.  Progress is satisfactory and work should be completed towards the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keegan also mentioned Rochfortbridge national school.  I am glad to say that it is hoped to invite tenders for the extension of this school within the next week.  Deputy O'Leary expressed the wish to have speedy progress regarding Ballyferriter national school in County Kerry.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a contract has just been placed for the new school.</P>
    <P>With regard to Killarney Garda Station, which was also mentioned by Deputy O'Leary, the Commissioners of Public Works have not as yet secured a suitable site.  They are, however, looking at a few properties.  Deputy Keegan mentioned Mullingar Garda Station and I must disagree with him regarding the state of the building.  It is in good repair generally and any minor works required will be carried out from time to time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keegan expressed the opinion that pre-fabricated classrooms might constitute a fire hazard.  This is not the case. Such classrooms conform to the recommendations of the OPW fire officer and comply with requirements of local authorities.  The structures have specified fire resistance.  The roof, walls and ceilings are made to acceptable safety standards. There are emergency exit doors in <Col N="1998" /> addition to the normal doors.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright suggested that shelters should be provided in national schools. The Department of Education recently established a committee to review planning criteria for national schools.  The OPW will be represented on that committee and I shall ask our representatives to put before the committee the views expressed by Deputy Enright.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned the storage of museum articles in Daingean.  It is primarily a matter for the Department of Education to decide if they wish to put the articles on display to the public but the Deputy's suggestion will be brought to their attention.</P>
    <P>The question of Garda accommodation was raised by several Deputies.  The various provisions in the Estimates for new accommodation and improvements to existing stations amount to approximately £3 million.  This is an indication of the urgency with which the problem is being tackled.</P>
    <P>The Garda building programme is an ongoing one and considerable progress has been made in the past few years in replacing sub-standard accommodation. It is expected that at least a dozen new stations will be completed this year and many more are at various stages from contract works in progress to detailed planning.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully spoke of the condition of Garda stations generally and of Drogheda Garda Station in particular.  I do not accept that Garda stations in County Meath are in a poor state of repair.  Like any other building in continuous use a Garda station will from time to time need attention.  Repairs and maintenance works are carried out without undue delay once they come to notice.  On this point let me say again that housekeeping and ordinary cleaning of Garda stations, and indeed of most State buildings, is not a matter for the Office of Public Works, but for the occupants of those buildings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating spoke of inefficient management of public buildings.  I take it that what he had in mind was the day-to-day use of the buildings and the organisation of the activities of the occupants <Col N="1999" /> including control of lighting and conservation of energy use.  Likewise, this is for the Departments concerned.  When the Office of Public Works provide accommodation for a Department they hand it over fitted out, furnished and appointed in the most economical way to meet the particular needs of the Department and the building is maintained thereafter in accordance with an ordinary programme.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have no responsibility for the housing of military personnel or prison officers.</P>
    <P>To get back to Drogheda Garda Station which Deputy Tully mentioned, the building is a large four-storey house on a restricted site in the centre of the town. It is not a bad building but it is too small for the station party now assigned to it. For that reason the Office of Public Works are looking for a suitable site for a new, larger building.  A number of options in this matter have recently been brought to the attention of the Garda and I am hopeful that a solution to the problem is not too far away.  As I said, the existing building is not a bad one but it is too small.  Extra office space has been provided in two prefabricated buildings at the rear of the station and for several weeks now a contractor has been working in the main building adapting and rearranging the space available to provide toilets and other facilities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully alleged delays in dealing with national schools schemes in County Meath.  I find that of the three cases he mentioned Kilcloone is progressing satisfactorily. Bills of quantities are being prepared with a view to inviting tenders. With regard to Duleek school, the commissioners have not yet got a satisfactory scheme from the school authority's architect. The commissioners expect to settle a scheme for car parking at Ratoath school in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>Irish materials are used in Office of Public Works contracts to the full extent compatible with EEC regulations and contract procedure.  With regard to the imported soft floor covering used in national schools, this material has qualities of endurance and washability at a very attractive price which make it particularly <Col N="2000" /> suitable for use in schools.  Every effort is being made to encourage the marketing of an Irish-made product which will meet the specialised needs of schools at a competitive price.  The Office of Public Works would, of course, much prefer to use home-made material.</P>
    <P>With regard to the former Garda station in Navan, the Office of Public Works have put certain proposals to the local authority which they hope will secure the future of this building.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the need for extra accommodation for Oireachtas Members.  Arrangements have been made to provide new premises for the College of Art and their existing space is becoming available according as they move out.  No time will be lost is making that space ready as an extension to Leinster House and this should solve many of the problems of which Deputies have complained.</P>
    <P>Deputies Keating and Donnellan raised the question of heating in Leinster House.  There have been complaints about heating in the House.  The heating system is constantly monitored and every effort is made to maintain suitable temperatures in all parts of the House.  I would ask that when complaints arise they would be chanelled through the Captain of the Guard.  The Office of Public Works' staff will be put on notice and can attend to particular problems as they arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would pay the Minister to change the system rather than leave the present system in operation.  It is continuously going wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>We are doing our best and any complaints should be reported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor spoke of the Burren area.  We still have problems in acquiring enough land to comprise a viable integral area for a national park in the area of the Burren which we have selected.  However, our efforts are still continuing.  In anticipation of final success we are in the process of recruiting staff for the park. The Burren is a very sensitive area and to preserve and interpret it so that visitors <Col N="2001" /> may obtain the greatest possible benefit from a visit to it requires very careful consideration.  The first task of the personnel appointed will be to study carefully this problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell raised the matter of Gael Scoil Inse Choir who are seeking a site for a new school in the Phoenix Park extension.  Whenever the Office of Public Works acquire or hold property as an amenity or for recreation purposes they are inundated with requests for plots and sites for various purposes.  This applies not alone to Dublin but is a countrywide phenomenon.  There is always tremendous pressure and the argument is that the purpose in mind is more desirable than the proposals of the Office of Public Works.  A consistent feature also is that no other site is available.</P>
    <P>A decision was reached many years ago that where the Office of Public Works had a property for amenity purposes they would not, except in very exceptional circumstances, release any portion for any other purpose.  This still holds and in the circumstances I regret that I cannot see my way to facilitate Gael Scoil Inse Choir.  As far as I know, Dublin Corporation have given some of their land as a site.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised several other issues in regard to the Phoenix Park.  He suggested the provision of tennis courts, bowling facilities, basketball courts, swimming pools and so on.  There has been considerable pressure over the last 30 to 40 years for the provision of such facilities but they have been uniformly refused.  The attraction of the Phoenix Park is the wide open spaces and the extensive vistas for which it is internationally renowned.  This is the great appeal for the vast majority of the people from Dublin and indeed visitors generally. The Office of Public Works wish to maintain this policy and to present the natural features of the park so that visitors may derive the greatest possible pleasure from them.  All the OPW's current plans are designed to that end.  The new information centre and car park at Knockmaroon is just one example of this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell also referred to the <Col N="2002" /> future of the Phoenix Park extension. When Dublin Corporation's road plans, which affect the area, have been finalised the OPW propose to prepare an overall plan for the more effective use of the balance of the property as an amenity. They will be happy to consider the views of Dublin Corporation, the various interested sports organisations and an Bord Fáilte in regard to such a plan and to receive their co-operation in carrying it out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating mentioned the condition of the Papal Cross.  If the Deputy had attended a recent press conference to which he was invited he would be aware that consultants were commissioned to prepare plans and contract documents for a scheme of works necessary to render the cross safe and suitable for retention.  These include the mounding of the base of the cross to the dimension of the temporary altar which was erected for the Papal Mass, the painting of the cross and the erection of a suitably inscribed plaque.  The contract documents are almost ready and tenders will be invited for the work within the next few weeks.  The scheme should then be completed before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>With regard to traffic control in the Phoenix Park, I am glad to say that in order to reduce and control the speed of traffic in the park a temporary roundabout is to be erected on the main roadway at the Phoenix Cross, and subject to this proving satisfactory, permanent roundabouts will be erected on the three junctions on the main road, that is, Mountjoy Cross, Phoenix Cross and Gough Cross.  The Commissioners of Public Works have asked Dublin Corporation to advise on the most suitable design for the temporary roundabout at the Phoenix Cross.  The erection of this roundabout will also involve the provision of road lighting by electricity in the vicinity of the roundabout.  When the temporary roundabout is erected and when some working experience has been gained of its operation I will arrange for the commissioners to examine the desirability of providing road markings as necessary. The provision of &ldquo;ramps&rdquo; could also be considered at that time but these <Col N="2003" /> would present practical and legal difficulties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating referred to the provision of shelters for the gardaí on duty at the entrance to Leinster House.  Plans which were drawn up for approval by the various interested bodies including the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the local authority were cleared finally on the 14 January 1981.  The Deputy will have noticed that work on the shelter at the Kildare Street entrance is in progress and the shelter for the Merrion Street entrance is being fabricated by the manufacturer and will be erected as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Tully's comments about tax deductions from the wages of employers of the Office of Public Works in Meath, all OPW employees in Meath are headquartered in Trim and there have been no complaints to the OPW from any of them about their deductions. As the Deputy should know, when persons commence employment in the OPW, if the persons do not present tax-free allowance forms or P45s the OPW are required to notify the Revenue Commissioners of their commencement in employment.  The OPW must then await details of the tax-free allowances from the Revenue Commissioners.  In the meantime they are required by the Revenue Commissioners to deduct tax at an emergency rate.  It is then a matter for the persons concerned to obtain any refunds from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Tully provides details of any individual cases in which he has received complaints.  I will be happy to investigate them.</P>
    <P>I would again like to thank Deputies for their contributions.  Deputies will appreciate that it is not possible for me to reply to every point raised in the debate.  They may be assured, however, that all of the points will receive consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the proposed closure of Blue Bell Factory, Ballyhaunis &mdash; Mayo, of which Ballyhaunis is a part, has suffered very badly over the past 12 months. Unemployment there has reached a critical stage.  Roughly 12 per cent of the workforce in the county is now unemployed and the rate of unemployment over the past 12 months is somewhere in the region of 21 per cent, which is nearly twice the national average.  If this rate of <Col N="2006" /> unemployment continues, we are hurtling towards a situation where we will have twice the national average unemployed. With the background of the closure of Mayco and of Travenol today, the imminent problems relating to Ceimicí Teo. at Corroy, Ballina, and the specific factory now under discussion, Blue Bell, the situation has reached enormous proportions and is totally unsatisfactory.  The situation must be brought to the notice of the House.  I am glad that the Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism is here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Being a Mayo man, I am sure he will react in the way in which a Mayo man is expected to react in these circumstances.  Blue Bell is part of a multi-national company which trades under the Wrangler name.  They make jeans and shirts.  I understand they have 16 manufacturing establishments in western Europe, 15 of which deal solely in jeans.  The only shirt manufacturing unit is in Ballyhaunis.  The situation in relation to the manufacturing of jeans is not at all satisfactory &mdash; we are told by Wrangler and Blue Bell that they are competing with a product from the Far East, specifically Hong Kong, which can be produced much cheaper than they can produce the product here.  That is so and while they may have incurred losses in jeans manufacturing in Galway, Loughrea and Roscrea, as far as I know they have not incurred losses in their shirt manufacturing unit in Ballyhaunis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 112 people employed in Ballyhaunis.  Production commenced in 1977.  The factory was officially opened two years ago by the Minister of State who is sitting opposite.  I would hate to think that the same Minister would now preside over its closure.  The statistics involved here in relation to the number of people employed provide food for thought.  Of the 112 people employed, roughly one-third of the total number are from Ballyhaunis and the surrounding countryside, <Col N="2007" /> within a 10-mile radius.  To put that in perspective, we are now losing one-third of the total number at work in that area.  That is worse even that the disastrous situation which confronted Limerick and this country with the departure of Ferenka and, to make matters worse still, those 112 represent about 90 per cent of the female labour force at work in Ballyhaunis. There is no other female employment outlet in that area.  If we are to get some idea of the serious impact of the closure of this factory in Ballyhaunis, we must look at it in this perspective.</P>
    <P>The other, purely commercial, aspect of it which must be referred to is the loss of money in circulation in that area &mdash; and here we are talking about a country town of a very progressive type and of a wage bill of something in the neighbourhood of £.5 million per annum &mdash; which will have a very serious impact on the commercial and business life of the town and the area.  As in cases like this, there are people who are hardest hit, the people who have entered into long-term repayment on things like house mortgages and property, totally dependent on a level of income to which they have become accustomed and given to understand that they had permanent employment in so far as any industrial employment can be permanent.  In other words, there was no talk of any financial difficulties or any problem in relation to industrial disputes.  In fact, the track record of the labour force there is second to none.  The production and productivity in this company have been stated by the parent company themselves to be as good as and better than those in most of their other manufacturing institutions.  At no time was there any quibble about productivity, industrial relations or any of the things that normally we hear referred to in relation to factories in trouble.  This unit was self-supporting, showed a profit and had a good track record in productivity, industrial relations, management and so forth and had no problems whatever. Yet the rug has been pulled from under their feet simply, I suppose, because of the multinational nature of this operation.  We are dealing with a very <Col N="2008" /> large company, possibly the biggest company in the world in that line of business, whose marketing sector is, I understand, based in Brussels and, from some inquiries I made, the production sector seems to have little contact with or knowledge of the activities of that marketing sector.</P>
    <P>The production capacity in this factory is, I understand, 10,000 shirts per week. Anyway they are at present producing 6,000 per week on a short-time basis, but, as I said before and wish to reiterate, both the workers and local management in that factory have been regarded by the company as second to none.  It is unfortunate that, in order to cut their losses in other areas and due to lack of productivity in Galway, Loughrea or Roscrea &mdash; I am quite sure that the people there are not to blame either &mdash; the factory in a place like Ballyhaunis, where profits are being shown, should be lumped in with the less productive and profitable areas of the company's activities and be victimised by Blue Bell.  It would seem that Blue Bell made a decision many miles from Ballyhaunis, Roscrea, Galway or Loughrea at senior management level to withdraw from this country.  The Minister, no doubt, will tell us that they have intimated that they will pay back any grants that have been given to them since they were set up.  I suggest that this is the least that could be expected of them, but it would seem that in this case &mdash; it is not the norm and thank God for that &mdash; the purely financial, fiscal approach has been applied without any mention of moral or social obligations to the workers or the community in which the company operated. It is unfortunate that this attitude should prevail.</P>
    <P>I understand that in this country we are proceeding through pretty rough waters at the moment and that economically we are not at the top of the league in so far as the economic future is concerned, but it is not the end of the world.  There is a future for industry in this country, be it put there by multinational sources or by indigenous Irish sources.  There is a bright future, and this company are taking the easy way out at this stage and showing a lack of perserverence and of the kind of understanding that one would expect <Col N="2009" /> from a company who have been dealing with labour forces in many countries down through the years, in that they ought to have seen themselves as having a social and moral obligation to these people.  That would seem not to be the case here.</P>
    <P>I will mention one aspect to which the Minister and the Government might put their minds.  It is how to redeem the situation in Ballyhaunis.  I am told that in the not too distant past this company did contract out work, shirt manufacturing, to other companies and allowed the facility of using the Wrangler name, in other words gave them a franchise.  This happened with a company in the North.  I understand, in the last year or two in relation to this company Blue Bell. Would it be possible to negotiate terms with them that would eventually grant the same concession to their plant in Ballyhaunis? After all, the building is owned by the IDA as are the plant and machinery within that building, as far as I am aware.  We have a trained, capable, enthusiastic and determined workforce who have been badly treated &mdash; I put it bluntly &mdash; by this company both in the short notice they got of the company's intentions and in the light of the production and productivity that they have shown themselves to be capable of in that plant since it was established four years ago.  It would be unfortunate if every avenue of approach was not tried at this stage to redeem that situation and retain that workforce and local management and to produce a commodity which they have shown expertise in producing in the past.  I would like to know if this suggested line of action could be explored further and I ask the Minister of State to comment on it in his reply if at all possible.</P>
    <P>Because this plant was grant-aided, there was a prohibition on the servicing of the domestic market with this product, the Wrangler shirt.  I am told that there is a dearth of this commodity on the Irish market.  Now that the company are releasing themselves from the obligations attaching to this grant aid, in the first instance, in the light of imports of shirts <Col N="2010" /> into this country would it be possible to continue this plant with Government aid? The Government should not stand back from the situation where a small amount of money is required.  At this stage it may be much easier to retain and protect jobs than to create them.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about an area where jobs are badly needed.  For the first time since the famine the population has shown an increase due to the efforts of industrialists and investors in providing jobs.  If the present trend continues we shall revert back to a stage where emigration will take over from where it left off 20 years ago, but with a difference that the escape routes and safety valves are no longer as open as they were.  The Birminghams, Londons and New Yorks of this world have enough troubles of their own and do not provide jobs any more.  Indeed, I would not accept that the people of Mayo should be forced to emigrate.  They are entitled to work in their own country, and preferably in their own county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I say that I share Deputy O'Toole's concern at these closures and proposed closures.  As the Deputy has so rightly pointed out, it is a very serious situation, particularly in Ballyhaunis, where this was the major industry in the town.  When it started it brought new hope to the area.  It is sad to see it closing after such a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Briefly, as the Deputy has said, this group have a total of 160 plants throughout the world, employing about 30,000 people.  They came to Galway and took over plants which were manufacturing jeans and which got into difficulties.  They then took over two new factories, one in Ballyhaunis and one in Loughrea.  Both of these started off making shirts.  Apparently, the operation was not profitable. They did not make any money.  Just as it appeared that they were at break-even point, the market in the product seemed to fall.  This meant that they had to switch to making jeans.  In competition with other companies, they then found themselves in trouble again.  The Government <Col N="2011" /> grants were capital grants of £104,000 and training grants of £242,000, making a total of £346,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this for Ballyhaunis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>No, this is for the overall operation.  This worked out at approximately £770 per job.</P>
      <P>At a meeting in Galway on 26 February last the vice-president of Blue Bell Europe told the IDA regional management that the Irish operation had lost $14.3 million since it began.  As the group were operating at the moment they had spare capacity in Europe and the parent body had decided to dispose of their Irish operations which were the least mature of their European plants.  They had decided to dispose of them as a going concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, briefly, is the troubled background to the closure itself.  We sympathise with the people in Ballyhaunis and with those who have lost their jobs.  It is well to record that we have an excellent workforce there.  During the time they were in the area there were no strikes or troubles of any kind and we have had already inquiries from people interested <Col N="2012" /> in having something established there. We cannot be any more specific at the moment on this, but the IDA are working as hard as they can to try to ensure that something positive will be done to restore the jobs there as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Ballyhaunis unit was a very successful one and this will influence any prospective industrialist who might contemplate taking over the factory there. We cannot be too rough on the company involved, because they are good customers of another product which is being made here.  It might not be to our advantage to have at this stage any bashing of the company.</P>
    <P>The position is as outlined.  The IDA and the Department will be doing their best to try to ensure that something is done as quickly as possible.  I am grateful to Deputy O'Toole for his suggestions in relation to some areas which might be explored regarding the keeping of jobs there.  We will pass these suggestions on to the IDA.  We hope to see something done quite quickly to restore confidence in the area and to bring back the jobs which have been lost.</P>

      <P>The interest rate charged by building societies and the Dublin Savings Bank on house purchase loans is 13.15 per cent at present.  The difference between repayments to the building societies and to the savings bank arises because mortgage interest is calculated by the societies for the whole year on the amount of capital outstanding at the beginning of the year and is calculated by the savings bank on the amount outstanding at the end of each month.  On this basis repayments to a building society in a full year on a house purchase loan of £20,000 at 13.15 per cent would amount to £2,872 and in the case of the savings bank to £2,836.80 &mdash; a difference of £35.20.  The method used by a building society to calculate interest on its loans is set out in both the rules of the society and in each mortgage contract.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 321 and 322 together.</P>
      <P>Housing authorities are entirely responsible for the maintenance and management of their rented housing estates.  I understand that Dungarvan Urban District Council are carrying out a scheme of repair and improvement works to houses in Cathal Brugha Place on a phased basis, financed from their own resources, including receipts from rents and a proportion of the proceeds of sales of council houses.</P>
      <P>I have been asked by the council to provide technical advice on the problems associated with these houses and arrangements are being made to have the houses inspected at an early date by one of my Department's housing inspectors.</P>
      <P>The question of the reception by me of a deputation from the council would, in the circumstances, best be deferred until the report of the inspector comes to hand, and I have advised the council to this effect.</P>

      <P>The design for this scheme has been approved by both my Department and Kerry County Council.  In view of the high cost of the scheme, however, the group have decided to await the introduction of the new grant structure under Regulation 1820/80/EEC which provides for the stimulation of agricultural development in the less-favoured areas of the West of Ireland, including County Kerry. Pursuant to the new regulation a programme has been submitted to the Commission and, if it is accepted, I hope to announce the implementation of an improved grant structure for group water schemes carried out within the framework of the approved programme.  I am hopeful that the proposals will be approved in the near future, particularly since I understand that any scheme commenced prior to EEC approval of the programme will not qualify for the grants under the western package.</P>
