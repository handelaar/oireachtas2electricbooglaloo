      <P>It has been the practice to regard details of security matters as confidential and I think it would be unwise to depart from that practice.</P>
      <P>Citizenship rights are included in the range of issues on which the British Prime Minister and I commissioned joint studies last December, in order to facilitate the special consideration of the totality of relationships within these islands to which we agreed to devote our next meeting.</P>
      <P>The general ambit of citizenship is set out in domestic and international law and is, I believe, well understood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the gross increase in staff numbers accredited to his Department since 1 November 1979; and the expression of that increase in percentage terms.</P>

    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the cost of salaries for the staff in his Department in the 12 month periods November 1979 and November 1980; and the increase expressed as a percentage.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The staff in my Department increased by 120 since 1 November 1979.  This is an increase of 226 per cent.  The salaries of the staff in the 12 month period ending November 1979 amounted to £345,400; for the period ending November 1980 the amount was £758,200.  The increase is 120 per cent.</P>
      <P>The increases are largely due to (i) the transfer of staff from the former Department of Economic Planning and Development (ii) the assumption by my Department of responsibility for the National Board for Science and Technology and for the messenger and cleaning service in the North Block of Government Buildings and (iii) the cost of salary increases under the first and second national understandings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy understands the situation.  The bulk of this increase comes from a re-organisation of the staff inside the Government service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the figures I have given the Deputy there is no additional recruitment to the Public Service.  It is simply a matter of transferring people from the responsibility of one Department to another, as in the case of the National Board for Science and Technology and the messenger and cleaning service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy Browne, would his answer suggest that not only have the staff of the late Department of Economic Planning and Development been transferred to his Department but the functions of that Department in their entirety, including the direction of the economy, also have been transferred to his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As I have already explained, the function of economic planning is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance and his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since they are not now doing the job they did in the former Department what is the Taoiseach's justification for retaining such a high level of staff if the functions they previously did have been transferred to another Department?  Is the charge not now accurately laid at you, Sir, that it is empire building if you strip them of their function but retain their personal service?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This may appear trivial but the Taoiseach took a personal decision in respect of a secretary for Deputy Blaney and myself in that he would not allow a secretary normally divided 3:1 to be re-allocated as 2:1.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On 23 December 1980 I announced that the proposed Irish zinc smelter at Ballylongford, County Kerry, will not be proceeded with for the present <Col N="27" /> due to low current and forecast zinc metal prices, the substantial overcapacity in the zinc smelting industry, the sensitivity of smelter operating economics to rising energy costs and other adverse factors. However, I indicated that these adverse conditions could change and that the IDA would continue to monitor the situation in the industry.  That continues to be the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that in their last election manifesto Fianna Fáil said they would certainly build a smelter because of the agreed enormous importance of such a smelter in the light of the great deposits that we have, the biggest mines in Europe?  Is it not a fact that, while there are transient price falls in the recession in relation to zinc, by the time a zinc-lead smelter is built prices will presumably have gone up again and we will be just about in time for the rise in prices?  In all the circumstances, does the Minister not agree that the decision made by Fianna Fáil in their manifesto was the correct one and that they should go ahead and carry out this enormously important undertaking on behalf of the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the references to the zinc smelter in the manifesto were correct in the light of the information then available.  The Deputy, however, although he has adverted to the falling prices of zinc, has not adverted to another very important aspect of this matter: the enormous increase in the cost of energy in recent years.  I am sure he is aware that energy is a very heavy part of the overhead costs of the zinc smelter.  On the basis of those two items alone the position has changed radically in recent years, I have made it clear that we have not ruled out the prospect of a zinc smelter in the future but that as of now it would be quite impossible to embark on a zinc smelter with any hope of an economic operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Two points arise out of the reply: is it not a fact that the Soviet proposal to build the zinc smelter was not proceeded with?  They would have been paid in zinc &mdash; I am sure the Minister is <Col N="28" /> aware of that.  This proposal was not pursued by the IDA.  Will the Minister say why this was so?  Secondly, in view of the real likelihood of our developing our oil resources, the question of energy &mdash; an important consideration &mdash; becomes much less important in the light of the prospect of our having our own supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take the second point first.  I agree with the Deputy it could become very important in the future but I must reiterate what I said to Deputy Horgan, namely, we do not yet have our own oil resources.  With regard to the Soviet proposal, that proposal was to provide technology and equipment, to train personnel and to build the smelter but not to own it or to take any equity in it.  It was discussed with representatives of the Soviet Union and it was pointed out to them that questions of construction and supply of equipment and the training of personnel were matters that would have to be determined in the first instance by the owners of the smelter and since that or the share-out of the ownership had not been decided, the Soviet proposal would have to await determination of that decision.  The Soviet representatives agreed with that proposition and in view of what has happened there has not been a decision on who should be the principals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil said they were <Col N="29" /> going to build a smelter in Kerry and they made a great play of this in their manifesto. Then they decided not to proceed with the matter.  If they were interested in building a smelter they would have built it close enough to the source of the ore so that it would have a better chance of making money.  If ore can be exported to the Continent and the existing smelters there are able to make a lot of money, particularly with regard to downstream industries, would the Minister not agree that the smelter should be started now so that eventually it can be put into operation if the price of ore goes higher, rather than just writing it off now and forgetting about it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, we have not written it off, but for the reasons outlined to Deputy Browne I cannot accept the proposition put forward by Deputy Tully.  I indicated I was somewhat mystified by what he said about a decisison by the Government that prevented the building of the smelter but I understand now what he meant from what he said later &mdash; fair play to the Deputy, he was making a constituency point and I recognise that.  With regard to the suggestion that I was passing a vote of no confidence in my Department because of the increasing price of energy, I must point out to the Deputy that 80 per cent of our energy is imported and we do not control the price.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>A Bill entitled the Turf Development Bill, 1980 was introduced in the House by way of the long and short titles on 17 December 1980 and the text of the Bill was circulated to Deputies on 24 January 1981.  I hope to take the remaining Stages of the Bill in this session of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes that funds be made available through my Department to enable Bord na Móna to pay grants to assist private bog development.  These grants will contribute to the cost of access roads, drainage and the purchase, hire or lease of turf cutting and other machinery. The Bill proposes that grants of up to 65 per cent of the cost may be approved in respect of bog development carried out by co-operatives and up to 45 per cent of the cost in other cases.</P>

      <P>That would be so but of course, we will be discussing this when discussing the Bill and I shall then be able to elaborate a little more on this.  Bord na Móna will have discretion in regard to the payment of these grants.  There will be certain conditions, one of which will be the approval by Bord na Móna of the plan for development and what is involved.  The query which the Deputy raised is one that will have to be taken into account.  What I meant to convey in response to the Deputy's original question was that it was not envisaged that there will be a limit to the overall size of bog in respect of which a grant may be made.  However, if there is a disproportion between the amount of grant and what would be achieved, that would be taken into account.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy when it is proposed to extend electrification to Clare Island, County Mayo; the cost involved; and the extra employment which it is estimated will be created in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the provision of electricity supply to Clare Island, County Mayo, requires the building of a substantial structure to house the generator and associated equipment and also the erection of a network of overhead lines to bring supply to the customers. The time taken to construct the <Col N="35" /> building will determine the date of supply to customers.  The design and specification have been completed and a consultant has been engaged to oversee completion of the building.  In normal circumstances the board would expect the building to be completed in six to nine months.  The earliest date possible for supply to customers would be October 1981 but this date cannot be regarded as other than an estimate based on the most favourable progress of construction.</P>
      <P>As the ESB are bearing the cost, the amount which will be involved is a matter for them.  During the construction period there would be short-term employment for persons from the locality but the board have informed me that it would be premature to estimate numbers at this time.  Additional long-term employment of a part-time nature will probably be available in the co-operative which is being formed to operate the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="36" /> for Energy if he will make a statement indicating the action he has taken, or proposes to take, to alleviate the immediate problems of the Limerick Gas Company; and whether it is proposed to connect Limerick with the Kinsale gas head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>An official press statement was issued on 21 January 1981 announcing that the Government had approved a package of measures to alleviate the serious financial difficulties of the Limerick Gas Company.  The following are the relevant details.</P>
      <P>The package will relieve the company's debt servicing burden by transferring certain of their borrowings to the Local Loans Fund and by a takeover by the State of the servicing of other borrowings. A component of this package is the approval by the Government of an increase of 25p per therm in the price of town gas in Limerick.  This increase is necessary to help to eliminate the company's financial deficits.  The remaining elements of the package provide for an annual subvention to the company by Limerick Corporation and a guarantee by Limerick Corporation that there will be no future significant increase in the company's deficits.  The company have been making losses since 1978.  Limerick Gas are also to seek naphtha feedstock at more stable prices from the Irish National Petroleum Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In approving the package of measures, the Government were conscious that the closure of Limerick Gas would result in an irreversible deterioration of the gas distribution system in Limerick which would obviate any prospects of supplying the Limerick region with Kinsale gas, should circumstances in the future be favourable towards such a project.  Bearing this in mind, in discussions with Limerick Corporation officials last July I indicated that if the package of measures was approved by the Government I would require Limerick Corporation not only to ensure no further increase in deficits but also to have an independent consultancy study carried out to see what economies were achievable within the Limerick Gas operation, to assess the-likely <Col N="37" /> market prospects over the longer term and to establish the viability, on the basis of the study, of a lay-on of natural gas.</P>
    <P>The necessary measures are being taken to implement the package as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise certain points.  Very serious problems beset Limerick Gas and there is no easy solution to them.  The measures which the Government propose to take and the other elements of the package are intended to give the company time to see if they can operate on a viable basis.  The feasibility of piping Kinsale gas to Limerick has yet to be evaluated.  This is contingent upon the outcome of the studies of the Cork-Dublin gas pipeline, as well as on developments in Limerick Gas.  In the meantime, the onus is on Limerick Gas and Limerick Corporation, of which the gas company is a department, to take whatever other measures may be necessary to keep the company operating efficiently. It is particularly important that further significant losses should not arise in Limerick Gas and the company are being pressed to put the independent consultancy in train as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for a comprehensive reply and, while acknowledging the aid that has been given to the Limerick Gas Company, as announced in the past week, I ask is the Minister fully aware of the fact that this recently announced package is merely a short-term solution to the problem? Could I have the assurance from the Minister looked for by the industrial, domestic and other consumers in the Limerick and mid-west region that the question of the piping of natural gas or Kinsale gas to Limerick would be actively considered? There is no other long-term solution to the need for a gas supply for Limerick and the very important industrialised mid-west region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware, and indicated in my reply to the question, that the package of measures announced by the Government constitutes a short-term approach to the problem.  Certainly we <Col N="38" /> never suggested that it constitutes anything else.  I have made it clear that there are certain steps which must be taken by Limerick Gas Company and Limerick Corporation in the short-term to try to increase the economic operation and the viability of Limerick Gas.</P>
      <P>As regards the supply of natural gas, I have indicated that this is dependent on, firstly, the pipeline from Cork to Dublin and the studies being carried out in connection with that and, secondly, on a further evaluation of the economics of supplying natural gas to Limerick.  I cannot anticipate the result of these but I can say that certainly the question of supplying natural gas to Limerick will be viewed sympathetically.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I misunderstood the gist of the Minister's answer.  In view of the time factor which is critical, would it not be preferable to do a parallel evaluation of the pipeline both from Cork to Dublin and with a branch-off to Limerick, rather than doing the Dublin-Cork one first and then looking at the question of the connection to Limerick?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

Deputies will appreciate that unless the Consolidation Bill becomes law before further Social Welfare legislation is initiated a number of amendments would have to be made to the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is fitting that I should take this opportunity to pay tribute to the way in which the members of the Joint Committee, Deputies and Senators, dealt with this Bill.  It was a very onerous task.  The Committee had six lengthy meetings at which each section of the Bill was considered in great detail.</P>
      <P>Some amendments were proposed in Committee and I was pleased to accept them as they were helpful suggestions which improved the clarity of the Bill. Other important matters were raised but, because of Standing Orders, these could not be incorporated in the Bill.  However, I undertake to have them considered further, and I hope to deal with most of them in legislation at an early date.</P>

However, I have difficulty in understanding the delay in introducing this Bill which was first introduced by Deputy Cluskey when he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare.  Deputy Cluskey did a lot of work on it.  It was not introduced by this Government during all the time that the present Taoiseach was Minister for Health and Social Welfare.  Having said that, I repeat my tribute to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, for the work he has put into the Bill.

      <P>I should like to raise a few matters on the Bill.  I understand that under Standing Orders I am not entitled to raise matters of detail.  However, in relation to section 197 I recall that the Minister gave us an indication that he would consider introducing an amendment in relation to the definition of the unmarried mother's allowance.  He has not done that and I should like to have his final view on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to appreciate that this Bill was prepared by the previous Government, that it was ready to be put through when an unfortunate event occurred in June 1977.  Because of the pressure of time under which the Committee were asked to work and the further <Col N="177" /> abridgement of time today, it is appropriate to note that three years passed since the change of Government and the then Minister for Social Welfare did not do anything whatsoever about the Bill.  Perhaps he was consolidating other matters during that time.</P>
    <P>The Bill consolidates in 312 sections matters dealing with many aspects of social welfare legislation going back many years and it would have been a considerable dereliction of duty on the part of the Government if the Bill, which largely had been finalised by the last Government, had not been put through the Oireachtas.  From that point of view, in the context of the delay of three years, a couple of things should be mentioned.  I was Chairman of the Committee and this is the only Bill dealt with by that Committee. It proves the value of the committee system because if we had been dealing with the Bill in this House it would have taken us three or four months to do the work the Committee did in such a short time.  I want to put that on record and to suggest to those concerned with the reform of the parliamentary system that the value of the committee system should not be lost sight of.</P>

      <P>I welcome the conclusion of this legislation.  It was difficult to understand why such a non-controversial Bill was neglected for so long by the then Minister for Social Welfare, the present Taoiseach.  When I introduced the Bill to the House it was welcomed by all sides and as far as I recall the present Taoiseach welcomed it on behalf of the then Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as this is consolidating legislation, it may not appear to the public to be very important and I do not imagine that there will be a rush to procure a copy of the Bill.  However, the Bill will be of considerable benefit to the public because it will help immeasurably the officials within the Department of Social Welfare and other Government officials <Col N="178" /> dealing with relevant aspects of social welfare legislation and it will also be of very considerable help to social workers and others dealing with their numerous fellow citizens who are deprived and in poverty.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record my sincere appreciation of the staff of the Department of Social Welfare.  This complex legislation was prepared very quickly indeed when one considers the volume of work involved and I could not fully express my appreciation of the way in which that work was tackled by the staff.  I can only say I regret that the same sense of urgency and commitment shown by the staff towards those who are dependent on social welfare was not imitated by the Minister for Social Welfare who took office immediately after Fianna Fáil's return to Government.</P>

The Bill was non-controversial and it was our job to consolidate legislation, not to change it, and this was pointed out very definitely by the chairman.

It augurs well for referring such pieces of legislation to Committees of the House and perhaps more use will be made of Committees in the future.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy Harte on his new appointment as spokesman on Social Welfare and I thank him for welcoming the Bill.  It will certainly make easier his task and that of anyone dealing with the code.  He raised the matter of the delay.  Anyone who worked on the Committee will recognise that it was a mammoth task and it was only by total concentration that it was completed in time.  Even at that it came very close to the Christmas Recess and I was very grateful that the Committee were prepared to facilitate me by concluding business immediately before Christmas.  This meant that the legislation could be completed before the budget.</P>
      <P>I should point out that my immediate predecessor introduced the pay-related social insurance scheme which had very major effects on legislation and administration. This delayed the progress of the Bill and some 250 amendments had to be fitted in because of changes which had taken place.</P>
      <P>The chairman raised the question of the unmarried mother and Deputy Harte raised the matter of definitions generally. It should be pointed out that the social welfare books used in those cases are social welfare allowance books and in order to avoid embarrassment the particular type of allowance is not defined.</P>

    <Title>Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals adopted in Bonn on the 23rd June, 1979, and signed, subject to ratification, on behalf of Ireland on 20th June, 1980.</P>
      <P>The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, known as the Bonn Convention, is an international convention designed to protect endangered species of wild animals, including birds, which migrate between States or cross national jurisdictional boundaries on the seas.  It was promoted by the Federal Republic of Germany in response to a resolution of the Action Plan adopted by the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm in 1972.  The final text of the convention was prepared in June 1979 at a two-week diplomatic conference in Bonn, attended by 77 States, including Ireland.  It was signed by the Irish Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany on 20 June 1980.  It will enter into force three months after it has been ratified by 15 States.  So far no State has ratified the convention.  The approval of the Dáil of the convention is necessary before Ireland can ratify it because it may eventually involve a charge on public funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The secretariat for the convention and its funding are to be provided for the first four years by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).  If after that time UNEP is not prepared to continue the service, alternative arrangements will have to be made by the conference of the parties, that is those states which have ratified or acceded to the convention.  It seems that the scale of <Col N="181" /> funding likely to find acceptance by them would be on the basis of United Nations contributions, which are based on GNP and population figures.  Any decision on funding would, however, require a unanimous vote at the conference of the parties. It is not possible at this stage to estimate what the Irish contribution might be.</P>
    <P>The aim of the convention is to protect endangered or threatened species of animals which migrate between different States or cross national jurisdiction boundaries on the seas.  It provides for measures to control the taking of these species, for protection and management plans, the maintenance of networks of suitable habitats and the prevention, reduction or control of discharges of substances harmful to migratory species.</P>
    <P>The migratory species with which Ireland is concerned are wild birds and whale species, including dolphins and porpoises.  Existing legislation embodied in the Wildlife Act, 1976 and the Whale Fisheries Act, 1937 is adequate to enable Ireland to implement the convention. The Wildlife Act protects all wild birds and whales within a three-mile limit.  The Whale Fisheries Act effectively bans whaling within our 200-mile exclusive fishery limit, and whaling outside those limits is prohibited for Irish registered ships except under licence.  No licences have been issued since 1940.</P>
    <P>Close international co-operation in the field of wildlife conservation is vital to the protection of our wildlife &mdash; particularly migratory species.  Ireland has always participated to the fullest extent possible in international conservation activities and agreements and the present convention represents a major initiative in this increasingly important area for the protection of our natural heritage.</P>
    <P>I now move that the terms of this convention be approved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this motion I must confess to being a little intrigued as to why this country should be the first State to put before Parliament a motion to ratify this convention.  It appears odd that a Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of <Col N="182" /> Wild Animals should be considered so important that we are the leaders in the field, rushing to ratify this convention.  In examining the appendix to the convention and looking at the type of animals to be protected &mdash; gorillas, reptiles, albatross and crocodiles &mdash; I wonder why the Minister thought it necessary to rush into the Dáil and have this convention ratified, and to be the first country in the world to ratify such a convention.  There must be some lesson in this somewhere but I have not put my finger on it yet, although I have my suspicions.</P>
      <P>Looking at the international scene, the convention is obviously a good one and is of considerable importance to many nations, particularly those in the southern hemisphere where it is clear that because of hunting, killing and so on certain species of wild animals are endangered. It is in everyone's interests that this common heritage, which has been bequeathed to the citizens of the world by our ancestors, should be protected.  I want to pay a strong compliment to the Minister for his particular interest in this area.</P>
      <P>So far as Ireland is concerned the only endangered species, apart from certain types of birds, are whales&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I develop this I might find the key to unlock it.  As I said the only endangered mammals are whales.  I was unaware of the whale population around our coast, but we live and learn. I was intrigued by the Minister's reference to the Whale Fisheries Act 1937.  He said this Act effectively bans whaling &ldquo;within our 200-mile exclusive fishery limit&rdquo;.  The Minister is excelling himself in this situation because having criticised him so often for throwing overboard our 50-mile limit immediately after he assumed office as Minister for Fisheries, <Col N="183" /> and hearing the latest dispatches from Brussels that the 12-mile limit is being thrown aside, I think it is great to hear him talking about our 200-mile exclusive fishery limit.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the explanation is that this is a special limit for whales, which are so important to us.  If the Minister is standing over this statement &mdash; but in the light of earlier experience I would not expect him to stand over anything he says &mdash; it is joyous news for the country.  He has announced and established in connection with the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals a 200-mile exclusive fisheries limit.</P>
      <P>I note that in Ireland birds are considered to be threatened and endangered.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Minister might indicate to what extent he considers they are endangered, the steps he proposes to take and the measures he proposes to introduce to ensure that this danger is removed.  The Minister referred to the Wildlife Act, 1976, but he did not outline how he will protect these endangered species under the said Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not observe in the current Book of Estimates any provision of finance for the funding of this convention.  While the United Nations are providing certain funds towards establishing the secretariat over a four year period, in the convention there is provision, for instance, for the provision of assistance to developing nations in connection with research and conservation in management of migratory species and their habitats and, also, in the establishment of appropriate scientific and administrative institutions. There are certain countries where wild <Col N="184" /> animals being protected are more abundant than here but who may not have the resources to implement the convention fully.  Now that we are rushing into ratifying the convention some thought should have been given to this aspect and some idea given by the Minister of the cost involved in making our contribution, in particular under the heading of aid to the developing countries, to enable them to put the convention into effect.</P>
    <P>We support the motion that the convention should be ratified.  I await, with some interest, the Minister's reply as to why it is so important to be the first nation to ratify the convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals. Maybe the wild animals in this country are thinking of emigrating.  Perhaps the Minister has an explanation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I share with Deputy O'Keeffe, in a rather light mood, the possible reasons or suspicions as to why this is being introduced, but the House should deal with this matter seriously. We are not ratifying anything, we are simply being asked to approve a convention. If the track record of the domestic Government Departments in ratifying conventions, approved by the Department of Foreign Affairs, is anything to go by, it will be many years before we formally ratify the convention.  The Department in question will be the Department of the Environment.  It will have to demonstrate it has the capability to monitor legislation of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House should be aware of the very real human interest in what appears to be an esoteric subject far removed from the day-to-day concerns of ordinary people. The migratory movement of wild animals in different parts of the world is the first early warning system we have of major changes in our environment, particularly in the climate and habitat of the environment. Anything that interferes with or distorts that will prevent us from getting a clear picture in sufficient time of what is happening to the habitats of our environment, with a consequent impact on agricultural production and the health of individuals.  We share the global space with wild animals, including birds, which <Col N="185" /> is rather curious phraseology in the Minister's speech, and we have a vested mutual interest in preserving their lives and their way of life so that we may protect ourselves.</P>
    <P>I strongly support and congratulate the Minister and his Department for bringing this convention to the House for its approval.  Would the Minister, now that he has disposed of the 200-mile exclusive fishery limit, give some indication as to whether the convention follows the same routine as other UN conventions and, therefore, must be approved by a minimum number of States before it can be ratified and what impact on domestic legislation its ratification will have?  Will it require us to amend in any way the Wildlife Act, 1976?  These are technical questions which the Minister may or may not be able to answer.  It is sufficient at this stage to approve the measure in principle. As the Minister said, we do not know what the cost may be.  The Department and the Minister should be congratulated for responding within the time-scale of June 1979 to now, which is quite short for this type of thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion and I sincerely hope the spirit of the Bonn Convention will be implemented.  However, as usual, I am suspicious of the agencies available to the Government to implement such measures because, on seeing the item on the Order Paper, I went to the Oireachtas Library and got a copy of the convention in question.  It refers repeatedly to the appendix giving the list of animals and birds involved.  I doubt if anyone in the House, with the possible exception of the Minister for Education, could tell me the name of one of the animals specified.  If the Minister is serious about the matter he should have given us a translation of the animals and birds involved.  The zoological phraseology as to which animals or birds are being protected is above the head of any Member of the House.  Would the Minister translate the names for the benefit and information of the Members so that we may know what we are protecting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to crocodiles and gorillas.  They are the only words <Col N="186" /> which make sense to the layman.  I have come across an albatross also.  Apart from those, I fail to recognise any of the common animals and birds which migrate to and from this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should know about that, he tends to hover over subjects without actually ever landing.  I have never seen an albatross &mdash; even on a golf course.  I am suspicious as to the agencies which are available for the implementation of the measures which are to be taken.  We fully support the convention. We are glad to see there are 77 countries involved in the conference which the Minister referred to.  Who are those 77 countries?  We are dealing with a motion about which we know little or nothing. We have only the bare bones, we have not got any of the real meat of the convention concerned.  We do not know which 77 countries are involved; we do not even know which animals are involved.  Would the Minister, elaborate on those aspects?  We have a limited number of birds and animals migrating to and from this country.  Would the Minister tell us the names of the animals and birds about which we are specifically concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, is there an annual census taken of the number of species, whether it be wild geese, cuckoos, corncrakes, swallows, pine martins, sand martins or whatever, to establish which are endangered, diminishing or have disappeared completely?  I am thinking here of the golden eagle which I believe was in this country up to 40 or 50 years ago.  Has the Minister some knowledge of what species have been wiped out, what species are in danger and can he inform us of what measures are being taken to protect those in danger?  I know that in Britain the relevant Government Department go to great lengths to protect endangered species, actually guarding the nests of birds in danger.  There is no comparable agency here for the protection of endangered species.  Therefore they could be wiped out quite easily without the public being <Col N="187" /> aware or the relevant Department doing anything to prevent it.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that we know what we are talking about.  This motion does not tell us that.  If the Minister knows perhaps he would inform us and, if not, would he undertake to introduce a measure at some future date which will inform us of what is involved?  Otherwise we are talking through our hats.</P>
    <P>I might mention the Wildlife Act of 1976, mentioned in the Minister's remarks, the objective of which was to protect our wildlife.  It has been a failure because the necessary money has not been injected into the appropriate Department to provide personnel to protect the species involved.  Indeed, in this country at present what was once a very common species of animal is now on the verge of extinction because of its being exploited for the value of its pelt.  I refer to the ordinary, common fox.  What concrete measures are being taken to protect such animals?  Due to the use of pesticides or other uses for monetary gain certain species could be wiped out and I include in those&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I make the point solely to show how a very common species of animal is in danger of being exterminated here.  Therefore the less common animals and birds such as those I have mentioned already &mdash; for instance, the corncrake, which is on the point of extinction in large parts of this country &mdash; must be in great danger.  I should like the Minister to tell us how many of each of those species we have in this country and what efforts are made to carry out a census of them annually so that we can monitor their extinction or expansion.  Unless we do so we are not doing the country a service and are not making a decent effort to protect our endangered species, especially <Col N="188" /> those that are rare and migratory. Perhaps the Minister could furnish some replies to the questions I have posed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether this is simply a question of signing a convention because everybody else is doing so, or are we really interested in doing anything about preventing the extermination in this country of certain species, particularly migratory birds.  As Deputy Deasy said the corncrake is now a thing of the past; one does not hear the corncrake any longer.  Perhaps there are some in very remote parts of the country but in most areas it is simply not heard any longer.  The cuckoo seems to be surviving. Some people do not seem to appreciate the fact that we have a far larger migration of birds in winter than in summer and that these are being wiped out. I am sure that many people using the land if made aware would not continue to use pesticides which are wiping out the bird population.  Those of us living in the country are aware of this fact.  The same applies to water animals &mdash; there are no crocodiles or the like in this country &mdash; the smaller water animals which are being wiped out in the same way.</P>
      <P>This is not simply a question of a political issue.  It is a question of our people being interested in the protection of wildlife. Simply to sign a convention, put it to one side and say: &ldquo;Are we not great, we have done that now, we are now in line with everybody else&rdquo;, is, I honestly believe, the wrong approach to such matters. Because I know of so many animals, birds in particular, being wiped out I believe it is entirely wrong that we should allow this measure go through without establishing whether or not any effort is being made to prevent the destruction, not of one or two but sometimes hundreds and thousands of birds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know the disastrous consequences of oil slicks.  That is an eventuality for which nobody can provide.  We are aware also that when certain local authorities attempt to eradicate oil slicks from beaches within their jurisdiction the cure has been found to be worse than the disease.  It is not unusual to find an enormous stretch of beach rendered sterile <Col N="189" /> because some of remedial action wipes out every living object on these beaches. While the Minister will be the person to sign this convention because it refers to migratory species of wild animals, I would ask that he and his colleagues, in the short time remaining to them, would get together and at least leave on record the fact that if they were not interested in anything else they were interested in the preservation of the wildlife of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion.  I note that while 77 countries are required to sign this convention, it will come into force three months after its ratification by 15 states.</P>
      <P>I would not take what I interpret to be the very narrow view of some speakers as to why we should be interested only in that form of wildlife, birds or animals affecting this country.  I think that our people, young and old alike, are very concerned about wildlife worldwide.  I believe our people will welcome whatever steps are taken to protect or conserve species in danger, whether they be in Africa, Asia, Australasia or wherever. It is important that we, as the country with perhaps the least vested interest, should be seen to be among the first to sign this convention.  I often wish that countries were quicker in signing some important conventions coming before them but which they fail to do for some reason or another.  Certainly, I welcome this one coming before us for ratification. My interest, like that of many other people, is to ensure that bird and animal wildlife in whatever part of the world, is conserved.  I should be interested to know what action, if any, will be taken when the necessary 15 states have ratified this convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What kind of action will they have in mind?  I would like if there was some kind of follow through by way of information forwarded to those of us who have spoken in this debate.  Names might be notified by the relevant Department dealing with this.  That Department might let us have some information on this matter at some future date as soon as something is to hand.  I would simply like to know <Col N="190" /> more.  I understand the broad outline and what we are trying to achieve.  It is laudable and I hope that other countries will not take too long to do what we are doing.  I hope that our members in the European Parliament will exert pressure over there to get other members of the European Community to ratify this convention as soon as possible because of the urgency in many cases of protecting such species.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would briefly like to add to the comments of my colleagues and support the principle of any measure which will consolidate legal supports for the protection and indeed enhancement and improvement of our environment and ecology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However I feel that we probably should be a little sceptical about matters such as this because, quite candidly, although we tend to get into the area of signing such documents and uttering supportive after-dinner speeches, when the crunch comes and when it comes to the choice between economic options I have yet to see the environment or the ecology getting the nod, as it were, in any debate in this country thus far.  Frankly, I believe that, unless a massive public education exercise supported by consequent legislative protection is initiated, the quality of our environment will be eroded further. The measure before us will have no legal effect unless it is ratified.  I do not know whether the Government propose to do that or when.  I hope it will be soon. I would like to think that the measure itself, which is one that we all welcome in principle, will soon become law and will be enforced not only in the spirit but in the letter.  I hope that it will not just be circulated in this House but that the Minister will ask his colleague, the Minister for Education, to circulate it to the schools to involve young people.  After all the young people are the ones who will benefit or otherwise from whatever environment this generation leaves to them, and if present indications are anything to go by I prefer to have been young some time ago rather than at the moment.  If we are to genuinely mobilise public support and public opinion to <Col N="191" /> accept a much more guarded and protected approach to our environment we are going to have to involve young people, and the schools could respond helpfully in that respect.  Therefore I would like to see this measure being circulated to them along with the appropriate covering documentation explaining the purpose of it and inviting their co-operation and participation.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see whatever law exists in relation to the often mindless morons who go around shooting rare animals or birds being enforced and being made more strict.  Only last week we saw an incident where such species was, in this country at least, endangered by somebody firing a gun carelessly.  I have my own views about the pleasure that people would derive from shooting any living thing but in a democracy there are those who believe that it is a reasonable form of sport and in that circumstance we should regulate for it.  But there is a wantonness about the efforts of some people in this regard.  Not enough is being done to protect particularly the migratory species which come to this country and which are of benefit to our ecology and our environment.  It is sad to see regular instances of such animals and such species being shot or hacked to death and that has occurred on too many occasions.</P>
    <P>I would like also to see the Department of Agriculture taking a new and much greater interest in the effects of agrarian reform at many levels and its impact. Deputy Tully has referred very rightly to the gradual pervading of the agricultural landscape by unquantified and unchecked volumes of chemical ingredients of various kinds.  I asked a question in this House about two and a half years ago in an effort to ascertain whether anybody even bothered to count how much chemical is injected into the land and stock and no one seems to be bothering. There are now more advertisements for these products on television than there are for any other product with the exception of alcoholic drink.  It is about time someone asked what effect this is having.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the protection <Col N="192" /> of these species is one facet of the need for us to protect our environment and our ecology.  It is going to get more difficult for people to do that in future because the pressures will be greater from commercial and vested interests who have little time or responsibility for such areas.  Therefore I commend the Minister for his initiative today and hope that in the future we can involve those sections of the population like young people, interest groups or interested parliamentarians and get them to form a united front to confront those who would simply cast aside the real and genuine concern for the quality of our environment and our ecology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the House for a very constructive reception of this measure which is simply seeking the approval of the House which is necessary in this circumstance in regard to the ratification by the Government at the earliest possible date.  I can assure the House that once this amendment is ratified by 15 states it will automatically come into force which means that there will be a fairly rapid implementation.  Seventy-seven states showed their interest by attending at the Bonn Convention in June 1979 when the final text was prepared, briefed and agreed.  So this is reasonably quick action by the countries concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise that we are not the first country.  A number of other states are at the moment taking the same procedures we are in seeking the required approval from their various houses of parliament and indeed at present the matter is being discussed in Brussels with a view to a co-ordinated stance by the ten EEC states who hope to ratify the convention together as a group.  The initiative for the ratification of the convention came from one of our EEC partners, the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany.  So there is an earnestness on the part of the EEC countries in particular some of whom represent parts of the world most seriously threatened, particularly the heavily populated areas of Western Europe.  These countries are seriously anxious to ensure the passage <Col N="193" /> of approval for the convention through their parliaments and then I can assure the House of immediate ratification and all the countries are moving at present in their respective parliaments.  That is why we have brought the matter forward here.  Sometimes we are moving in concert with our EEC partners who are not alone because every country in the world is involved in one way or another.</P>
    <P>One might ask why the Minister for Foreign Affairs is involved in the matter at all.  The reason is that this is an international convention concerned with migratory species.  Therefore it has to be done in an international way and the Minister for Foreign Affairs acts as the agent for the Government in all international matters and in the signing of and the ratification of international conventions. There is already in this country a highly skilled group of dedicated people who have made their contribution towards the development and protection of our rural environment.  As a result of the passage of the Wildlife Act in this House I had the pleasure, as Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, of establishing the Wildlife Council which is now in existence and on which various voluntary bodies are represented; these are voluntary bodies with a particular interest and motivation in ensuring that indigenous wildlife in this country, both animals and birds, is fully protected.</P>

I will read out what is involved in regard to migratory species that affect us: <Col N="194" /> no animals as far as Ireland is concerned; &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in regard to mammals.  There are three species of whale which come to our waters, blue whale, hump-backed whale and a light whale.  In regard to birds we have geese, swans, ducks, hawks, buzzards, the osprey eagle, peregrine falcon, harriers, sandpipers, curlews, snipe, thrush, plover and the warbler that is always indigenous to the Irish scene.</P>

      <P>That is the picture as far as we are concerned.  The main thrust is the separate wildlife legislation and the wildlife council set up under it concerning itself with the problems referred to by Deputy Tully and others.  We must make sure that we do not drag our feet or lag behind other countries who are seeking to bring in an international convention to protect these species throughout the world.  Most civilised countries have legislation analogous to our wildlife Act. There is provision under our Act to enable us to write in the necessary regulations to implement this convention so there would be no problem about implementing it.</P>
      <P>It is important that we show our interest in the environment by proceeding to ratification with our other EEC partners as soon as possible.  We can entrust the subsequent administration of whatever regulation is required to be brought in under our Act to implement the convention to the wildlife service of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and to the voluntary bodies represented on the wildlife council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this measure at some length prior to the adjournment so I do not intend to delay the House unduly.  Since our discussion, and further to it, a number of other issues need to be dealt with.  We now have before us the most recent report of the Garda Commissioner on crime statistics which is a helpful barometer of the manner in which we can adjudicate upon the success or otherwise of the administration in relation to dealing with malicious crime and other forms of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am mindful of the fact that the Minister, in his introductory remarks, referred to this series of statistics and the indication of increase in relation to malicious injury and crime as being one more unfortunate index of a general increase in criminality in our society.  The most recent figures from the Garda Commissioner unfortunately give no cause for consolation but underline once again the fact that we are failing to tackle the problems in this area.  In 1979, under the heading offences against property with violence, there is an increase in the general category of 2 per cent, from 21,119 <Col N="196" /> crimes recorded in 1978 to 21,535 in 1979. The detection rate unfortunately is still disappointingly low despite the best efforts of the Garda so that on average one is less likely to be caught than not be. In other words well over half of the offences in this area are not detected.  I stress there is a significant distinction between detection and conviction and the latter, conviction would be lower still.</P>
    <P>I suggest with respect that the Bill before us, which is fundamenetally a fiscal matter and endeavours to tidy up certain matters in relation to existing legislation in respect of malicious injuries, should be more fundamental.  What we are really talking about is tidying up the administration of malicious injuries but what we should be doing is talking about how to stop them occurring.  Nowhere is that concern expressed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In an article in <i>The Evening Herald</i> on 19 November 1980 the comments of a managing director of a company are reported.  He said that school vandalism has soared over the past 12 months to a record £750,000 in insurance claims.  That is a staggering figure and is part of a trend.  The commissioner's report spells out under the heading arson and malicious damage that there were 1,259 cases of malicious damage of which 150 cases were arson; 661 or 52.5 per cent were detected.  In 1978 the total figure for arson was 114 showing an increase for 1979 of 31.6 per cent.  In one 12-month period the figure for this most fundamental form of damage showed an increase of almost one-third which is staggering. Nowhere in the Minister's comments or in the comments, actions or attitudes of the Minister for Justice has there been decisive and progressive steps taken to counter such trends.  Instead of that we are forced to talk about a Bill which fundamentally does nothing more than recognise that inflation and passing years have made existing legislation outdated and antiquated.</P>
    <P>The right way to deal with matters such as minimum or maximum limits in relation to figures in legislation would be to have them index-linked in some way to reasonable economic indicators.  This would mean that everytime one wanted <Col N="197" /> to increase the jurisdiction of a court in an area or any time one wanted to increase the minimum damage subject to a claim, one would not have to run into the House and waste its time with a matter which is no more than up-dating to take account of inflation.  Many of the measures in this Bill do only that.  This House should be more centrally engaged in dealing with the real issues and the real issue in this Bill is not whether the minimum damage subject to a claim is to be increased from £5 to £100, is not whether the District Court should be empowered to deal with claims for compensation not exceeding £2,500 but how to deal with malicious crime in the community in a constructive, enlightened but determined manner.  That is not what we are talking about.  Instead we are talking about bookkeeping, accountancy and administration. That is not the fundamental job of our Parliament; it is the job of those who regulate the way Bills work.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider incorporating in the Bill a series of amendments which will mean that the next time a similar Bill is introduced we will not have to spend our time arguing about the increases requested by the Minister which do not do anything more than take account of the passing of years and the soaring rate of inflation.  I would much prefer a constructive and enlightened discussion in the real area of public concern, which is how we can stop crime and prevent malicious injury.  We could be more usefully engaged in such a debate but we are bound to deal with matters which though significant and important in themselves are of less importance than other issues which we will never get a chance to discuss.</P>
    <P>A request has been made to me by Deputy Deasy in relation to this Bill and in the course of it he outlined the experience of his local authority, Waterford County Council.  Deputy Deasy wants the burden which falls on local authorities in regard to such claims taken off them. Unless we honestly recognise that local authorities in contesting a claim in the context of this Bill stand to lose substantial sums of money then we are doing local authorities, and the services they <Col N="198" /> provide such as housing, an injury.  I will deal with the amendment he has suggested in more detail on Committee Stage but the essence of it is to have included as a charge to malicious injury expenditure the cost incurred by a local authority in defending claims.  At present those costs are not allowable.  In one case in Waterford recently the cost of fighting such a claim amounted to about £30,000 and the council had to stand the loss of that money.  Local authorities should not be asked to do so because it means that people are deprived of essential services. They fight claims on behalf of local citizens but in doing so they run the risk of having to cut back on their services.  If local authorities accept the loss from now on they will tend not to contest such claims so as not to incur such heavy costs. An injustice would arise in such cases and there would be a heavy cost to the State. I have no doubt that the Minister will consider this matter sympathetically.</P>
    <P>I do not think any Member will disagree with the sensible request to increase the monetory limits in the Bill.  In fact, the Minister is only taking account of inflation in recent years.  The Minister should consider some way of linking them to economic indicators.  The increase in the jurisdiction of the District Court can be more appropriately dealt with in the course of the debate on the Bill dealing with our courts but this change will mean a greater sense of realism.  However, it will present problems because the District Court has difficulty in dealing with its present work load.</P>
    <P>The power to be granted to local authorities to pay compensation without delay on foot of court awards is welcome. It will mean that those granted decrees will get justice.  In the past the payment of such awards was delayed for years. There is a need for vigilance in regard to that power and to the power to settle claims out of court.  In some circumstances there could be unconscious abuse of such powers which could mean that public money is dispensed with more largesse than appropriate.  I am sure some mechanics will be devised for dealing with those matters.  I am concerned that under the Bill it will no longer be a <Col N="199" /> defence to an application for compensation for malicious damage merely to show that malicious damage was caused by a child or person of unsound mind.  I have serious reservations about removing that defence.  It is contradictory to suggest, as the Bill does, that one can have a malicious injury inflicted by a person of unsound mind.  Clearly, there is an injury inflicted but the degree of maliciousness obviously implies full knowledge, clear consent and some maturity in the mentality of the person involved.  The person of unsound mind, by definition, does not have some of those qualities.  I imagine that shortly after the Bill is passed a test case will be brought before the courts in relation to that matter.  I do not understand how a person of unsound mind, or a child, who arguably is not aware of what he or she is doing, can be found guilty of malicious injury, something which implies a deliberate and knowing attempt to inflict malicious damage or injury.  The Minister should consider that matter carefully.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal in the Bill to the effect that compensation will not be payable where the property in question does not have planning permission or where the development was not done in conformity with planning permission.  In general I approve of that but there should be some exceptions.  Prior to 1963 there was virtual open season with regard to planning laws here and those in breach of planning laws at present need only prove that the development concerned existed prior to 1963.  If a person purchases or inherits a property part of which is in breach of the planning laws I do not think he should be penalised.  The intent is to encourage people to keep within the planning legislation and it is timely to do that because the planning laws are largely flouted and ignored.  We have the ludicrous position of people being entitled to apply for permission to retain illegal planning developments even though they entered into such illegal work knowingly. Consideration should be given to exceptions such as cases where people either through ignorance or through an historical accident or through inheritance <Col N="200" /> acquired property.  In such cases it is reasonable to accept that they did not know about the degree of legality in relation to the planning laws.  The Government should assist such people in rectifying the matter.  With that exception the principle in the Bill is acceptable.</P>
    <P>I find one proposal in the Bill a little mysterious.  Loosely worded it means that a court would be empowered to reduce the amount of compensation it would otherwise award having regard to the general conduct of the applicant including, in particular, his conduct in respect of any precautions he might reasonably have taken to avoid any damage or loss.</P>
    <P>There is a significant implication here that one may make a judgment retrospectively about alleged action or inaction taken by a person who makes a claim.  That should be looked at very closely and I hope to do that in co-operation with the Minister on Committee Stage.  It could mean that we may get attempts to impute motives or to imply actions or acts of commission or omission prior to the incident, say a fire, in which a person will find that he will have to produce evidence to defend his innocence. The onus must always be on people who bring a prosecution to prove guilt and I am a little unhappy about that section which apparently gives the courts &mdash; this is the interesting part &mdash; not the right to say &ldquo;You did not take precautions, therefore you are not entitled to the compensation&rdquo; but &ldquo;You are somewhat culpable or we think you are slightly culpable and therefore we will reduce the compensation&rdquo;.  If the real thrust of this section is to try to keep these awards down, let us say so, but I would not be happy in the case of a decent person who genuinely has suffered injury that for some technical reason far above his head the court decided that, as the phrase is, the general conduct of the applicant &mdash; whatever that means &mdash; was found to be deficient in some way.  Now and again the conduct of all of us could be found to be deficient and I would hate to think that it might be the basis for a reduction in a compensatory award.  I would like the Minister to spell out precisely what that <Col N="201" /> section means and until then we will withhold our judgment in that regard.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (3) states that a person shall be entitled to claim compensation for property damaged maliciously within a harbour or within one mile beyond the coastal boundary of a local authority area.  That is right and proper and, depending on how the subsection would be implemented, we will support that.  I would like to know how that extension of jurisdiction is to be implemented and who would be involved in the process of bringing the matter to light, commenting on it, supplying evidence and so on.</P>
    <P>The unlawful taking of property in the course of a riot will be covered by the code.  I would have thought that present provisions would allow for malicious damage say in the event of trouble at a football match.  This section indicates that it is felt necessary to enlarge upon that.  I hope that the Minister will tell us a little bit more about this when he is replying.  What is the <i>rationale</i> of it?</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the period for lodging claims is to be increased from seven to 14 days and I would not be adverse to it being increased much more than that.  I cannot see the reason or immediate need for a deadline in this regard.  The lodging of a claim is not the easiest matter in the world.  It needs legal advice and assistance, in some cases a good post assistance, and a certain amount of concentrated attention by the person making the claim which he may not be able to afford in the wake of perhaps a very traumatic event like a fire or serious damage to property.  I do not see why 14 days should be the limit and I ask the Minister to consider the possiblity of increasing it still further.  It is immaterial whether it is 14 days or 28 days.  What is material is that a person who has been hard done by in this respect should get the opportunity of achieving justice.  It has happened that some genuine person lodging a claim eight days after an incident has been disbarred from having that processed in the same way as the Bill would propose that anyone doing it after 14 days would be. That is over-bureaucratic.  I cannot see the reason for it and I ask the Minister to be a lot more flexible in his approach to <Col N="202" /> accepting claims than the 14 days' limit would allow.  Again maybe the <i>rationale</i> here is not clear to me and if so I would like to hear it.</P>
    <P>In line with that, as there is a proposed increase of 100 per cent in the date of lodging claims there is a similar percentage increase proposed in relation to the period of limitation of commencement of proceedings to be reduced from six to three years, except on this occasion it is inverse.  Again I would like to see that justified.  Any parameter which tends to reduce the opportunity for people to obtain justice has to be at least frowned upon initially and justified by the Government of the day.  The whole process and the procedure of adjudication on such claims is the forum which is supposed to be able to make an assessment of the degree of damage, compensation and justice applicable.  We should not pre-judge that by setting limits if they are avoidable.  I know there has to be some limit, but I think that the six-year limit has served us not badly and I would like to hear the argument for a reduction. Again it can happen that people by omission or by presuming that a solicitor has done it on their behalf or that another member of the family has looked after it would find suddenly that it is not being done or has not been done.  Putting that with the fact that at the moment adjudications on these take two or three years anyway on occasion, it can mean that before one knows whether it is even coming up in the court the time limit within which people are supposed to have applied has expired.  I am not happy about that and I cannot see the reason for it.  If there is some reason why the six-year limit has not served us well that might be brought forward.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other relatively minor points but my comments today in conjunction with what I said before the adjournment will suffice.  I ask the Minister, therefore, to rid us of legislation which is principally about updating financial limits and taking account of inflation. These matters should be dealt with in another and, in my view, better way.  Let us get down to the real issues.  Why is malicious injury increasing in the community? <Col N="203" /> Can we do anything about it?  I believe it is increasing a lot more even than official statistics show.  Any garda will tell any inquirer that more and more people are simply not reporting minor malicious damage because the Garda are hard pressed to deal with the problems they have to face at present.  Therefore, there is probably under-reporting of such incidents and poor detection, relatively speaking &mdash; that is not the fault of the Garda but of those who do not give them the resources &mdash; and an increasing figure of incidents reported and detected.  Put together and in conjunction with other crime statistics they show us as a Parliament and a people increasingly unable and even at this stage unwilling to confront the real problem of crime in our community.  I would like to see us dealing with a Bill which would endeavour to tackle that fundamentally rather than the economic and fiscal implications of issues arising from such concerns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House is very far short of what I would expect such a Bill to be.  If we remember that it is repealing portion of the Grand Jury (Ireland) Act, 1836, the whole of the Malicious Injuries (Ireland) Act, 1848 and the whole of the Malicious Injuries (Ireland) Act, 1853, among other things, we realise that we are trying to amend rather than replace very much out-dated legislation.  One other such Bill came before the House dealing with building societies during my time over there and when the matter was brought to my notice I was horrified to find that the shortcomings in the legislation were due mainly to the age of the Act, which then was 103 years old.  It had been introduced by the British long before this State became independent and for that reason it dealt with an entirely different set of circumstances from the one in operation at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, this legislation which we are trying to patch up originally dealt with many things that have changed so much that they bear very little relation to what is happening now.  Deputy Keating spoke of the alarming rate at which vandalism is increasing here and elsewhere.  I would <Col N="204" /> not be as despondent as he is about this because while no doubt malicious acts of various kinds are being committed on a far greater scale than previously, it is also true that in every area the number involved is relatively small.  If parental control were tightened up and if the powers that be, particularly the Garda, were empowered to do the job and if when taken to court these miscreants were dealt with in some way rather than by telling them to be good boys and not to do it again &mdash; although they have done it 20 times already &mdash; there might be a reduction rather than an increase in vandalism.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I am glad the Bill has been introduced, inadequate though it is. I find it hard to understand a number of items in it and there are a number of items which are very well thought out. These are some of the points I want to make.  First, there is the whole matter of property which is damaged.  At present the biggest trouble is in regard to public property.  In every city, town and village we find that any telephone kiosk is fair game for the vandals.  If one asks local people who should know if they are aware that this is happening they usually say that the damage is done by &ldquo;strangers&rdquo; coming from &ldquo;outside&rdquo;.  If the area is watched as it has been by interested people from time to time it usually turns out that the damage is done by the sons and daughters of the very people who talk about &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo; coming and doing it.  This is one of the unfortunate aspects of modern vandalism.  I believe the legislation before the House could have contained a provision to hold responsible parents or guardians of under-age people who do damage.  We might get a reduction of vandalism in that way.</P>
    <P>There is reference here to people of unsound mind or children causing damage. That situation exists under present legislation because, peculiarly, it can be so interpreted.  I had experience of two children aged 12 and ten attending a school for the mentally handicapped who, having been brought home by a school bus decided that five or six pennies <Col N="205" /> they had noticed on the teacher's desk could be spent by them if they had them. They thumbed their way back to the school, broke into it, stole the pennies and before leaving, set the school on fire. I think the damage cost £21,000.  The first court to which the case went decided that there was no jurisdiction because the boys were not mentally sound but on appeal it was decided that this was malicious damage and the ratepayers who were then paying all the rates in the area had to pay full compensation.  This sort of thing happens and I think what is included in the present Bill should be the other way around.  It should not be held that people of unsound mind can commit a malicious act or that children who have not reached the age of responsibility should be able to commit a malicious act. That is the type of thinking I could not agree with and I believe it should be changed before the Bill leaves the House.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the number of people involved in damage to property. I am rather surprised to find that if three people do something it is a riot and it can be included while, if the number involved is fewer, it cannot be included. I do not think that is a proper interpretation. There is also the question of the first £100 not being counted.  I disagree entirely with the former speaker on this because while £100 may not be very much to Members of the House it is a lot to people getting perhaps one-quarter of it as a weekly income.  Take car damage: breaking the windscreen or the windows is not unusual and somebody who needs a car to go to work may be asked to bear the cost of the damage himself even though the amount involved may be £50 or £60 but because it is under £100 he cannot recover compensation.  It may be that the person has £50 or £60 a week to keep his wife and family.  Irrespective of what is done in England or Northern Ireland we should think for ourselves and I think the thinking here is wrong.  At present when so many people have incomes on which they can barely exist it is wrong to wipe out the first £100 compensation or rule out a claim for less than £100.</P>
    <P>A few years ago when local authorities <Col N="206" /> repaired roads, they tarred them and very often left chippings on them.  It was ruled in a number of courts that if somebody travelling such a road had a windscreen smashed by the chippings the cost could be claimed against the local authority. Whether liable or not under the proposed legislation such claims would be ruled out because the windscreen of a car will not cost £100.</P>
    <P>One of the good points of the Bill is the suggestion that compensation can be paid out by the local authority without having recourse to the present system whereby the claim must be included in the following year's rates before the money can be paid out.  I had an instance of a person I know well who, just before Christmas, received compensation for damage done to a car two years previously. While the law said he could not be paid until it had been included in the rates there was no limit at the other end. As a result the local authority, like most local authorities, did not pay until the end of the year.  Instead of having the claim paid as soon as the rate was struck and money coming in, it was not paid until the end of the year so that it was well over two years before payment was made even though the decree had been granted in good time.  This is wrong because the value of money changes so much between the time the repair is done and compensation paid.</P>
    <P>I mention cars particularly but many other things are being damaged by a relatively small number of persons.  I was amazed to find recently that a local authority had reported well over £1¼ million due to be paid by them if the cases were decided against them as almost certainly they will be.  There must be another and a better way of dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>It is all right for the Minister to say it is better to leave this communal payment because it costs the ratepayers so little. In his opening speech he referred to the fact that some people considered it was a special punishment.  I believe that was the reason it was introduced and I know it is still in operation in some other countries but we should get away from that. In fact, we got away from it when we <Col N="207" /> stopped having a special rate for a separate area.  In my view there is no justification for the system as it stands.  If somebody from one county goes to another county and causes damage amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds, why should the unfortunate county in which the damage is caused be held responsible? In many instances the person who causes the damage pays only a fleeting visit to the area where the damage is caused.  That is entirely different from the situation where young people cause vandalism on a small scale.</P>
    <P>I am not pillorying people from this city but very often there are situations where people from Dublin steal cars which they drive out of the city and county and eventually crash into a hedge or bank in a neighbouring county.  The car will be left there until it is completely broken up.  Who is responsible?  It is not the authority of the area from which the car was stolen but the authority of the area in which the car was crashed.  This is something that is difficult to understand. There is very bad liaison between the authorities and those who should be responsible for tracing stolen vehicles. Claims amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds are made in respect of damaged vehicles and many of them would not have arisen if somebody in authority &mdash; I am thinking in particular of the Garda Siochána &mdash; reported to a central authority the numbers of the abandoned cars in their area.  It is ridiculous that a car can be driven into another area and left there until it is vandalised with the State having to pay all the costs. The Minister might consider this matter.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of points that could be dealt with more effectively on Committee Stage.  I should like to see quite a number of amendments introduced to improve the Bill.  I agree with the previous speaker that this is not what most of us expected would be put before the House.  We considered a Bill to change the law completely should have been introduced, not just some measures to amend it.  The Minister is aware that the previous Government introduced a system that ultimately pays compensation <Col N="208" /> in excess of 20p in the £ on the rates and that system does not appear to have changed.  I should like the Minister in his reply to explain why the amount in the Estimate has dropped from £3 million last year to £1 million for this year.  I do not believe in modern miracles.  There must be some reason why the figure has dropped so considerably.  This is the amount being paid to local authorities. Does the Minister expect a very substantial reduction in vandalism and does he think that the amount chargeable in the next 12 months will not be nearly as much as was payable in the previous 12 months?  Does he think it is a nice, handy figure that can be put down in a budget and replaced at a later stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is wrong to have such a situation arising on a Bill like this.  If the Government expect co-operation from us we should know what is in their minds. There should be an explanation as to why the Government consider that £1 million will be enough for 1981 while the amount for 1980 was £3 million.  I am sure there was not such a reduction in the amount of vandalism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right that we should know what is being proposed.  It is a fair question and, knowing the Minister, I am sure he will make an effort to give us the information when he is replying on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Property is defined as including rights of fishing, shooting or herbage that are not compensatable under the present law.  It was common practice some time ago to blow up salmon and eel weirs owned by people whose families had got them by way of a gift from some British king and there was no provision for compensation in such cases.  I see now that the Minister proposes to include such cases.  I have known also of instances <Col N="209" /> where valuable woods were burned and, again, compensation was not payable.  If my reading of the Bill is correct, this is now being included.  I should be very glad to know from the Minister if he could give us an estimate of the amounts of money that might have been involved if such compensation were allowed.  Will the Minister tell us what provision has been made in this area?</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to buildings erected without planning permission and I go along with the Minister in his comments on this point.  If somebody deliberately flouts the planning laws the State is quite entitled to deal with him.  If a person flouts the law and if the property that he erects is subsequently damaged, in my view it is quite ridiculous that he should make a claim against the State or local authority.  I am also interested in the decision to reduce the period from six years to three years.  This is something new in law.  Under a number of other Acts there is provision for a six-year period but now we are providing for a three-year period.  Will there be amendments of various Acts to reduce the period to three years?</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with the previous speaker that the time for lodgment of claims at present is ridiculously low. Somebody who may not even know where, for instance, the damaged property is, gets only seven or eight days to lodge a claim and cannot do so because of this.  It is proposed in this Bill to increase that time to 14 days.  It should be longer.  I would not leave it open-ended, however.  There should be, as with the planning laws, a period of 30 days during which a person would have the right to make a claim.  There may very often be reasons why a claim cannot be made in the ridiculously short period. The law should be there to protect those people's rights.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the decision that anything up to £2,500 should be under the jurisdiction of the District Court, which is one way of ensuring that the matter could be dealt with.  I also entirely agree with the proposal that local authorities can make an offer to deal with the claimant outside the court, which will <Col N="210" /> shorten proceedings, as the Minister said. This also can reduce very substantially the legal costs involved.  Very often legal costs amount to more than the actual claim.</P>
    <P>My car was damaged and the insurance company responsible for the person who damaged my car refused to accept a demand for £550.  Subsequently, at the door of the High Court, they agreed to pay £950, because a whole string of people who should not have come into the case at all had to be produced.  It did not look very much as if someone was trying to help his friends.  It should be possible to negotiate, either directly or through the legal advisers, with local authorities and settle cases out of court, if this can be done.  This would be very much easier for the claimants and much cheaper for the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not exactly in favour of the suggestion that it should be put on the basis that, in the event of going to court and money being lodged in court, if it exceeds the amount which is eventually awarded, the person making the claim will eventually have to carry the cost of the case.</P>
    <P>One other thing about which I am not too sure is that the notice would have to be served within the period on the local authority and on the Garda.  Why the double notice?  Would it not be sufficient to have the notice served solely on the local authority?  Many may not be aware of this stipulation and unless they are legally advised may find themselves shut out because of this stipulation.</P>
    <P>Finally, with regard to damage done to property at sea, this is something about which one would have to be very careful. Take for instance, a port like Drogheda, half of which is in County Meath and half in County Louth.  If a craft comes out from that port from the Louth side and the beach along the Meath side is damaged or <i>vice versa</i>, is it reasonable or right that the area outside which the craft is would have to carry the cost if there is no way of deciding which side the craft was on before coming out?</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Bill has been introduced, although I am not happy that it has done everything that I would expect or hope that it would do.  Would the <Col N="211" /> Minister have a good, hard look at the Bill before letting it through?  Again, would the Minister please tell us how he proposes to pay more compensation with less money, unless this is for election purposes?</P>

      <P>The introduction of this Bill is another step forward by Fianna Fáil on the road of social commitment to the people of this country.  In particular, section 15, the section which provides for the abolition of a local levy in the event of a malicious injury claim must be seen in relation to the legislation already passed which removed rates from private dwellings.  This is in full conformity with the thinking that local houses should not have to pay a rate or a bill which would be penal and unjust in relation to whatever might happen within the jurisdication of their local authority.  This is also very important from the point of view of allowing the local authority more scope to ensure that where such claims exist they can proceed rapidly and be settled to the satisfaction of the unfortunate victim.</P>
      <P>When in a position of dispute with one another as to who is liable for compensation, the local authorities should be made to pay on the grounds that where the court case takes place that local authority is to be liable, irrespective of the dispute that may take place between two or three local authorities in relation to liability.  It is not fair on persons or firms who, through no fault of their own, are involved in proceedings to recover money under these acts that they should be precluded from swift settlement because of a dispute between local authorities as to who is liable for what. There might be room for a slight change in this area.  Nevertheless, the whole idea of this section is commendable and certainly is a vast improvement on previous legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thinking in relation to damage to an unauthorised structure which had not the necessary planning permission is also very interesting.  In this context, another type of malicious injury that occurs is damage to the environment of many of <Col N="212" /> our cities and towns by the unauthorised destruction of property by private individuals or companies for purposes of rebuilding or renewal.  In these circumstances, it is impossible for the local authority to take an action against people who deliberately destroy their own property, thereby changing the environment of that district.  Would it be possible to introduce a section or subsection into this Bill to penalise people who flout the planning laws and regulations of the various local authorities by maliciously damaging their own property for financial gain, to rebuild on the same site, with no regard whatsoever to planning laws or regulations in existence?</P>
    <P>It is in the Bill that if an unauthorised structure is damaged, then no compensation is forthcoming, but I suggest that if people deliberately damage existing buildings they are causing malicious injury to the residents of that area.  There is also a suggestion here that if an unauthorised structure is destroyed and no compensation is forthcoming, the owner of that structure is in a very difficult position, perhaps through no fault of his own, in that he cannot seek compensation. There might be a temptation for very bloody-minded people to do something deliberately of a malicious nature which would not be the subject of compensation.</P>
    <P>The other areas of the Bill which are a big improvement are those dealing with compensation at sea and for property on boats.  With the enormous expansion of the fishing fleet during the past few years this must be of importance to the owners of fishing boats and gear and is to be welcomed.  Unfortunately these people are occasionally subject to malicious acts and the section is certainly a step in the right direction.  In this context one would wonder about some of the harbour authorities who do not improve their installations and occasionally damage can be done to boats while they are in harbour due to matters which are the direct responsibility of the harbour authority.  I refer in particular to the harbours at Balbriggan and Skerries which are the responsibility of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  They are certainly not <Col N="213" /> spending money on these harbours and boats have been damaged at these locations through negligence on the part of that authority.  Can this damage be construed as malicious because of the deliberate negligence of the authority in fulfilling their obligation to maintain their property at these locations?  This is an interesting point which will have to be carefully examined when this legislation is passed.  A small fisherman who finds that his boat has been damaged by lumps of masonry will look to this Act for protection. The damage may be caused as a result of those who own the harbour and allow others to use it when not maintaining it properly.</P>
    <P>This type of situation could arise in other areas &mdash; for instance, in regard to dangerous buildings which have not been either repaired sufficiently or demolished by their owners.  A car owner may find that his vehicle has been severely damaged and he will look to this legislation to recover his losses.  I welcome the Bill and make those few suggestions in the hope that they will be considered with a view to protecting the people concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth about this Bill is that, despite the praise lavished upon it by Deputy Fox, it is a piece of medieval junk to which this Government are adding a further dimension.  The truth about the malicious injury system is that its roots lie in very early Norman England, if not even in Saxon England.  It is a penal system designed to punish the inhabitants of a locality for failing to apprehend wrongdoers or for allowing wrongdoers to exist and flourish in their midst.  It bore that character right into the 17th and 18th centuries and the forerunners of the legislation scheduled here specifically mention areas which are haunts of reputed Papists as being appropriate areas to lay under charge in respect of damage committed. It is sad that Deputy Fox should think this an apposite moment to praise his own side because a serious look at this legislation and its history would have convinced the Government who wanted to reform it that the entire principle whereby the inhabitants of a locality are laid under contribution for a wrong committed <Col N="214" /> in their geographic midst is absolutely out of tune with the 20th century.</P>
      <P>Not only is this the case but, as I hope to show the House in a very few words, it is repugnant to our own Constitution. Although I quite agree with the proposal that the State should contribute anything in excess of an award the product for which can be found only in 20p in the pound or upwards and that this mitigates the impact of a malicious injury award on the individual ratepayer, I warn the Government that they are now proposing to pass into law something which in my view is constitutionally infirm.  They can ask their own advisers about it.  It is infirm because of the basis on which this legislation ultimately rests, one which proposes to penalise the entire inhabitants of a locality irrespective of their individual share of fault, if any.  It proposes to penalise the inhabitants of a locality but not the inhabitants of the locality next door, even though in respect of the only matter which ought to be material- &mdash;mainly, culpability, real or imputed &mdash; there is nothing to choose between them.</P>
      <P>If I were a cantankerous or litigious ratepayer and found myself being charged even as little as £20 on my rates bill in order to meet the local authority's malicious injury bill, I would be strongly inclined to challenge the constitutional propriety of it.  I would not have to go to the High Court or Supreme Court to do so because the requirement that one starts in the superior Courts only applies to challenging Acts of the Oireachtas. When this Bill becomes law it will be an Act of the Oireachtas and it would be an expensive business to challenge it.  However, it would be enough for me to challenge in the District Court any of the antique Acts which provide the pedestal on which this legislation will repose.  I may be wrong about this but I will briefly explain the reasons for my opinion.  Perhaps the Government's legal advisers will tell them that what I am saying is a bottle of smoke and to carry on.  If so, that is all right and I have not that much pride as to be offended about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one were to neglect the constitutional dimension of the entire system this <Col N="215" /> Bill is undoubtly an improvement in as much as it is a step in a more rational direction in some respects than existing law, but it still carries the infirmity which is borne by the entire malicious injury code.  Deputy Tully, who did not purport to give anything but a layman's view, put his finger on this infirmity when he said that it seemed insane that, although the obvious perpetrators of a wrong might be known not to come from a particular district, nevertheless the district in which they perpetrated the wrong was the district to be laid under contribution for the purpose of malicious injury compensation. I endorse everything Deputy Tully said on this matter.  Of course it is an absurdity and I will give the House from my own experience at the Bar an instance of how this absurdity can work in a very extreme form.</P>
    <P>I have forgotten which side I was on but I recall CIE bringing a malicious injury application against Kildare County Council in respect of damage which CIE said had been caused to one of their trains by football hooligans travelling back from Carlow to Dublin.  It was the belief of CIE that the damage was caused while the train was traversing County Kildare. The claim failed because CIE's evidence was a bit shaky and the judge could not be absolutely persuaded that the damage might not have been caused at the point when the night express from Carlow was hurtling over the boundary of County Dublin at Hazelhatch.  Only that trivial evidentiary debility in CIE's case prevented the ratepayers of County Kildare in or around the year 1960 from being stuck with the bill for damage caused to a train by hooligans resident in Dublin who had spent the day in Carlow and had never set foot in County Kildare, merely because the train was traversing the county at the moment when the CIE inspector and guard believed that the seats had been ripped, the windows broken and the lavatories smashed.  That is an extreme case but anyone who has been at the Bar or practised as a solicitor could not only endorse it but probably produce even more absurd cases.</P>
    <P>Take the case of the vandals Deputy <Col N="216" /> Tully had in mind, who travel on a bank holiday to Bettystown and commit damage there.  The people of Meath are stuck with that damage.  Take the case of hooligans who travel to Bray and commit acts of vandalism there.  It is not the people of Dublin who, if any responsibility is to be borne by the neighbours who might be thought to be responsible for the way the children are being brought up, will have to pay for that, it is the people of Wicklow who will have to pay.  Sheep farmers from Blessington to Baltinglass will have to contribute in some shape or form to restore the malicious injuries caused by people who may have come from a Dublin suburb simply because the damage was committed across the boundary in the town of Bray.</P>
    <P>That is an absurdity but it is an absurdity which has a special dimension in this country.  To carry that absurdity through into law represents a breach of the spirit and of the letter of Article 40.1 of the Constitution which provides that all citizens shall as human persons, be held equal before the law.  That provision and comparable provisions in comparable constitutions, like those of Germany or Italy, do not mean that every citizen has to be treated in exactly the same way for all purposes all the time.  If it did, all legislation would be futile.  Legislation has to classify and divide citizens, cases and situations into categories and apply different judgments and assessments to each category.  It would be futile otherwise.</P>
    <P>The criterion on which the classification is based has to be reasonable.  It has to be one which is not invidious or arbitrary. That is the point we are dealing with here and it is being repeatedly laid down by the courts of this country and by the courts of other countries with comparable constitutional provisions.  An arbitrary, casual discrimination with no reason behind it cannot be defended when measured against a guarantee of equality before the law.  The Government have their legal advisers to contradict me if I am wrong, but I believe the differentiation which will allow a citizen in Shankill, County Dublin, to escape contribution for an act of vandalism committed <Col N="217" /> in a dancehall in Bray by somebody from Balbriggan, but will require a citizen in Baltinglass to pay, is a breach of the provision I am talking about, because it is a discrimination which is entirely arbitrary.  It is not in any sense related to the provenance of the wrongdoer &mdash; his known provenance, his likely provenance or his putative provenance.  It is related simply and solely to the administrative area in which the wrong has been committed.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the House that that provision goes back to the 11th or 12th century when the administrative divisions of Saxon England were penalised for allowing rogues, vagabonds and bandits to roam unmolested through their territory. It also goes back to the 17th century and was supposed to terrorise districts in Ireland where people permitted Papists, Raparees and Tories &mdash; and the ancestors of some Deputies who are my political opponents &mdash; to roam at large through their territories, into making sure these things did not happen.  That might have had some reason when there was no police force, no proper law and order and when the only way the King's peace could be kept was by pushing, in this crude way, a measure of responsibility onto the inhabitants.  How can that be said of the inhabitants of a surburban terrace in Bray, County Wicklow, in regard to hooliganism committed by people from Dublin or Wexford?  Surely that is an arbitrary distinction.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I do not complain about the principle whereby the public should compensate the victim of malicious damage.  That is a necessary social measure but it should be a contribution levied on the public at large and not on a particular administrative district in which the act is committed for some reason which has no possible connection with the people in that district and for which they can be asked to bear no responsibility.</P>
    <P>As a matter of procedural convenience I would have no objection to the local authority being made, for court purposes, the nominal respondent in malicious injuries claims.  There could be no objection to that because it is convenient <Col N="218" /> and there is usually a county solicitor and the local authorities are equipped to handle litigation, defend claims and so on. There could be no objection to that provided the burden of the award does not fall on the ratepayer.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the mitigation contained in this Bill, it is clear that that burden will in some measure fall on the ratepayer.  That is recognised by the Bill because in section 17 the ratepayer is specifically given a status in regard to appealing a malicious injuries award.  The point I am making is that it is tacitly recognised that the ratepayer is ultimately the victim of the system even though, I freely admit, in a mitigated form.  In section 17 an appeal against the grant of an award may be taken by any ratepayer entitled, by virtue of section 10(2), to appear and be heard.  Any ratepayer who is so entitled shall be entitled also to appear and be heard at the hearing of an appeal against the decision of such application.  In other words, this Bill, produced by a Government who constantly issue certificates to themselves of purity in regard to the pursuit of national ideals, is simply another decoration stuck to the end of a long train of Saxon legislation.</P>
    <P>The right thing for the Minister to do is to withdraw this Bill, although there are some sections which could be rescued. We should frankly admit that malicious damage is a charge on the entire community, ought to be recognised as such, and met out of the Central Funds.  While there could be no objection from the litigation point of view to the local authority being made the nominal respondent, the payment of the award should be automatically reimbursed in full by the Central Fund, and not merely to the extent of the excess over 20p in the £.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious weakness in respect of this arbitrary distinction where the inhabitants on one side of the line, although they have no reasonable putative responsibility for the commission of an act of malicious damage, can be asked to contribute while the residents 100 yards away or on the far side of the road who equally have no responsibility, cannot be asked to contribute.  That is arbitrary <Col N="219" /> discrimination.  In many malicious injury cases when the provenance of the offender is known &mdash; because the offender has been apprehended and convicted &mdash; the arbitrary nature of this discrimination becomes even more glaring. If my neighbour in south Dublin goes to Bray and commits an act of vandalism &mdash; if one is going to talk about putative responsibility for not keeping the peace and keeping people under control &mdash; it would be more reasonable to fix me with the liability for what my neighbour has done than to penalise the people in Bray, among whom he has only been an unwelcome visitor.  There might be some sense in that &mdash; I still think it would be an arbitrary and unjust system &mdash; but there might be some sense in that.  But not at all, I am let off the hook, I do not have to contribute one penny, nor do any of the other neighbours.  The people who have to contribute are the people who by accident happen to inhabit the administrative section in which this act of vandalism has been committed.</P>
    <P>It is clear that this system which we are perpetuating, although in mitigated form, is a violation of Article 40(1).  In addition to that, although this aspect is less serious, it is a violation of Article 38 which says that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law.  I admit it does not appear on the face of the Bill that anyone is being tried or convicted of anything, but this Bill has to be considered in the context of the legislative <i>corpus</i> on malicious injury which goes back &mdash; the stuff which is still in force goes back to the 1830s, I think, maybe the earliest ones are now being repealed.  Certainly there are Acts of William IV here and that means the 1830s.  There are still some of Chapter 116 of the sixth and seventh of William 1V in force, so the code we are talking about as being still in force here goes back to the 1830s.  It goes back seven hundred years further than that in historical fact.</P>
    <P>In historical fact it is a penal system.  It is intended to punish inhabitants of a district for allowing crime to take place in their midst.  To the extent that that <Col N="220" /> nature still adheres in this legislation, it is a breach also of Article 38(1), because that article says that no one shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law.  It seems to me <i>a fortiori</i>, and nobody would waste the time of a court in arguing such a point, that if a person cannot be tried on a criminal charge save in due course of law, still less can a person be punished for a criminal offence save in due course of law.  Due course of law in this country means, as repeated court decisions have made plain, that a person cannot be punished except for a known offence, an offence known to the law, which has been individually brought home to you.  There is no such thing as guilt by association in our State, nor should there be.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as guilt which putatively sits on somebody because of something which the law finds it convenient to assume he has left undone.  That does not exist in our law and cannot exist in our law.  This system has a conception of that kind at its core.  I admit that, with the improvement which this Bill represents, the average ratepayer will not be very heavily mulcted in respect of malicious injury claims no matter how many there may be or how frequent they may be or how heavy they may be.  Nonetheless, the principle of the thing, whereby a ratepayer can be asked in respect of a system which imputes guilt to him, without any trial, without any consideration of whether he could have done anything to stop the wrong from being committed &mdash; that system is a violation, even though I admit a fairly trivial violation, of Article 38 (1).</P>
    <P>I do not want to bore the House on the subject.  I hope I have made my feelings about it plain.  The Government, if they wish, can take legal advice about it, because I may be wrong in some of the things I have been saying.  The Government can take their own course.  It would be better and would make the Bill far less constitutionally vulnerable and would put the whole system on a more reasonable basis if the State was willing to assume, not just whatever the excess is of 20p in the £, but the entire burden of recouping local authorities for malicious <Col N="221" /> injury awards.  That would not really be revolutionary, because the State is now committed in any case to supporting local authorities by means of extremely large block grants intended to represent &mdash; although, of course, they do not&mdash;and in the last two budgets have not come near to representing the revenue lost through the abolition of domestic rates. Since the Government are expected to contribute heavily to local authorities it does not seem to be a very serious matter if they simply made a clean job of this, took malicious injury awards under their wing and scrapped the idea of levying even any proportion of an award on local ratepayers.</P>
    <P>The absurd so-called local levy, although it was not often used, was a medieval system brought to a very intense point, whereby the inhabitants even of a single townland could be stuck with the entire sum of an award if it was thought that that townland contained a population which had gone in for rick burning or for cattle hocking or whatever the offence concerned might have been. That was a medieval principle in a very extreme form and I am glad to see it is being done away with by the Bill.  But the principle which underlines this eight hundred years or more of law is still there at the heart of the Bill.  It is not consistent with our Constitution and it would be far simpler, more sensible and it would cost the State nothing to take over the whole of malicious injury awards and not to leave the system open any longer to the kind of reproaches I have been levellling at it.</P>
    <P>I would like to list a few points which are really Committee Stage points but I will list them briefly so that the Government can take a look at them if they think fit.  On page 4 of the Bill, section 5, we still have this phrase about three or more persons unlawfully, riotously or tumultuously assembled together.  I think I am right in saying that the whole business of unlawful assembly, let alone riotous assembly or tumultuous assembly, is a very dark part of the law.  Although there are a couple of relatively recent Irish <i>dicta</i> on what an unlawful assembly is, they are not very numerous and any counsel <Col N="222" /> would be hard put to it to explain exactly what an unlawful assembly is and the same goes for explaining what a riotous assembly is.  I cannot recall offhand any recent Irish authority of what a tumultuous assembly is.  Unless the law advisers to the Government know exactly what they mean by this stuff, they should not put junk like that in merely because it was in the 1836 Act.</P>
    <P>Going back to another of my cases when I was at the Bar, appearing for somebody who was looking for compensation because some damage had been done, as far as I remember it was something to do with a wall, most of which had been pushed over.  Perhaps it was not a wall, but it was some structure which fell outside most of the Acts but could be the subject of compensation only if it could be brought within a section in which the element of riotous, tumultuous or unlawful assembly was a necessary component.  Luckily, the judge before whom I appeared was a man who understood and perceived the absurdities in the code and he said he was willing to assume that the very large scale damage to the wall could not have been done by one or two persons and that it must have taken three persons to do it.  Of course, there was no evidence about who had done it, one man working hard all night could have done it.  But the judge simply &mdash; I will not call it pious perjury but it was a judicial operation comparable with what juries used to do when capital sentences were passed for stealing sheep or a small sum of money&mdash;the judge took a short cut and said the damage was very serious and, although he did not know how many people were involved in it, he was willing to suppose that there were three or more and of course since they were causing damage they were unlawfully assembled. He got over it that way.  The State and its legal advisers ought to look at this phrase and ask themselves if it is necessary to leave this medieval shackle on counsel appearing for somebody whose property has been maliciously damaged.  Need there be any case in which he must show that the people who injured him were three or more in number?  What is the point in that?  What is the value of it?  Is <Col N="223" /> there anything to be said for that standard except that William the IV's draftsmen thought it good enough to put in ten years before the Famine?  What else is there to be said for it?</P>
    <P>I am all for reforming the law and so on, but if we are going to reform and improve it let us clear the junk out of it, look at every phrase, clause and principle with a fresh eye and not in the usual Paddy way, assuming that just because the English gave it to us&mdash;and mind you the malicious injuries code was one of the weapons of English Government here essentially for compensating landlords, essentially for compensating people of property for the deprivations carried out by the people who had nothing, namely us and our forebears&mdash;it is good enough. We should free ourselves from that perspective and say &ldquo;All right, it is a reasonable social purpose on which the people and public at large should club together and compensate somebody for injury wantonly and maliciously committed.&rdquo;  I would accept and support that.  But if so, let us start with a clean sheet, let us make a clean job of it, let us not keep this junk which, as I have said, under the influence of the unlawful and tumultuous assembly no lawyer in the country could give a clear explanation of.  Let us not keep principles in the law which are constitutionally problematic.</P>
    <P>I see that in section 5 (4) a person who has suffered a loss is still not entitled to recover in respect of consequential loss or damage.  The rule against recovering on consequential loss and damage is, I think, a judicial rule.  I think it has been held by the Supreme Court on a couple of occasions that the malicious injuries code does not cover consequential damage or loss.  That is a perfectly fair interpretation of the old English legislation, part of the apparatus of repressive government which the English erected and kept going here and which of course the Paddies thought more than good enough for themselves once the English had left.</P>
    <P>I want to know where is the reason for not affording compensation for consequential <Col N="224" /> loss?  Where is the reason behind that?  If the reason is we cannot afford it. I admit that that is a good reason.  If the reason is that there would be no end to the compensation awarded against the State.  I can see that that would be a reason&mdash;in other words we simply cannot afford to cover consequential loss.  If that is the reason it should be frankly admitted because certainly there is no other reason.</P>
    <P>Suppose I am a shopkeeper whose premises have been maliciously burned down&mdash;I am giving this instance off the top of my head&mdash;the law as it stands, if I understand it correctly, will permit me to get compensation for the actual physical damage.  But if I have been out of business for a month while my premises were being repaired, I do not get any compensation in respect of that.  Why not?  If the reason is we cannot afford it, I will accept that.  The State has not got a bottomless pocket: I accept that, if that is the reason.  But let us be clear what is the reason.  If the reason simply is that the Supreme Court said consequential loss was not covered in a couple of cases previously, that is not a reason.  Because the Supreme Court was saying consequential loss is not covered, in its capacity as a court construing an ancient British statute &mdash; which did not even envisage consequential loss, which arose in days when perhaps consequential loss was not a thing one talked about or experienced very much, the average landowner whose rick was burned down, whose cattle were injured, or whose lock gates were broken up, or whatever injury he might have undergone, probably would not think in terms of the modern, commercial world of consequential loss&mdash;I am out of business; I am operating on very narrow margins; I have got competitors all around me who are going to run away with my goodwill.  My shop has been burned down and I have been out of business for six weeks while it was being rebuilt and in respect of that loss I cannot get a halfpenny under this Bill.  If the reason is that we cannot afford it, I will accept that but let it be that reason.  The only other reason could be the judicial interpretation of a very old British statute passed <Col N="225" /> in quite different kinds of times in which most outrage and vandalism was rustic outrage and vandalism, in which the concept of consequential loss would not have had at all the same painful bearing on ordinary people's lives as it would have today.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I do not mean to differ with Deputy Keating.  Deputy Keating, I remember, said something about how it seemed to him to be incredible that one could be attributing malice to a child or to somebody who was mentally infirm.  Of course it is; he is perfectly right about that.  At the same time I agree that this change in the Bill is an improvement. One of the problems under the old law &mdash; as I recall it from my days in practice &mdash; was that if the damage was known to have been caused by small children, or if counsel for the applicants had not excluded the possibility of the damage being caused by small children, excluded the possibility beyond a reasonable doubt &mdash; because this was always construed as being a penal statute, as part of a penal code, and the same burden of proof was imposed and presumably even now will still be imposed on a malicious injuries applicant as on the State, or previously on the Crown, in a criminal prosecution &mdash; the likelihood that a small child, below the age of criminal liability, had committed the injuries, he was liable to lose his case.  A sympathetic judge, a judge permitting pious illegality might quite likely overlook the possibility.  But it was open to a local authority to argue &mdash; and naturally local authorities did very powerfully argue &mdash; that you could not exclude in particular case the possibility that a five or six year old child might have put a match to something, and in that instance the applicant failed.  This Bill is an improvement.  The fact that the damage may have been caused by a child ought not, in reason, exclude compensation and any doubts one might have about it are ones which arise only from being blinkered by a respect for this ancient British legislation which, in a free Republic, is quite out of place.</P>
    <P>Of course if what I say were listened to by the Government, if they would scrap this practice of making local authorities <Col N="226" /> pay anything for malicious injury, this would not arise.  But where two local authorities are simultaneously made respondents, which can happen in some instances, section 11 (3) says that the compensation shall be paid in such proportions as the court deems proper. Although that is not too far away from the way the law has been up to now I must say if I were a judge I would welcome some indication as to what I was supposed to do under this subsection. Seeing that neither local authority is to blame for the damage, seeing that the inhabitants of both areas are equally free of guilt, or at least of any guilt which the Constitution permits me to impute to them, seeing that none of them has been tried for anything, seeing particularly where the identity and provenance of the wrongdoer is actually known to be from perhaps a third county, I am not so sure what I should do with this if I were a judge.  I suppose I could say equality is equity and split the thing between the two.  But is equality equity as between a rich county and a poor one?  Probably one could give good examples.  In County Mayo the produce of 1p in the £ is only £50 or £60 on the rates.  County Sligo, which is next door, has a better produce on 1p in the rates.  Would it be fair as between Mayo and Sligo, where the inhabitants of neither county could be blamed for what has happened, to divide an award evenly between them?  I cannot expect everything to be spelled out in a Bill but the Government might look at that subsection and ask themselves if it could be improved.</P>
    <P>I agree also &mdash; and I think this is a wise improvement &mdash; with the idea expressed in section 13 of conferring jurisdiction on the District Court and I agree also with the provision in section 16 whereby a local authority can settle a malicious injury claim.  Formerly that, in theory, was not possible and it was not possible because of the same antiquated English law that one could not compromise a felony; the local authority could not settle a malicious injury claim because it could not settle an issue of guilt.  I am not absolutely certain about this but part of the reason may have been a statutory <Col N="227" /> duty not to hand away the ratepayers' money without a fight.  Certainly it was the practice when I was at the Bar that the local authority not just would not but could not legally agree an issue of liability. What it could agree was the amount of the loss; it could acquiesce in the applicant's assessment of the amount of his own loss, but the issue of liability, the issue of whether the damage had in fact been maliciously caused in their area or not could not be compromised due, as I see it, merely to this antique legal history of the whole code and I agree that section 16(1) is to that extent an improvement.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say except to ask that the House be enlightened on a single point arising under section 19.  Assuming that the Government go ahead with this Bill and do not do what I suggest they should do, namely, take over the entire responsibility out of the Central Fund for malicious injury awards, what will the mechanism be whereby the amount of the excess over the produce of a rate of 20p in the £ will be refunded to the local authority?  I presume the section means &mdash; and I would like to be reassured about it &mdash; that, as between the ratepayers who are being called on to contribute, the amount of their contribution will be proportionately abated so as to bring their individual contribution proportionately down to the point where it would be as though, so to speak, the entire malicious injury bill were only 20p in the £.  Or is it intended that the entire amount will be levied on ratepayers and that the local authority would then get into its fist in pound notes an amount equivalent to the excess but with no statutory duty to make that good to the ratepayer?  I do not know whether I am making that clear or not.  Probably I am.  I would like to be reassured about that.  Apart from that I have nothing more to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  Many people here will welcome the advent of this legislation.  I realise it is too late for those who already have claims lodged for malicious damages.  But I am thinking of the person who perhaps had a business burned down maliciously and was waiting <Col N="228" /> for two, three or even four years to get his money awarded by the courts.  Not so long ago I made representations for a constituent that that had happened to. The man was literally being forced out of business because he had to wait so long for the money to come through.  Therefore this legislation is very welcome.</P>
      <P>I also welcome in this Bill the fact that these small claims can now be settled between the local authorities and the agreed party out of court.  This can clear an awful lot of work once the present load has gone through the courts and allow time to deal with the claims in excess of £2,500.  I am also pleased to see that the Minister has included in this legislation the right for the parties to agree between themselves without recourse to law claims in excess of £2,500 if they can so do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the provisions of this Bill which interested me very much was the section dealing with the compensation for damage caused by a person of unsound mind or by a child.  I was not aware until I saw that section that there was this rule that if damage was caused by people in this category malicious damages could not be claimed.  The reason I was rather surprised is that in my constituency my experience has been that when people had damage done to their cars or saw their car being crashed and spoke to the local Gardaí they were told, when they said they could identify the party who had done this, that if they did so they would not qualify for malicious damages and that they would be better off if they just forgot what the person looked like and then they would get malicious damages. I understand this is not so, that where a person is recognised as having done damage to a car and that person is not in any financial situation to pay for the damage that he or she has done, then&mdash;and I am thinking particularly of damage to motor cars because that is particularly prevalent in this city of Dublin certainly&mdash;people should know that they can in fact get malicious damages even when these people are brought to court.  I think it is tragic that the amount of malicious damage that has been caused throughout our city today by many of <Col N="229" /> these vandals has been allowed to rise to the extent that it has.  Certainly the city has very much a vested interest in keeping malicious damage to a minimum.  I would think that the sooner the Department of Justice comes up with some scheme of community services that could be served by some of these vandals to make them pay in some way for the damage that they have done the better, because the situation seems to be getting worse daily.</P>
    <P>In relation to the raising of the limit from £5 to £100 before one can claim, it is never acceptable when something of that type is raised.  But one can understand it because of the long time it has been in operation and because in other countries the threshold figure was increased much earlier.  It would be interesting if the Minister was given the figures of how much local authorities incurred last year for costs in court cases, the number of cases the courts had to handle for malicious damages and the total cost. Making it unnecessary for a claim up to £2,500 to be paid out by a court will pay dividends.  Most of the claims before the court are minor ones.  Money paid out in court cases by local authorities ultimately comes back on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on bringing up to date the repealing of the 1836 Act whereby the court could direct that the cost of meeting compensation for malicious damages could be levied on the rates of a very small locality.  This is to be welcomed.  I am glad that the Minister has included in the legislation compensation for property stolen in the course of a riot or some such disturbance.  This is long overdue and it is only just that it should be included in our legislation.  One of the major sources of delay in people getting compensation is the fact that malicious damage claims cannot be entered by the corporation or local authorities until the financial year following the claim.  As has been stated by the Minister there is a time lag of almost two years between the occurrence of the damage and payment of the award.</P>
    <P>I welcome the part of section 12 which provides for the reduction or exclusion of compensation payable to people who <Col N="230" /> have not taken reasonable precautions to protect their property.  It is about time that people found out that their carelessness or recklessness in locking up their premises or leaving their cars in such a situation where they know something could happen to them will be taken into account.  I do not know if that sort of situation will be taken into consideration but if it is it is to be welcomed.  People must be made to have a sense of responsibility for their property particularly when their fellow citizens have to pay for any damage that may occur to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the fact that personal compensation as such was not part of the Bill, that is, compensation for criminal injury to the person.  The Minister should bring this in as soon as he can because the position about assaults on people leaves a lot to be desired.  The Minister referred to the criminal injuries compensation tribunal.  That deals with people injured in the course of their duty or in the course of helping someone in distress.  I am glad the Minister will be reviewing this whole area.  It is part and parcel of malicious damage in the overall picture as I see it.  A person could be hit on the head by a drunkard, suffer concussion and be off work for a week and yet he would not have recourse to any kind of claim.</P>
    <P>The Bill as it stands contains incentives to people to protect their own property. If they do not do so properly they may find themselves paying for it by reduced compensation.  It is important to make this clear to firms.  Deputy Keating was against the section which states that unauthorised developments would not be entitled to malicious damages, that is if there was no planning permission.  I welcome this, not because it may be vindictive, but if people who fly in the face of their neighbours and the law of the land and ride roughshod over people and antagonise them, know that if the building goes on fire or the structure is knocked down no compensation will be paid to them, they may think twice about it.  It should be made widely known that any unauthorised development which is the subject of vandalism will not be considered under this Bill.  I welcome the Bill <Col N="231" /> and wish it a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past 25 years claims for malicious damage have increased eightfold.  Over the past decade the number of indictable offences recorded increased by 100 per cent.  It is bearing in mind these statistics that one must look at the Bill.  The situation is that we can brush off such statistics by merely referring to an increase in criminality in our society or we can look deeper at the problem and try to see the root causes of such appalling increases.</P>
      <P>When one is in Government one must accept with regard to such a totally appalling situation that the buck stops on the desk of the Minister for Justice and the initiatives that have to be taken to deal with the situation must come from him.  It is because of the huge increases in such claims that we tend to accept philosophically that there is no way to stop such instances, that they are part of the normal life of our society and that we must accept that this inexorable increase in crime cannot be halted.  Our outlook is shaped by that philosophy.  I am disappointed with the approach of the Government who ignore this huge increase in the number of claims for malicious damage and the terrible increase in crimes and, effectively, do not produce any initiative to turn the tide and try to reduce the level of crime.  We seem to accept annually that there must be an increase in crime.  I do not accept that that should be the situation.  Measures must be taken to ensure that crime in the broad sense and, in the specific sense, damage to property, is reduced.  It is incumbent on the Government to take steps to reduce crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seems to accept that philosophy. There is a provision in the Bill to the effect that claims under £100 in value cannot be made.  In effect that appears to be an acceptance by the Minister that claims under that sum are (a) not worth reporting to the Garda, (b) are not worth claiming for in the courts and (c) generally are not worth talking about. The attitude appears to be that where a <Col N="232" /> crime is committed &mdash; a crime is committed if a portion of a car is maliciously damaged even though it may not cost £100 to fix it &mdash; and the damage is under £100 it is not worth talking about and that nothing can or should be done about it. I worry about that philosophy which amounts to an admission of defeat by the Government in the face of the rising tide of crime.  I put it to the Minister that he and the Government should adopt a new approach in dealing with crime.  New initiatives are necessary and the tired, accepting approach in regard to the increase in crime in our society will not do in the future.  That is the major point that must be made in connection with this Bill.  It is about time it was made because unless I, and people like me, shout this from the rooftops the increase in criminality in our society will be accepted.  The lead must come from the Government. They must state that such an increase is not acceptable and there must be an all-out drive to reduce the level of criminality.</P>
    <P>Such action must be taken straight away.  Those who read newspapers on a regular basis will note that serious crimes get little coverage because they are so common.  Vandalism seems to be totally acceptable and, even worse, offences against the person are increasing.  While one has sympathy for the person whose car or home is damaged I have the strongest feelings about violence against the person.  We cannot under any circumstances accept that there is any acceptable level in our society in relation to offences against the person.  We must aim for the perfect society with everybody free to move about without fear of injury to life and limb.  I accept that we cannot expect Utopia in the near future but we must aim for it.  We must turn around our present approach and reject the acceptance of an inevitable increase in criminality. I will have an opportunity on another occasion of dealing with crime in the broader sense but the increase in the number of malicious injury claims is a reflection of this.</P>
    <P>While the Bill in its basic content tidies up a number of administrative matters it does not in any way approach the basic <Col N="233" /> problem.  Today I have dealt with a number of matters in the House including the Bill in relation to social welfare and the legislation on the conservation of wild animals but there appears to be a deliberate attempt at evasion by the Government of their responsibility in relation to crime.  There has not been any attempt to tackle the basic issues in our society that need to be tackled and while this approach continues so also will the same attitude be adopted by the ordinary citizens. The figure of £100 is not a huge sum but it is the philosophy behind accepting that damage amounting to anything less than that cannot be claimed for that I challenge.  The increase in the minimum figure is from £5 to £100.  While I have to accept that IR£5 in our present economic difficulty would not carry you very far and possibly should not take up the time of the courts, there are still many people today for whom the sum of IR£100, bad and all as the Irish £ is, represents a considerable amount.  It represents a major percentage of their entire wealth. For those who suffer damage of less than that, some possibly marginally less, it does not seem very fair to exclude them from the courts.  Maybe it is natural that I would expect that from the Fianna Fáil Party.  I always thought that that party represented the interests of the rich, looked at the interests of the rich and had the philosophy of the rich, but they should bear in mind that there may be somebody for whom the widow's mite is an enormous sum.  For maybe a council tenant or somebody who has lost a job &mdash; and there are a lot of them around nowadays, we are heading into the second hundred thousand &mdash; damage to their property of the order of £80 or £90 could be a very major thing and I believe that that is a figure that should be revised.</P>
    <P>Also, the philosophy of accepting that damage under that sum has not been worth claiming really concerns me. Whilst there are two major arguments for a revision downwards of that sum and I express considerable sympathy for somebody in poor circumstances who may suffer damage of slightly less than that sum, the point I want to stress here is the philosophy of accepting damage as not <Col N="234" /> being worth bothering about.  That outlook has extended right through the approach of this Government to dealing with crime and offences committed against the person and against property. This philosophy has resulted in a totally lacklustre, tired approach which will have to change.  Either that or the Government will have to change and I suggest that the best thing for this country is that both would happen.  For the citizens of this country who have suffered so much from all types of crime and vandalism over the last number of years that is the best hope.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that claims up to the sum of £2,500 can be dealt with in the District Court and I have always been a great believer that justice must be as close to the people as possible.  I have always been a great believer in the District Court and the advantage of ready access to the District Court which is not available to people in the Circuit Court and the High Court, obviously because of the smaller numbers and the fact that they will be sitting a considerable distance from where claimants live.  However, this has to be taken into account here.  Are the District Courts organised at the moment to deal with this type of claim, bearing in mind the proposed increase in general jurisdiction under the Courts Bill?  I know the difficulty that could arise here.  When I practised as a lawyer I knew the difficulties in the Circuit Court offices and the High Court offices and the need for staffing and equipment from the point of view of giving a proper service, having proper filing systems, making of orders, and being able to have them available within a reasonable time to the contending parties. While I have been out of practice in the District Court for a few years now I wonder if they are geared to take on this extra jurisdiction.  I wonder whether the District Court offices which I used to visit in the course of my practice will be geared for all this extra work.  I ask the Minister in his reply to deal with this situation and if they are not perhaps he will tell us what steps he proposes to take to ensure that they will be able to discharge their function effectively.  There is no point in giving jurisdiction to the District Court <Col N="235" /> unless the District Court offices are geared properly to deal with it.</P>
    <P>An aspect arising out of section 6 is the question of permitting a claim to be made in respect of property taken during a riot.  The Minister must consider seriously that this is quite an unusual situation. Once he has opened the door of compensation for loss suffered as a result of property taken has he not to look at the overall situation of the injury suffered by anybody whose property is stolen as a result of crime?  The Minister under this Bill re-enacts and updates legislation in regard to injury suffered by somebody who has property damaged, but is not far more injury suffered by somebody whose property is stolen?  I have in mind somebody whose car is damaged maliciously. Perhaps the tyres are slashed and dents put in the wings and the bonnet and the cost may be a couple of hundred pounds to fix it up and as provided by this Bill and also under existing legislation such an injured party can recover.  However, the car itself might be worth £2,000 or £4,000 and if it is stolen, except in the very unusual situation of a riot, he has no entitlement.  While the natural outlook of anybody looking at existing legislation and updating it is to look at it within the narrow confines of the earlier thinking which brought about this legislation which is related solely to malicious damage, the Minister should have a broad look to the equities involved here and to the administration of justice in the broader sense.  The basic question that I will pose to him and leave with him is: if somebody should be entitled to claim because his property is damaged maliciously, why should not a person whose property is stolen also be entitled to claim?  Where is the balance of equity in that situation?  On that note I feel I have given the Minister food for thought and I hope that he will dwell on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I have one point of substance to make and I hope the Minister will be able to treat it favourably.  I understand that where a local council has to take a case to court <Col N="236" /> and the court decides that compensation is payable by the council, the present position is that the legal costs relating to the case must be borne by the ratepayers in the local authority area; and while the amount in excess of 20p in the £ is recoverable from central funds the legal costs the council had to incur are not recoupable from Government funds. This is wrong because it is a disincentive to a local authority testing a case in court because in the event of losing the court case the costs go with the case and the council is not only liable for its own costs but also for the costs of the full litigation. Where legal fees are not recoverable there is a clear disincentive for councils to test a case in court.  Rather than have such a disincentive in a major case &mdash; and we are talking of cases where large property is involved &mdash; where there is a need to go to court the incentive should be on the council's side.  The council is protecting the ratepayers' money in the first instance and, secondly, the money of the State.  Where a council sees a need to go to court the law should favour the council and I suggest that the legal costs of a case should be recoupable to the council.  I am sure the Minister will take note of that very valid point.</P>
      <P>I had put down an amendment to the Bill but, obviously, since this would impose a potential levy on the Exchequer it would have been ruled out of order, and I would not have the opportunity of speaking on it.  I am availing of this opportunity instead.  I ask the Minister to amend one of the sections, probably section 19, and add a new subsection which would enable legal costs to be included in the overall allocation of money so that the compensation would include the legal costs associated with the claim from the point of view of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel the £100 specified in section 5 is too high.  While I realise that we must draw the line somewhere, £50 or £75 or £100 may be a lot of money to some persons.  Personally, I would opt for a figure of £50.  All public representatives are very unhappy about the existence of vandalism especially in the cities.  It seems to be an increasing illness in our society and certainly private citizens are <Col N="237" /> entitled to the protection of law in regard to malicious damage to their property. The case instanced by the previous speaker of a stolen car not being eligible for compensation seems to be an anomaly. I know of a case in my own city where a car was stolen and not recovered and apparently the owner is debarred in law from seeking compensation for what is in effect the same type of vandalism as if somebody came along with a hammer and smashed up the car.  There are certain anomalies still existing in regard to malicious damage and there is further room for improvement.  The District Court does excellent work.  It is a local court sitting every week and the justices have a &ldquo;feel&rdquo; for their areas and the crime rate, and I think the District Court should be empowered to hear these claims.  I am pleased to see that claims with £2,500 as the upper limit can be decided in District Courts.  That is good.</P>
    <P>The question was raised about backup services and the efficiency of District Courts &mdash; whether they have sufficient personnel to deal with the increased workload. I suggest the District Courts are at present overworked and that there is a need for greater investment in the system which does such excellent work which can only excite our admiration for the justices, clerks and others associated with these courts.  They do an excellent job.  We are here increasing their workload again and I think a positive decision must be made by the Government to give them greater personnel and financial resources because their workload is becoming far too great.</P>
    <P>The main point of my contribution relates to the question of legal costs.  I believe the Minister is aware of it and will give it serious consideration.  With the limiting of the increase in rates by this Government the amount of money local authorities can raise is severely restricted, and where there will be huge legal costs such as would be associated with a large case I think it incumbent on the Government now to introduce an amendment to this Bill allowing legal costs in such a case to be recouped to the local authority.  The flexibility of financing the expenditure of an authority is <Col N="238" /> severely restricted because of the limiting of increases in rates.  For the past three years credit balances held by local authorities have been whittled away slowly but surely and anything like rebuilding courthouses will completely upset a local authority's ability to provide the essential services for which they exist. It is another case of their being left with bills which they should not have to pay. There is no doubt in my mind that the essential source of funds to fight large cases should be the central Government which should back up the local council in taking cases to court where necessary.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the Government's action in terminating house improvement grants and household fuel conversion grants having regard to the necessity for prolonging the life of the national housing stock and conserving energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To that motion the Government had the courage, or perhaps I should say the cheek, to put down an amendment generally complimenting themselves or asking the House to compliment them on the housing situation and their housing programme.  Because of the necessity for conserving the housing stock encouragement should be given to people to repair their houses.  All of us know that the cost of providing new houses has risen very considerably and we know of the difficulty of replacing old houses.  The price of a new house is completely out of the reach of young married couples.  I shall give the House some statistics from the quarterly bulletin of housing statistics compiled by the Minister and his Department. Figures show that the average price of a new house in 1976 was £12,258 but that figure had jumped to £28,287 in 1980.  I do not have to remind Members of this House or young people looking for homes that this is an enormous sum, <Col N="239" /> especially when we know that the maximum grant available from local authorities is £12,000.  That leaves a gap of £16,000.  That local authority grant is available only to people whose income does not exceed £5,500 per year.  Therefore, only people who have a house to sell, who have their own site or who will do much of the work themselves will be able to consider purchasing or building a house with the aid of the local authority grant.</P>
    <P>Very many people must go to banks or building societies for finance and in the case of a house costing £28,287 the repayments will be in the region of £60 per week.  It is not possible for people in receipt of normal incomes to pay such an amount each week.  As a result of such repayments many young married women are forced to go out to work and to keep working when they would much prefer to be at home looking after their homes, and later on caring for their families. However, when repayment charges are so high the young couple must work. There is no objection to young married women working provided they want to do so.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> There is no objection whatever <Col N="240" /> to young married women working provided they want to work.  There is no suggestion from me that they should be prevented from working and earning money but we know from experience that many of these young women would prefer not to have to work especially when the first or second child arrives.  In addition, driving these young women out to work is adding to the huge unemployment figure, one that is growing dramatically.</P>
      <P>I am not telling the Minister or the Government anything they do not know. They appreciate fully that prices have escalated beyond the reach of those people who need housing.  There have been rumours in the past month or perhaps two months that the Government propose to increase substantially new house grants.  I hope they do because such an increase is long overdue.  In this connection a rumour has been circulating in this city and throughout the country for some time past that the figure will be £3,000 as from tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am just relating rumours which I have heard and cannot know whether these are right or wrong.  However, if the Minister does propose in the budget tomorrow to increase new house grants from £1,000 to £3,000, as is rumoured by people who profess to know what they are talking about, it is certainly not before its time.  It is evidence that the increase is badly needed.  The price of a house has jumped from £12,258 in 1976 to £28,287 in 1980, so it will be seen that the proposed increase of £3,000, if this is correct &mdash; and the Minister will not be in a position to either deny or confirm this figure but must be aware that wise guys are predicting or forecasting £3,000 &mdash; will not, in fact, restore the availability of houses to what it was in 1976, at a price of £12,258, because houses have jumped, not in value but in cost, to the figures that I have mentioned.  We all know that the much larger loans are far harder to get and much more difficult to finance.  If this rumour about house grants is correct, I certainly hope that there will not be a repetition of what happened when the Minister's predecessor introduced the £1,000 new house grant.  Then the price <Col N="241" /> of a house jumped from £12,258 in 1976 to £14,770 in 1977, to £18,966 in 1978 and to £23,144 in 1979.  In other words, inflation in this respect took off like a bomb immediately the last housing grant was introduced and there was no benefit whatever to house purchasers or house builders.  As a matter of fact these were much worse off.  I am putting these facts on record to show that there is a grave necessity for conserving houses where possible and prolonging the life of houses which, with the expenditure of some money, would last a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>Next I want to say &mdash; and this is relevant to the amendment &mdash; that, notwithstanding the attempt of the Government to applaud themselves for a good job done in house building for the people who badly need houses, house building has fallen behind.  The local authority house building programme has fallen behind very considerably.  The Minister stated that local authority housing completions in 1980 will reach 6,000, which is a nice round figure.  Assuming that this is correct, it will be the lowest number of houses built since 1972.  Will the Minister spell out this figure of 6,000, because again I am relying on the quarterly bulletin on housing statistics for the quarter ended 30 September 1980?  I find there that in the first quarter of 1980, 711 houses were completed; in the second quarter 1,188; and in the third quarter, 1,366.  Those three figures total, according to my mathematics, 3,665.  If the figure of 6,000 was reached in 1980 it means that 2,735 houses must have been completed in the last quarter, or almost as many as in the other three quarters.  This sounds funny to me but, even if it is correct, 6,000 houses would be the lowest number built since 1972.</P>
    <P>While completions are important for those lucky enough to be at the top of the queue and who qualify for the comparatively small number of houses made available, the people who do not qualify are more concerned with new house starts than with new house completions.  Would the Minister tell us how many local authority houses were started in 1980? We know that no money was available to local authorities for new house starts, on <Col N="242" /> houses to which they were not committed before 1980, until almost the end of September and local authorities who sought over £1 million were in some cases allocated as little as £35,000.  What is the housing programme for this year?  How many houses will be completed this year and, in order to know that, we have to know how many houses were started last year?  According to another official document issued by the Minister's Department, the number of houses at planning stage has fallen drastically by about 2,000.  I do not have the exact figure.</P>
    <P>In so far as the private sector is concerned, the Minister says that a large number of houses were built this year, I think he said a record number.  There certainly are a lot of them throughout the country unoccupied and on the market for sale.  Again, the telling figures obtained by Deputy Bruton to date represent a nice litany to show that the country is in a state of depression.  When these figures were being given by Deputy Moore we could see depression on the faces of the Taoiseach and some of his Ministers.</P>
    <P>The figures show that there was a falloff in private house building, that there must have been because the sale of cement in the last six months of 1979 declined by 21.4 per cent.  You cannot make omelettes without cracking eggs and you cannot build houses without buying cement.</P>
    <P>All this means that an increase in the grants available to house purchasers is badly needed and if this £3,000 figure is an accurate rumour &mdash; I am more convinced now than when I came in here earlier that it is &mdash; steps should be taken to see that it goes directly into the hands of house purchasers.  According to the figures given today, the number of people employed in the housing industry has fallen.  On a base of 100 in 1975, there were 95.8 employed in 1980 in the housing industry as against 100.2 in 1979. They are not my figures: they were given today by the Taoiseach's Minister of State at Question Time.</P>
    <P>The figures I have been giving and what I have been saying by way of comment, are meant to convince the Minister and <Col N="243" /> the House that housing grants and home improvement grants are necessary to allow people who cannot buy new houses because of astronomical price rises to improve and make do with the houses they have.  If that problem was never there, the Government are in honour bound to make generous housing grants available.  In abolishing the existing grants they behaved in a disgraceful manner, completely reneging on the promises on which they were elected.</P>
    <P>At page 20 of their manifesto in 1977 they stated that Fianna Fáil believed then that as many families as possible should own their own houses and that those who owned houses should be able to keep them.  Now the Government have made it nearly impossible to buy a house.  We put before them a policy on mortgages based on inflation and incomes.  That policy was received by Deputy O'Donoghue, a former Minister, as nothing new.  He said Fianna Fáil had been thinking about it.  But they have not done anything about it.  He said he hoped that when they had introduced it they would not be accused of stealing Fine Gael's thunder.  On the first day the present Minister for the Environment spoke he referred to an inflation-related, income-related housing policy.  The only problem he pointed to in this respect was in relation to what would happen to people operating local authority housing finance schemes throughout the country.  He completely overlooked that such schemes would be necessary for smaller loans but the Government have not made these available, and though in their investment plan they seemed to be talking about something of the sort, they are not making it easier to buy new houses.</P>
    <P>In their manifesto Fianna Fáil assured the people they would make it easier and cheaper to keep houses.  In paragraph 6 of their policy on local government they said they would introduce a new grant scheme for house improvement.  However, we have less favourable house improvement grants indicating an intention to abolish such grants.  It is a despicable performance.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil took over, a grant of <Col N="244" /> £400 subject to a means test of £10 valuation was available for house improvements. Anybody who knows anything about Ireland will agree that old houses which need repair would fall within the £10 valuation category.  It is true to say that having got rid of that grant scheme Fianna Fáil introduced a home improvemnt scheme which appeared substantially to improve the old one.  They made the grant available to all, irrespective of valuation, so that even millionaires could qualify whether the valuation of the house was £60 or £10, and they increased the amount from £400 to £600, abolishing the county council's contribution of £200.</P>
    <P>However, at the beginning of last year, from 21 January, with a week's notice and provided that there was not a commitment by the applicant to a contractor or that he had commenced work, the grant was no longer available.  The people who came badly out of this were those who could not afford and never will be able to afford in the foreseeable future to buy a house, people who would try to repair the houses they had, to replace faulty roofs or replace old leaking windows and so on.  Here we are not talking about essential repairs which would keep a house standing for two or three years until God calls the occupant: we are talking about people who want to repair their houses so that they can expect them to last for 20 or 25 years with the help of Government grants.</P>
    <P>Another very deserving class have also been hit and they are the many people buying out local authority houses which have been in existence for the past 50 or 60 years, some of which have no indoor toilet or proper kitchen.  The people who buy these houses convert them, if they can afford it, into little castles.  They replace old windows and doors with hardwood timber and build on indoor toilets. These people are not now being encouraged to do such works and the county councils cannot afford to carry out repairs because the Minister for the Environment has turned off the finance tap and ensured that local authority houses will be allowed to deteriorate.  This is the kind of people the Minister has hit.  It is a shame and a disgrace.  The people who <Col N="245" /> own such houses are not being given the necessary assistance to prolong the lives of their houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, could not go back to a reasonable means test when he found that people living in fashionable areas in Dublin and elsewhere were availing of the grants to put in aluminium windows, add additional rooms and make all sorts of other improvements.  If the Minister introduced a means test he would be saying that Deputy Tully was right and that the Fianna Fáil manifesto was only a stunt to get them over the election.  Of course he could not do it, so the whole scheme was chopped and in the process of cutting out abuses the deserving cases were also hit.</P>
    <P>At the same time the Minister also abolished the energy conservation grants and all the Ministers are now blaming the mess into which they have got the country on the cost of imported oil.  Everything that has befallen this country is blamed <i>in toto</i> on the cost of oil, yet on 21 January last year it was announced that no more grants would be payable for changing over from oil-fired heating to systems using solid fuel.  Of course the Minister for Energy, formally Minister for Finance, had to make his mark in the Department of Energy.  How did he do so?  By substituting for these energy conservation grants of up to £600 a new grant of £50 for attic insulation.  What have we come to and where are we going?</P>
    <P>Not only did the terminating of the housing grants scheme impose hardship on people who wanted to avail of it but those who had applied and were encouraged to rush in during the last week of the scheme are being treated in a disgraceful way.  The housing section of the Department of the Environment is in a state of chaos, notwithstanding the extra Minister of State at that Department. The Minister seems to be surprised at that but if he represented a rural constituency he would know that it is impossible to get a grant.  Papers are lost and inspections do not take place and people cannot get the grants to which they are entitled. If one gets a letter from the Department saying that a grant has been or will be paid or hears of someone who has <Col N="246" /> actually received it, one is very surprised. If the Minister expresses surprise at what I am saying it must be that I am particularly unfortunate because much of my time is taken up by people who have completed reconstruction work and qualified before the axe fell and who yet cannot obtain grants to which they are entitled. I want the Minister to say when the backlog of work in the Department will be cleared and when people who are qualified for grants will receive them. There has been a disgraceful performance in this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister can propose to delete from my motion all the words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;takes note of the action taken by the Government to ensure continued progress on a comprehensive basis in the building industry and, in particular, of its success in securing an unprecedented level of housing completions in 1980.&rdquo; Everybody knows that this is nonsense and that house prices have gone beyond the reach of those who wish to purchase them.  What about the people who were led by the manifesto to believe that a better and more favourable scheme of house improvement grants would be introduced?  What have the Government to say to them?  Their plight has been aggravated and exacerbated by the fact that housing prices have gone far beyond their reach.  What about the unfortunates who wish to repair the council house they are buying, the price of which has been raised by the Minister?  Year after year since this Government came into office the prices of council houses and the annuities which must be paid have been increased substantially.</P>
    <P>There is an unanswerable case for my resolution.  If the new house grant is increased tomorrow by £3,000 I will be the first to welcome it but I appeal to the Minister with all the sincerity I can command to make sure that we do not have a repetition of escalating house prices such as occurred after the introduction of the last grant.</P>

    <P>I have great respect for Deputy Fitzpatrick and his long experience as Shadow Minister for the Environment.  I regret he will no longer be my Shadow Minister. However, I look forward to seeing him on the front benches opposite for many years as Shadow Minister for another Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick started by discussing spiralling house prices.  I would like to give him some figures.  Since January 1973 there has been close correspondence between increases in prices of private new houses of comparable standard, house building costs and average earnings of adult male workers.</P>
    <P>The trend in increases in house prices, house building costs and earnings is, as follows.  In the case of new house prices, there was an increase of 113 per cent during the period of the Coalition.  From mid-1977 to the third quarter of 1980 there has been an increase of 84.6 per cent.  In the case of house building costs there was an increase of 133 per cent in the period 1973-1977 and under this Government there was an increase of 52.3 per cent.  The average earnings of adult male workers increased by 126 per cent during the time of the Coalition and roughly 53 per cent during period from mid-1977 up to the end of September 1980.  Between 1976 and 1980 there was an estimated 9 per cent improvement in the standards of privately built houses.  The CRV system was introduced in February 1973.  The effect of the control was diminished in 1976 under the Coalition when the scope of the new house grants scheme was reduced.  The CRV system has been extended on several occasions since July 1977 and CRVs are now required for practically all new house purchases for which loans are obtained, excluding certain <Col N="248" /> flats, and for all grant-aided houses. Since September 1980 the CRV system has been put on a firm statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested there should be an increase to £3,000 for new house grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to labour the point that when he was a Member of the Coalition Government house prices and wages more than doubled &mdash; new house grants were not increased by a single pound.  That the present grant still provides an adequate incentive for persons to become home owners is proved by facts, that the number of new house grants allocated increased from 9,330 in 1979 to 10,016 in 1980.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to what he called a slow-down in the local authority housing programme.  I will deal at greater length with this later.  This Government are fully committed to a steady ongoing output of between 6,000 and 6,300 local authority dwellings every year.  Has there been a slow-down?  The best yardstick of work in progress is the number of men employed on the programme.  At 30 November 1976 when the Coalition were in office 6,043 men were employed.  At 30 November 1977 when the Fianna Fáil Government were reviving the programme 6,742 men were employed.  At 30 November 1979 the figure was 6,750. At the end of last November the total employed on local authority housing was 7,291, the highest figure of employment at any month's end ever.  This belies the point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the drop of 21 per cent in cement sales during the past six months.  If he looks at the figures more closely he will see that there were significant signs of an improvement in that situation.  This is due largely to the action taken by the Government under the second national understanding where considerable money was put into the building industry at the end of last year.  The Government's investment plan provides substantial increases in roads and sanitary <Col N="249" /> service investment.  This has been welcomed by representatives of the building industry, the CIF and the CII and should result in increasing output and employment.</P>
    <P>At a time when there are so many matters of live and important national interest which could well be the subject of discussion in this House, it gives me no joy to see parliamentary time being taken up in a completely negative fashion debating just one aspect of an interrelated package of housing policies introduced by the Government slightly more than a year ago.</P>
    <P>It is a measure of the level of responsibility of the party which moved this motion that the topic raised tonight was already fully debated twice in Dáil Éireann and that not one new iota has been adduced in the opening speech to justify our traversing the same ground again.  As o their bona fides in deploring the termination of part of the scheme of house improvement grants, one has only to look at their own record while in office from 1973-77 when they deliberately set about dismantling the whole system of housing grants by the introduction of restrictive means tests and maximum valuation limits. So effective were these measures that the total amount paid out by the Department in housing grants fell from £7.8 million in their first year of office to £4.3 million in 1977.  Compare that record with the £27 million paid last year and the £28.5 million which the Government are providing in 1981 and you will understand my questioning the motive and the objective in raking up this matter once again.  However, in case any members of the public might be misled by statements made by Deputies opposite, I am left with no alternative to setting the facts on the record once again.</P>
    <P>House improvement grants cannot be considered in isolation from other aspects of housing policy.  In turn, as the Government's Investment Plan 1981 published earlier this month, clearly established, housing policies must be considered in the wider context of social and infrastructural services generally and ultimately as part of the overall national building programme.  This is what government <Col N="250" /> is all about.  In their narrow and selective approach to one relatively minor aspect of building, the Deputies who support this motion show once again that they would not be a creditable alternative Government.</P>
    <P>To begin, let me go back a year in time. Before I finish tonight, I shall, unfortunately, have to go back somewhat further. When the phasing out of certain house improvement grants was announced in January 1980, the Government pointed out that local authorities would be asked to carry out a detailed assessment of accumulated housing needs and prospective needs for the following five years and that, arising from these assessments, the Government would develop an appropriate and comprehensive strategy for housing, well into the eighties.  This involved the most comprehensive and sophisticated housing survey ever undertaken in this State.  I expect to receive the detailed assessment from local authorities over the next month or two and the information obtained as a result of the surveys of the housing stock in their areas and their consideration of possible developments relating to household formation will assist me in devising policies concerning the national housing programme and also ways and means of ensuring that the existing staff is adequately maintained&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, as an initial part of my approach to the matter of house improvements, I intend to outline to local authorities very shortly a new and imaginative policy relating to the future financing of improvements to their rented housing stock.  I know Deputy Fitzpatrick will be pleased about that as he mentioned <Col N="251" /> the improvements to the rented housing stock.</P>
      <P>In January 1980, the Government also announced that they proposed to re-deploy the capital resources available for housing in order to maximise the national benefits and, in particular, to apply public funds to assisting categories and individuals in relation to their genuine need for such supports.</P>
      <P>The provision for housing capital expenditure by the Exchequer in 1981 is £242 million.  This represents an increase of 33 per cent on the original provision of £183 million for 1980 and an increase of 20 per cent on the estimated outturn of £201 million.  In fact, in 1981, the amount of money we are providing for housing shows an increase of 34 per cent in real terms as compared with 1977.  On the other hand, while the Coalition Government were in power, expenditure dropped by 57 per cent in real terms between 1975 and 1977.  This shows very clearly where their priorities were during their last two years in office.</P>
      <P>In terminating some grants, the Government looked at ways of compensating people of modest means who would otherwise suffer hardship.  Such people are more than compensated for the termination of open-ended grants by large increases in local authority house improvement loans and in the qualifying income limits.  The maximum unsecured loan which had been increased from £200 to £600 in November 1977 was raised to £1,000 in respect of work started on or after 1 February 1980.  Where security can be provided, a loan of up to £4,000 may be advanced.  The interest rate on these loans is considerably lower than that charged by commercial lending agencies.  In February 1980 the income limits for these loans was increased from £4,000 to £5,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies supporting the original motion may attempt to cloud the issue by giving misleading figures for expenditure, but let us take a more simple yardstick. When it comes to the question of total new house completions, the present Government's record speaks for itself.  When the Coalition Government took up office <Col N="252" /> in 1973, we handed over to them a housing programme which had a completion rate of 25,000 well within its sights.  Completions rose to 26,900 in 1975, but by then the Coalition Government had run out of steam.  Completions fell by almost 3,000 to 24,000 in 1976.  In the first six months of 1977, the annual completion rate had dropped to 21,000 before they were voted out of office.  Since then we have effected a steady recovery.  Completions increased to 25,400 in 1978, to 26,500 in 1979 and to an all-time record of 27,785 last year.  This achievement did not happen accidentally.  It was the result of the development of appropriate policies over the past few years.  Let us consider these policies and contrast them with the performance of the Coalition Government while they were in power.</P>
    <P>The number of non-local authority house completions increased from 16,700 in 1976 to an estimated record level of 21,785 last year.  In other words, there were 5,000 more private houses built last year than in 1976 and this achievement no doubt considerably helped young couples who were seeking to buy their first home.  While the Coalition were in power, the number of private house completions dropped from 18,600 in 1973 to 16,700 in 1976.</P>
    <P>In 1977, we introduced a grant of £1,000 for first time owner/occupiers of new houses.  This grant replaced a grant based on restrictive income limits which the Coalition Government had imposed in 1976.  Since 1977, the SDA loan and income limits were increased on three occasions by a total of 166 per cent and 134 per cent, respectively.  The Coalition Government allowed these limits to remain static between September 1973 and July 1977, despite the fact that house prices and earnings more than doubled during that period.  Expenditure on SDA loans increased from £17 million in 1977 to an estimated £63 million in 1980 and the provision for this year is £93 million.</P>
    <P>The impact of building societies in private housing investment has expanded considerably in recent years.  Total advances by the societies increased from £119 million in 1977 to an estimated £270 million last year.  With effect from August <Col N="253" /> 1979 all registered societies were asked to:</P>
    <P>(a) allocate at least 70 per cent of available mortgage finance in providing mortgages for house purchasers whose mortgage requirements did not exceed £20,000.</P>
    <P>(b) require that certificates of reasonable value be furnished by all applicants for mortgages for the purchase of new houses and</P>
    <P>(c) allocate at least 40 per cent of all loans for the purchase of new houses.</P>
    <P>In keeping with this policy of encouraging the application of the bulk of their funds to borrowers in the lower loan bands and in particular to new house loans, societies financed the purchase of about 7,500 new house loans in 1980.  The fact that societies maintained a high rate of approvals last year augurs well for 1981.  It is estimated that they will have over £300 million available to them which will finance the purchase of approximately 7,000 new houses.</P>
    <P>A temporary subsidy was introduced last year which enabled building societies to increase their investment rates and let mortgage rates stand at 14.15 per cent. With the general downward movement of interest rates, there is now no need for the subsidy, and the societies have been enabled to reduce their mortgage rates by 1 per cent.  Since 1977, the maximum amount of personal interest &mdash; including house mortgage interest &mdash; qualifying for income tax relief has been increased from £2,000 to £4,800.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite have been critical from time to time about increases in house prices &mdash; carefully ignoring the concurrent increases in average earnings. One has only to look at the remarkable growth since 1977 in home ownership as indicated in new house completions to realise that house prices have not moved beyond the purchasing capacity of the general public.</P>
    <P>At the same time this Government have been genuinely concerned about the control of new house prices.  A Fianna Fáil Government introduced the first <Col N="254" /> ever form of control on such prices in 1973.  While the Coalition were in power, they exercised little or no control over rising house prices and costs.  In fact, the system of house price control was largely undermined by the income limits which they imposed on the new house grant system in 1976, thus greatly lessening the scope of the controls which were associated with that system.  Since 1977, the form of control of new house prices has been extended on several occasions. CRVs are now required for practically all new house purchases for which loans are obtained excluding only a very limited number of flats, and for all grant-aided houses.  Since September 1980 the CRV system has been put on a firm statutory basis, and provision has been introduced to enable appeals to the courts by any builder dissatisfied with the operation of the controls.  I regard it as a vote of confidence in the equitable manner in which the system is operated by my Department that no builder has, so far, felt constrained to have recourse to the courts.</P>
    <P>In the area of non-profit housing, a grant is available since 1979 to meet a substantial part of the administrative costs of the National Association of Building Co-operatives.  In 1978, an improved package of financial assistance to voluntary housing associations providing housing for elderly persons came into operation.  Again, the Coalition fell down on the job in as much as they did not take any steps to assist non-profit housing bodies between 1973 and 1977.</P>
    <P>Another way in which private housing activity was encouraged was that the subsidisable cost limit on each housing site developed by local authorities and approved bodies for modestly priced private housing was increased from £900 to £1,500.  This limit had remained unchanged between 1972 and 1977.</P>
    <P>When the Coalition took up office in 1973, they set out in a determined fashion to increase the rate of local authority housing completions.  They succeeded in reaching a completion figure of almost 8,800 in 1975.  They then realised that the country could not afford such a high proportion of council houses out of the total <Col N="255" /> of new house completions.  During their last year in office, in 1977, the completion rate had dropped by almost 2,500 to an annual level of 6,300.  Since then, the annual rate of completions has been maintained at a steady level ranging from 6,000 to 6,300.  This is infinitely preferable to the peaks and valleys in output which occurred under the previous Administration.</P>
    <P>Low-rise mortgages were advanced for the first time by local authorities in 1977 and the number of these loans advanced for the purchase of private houses has been of the order of 700 annually.  Over the last three years the number of tenants and prospective tenants of council houses who have either qualified for a low-rise mortgage or obtained a council house on a tenancy basis ranged from 6,700 to 7,000.  When the number of casual vacancies in council houses is taken into account, the total number of persons qualifying for such houses or mortgages has been about 9,000 in each of the last few years.</P>
    <P>Having put the subject of this motion into its proper and wider perspective I would like to deal with its limited and specific terms.  I welcome the opportunity given to me by the Opposition to deal in detail with the Government's reasons for terminating certain house improvement grants, and in doing so I will once again remind the Deputies opposite, however much they may dislike it, of their miserable record in housing grants during their term of office.</P>
    <P>The Government did not make their decision lightly in January 1980.  House improvement grants, in one form or another, have existed since 1924 and, over the years, made an important contribution to helping people to conserve and improve their houses.  But it must be kept in mind that housing grants have always been one of the components in financing the element of the housing programme. They cannot be considered in isolation from the other elements of housing policy concerned with improving the quality of the national housing stock, especially the scheme of loans at relatively low interest rates, to which I have <Col N="256" /> already referred and which were greatly increased by the present Government.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite choose also to overlook the other house improvement grants schemes which have been retained &mdash; the group water and group sewerage facilities grants, the scheme to help voluntary organisations adapt existing dwellings in order to provide decent housing for old people, the grants to make houses suitable for persons suffering from physical handicap or severe mental illness and the essential repairs grants.  The Fine Gael motion blandly ignores these factors, and, in highlighting the need to conserve energy, overlooks the highly popular and successful scheme of grants introduced last year by the Department of Energy to encourage householders to reduce energy consumption in their dwellings.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the extent of the demands on the Exchequer, it was evident that public expenditure in 1980 had to be controlled, more particularly in the light of trends in the national and international economic climate.  Radical measures had to be taken without delay to bring the expenditure on housing within the extent of the public funds which could be provided and to re-deploy resources in the manner I have indicated. It was in this context that the decision was taken to phase out certain parts of the house improvement grants scheme.</P>
    <P>I stress once again that only parts of the overall grants scheme were ended. The Government looked in detail at the different categories of applicants and of works which had been benefiting.  The works assisted were certainly wide-ranging. Grants were being paid for the provision of works such as sun-parlours and playrooms, the conversion of garages into livingrooms and the building of extra rooms which were not needed to relieve overcrowding.  It is understandable that people should seek as good a standard of housing for themselves and their families as they can achieve, but they cannot reasonably expect the State to contribute towards the cost of non-essential improvements at the expense of people who need extra accommodation for their families or who must carry out urgent <Col N="257" /> repairs and who cannot do so without some help from the State.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision in announcing the package of changes in the loans and grants was made on the basis of these priorities.  The payment of a grant of up to £600 to people changing their oil-fired central heating to an expensive solid-fuel burning unit could not continue to be a priority in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>During the past few years, a significant increase has occurred in the numbers of new houses being provided with solid-fuel systems.  Nowadays, practically every scheme of houses has such a system. I might add that poor people did not, in general, avail of these grants. Consequently, where hard decisions had to be made this pilot scheme had to be terminated.  In passing, I might suggest that with the constantly escalating costs of heating oil, many householders find that, over a period, the change to solid-fuel heating can be self-financing.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Government in announcing the termination of certain grants on 21 January 1980 did not follow the lead given by the Coalition when they restricted new house and reconstruction grants in 1976 and 1977 respectively. Without any advance warning, the Coalition imposed income limits and valuation limits overnight consequently excluding people who had entered into binding commitments or purchased materials in the expectation of getting grants.  In contrast, this Government allowed a period of grace up to 1 February 1980 to enable people in similar circumstances to submit applications.  Later on, applications were accepted which reached the Department after 1 February but which had been posted at a time by which they could reasonably be expected to arrive in the Department by that date. The result was that almost 46,000 applications were accepted following the announcement of the termination of the grants.  In fact, between 1 January and 1 February 1980 about 50,000 applications were received and accepted, corresponding to practically the entire intake for 1979.  As well, the final date of 1 October 1980 for the completion of works and <Col N="258" /> claiming of grants was extended to 31 March 1981.</P>
    <P>I come again to the Opposition's sorry record on housing grants.  When they came into office in March 1973 they inherited various grants schemes &mdash; new house and improvement.  The State new house grant was generally of the order of £300 to £325 and was paid mainly to builders, except where applicants were building their own houses.  Higher grants were paid to farmers and to people on low incomes.  The State reconstruction grant had a maximum of £200, the water grant £75, the sewerage facilities grant £25 and the essential repairs grant £80. The maximum recoupment paid by my Department to local authorities in respect of handicapped persons grants was £400, which meant that the maximum grant paid by the local authorities rarely exceeded £800.  Local authorities paid supplementary grants corresponding to the State grants in respect of new houses, reconstruction and water and sewerage.</P>
    <P>What did the Coalition do in their four years of office?  Did they improve the grants about which they are now shedding crocodile tears?  Did they introduce any new scheme of grants?  The simple and concise answer is: no, they did not. Let me suggest that &ldquo;crocodile tears&rdquo; describes the motion put on the Order Paper by Fine Gael.  Their record in Government, when they had the reins of office and when they could have done something for the people that they now cry for, was so deplorable that they should have the good grace to blush about putting down a motion of this type. I would commend the amendment in my own name to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I cannot say that the Minister here was responsible for either the ills or successes of the Department because he has not been long enough there.  But I congratulate the officials of the Department on the tremendous number of local authority houses which they have built in the last 12 months.  Unlike my predecessor, unlike the people who were in Opposition when I was in Government, I am prepared to accept their word and to <Col N="259" /> believe that they are telling the truth when they say it.  That was not the attitude of Fianna Fáil here; when the figures were put up they denied them and tried to make out that the officials of the Department of Local Government were in cahoots with the Government and were telling lies.  I am not prepared to do that.  I accept that if the Government say it is so, then it is so.  I would advise the Minister when he comes into Opposition &mdash; and that will not be too long now &mdash; to follow suit.</P>
      <P>My comment on what the Minister has just said here tonight is, as the English comic says, &ldquo;what a load of rubbish&rdquo;.  If he really believes half the things he said here he is the most gullible man not alone in this House but in Ireland.  When Fianna Fáil were in office they had their plans, as they always have.  There is one thing that can be said about Fianna Fáil and that is that they always have plans. The late Seán Lemass, for whom I had a great admiration, always said that success was around the corner, prosperity was around the corner.  Fianna Fáil always had something around the corner, something they were going ahead with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They went into great detail about the number of houses which they felt would be required in the late seventies and coming into the eighties and, having deliberated long about it, they decided that if they were to build 20,000 houses it would be all that the country would require. The Coalition showed that they were in fact talking through their hats by increasing the number so that in four years we succeeded in having built here 101,000 houses which is an average of over 25,000 houses per year.  We showed that Fianna Fáil did not know what they were talking about and were not prepared to face up to the situation.  They said what they thought would suit themselves and the figure they came up with was around 20,000.  The Minister is apparently correct in saying that there were 21,000 houses built in 1972 but the reason for that was that the previous year over 2,000 houses which should have been recorded were held over because of a technical hitch, to use the media term, and they <Col N="260" /> were included in the next year's statistics so that the number of houses actually built in 1972 is down to 19,000.  We are proud that we did show Fianna Fáil that the houses were required, could be built and could be paid for.</P>
    <P>The funny thing about it all is that Fianna Fáil, when they were in Opposition &mdash; and I will again absolve the present Minister who was not there &mdash; kept repeating all the time that those houses were not built but when they got back into power they were definitely going to wipe us off the face of the earth with the number of houses they could build and on more than two occasions a gentleman who is no longer in politics as such stated here that he felt that Fianna Fáil would be able to build 30,000 houses.  I agree that they did very well last year by building 27,785 houses.  But they are still a long way off from the 30,000.</P>
    <P>They also said that the number of people employed would grow so much that there would be 50,000 people employed in the building industry.  We know from the figures given here today what the situation is in regard to employment in the building industry.  We also know from the record of the cement sales over the past two years what the situation is.  The only thing I can say is that they must have gone back to the old system of building houses with mud and straw because they are certainly not using cement.  I was sorry for Deputy Moore, the Minister, today because he was in a very awkward position which he should not have had to try to defend.  But he tried manfully to defend the fact that the sales of cement had dropped and the number of houses had increased by saying that they must have been using imported cement.  I would be interested in the reply to that when the Minister is answering.</P>
    <P>Despite what the Minister has been saying, the real kernel of the trouble is that Fianna Fáil in their manifesto said first of all that they were going to make it easier for people to own and improve and look after their houses and having said that, at the first opportunity they got, they wiped out completely the improvement grants.  That may be all-right for people who live in good new <Col N="261" /> modern houses and for whom grants are not a priority to keep houses in repair.  I would like to give this lesson to the Minister for nothing.  It does not matter a damn how many new houses are built here.  If we are not able to keep the older houses in repair the housing stock must drop.  The position we are in now is that the housing stock is dropping because people are unable to get money to keep the older houses in repair.</P>
    <P>I am amused at the Minister talking about loans and saying that they increased the amount of the loan and the income limits so that people could get loans.  Does the Minister not know that the one thing they did not increase was the amount of money which was being given for these loans?  If one offers bigger loans one cannot give as many loans out of the same amount of money.  This is what the Department did not alone with regard to the question of secured and unsecured loans for repairing houses but in relation to the SDA loans.  I was a member of Meath County Council for many years and they asked the Minister for nearly £2.5 million for SDA loans and for local authority houses this year and got less than £1.25 million.  The Minister should not cod himself because he is not codding the House or anybody else about the fact that the SDA loans are available.</P>
    <P>Let us come to the question of the amount of money available from the building societies.  There was a tremendous increase in the amount of money available to the building societies under two headings because of an Act which was passed in my time.  This allowed pension funds to be channelled into building societies, because there is now trustee status for building societies and because we joined the European Monetary Fund and insisted on the repatriation of money which was mainly in Britain.  A large amount of money came back here and went into the building societies, a very good thing.  Unfortunately it is the only good thing about the EMF because now we have suffered a devaluation of almost 25 per cent, thanks to Fianna Fáil and their foresight in seeing what was going to happen.</P>
    <P>I am amused when I listen to the <Col N="262" /> Fianna Fáil spokesmen, particularly somebody as eloquent as the present Minister, putting forward the cases for Fianna Fáil.  He excelled himself here tonight because he even laid claim to the low rise mortgage.  Does he not know that the low rise mortgage was introduced by me and the Coalition Government?  Is he not aware of that or has he got his lines crossed or is he just chancing his arm, feeling that if the newspapers pick it up it will be accepted and nothing more will be said about it?  God knows they have little enough to claim credit for and if they could claim credit for this it might be a little bit of help to them.</P>
    <P>I do not know where the Minister got the idea about the CRV not being operated properly during the time the Coalision Government were in power because while a Fianna Fáil Minister was responsible for introducing it it did not come into operation until I took over.  Looking back on it, I have grave doubts as to whether it would have been introduced if there had not been a change of Government. But I am prepared again to back the Department officials no matter who they are, no matter what posts they hold in the Department.  They operated the CRV to the best of their ability then as they are doing now.  These snide attacks on those officials are something which should not be engaged in.  The Minister talked about the fact that he has called for a survey of housing in all local authority areas and Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out that a survey was done before.  It might not have been done as recently as Deputy Fitzpatrick's memory suggested, but it is not too long ago.  I remember it particularly because of the fact that it showed County Mayo as having an appalling number of substandard houses.  However, after four years of Coalition Government County Mayo has as fine a housing stock as any other county.  The Minister might check his facts before he starts talking about this sort of thing.</P>
    <P>The amendment introduced by the Government about their record suggests that they do not know the facts about new houses.  In 1976 the average cost of <Col N="263" /> a three bedroom house was £12,258.  In 1980 the cost of the same house was £28,287.  The Minister says &ldquo;Did we not increase the new house grant to £1,000? But one cannot wipe out an increase of £16,000 by giving an extra couple of hundred pounds and that is all it was.  To those who needed help to buy a house we gave £625 in normal cases and over £900 to people who were in really bad conditions and to small farmers.  The Members of the Fianna Fáil front bench came in here in force to shout across the House at me when in the Coalition Government when I introduced a means test for both new houses and for the reconstruction of houses.  I make no apology for that because I believe that while resources are scarce those who need are the people who should get and those who do not need should not get a hand out from the State in order to increase their riches.  If there is plenty of money there is no reason why there should not be an incentive to people who do not need it, but when money is scarce, as it was and as it now is, the thing to do is to introduce a means test and give to those who need it.  Fianna Fáil did not accept that; everybody should get not alone the grant they were getting but much more.  They told people to wait until they got into power.  However, when they came to power the grants went altogether and many houses badly in need of repair are not being repaired because people have not got the money to repair them.</P>
    <P>In relation to the £400 grant for repairs which Deputy Burke sneered at, they applied mainly to people who were very poor.  Perhaps Deputy Burke does not understand this but there are many poor people who are very independent and when they wanted to repair their houses they paid for it, as they went along.  They did what they could and then saved to complete the job.  But the Fianna Fáil Government put a deadline down and told them that if they did not have their houses repaired they would not get any more money so that now unfortunate people who paid every shilling they earned to repair their old houses will not get the extra money they need.  A sum of <Col N="264" /> £100 or £200 is nothing to a Member of the Dail or to a Minister, but it is an awful lot to some poor fellow who could not buy a pair of boots because he repaired his house.  The Minister should have a good hard look at that.  It is not too late yet, and even if his time here is not long he could earn the gratitude of some of these poor old people by giving them their right.  They did not know that the money would be stopped.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely at one with Deputy Fitzpatrick in relation to the heating grant.  The heating grant was introduced with four different versions.  The situation was that a man or woman who wanted to instal central heating and who had for instance an immersion heater for hot water did not qualify but the man with central heating who wanted to install solid fuel heating could have both with a grant.  That is the way it was interpreted, not because the departmental officials decided it but because the Minister made such a hames of it.  Eventually everybody except one section, usually the County Council tenant or the person who bought a council house, could get it.</P>
    <P>The scheme did introduce a lot of people into burning solid fuel and as such it saved a lot of oil.  The Minister said that people turning to solid fuel saved money because of this fact.  Obviously the Minister has not recently met anybody who has bought an eight stone bag of coal for £4.60.  It is the most expensive central heating that one could have.  A lot of honest people sell coal, but I would advise people who think that the eight stone bag is rather small to weigh it, because I have heard of seven stone bags being passed off for eight stone bags by some coal merchants and it is dear enough without that sort of racket.</P>
    <P>In the budget tomorrow the Minister or the Government may reintroduce the reconstruction or house improvement grant and many more of the grants they did away with.  I warn them that if it is not done in the budget, when his Government go out, if the Labour Party have anything to do with it, we will reintroduce it because it did more to help the poor than anything else.  If we want to encourage people to spend their own money <Col N="265" /> repairing their houses we should give them a little money to do it and not do what Fianna Fáil did, wipe the whole darn lot out because they wanted to buy an executive jet or something.  When the <Col N="266" /> next election comes along, they will know what they will get for those antics.</P>

      <P>The biomass demonstration project, which is in progress at a number of locations, is proceeding satisfactorily.  The demonstration programmme involves the planting, <Col N="39" /> maintenance, and harvesting of short rotation forestry and its subsequent combustion for electricity generation.  During this project 200 hectares (500 acres) of coppicing trees and 200 hectares (500 acres) of single stem conifers will be grown over a period of five years, at Bellacorick, County Mayo, in addition to other planting at Clonsast, County Offaly.  This demonstration project is a pioneering effort in the technical development of short rotation forestry.</P>
      <P>During 1980, 40 hectares of coppicing trees were planted at Bellacorick by Bord na Móna, of which 28 were on deep bog and 12 on cutaway bog.  As a result of earlier experimentation two species of willow and one species of alder were selected for planting.  In addition, a further 40 hectares of single-stem trees have been planted.  Further plantings are currently proceeding.  The progress of these plantings is being closely monitored.  The second phase of this programme will proceed from April 1981 and is budgeted at £7.6 million for a three-four year period.</P>

      <P>Ireland's percentage share of the Regional Fund is fixed at 5.94 per cent of the total fund as opposed to 6.46 per cent prior to the revision of Regional Fund quotas to take account of Greek accession to the Communtiy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is true that, measured against the differences in the level of economic development in different regions of the Community, the amount allocated to Ireland from the Regional Fund for 1981 is not adequate, it must be accepted that in the present Community budgetary situation it was not to be expected that agreement to a larger amount could have been reached among the member states.  The <Col N="40" /> total amount of the Regional Fund for 1981 was increased to take account of Greek accession to the Community and, while Ireland's percentage share decreased slightly, there has been no consequent reduction in our cash receipts. Indeed since 1975, when the fund came into operation, the amount we receive annually has steadily increased from £8.3 million in 1975 to approximately £60 million in 1981.</P>
    <P>However, I can assure the Deputy that we are continuing to press for an increase in the resources of the Regional and Social Funds which, as I have said, cannot as they stand at present be considered as adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if requests from Irish citizens to embassies for permission to emigrate are the subject of inquiries by such embassies to the Garda Síochána or the security forces in general; whether such inquiries are responded to; if so, in what way; the criteria laid down for processing such inquiries; and the number of such inquiries dealt with in the past ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  However, persons seeking to emigrate from this country to certain other States are required by the authorities of those States to produce what is usually referred to as a certificate of character from the Garda Síochána.  The approach to the Garda Síochána is not made by the embassy but by the persons concerned.  To facilitate such applicants, as a service to them, the Garda Síochána issue the required document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> The certificate is primarily a certificate that the applicant was not convicted of an indictable crime, except as may be stated on the certificate.  (As it is issued at the request of the person concerned, no question of confidentiality arises in relation to the disclosure of a criminal record).  There is a general understanding that, in giving such a certificate, the Garda need not take account of any convictions recorded against a person under the age of 17 years.</P>
    <P>Depending on the procedural requirements of the State in question, the document is sent either to the diplomatic or consular mission concerned or to the applicant himself.  Where it is sent to the applicant, it carries a stamp that it is issued only for the information of the particular authorities concerned.  It is not therefore intended as, or available for use as, a general reference such as a private citizen might issue.  A record of the number of the documents in question issued by the Garda Síochána has been maintained since March, 1972; since then over 26,000 have been issued.</P>

      <P>As regards the last part of the question, I do not know of any reason for distinguishing in this context between penal servitude and imprisonment.  Accordingly, unless what the Deputy is suggesting is that, the electoral law should be changed, a matter which is not primarily my responsibility, the proposition would involve taking some 1,300 prisoners to polling booths near their normal place of residence.  Such a project would be entirely impractical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The only distinction that exists is in relation to penal servitude, as distinct from imprisonment.</P>
      <P>The prison rules make no distinction between men and women in regard to the earning of remission of imprisonment. Neither is any distinction made in practice in the granting of remission of imprisonment over and above the remission &ldquo;earned&rdquo; under the rules.</P>
      <P>The prison rules did distinguish between men and women sentenced to penal servitude.  A woman serving penal servitude could earn one-third remission as compared with one-quarter for a man. However, because of a decision of the Supreme Court in 1955, it is clear that those particular provisions of the rules are of no force or effect.  Remission may, however, be allowed under the Criminal Justice Act, 1951 even though not &ldquo;earned&rdquo; under prison rules and, in the small number of cases where a woman is serving a sentence of penal servitude, it has been usual to remit one-third as a matter of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various aspects of the question of remission, including in particular the &ldquo;earning&rdquo; of remission under the prison rules, are being examined and it seems reasonable to assume that revised rules would not seek to reintroduce a distinction in this respect between men and women who are sentenced to penal servitude. This, however, is not intended to imply that either penal servitude prisoners or the much bigger numbers of other prisoners are likely to be accorded a more-or-less automatic claim to a remission of one-third on the basis that this has heretofore been accorded to those women prisoners who are serving penal servitude.  Those who have had that <Col N="67" /> concession were only a small minority of a small minority of the prison population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to the first part of this question is that central records are not kept in a form that would enable information in the form sought to be extracted.  The information could be got only by circularising every Garda district and sub-district in the country and having returns compiled locally.  I do not consider that I would be justified in asking the gardaí to undertake the considerable amount of work which this would entail, bearing in mind that it would involve diverting gardaí from other duties.</P>
      <P>As regards the parts of the question which seek information relating to the next ten years, it is not possible to say what number of houses may need to be replaced in that period.</P>
      <P>With regard to maintenance, the Office of Public Works are responsible for the maintenance of State-owned accommodation.  Maintenance of leased accommodation can be the responsibility of the lessor or the lessee, or can be shared between them, depending on the terms of the particular lease agreement. In the usual course Garda houses are inspected at least annually but more frequent inspections take place as needs dictate.</P>
      <P>As regards rent the position is that a rent allowance, separate from pay, is payable. The current rates, effective from 1 March 1980 are £741.43 (for married members) and £556.07 (for single members) per annum.</P>

    <P>The official records do not show the average pay.  This would depend on the numbers on the various points of the scales from day to day.</P>
    <P>Apart from increases of 7% from 1 April, 1970, and 10% from 1 January, 1971, which were granted in line with a general pay round applying in the civil service, the criteria used in reviewing pay both of the Garda Síochána and of prison staff during the period were those provided for in the National Agreements and the National Understandings.</P>
    <P>A special review of Garda pay was carried out by the Garda Síochána Committee of Inquiry who reported in April 1979.  A copy of the report was presented to the House on 11 May 1979.  (While the Conroy Report was made during the period mentioned in the Question, namely on 15 January 1970, the pay scales as recommended became effective from 1 June 1969.  That Report was presented to the House on 23 January 1970.)</P>
    <P>No special review of Prison Officers' pay (in the sense of a review by an <i>ad hoc</i> Committee) was carried out during the period.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state in respect of each State car assigned to the Taoiseach, and his predecessor, each Minister and Minister of State in each of the years 1977, 1978, 1979 and 1980: (a) the mileage covered, (b) the petrol consumed, (c) any other expenses incurred in respect of repairs or replacement of State cars, (d) the cost of insurance in each case and (e) the total cost of each.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of miles covered by the official cars assigned to the Taosieach and each Minister and Minister of State during the year ended 31 December 1980 is shown in tabular statement No. 1 attached.</P>
      <P>The mileage covered during the year ended 31 December 1979 was given in my reply to a Question on 4 March 1980 (see Dáil Debates, Vol. 318, No. 6, Columns 1171-2).</P>
      <P>Statistics showing the relevant mileage figures for 1977 and 1978 are not available and would be particularly difficult to compile at this stage.  However, a return showing the approximate mileage travelled during the twelve months ended 31 July 1978 was compiled at the time and the figures are given in tabular statement No. 2 attached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to cost, the position is that, as I have indicated in reply to previous Questions, precise costings are difficult to make but, on the basis of a <Col N="73" /> detailed analysis carried out some years ago and allowing for subsequent increases in pay and allowances and in the cost of cars, fuel etc., it has been calculated that the average cost per user, including depreciation, petrol, oil, tyres, repairs and maintenance, driver costs, <Col N="74" /> etc., was £23.900 in 1977, £26,300 in 1978, £30,000 in 1979 and £36,500 in 1980.  As the State carries its own insurance, insurance premiums are not paid, but the costings include an estimated figure to cover the consequential cost to the State.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 275, 276 and 279 together.  The following is the information requested:</P>
      <P>(1)  Personnel are generally rostered for duty on a weekly basis.</P>
      <P>(2) As the rostering arrangements vary with the nature of the duty to be performed and the particular tasks which are allotted to individual units, it would not be possible to furnish details of such arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> (3)  While there is no maximum period of continuous duty applying to personnel of the Defence Forces, normally duty would not exceed 24 hours.</P>
    <P>(4)  The normal training week provides for 1½ rest days.  However, following a continuous period of 24 hours' duty, a resting-off period of 24 hours is allowed.</P>

    <P>In addition to the special leave indicated above, special leave with pay for the period of necessary absence from his station may be granted to an officer or man&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  who comes into contact with a case of infectious disease or is resident in an area where there is an outbreak of infectious disease;</P>
    <P>(ii)  for the purpose of attending before a civil court as a witness on behalf of a party other than the State;</P>
    <P>(iii)  for the purpose of attending examinations held by the Civil Service Commissioners, the Department of Education, the Universities, recognised professional institutions, the Institute of Public Administration and other similar bodies.</P>
    <P>(b)  Special leave without pay may be granted in certain exceptional circumstances where annual leave has been exhausted.</P>
    <P>(c)  Sick leave</P>
    <P>A. Officers</P>
    <P>Sick leave and/or hospital treatment up to a maximum period, or aggregate periods, of 548 days in any period of four <Col N="79" /> years may be granted to an officer.  (Special provision is made for officers suffering from tuberculosis.)  Full pay and allowances would be issuable for the first 365 days of sick leave and half pay for the remaining 183 days.  An officer may, at any time, be retired from the Permanent Defence Force on medical grounds if he is unfit for further service therein.</P>
    <P>B. Men</P>
    <P>A man may be granted up to 90 days' sick leave and/or hospital treatment on the recommendation of a medical officer. This period may be extended on the recommendation of an Army Medical Board.  All sick leave in the case of men would be with full pay and there are no maximum periods laid down.  A man may, at any time, be discharged on the grounds of being below Army physical standards if he is unfit for further service.</P>
    <P>In relation to both officers and men, the principal criterion in deciding on the grant of sick leave is whether or not there is a reasonable prospect of return to duty on the expiration of the period of sick leave.  All cases of sick leave are kept under regular review in the light of this criterion.</P>
    <P>With regard to part (b) of the question, the weekly charge made is either £3.53 or £2.35, depending on the quality and condition of the accommodation provided. Accommodation charges were last reviewed with effect from 1 March 1980 and the previous review took place in 1970.</P>
    <P>With regard to part (c), members of the force (other than recruits during training) are not required to live in official accommodation and there are no plans at present to provide additional single accommodation.  Maintenance of existing accommodation is carried out by the Office of Public Works except where leased property is maintained by the lessor.</P>
    <P>With regard to parts (d) and (e), the normal rule is that, where they are on duty at a distance of two miles or more from permanent station for at least five hours, members receive a monetary allowance (subsistence allowance) and <Col N="80" /> they make their own arrangements for the supply of food.  I am not aware of any suggestion that members generally would prefer to forego this arrangement. Exceptionally, where members are engaged on special duties away from their permanent stations for unusually long periods, or in other special circumstances, they may be supplied with refreshments at public expense but on the basis that, if the circumstances warrant the supply of a full meal, the subsistence allowance that would otherwise be payable is reduced or abated.</P>

      <P>My Department's property on Bere Island includes a number of roads which are repaired as necessary from time to time. The amount spent on their maintenance in 1980 was £1,040.  Military use of the roads is very limited as troops are not stationed on the Island.</P>
      <P>Certain other roads on the island are the responsibility of Cork County Council.</P>

      <P>The information requested at (1) of the question is being compiled and will be communicated to the Deputy when available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> It is not possible to indicate the precise number of married quarters which are unsuitable.  A considerable number of the quarters erected prior to 1954 are regarded as unsuitable and it is intended that these will be replaced by modern dwellings as resources permit.</P>
    <P>The construction of 12 new dwellings at Cathal Brugha Barracks is expected to commence soon.  Planning is at present being undertaken for 130 more married quarters at other locations.  The number of dwellings which will be built during the next ten years cannot be predicted; it will depend to a large degree on the capital allocations made available each year for the purpose.</P>
    <P>Married quarters are inspected periodically by or on behalf of the officer commanding the barracks.  Maintenance works are carried out by the Corps of Engineers or by outside contract.</P>
    <P>The pay rates of all ranks of the Defence Forces are consolidated inclusive rates.  There is no identifiable rent element in these pay rates.  A rent allowance, as such, is not payable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will outline the following in relation to the Defence Forces: (a) the number of quarters available for single personnel, with a breakdown of the numbers built prior to 1920 and in each ten year period since then; (b) the amount charged for such accommodation, the criteria used for setting rents, when rents were last reviewed and how often they are reviewed; (c) the plans, if any, to replace or improve this accommodation; (d) if personnel have to pay for food or rations while on duty and, if so, if he will give details; and (e) if he is satisfied that members who are operating away from base, particularly members on security or checkpoint duty, are adequately catered for with hot meals and if he has received any complaints about this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested at (a) of the question is being compiled and will be communicated to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" /> The position in regard to the other matters is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b) The amounts deducted from the pay of members of the Permanent Defence who occupy single quarters are as follows: second-lieutenants on appointment, 40p a day; second-lieutenants during their second year in rank, 53p a day; other officers, 64p a day; non-commissioned officers and privates, 24p a day.</P>
    <P>These charges, which are regarded as somewhat nominal by comparison with the general level of rental charges, were initially determined many years ago by reference to such considerations as the military exigencies and the question of what might be regarded as an equitable charge in the case of personnel living in barracks.  The charges are reviewed on the occasion of the application of general increases to the pay of the Defence Forces.  They were last reviewed in November, 1980, in the context of the application of the first phase of the agreement on pay policy, 1980, in the second national understanding.</P>
    <P>(c) There is a continuing programme for the provision of improved living accommodation for single personnel. New billets have recently been provided at a number of locations and are under construction at others.  Existing billets are being improved, where practicable, by dividing large rooms into cubicles, the provision of individual bedhead lighting, installation of central heating and improvements to sanitary and ablution facilities.</P>
    <P>(d) Members of the Defence Forces in receipt of rations, the majority of whom are single personnel living in barracks, are, in general, liable to a deduction at the current rate of £1.22 a day from their pay in respect of such rations.  Provision is made for exemption from this deduction in certain circumstances. For example, married personnel who receive rations when on temporary duty away from their normal stations or when on seagoing duty aboard ship are exempted from the deduction.  In certain exceptional circumstances <Col N="89" /> in which the issue of rations is not feasible subsistence allowance at the appropriate rate is paid.</P>
    <P>(e) Hot food in proper containers is supplied to troops on prolonged duties away from base.  In other circumstances (for example, check points or patrol of short duration) catering is arranged so that hot meals are ready on return to barracks.  No complaints have been received in this matter.</P>

In the case of <Col N="94" /> whiskey, beer and stout the retail price for on-premises consumption has been controlled by way of Maximum Prices &ldquo;Standstill&rdquo; Order (that is, prices are frozen at the level being charged in premises in June 1978).  Subsequent orders provide for approved increases since that date.</P>

      <P>Formal notices of assessment were issued on 15 August 1980 to the vast majority of farmers to whom resource tax was estimated at that stage to apply.  Subsequently, notices of assessment were issued, on various dates, to some 500 other individuals as they became identified, while similar notices will issue shortly to another 200 individuals recently identified.</P>
      <P>It is thought that virtually all individuals liable to resource tax have now been identified and that the number of extra cases likely to emerge will be quite small.</P>

    <P>The Government are intensifying and expanding their employment policies through the Investment Plan 1981.  The implementation of the plan will result directly in higher employment of about 10,000, mainly in building and construction, telecommunications and energy. These jobs are additional to those directly arising in manufacturing and indirectly in the services sector as a result <Col N="96" /> of investment by the industrial promotion agencies.</P>
    <P>Among other measures the change in corporation tax payable by manufacturing firms, which is now being fixed at 10 per cent, should also benefit employment. It will provide a significant incentive to firms trading on the home market and will encourage a greater degree of industrial linkage in the domestic economy.</P>

It will be noted from the report referred to in the question that a number of factors depressed the income tax receipts other than on ordinary wages and salaries in 1978-79 <i>vis-á-vis</i> 1977-78.  In particular there was the Post Office dispute, which affected 1978-79 receipts from farmers and Other Schedule D more than PAYE receipts; and the dates on which the self-employed paid income tax were brought forward in 1977-78 resulting in a once-off increase in that year over and above the normal trend.</P>

If adjustments were made in those levels on the basis of the change in the consumer price index between April 1975 and November 1980, increases of approximately 100 per cent would fall to be made resulting in thresholds of £300,000, £30,000, £20,000 and £10,000 respectively.

      <P>I understand that there was some slight dislocation of classes for a brief period prior to their moving into the new extension in mid-October 1980, even though the accommodation provided under the project was more than adequate for the numbers attending.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the White Paper on Educational Development, it is intended to set up a formal mechanism to review the operations of all the regional colleges in the light of the purposes for which they were founded, and to advise on the direction of future development.

      <P>Investigation of joint works applications is generally a complex operation necessitating detailed surveys of outfalls, bridges, sluices, culverts, and so on.  Account must also be taken of the possibility of damage to adjoining interests. An added difficulty in the Gort area is that most of the outfalls converge on Coole Lake through a series of underground channels.  Of the 22 joint works applications received in the Gort area, 12 were either withdrawn or cancelled as schemes could not be prepared because of such factors as lack of adequate outfall, objections from affected parties etc.  Of the balance, approved schemes have issued in two cases and a further five cases are at an advance stage of investigation. The remaining three cases will be investigated as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The only regulations which were recently introduced related to testing for oestrogens (hormones).  These regulations stem from a requirement of the Italian Ministry of Health that, from 20 October 1980, calves being imported into Italy must be accompanied by a veterinary certificate indicating that the animals come from a holding where oestrogenic substances are not used.</P>
      <P>Trade with Italy in calves has not, in fact, been hampered by these requirements as the necessary certification is being provided by veterinary practitioners. I am not, therefore, aware that substantial losses have been incurred by farmers as a result of the Italian requirements. In fact, prices for calves have been extremely buoyant here in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>Proposals for control on the use of hormones in livestock production in member states are currently being examined by the EEC.</P>

      <P>Hide prices are quoted by hide merchants on a week-to-week basis to individual sellers, both factories and butchers.  They can vary in the light of the seller's quality record and the degree of trimming and dressing with which the hides are offered to the merchant.  As no hide auctions are held in this country, an annual price could only be calculated by collating a vast number of individual transactions, for which detailed particulars are not available to my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will outline the general arrangements in regard to requirements for signing-on at employment <Col N="129" /> exchanges; and the reason for the discrepancy arising from the situation whereby in some areas people are required to sign on five days per week and in other areas on only one day per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements for signing for unemployment payments are governed by regulations which require daily attendance on every working day in the case of persons living within two miles of the nearest employment exchange or branch employment office.  The regulations permit less frequent signing in the case of persons living more than two miles away or in other exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>The general position is that claimants living between two and four miles away are required to sign twice a week and those living beyond four miles sign once a week.  Persons over 65 years of age sign once a week irrespective of distance and they also have the option of four-weekly signing.</P>
      <P>Differences in the frequency of signing between areas can arise due to the particular circumstances pertaining at the local offices.  The requirement to attend at a local office or other designated signing centre at specified times is an important element in the control of claims. Policy in implementing the regulations is based on considerations of maintaining proper control while at the same time taking into account the facilities at the local offices.  These facilities can vary from area to area.  Where, for example, due to a large increase in the live register at a local office, difficulties are encountered in complying with the prescribed frequency of signing, relaxations are introduced from time to time in the signing arrangements for the convenience of claimants and of the local office.  These arrangements are kept under review and modified as required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployment assistance is not being paid to the person concerned as it was decided some time ago that he was not available for and genuinely seeking employment.  He appealed against this decision but the appeals officer upheld the disallowance.  The person concerned has since claimed unemployment assistance again and certain inquiries are being made as to whether he now satisfies the conditions for entitlement.  It is expected that these inquiries will be completed shortly and when they are, a decision will be made in his case without delay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to say how many pensioners were awarded supplements under Article 50 of Regulation 1408/71.  However, in April 1978 when such supplements ceased to be awarded to pensioners resident in this country, 120 retirement pensioners were in receipt of supplements, together with 42 old age contributory pensioners and 46 widow pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was decided, rather than to reduce <Col N="139" /> the pensions of those concerned in April 1978, to phase out the supplements by withholding future increases in pension rates until such time as the supplements would be eliminated.  Following the increases in pension rates in April 1980, the number of retirement pensioners still in receipt of a supplement was 25, together with 10 old age contributory pensioners and 12 widow pensioners.  As these pensioners are still in receipt of pensions of a higher amount than that applicable on a strict interpretation of the EEC Regulations, increases in pension cannot be paid to them until their position has been regularised.</P>

      <P>I have received representations recently from the secretary of the Strawberry Beds Community Centre about the telephone service in the area. The incidence of telephone faults in the area has been high in recent months.  This is particularly true of faults in underground cables which are the most difficult and time consuming to repair.  Because of the large number of such faults, I regret that there has been considerable delay in restoring service in many cases.</P>
      <P>These problems were aggravated by a separate series of faults in the local distribution system.  A special effort is being made at present throughout the 01 area to reduce the backlog of faults and so improve the quality of service to all customers. This includes a special programme of systematic examination and repair of plant in the Strawberry Beds. Because of the many demands on the Department's resources, it will take some time to complete this programme but I expect a gradual and sustained improvement in the quality of service in the area in the coming months.</P>

      <P>The position in regard to the provision of information on the total number and value of house improvement grants currently awaiting payment remains as stated in my reply to question No. 431 of 9 December 1980 for the reasons given therein.  Grants will be paid in 1981 where the necessary conditions have been complied with, namely, completed applications received, contracts or commitments entered into, works completed and payments claimed by the specified dates.  It is expected that the 1981 provision of £19 million for house improvement grants and solid fuel grants will be adequate to meet the demands arising from compliance with these conditions and will be fully expended.  The prior approval of work for which solid fuel grants are sought has never been required.

The selection of locations for expenditure of such grants is primarily for decision by the road authority concerned.

      <P>In October, 1980, Cork (South) County Council advised my Department that the streets of Bantry required regrading and resurfacing due to a number of factors including excavations carried out as part of public water and sewerage schemes in Bantry; excavations carried out by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs; poor ground conditions beneath the surface dressing; and bad weather.</P>
      <P>The Council propose to regrade and resurface the total width of the streets and roads rather than to simply reinstate the portion affected by sewer excavations only.  A sum of £45,000 is included in the Bantry Sewerage Scheme contract to cover the cost of road works attributable to the sewerage scheme and may be financed from loans totalling £1,215,000 and already sanctioned for this scheme. The Council sought a special grant to cover the balance of the cost involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 25th September, 1980 a supplementary grant of £30,000 was allocated to Cork County Council for strengthening the national secondary road (N71) from Bantry to Snave.  It is understood that the full amount of the grant has been <Col N="168" /> expended on the strengthening of the national secondary road in the town.</P>
    <P>In the current year a grant of £120,000 has been determined for the improvement of the national secondary road from Bantry to Glengariff.  Part of this grant will be used to improve the national secondary road through Bantry town up to a satisfactory standard.  The financing of the remaining works on other roads in Bantry town is a matter for Cork County Council having regard to the finance available from the Council's own resources and from the block grant of £1.056 million made to the Council for 1981.</P>

      <P>The second national understanding contains a commitment to introduce legislation at an early date to extend the provisions of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, as sought by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and, after consultation with both sides of industry, to introduce such other legislative changes as may be necessary to achieve a more satisfactory application of that Act.  It is my intention to deal with these issues in a single piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>Estimated figures prepared in my Department indicate that approximately 404,000 days were lost through strikes in 1980 compared with over 1,427,000 in 1979.  It <Col N="173" /> is estimated that disputes in the public sector accounted for 155,000 of the days lost and private sector disputes for 249,000.  It is also estimated that 31,000 days in the public sector and 153,000 days in the private sector were lost through unofficial strikes.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office, which is the official source of statistics on industrial disputes, will be issuing firm figures in due course.</P>
