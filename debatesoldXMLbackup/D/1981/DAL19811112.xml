      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £27,996,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1981, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain services administered by that Office; for the pay and expenses of the Defence Forces; and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for Defence for the financial year ending on 31 December 1981 which was passed by the Dáil on 9 July last, was for a net sum of £143,980,000.  The Supplementary Estimate for Defence which I am now introducing is for an additional sum of £27,996,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before proceeding to the details of this Estimate, I should inform the House that the original Estimate for Defence was not <Col N="1910" /> adequate in relation to pay, at least, to meet the commitments which could be anticipated to arise in 1981.</P>
    <P>One of the first tasks of this Government was to undertake an urgent examination of the country's finances.  This examination highlighted the very serious condition in which the finances of the State had been left by the outgoing Government. Other Ministers in the course of the presentation of Supplementary Estimates to the House have referred to the inadequacy of the funds required for their Departments.  It will not, therefore, come as any surprise to the House or to the country that this pattern of under-estimation has also emerged in so far as my Department is concerned.</P>
    <P>When I refer to under-estimation I want it clearly understood what was involved.  What was involved was that the provision made in the original estimate for pay was inadequate to the tune of £10 million.  In other words, adequate provision was not made to cater for the numbers actually in the Defence Forces at the time the Estimate was framed.  A decision was taken to allow recruiting to continue on the basis of acceptance of suitable applicants who presented themselves &mdash; active recruiting measures being discontinued. It was simplistic to hope that, in the prevailing circumstances, merely to discontinue advertising for new recruits would result in a substantial reduction in strength.  That did not happen and anyone who faced up honestly to the situation would have realised that it would not happen.</P>
    <P>The obvious conclusion is that the inadequate provision was not accidental or due to unforeseen circumstances but represented a failure to take into account the reality of the strength of the force. We now find ourselves in the extraordinary situation that the Government have to find the necessary finance to meet a commitment which the former Government did not provide for.  That, of course, is part of the story of the financial crisis which we inherited.</P>
    <P>The figure of £27,996,000 now required includes an amount of £14,899,000 in respect of increases in pay and allowances granted to members of the Defence <Col N="1911" /> Forces and civilian employees and civil servants of my Department for which provision was not made when the original Estimate was made.  The main increases for the Defence Forces are those arising from the application to the pay of all ranks up to and including commandant of the benefits of an arbitration award to executive grades in the civil service with effect from 1 September 1980.</P>
    <P>There also has been an increase in the numbers of FCA members attending for training and increased expenditure on transportation, Post Office services, buildings and lands.  As well, there has been increased expenditure on supplies and equipment for the Defence Forces due to carryover of commitments from last year, price increases, and outstanding orders being met more rapidly than expected.</P>
    <P>The Estimate already passed by the Dáil was on the basis of a strength of 1,525 officers, 109 cadets and 10,700 NCOs and privates making a total of 12,334 all ranks.  In fact, however, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force, which had declined substantially in the period mid-1977 to mid-1979, on the 1 January 1981 was 13,731 all ranks. It is now about 14,850 all ranks.</P>
    <P>While the present tragic situation in Northern Ireland continues the need will be readily apparent for adequate numbers of well trained men to service the many calls in aid of the civil power on Border patrols, check-points, protection of vital installations, escorts for cash in transit, and so on.  The Government are committed to the promotion of efficient Defence Forces integrated with the community, equipped and trained to safeguard our neutrality, to render necessary aid to the civil power and to maintain our established role within the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I will now give details of the subheads involved from which it will be clear that savings on some services have offset to some extent excesses on the subheads requiring this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Under subhead A &mdash; Office of the Minister for Defence, Salaries, Wages and Allowances &mdash; the sum of £400,000 is <Col N="1912" /> required to meet the cost of pay increases to the staff involved.</P>
    <P>There is provision for an additional sum of £21,880,000 under subhead B &mdash; Permanent Defence Force: Pay &mdash; to cater for under estimation, the cost of pay increases and increased strength.</P>
    <P>The additional sum of £2,805,000 required under subhead C &mdash; Permanent Defence Force: Allowances &mdash; is to meet the cost of increases in rates of certain allowances and an increased volume of subsistence allowance payments.</P>
    <P>The sum of £2,250,000 is required under subhead D &mdash; Reserve Defence Force: Pay etc. &mdash; to meet the cost of increased numbers of FCA members attending for training and also the cost of increases in pay and allowances.</P>
    <P>An additional £750,000 is required under subhead F &mdash; Civilians attached to Units: Pay etc.  &mdash; to meet the cost of pay increases.</P>
    <P>The additional gross sum required under the subheads of the Vote relating to items other than pay and allowances amounts to £3,579,000.</P>
    <P>This sum, which is related to increased costs and carryover commitments, arises under subhead G &mdash; Civil Defence &mdash; £100,000; subhead I &mdash; Medicines and Instruments, £51,000; subhead L &mdash; Petrol, Fuel Oils etc., £120,000; subhead R &mdash; Solid Fuel, Electricity, Gas and water, £400,000; subhead U &mdash; Transportation etc., £300,000; subhead V &mdash; Expenses of Equitation Teams at Horse Shows, £30,000; subhead W &mdash; Travelling and Incidental expenses &mdash; £125,000; subhead X &mdash; Post Office Services &mdash; £665,000; subhead DD2 &mdash; Expense of operation of Sail Training Scheme &mdash; £70,000; and subhead FF &mdash; Office Equipment and Other Office Supplies &mdash; £40,000.</P>
    <P>There is provision for an additional sum of £700,000 under subhead M &mdash; Clothing &mdash; due mainly to increased carryover and outstanding orders being met more rapidly than expected.  Under subhead S &mdash; Buildings &mdash; an additional sum of £600,000 is required due to increased progress during the year on building and maintenance works.  The sum of £228,000 is required under subhead CC &mdash; Lands <Col N="1913" />&mdash; for increased purchases of premises and £150,000 is required under subhead D1 &mdash; Assistance to Sail Training in connection with the purchase of the sail training vessel <i>Asgard II.</i></P>
    <P>The total increase of £31,664,000 is partially offset by savings amounting to £1,988,000 and by surplus appropriations-in-aid amounting to £1,680,000, leaving the net additional sum of £27,996,000 required for the Supplementary Estimate.  The main savings arise in subhead P &mdash; Naval Stores &mdash; £1,450,000, due to anticipated expenditure on naval construction not arising in 1981; in subhead 02 &mdash; Aircraft &mdash; £300,000 due to a refund of a VAT payment in respect of an aircraft purchased in 1980; in subhead K &mdash; Provisions &mdash; £100,000 due to expenditure on rations being less than expected; and in subhead AA &mdash; Irish Red Cross Society Grant-in-Aid &mdash; £100,000 due to savings on the provision for repairs to the society's headquarters.</P>
    <P>The surplus of £1,680,000 under Appropriations-in-Aid comprises additional receipts from United Nations, from the occupation of official quarters, and from rations on repayment, which are partially offset by shortfalls in receipts from discharges by purchase, from the EEC and from the recoupment of costs incurred in connection with oil incidents.</P>
    <P>It is my aim as Minister for Defence to provide, in men and equipment, a modern well-equipped Army capable of meeting the many demands made on them in these troubled times.</P>
    <P>Having had some experience of Army life I am very much concerned about the welfare of our Defence Forces.  In line with Government policy I intend to ensure that the conditions of service generally of members of the Defence Forces will be maintained at a high standard and, in particular, that those personnel who are bearing the brunt of very onerous responsibilities will continue to be compensated for their efforts.</P>
    <P>Before I turn to the Supplementary Estimate for Army Pensions for the year ending 31 December 1981, I wish to express my appreciation of the work <Col N="1914" /> being done by all ranks in the Permanent Forces and in the reserves, including Slua Muirí, the FCA and others, and also the Irish Red Cross Society.  I hope to have an opportunity before long, when the main Estimate is being dealt with, to deal with this subject fully.</P>
    <P>I should like also to refer to the Irish troops in the Middle East.  It is unfortunate that many people here seem to think that when our troops go abroad they do so for two things, a bit of sun and a few extra bob.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The display of ignorance of some people who have been reporting for and writing to newspapers in the past couple of months has been appalling. Some people want to know if we have troops all over the Middle East.  We have. As well as having a battalion in the Lebanon we have officers and NCOs in Syria, in Egypt, in Israel and other Middle East areas.  They are risking their lives to keep world peace but this is not appreciated by the general public.  Therefore, I should like to place on record my appreciation of the work they are doing.  I know Deputies opposite have the same point of view.  We must make it known, loud and clear, for the benefit of people at home that our soldiers who go abroad are working to try to hold world peace, and I offer them my special thanks for the way in which they are doing their jobs. They are very well respected where they are serving.</P>
    <P>Now I turn to the Supplementary Estimate for Army Pensions for the year ending 31 December 1981.  The main Estimate for the year ending 31 December 1981, which was passed by the Dáil on 9 July 1981, was for a net sum of £25,600,000.  The supplementary is for an additional sum of £1.090,000.  The additional sum is required mainly to meet the cost of the actual increases granted in 1981 over and above the amount, £1,711,000, provided for increases in the main Estimate.</P>
    <P>Budgetary increases in military service pensions, special allowances and in the allowances payable to widows of military service pensioners and special allowance holders, together with the normal general increase from 1 July 1981, require additional <Col N="1915" /> sums totalling £699,000 in subhead C &mdash; Allowances and Gratuities to Dependants etc.; subhead D &mdash; Military Service Pensions; and subhead G &mdash; Special Allowances.  Subhead E1 &mdash; Defence Forces Pensions Schemes &mdash; requires a further £720,000 arising out of an increase in Army pay granted after the main Estimate was framed.</P>
    <P>Subhead E2 &mdash; Payments in respect of Transferred Service &mdash; relates to the scheme whereby service in one part of the public sector may be reckoned for pension purposes in another.  It is of particular relevance to a man leaving the Army, moving into other pensionable employment and being credited for pension purposes with his Army service.  In some instances a financial adjustment will be required between my Department and the final employer.  There is a token amount of £10 in the main Estimate but it is now expected that some payments may fall to be made under this scheme before the end of 1981 and, accordingly, provision is being made for a further sum of £50,000.</P>
    <P>There is also a token amount of £10 included in the main Estimate for subhead K relating to lump sums payable in the case of personnel killed or injured while serving with a United Nations Force.  As the House is aware there have, unfortunately, been a number of tragic deaths of Defence Force personnel in Lebanon this year and, accordingly, a further sum of £72,000 is now required under this subhead.  The annual allowances for dependants of such deceased personnel are provided for under subhead C.</P>
    <P>The total increase of £1,541,000 is mainly offset by savings amounting to £303,000 and by surplus Appropriations-in-Aid amounting to £148,000 leaving the net additional sum of £1,090,000 required in the Supplementary Estimate.  The main savings are £195,000 under subhead B &mdash; Wound and Disability Pensions and Gratuities etc. &mdash; and £100,000 under subhead M &mdash; Funeral Grants.  The surplus Appropriations-in-Aid is due mainly to contributions to pension schemes for widows <Col N="1916" /> and children of personnel of the Permanent Defence Force being higher than anticipated.</P>
    <P>I commend both Estimates to the favourable consideration of the House. If Deputies require more information on any points I shall be glad to give it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Sylvester Barrett Mr. Sylvester Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sylvester Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to wish the Minister well in his new Ministry, Defence, a Department which has grown in importance over the years and is now one of the most important Departments, due of course to the situation which prevails in this country at the present time <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Northern part of it, the security duties, the UN duties and the many other duties which the Army did not have, possibly, when the Minister was in the force during the Emergency.</P>
      <P>The Minister has referred to the inadequacy of the main Estimate and the shortfall, particularly in regard to Army pay.  There is a shortfall with regard to Army pay but I should like to point out that, in 1980 in particular, there was a very intensive recruiting campaign carried out by way of advertising in the media, particularly television.  This campaign was quite successful.  By way of advertisements a new picture was created of Army service and young men were attracted and recruiting did increase in that year.  That campaign was necessary because the Defence Forces were below full strength.  From 1977 to 1980 Army strength increased.  That recruiting campaign was discontinued at the end of 1980 and it was natural to assume that recruiting would decrease in 1981.  The Estimate was based on the projections with regard to the amount needed for Army pay.  As we now see, the strength has increased from 1 January last from 13,731 to 14,850, an increase of 1,100 approximately. There are reasons why people are attracted to the Army despite the lack of an intensive recruiting campaign. Unemployment has increased enormously in the last year or two.  Unemployed young men, in particular, will look around to see what they can do. More of them are attracted to Army service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1917" /> There is nothing unusual about a shortfall in the provision for Army pay.  This is not the first time that a supplementary estimate has had to be introduced and I do not suppose it will be the last time. Projections must be made as to what the requirements will be for the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps.  It is not the eighth wonder of the world that there should be a shortfall.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other subheads of the Supplementary Estimate I would say all of them are justifiable.  There are increases in transport and other costs.  It could not have been anticipated that the OPEC countries would increase the price of oil on which we are so dependent two or three times this year.  At the beginning of the year Saudi Arabia was talking about freezing the price.  We know what has happened in the meantime.  We also know about the budgetary increases which occurred in July.  It is not unusual or exceptional that a supplementary estimate should be required.  It is necessary to provide this Supplementary Estimate for the Army because of the security role which they now have in this country and which they did not have until the last eight or ten years in particular.</P>
    <P>I too would like to pay tribute to the officers and men of the Army who have served under conditions of hardship. They carry out their duties at different hours of the day and during the night. They are exposed to weather.  Some of the money now being asked for in the Supplementary Estimate is for the purpose of increasing allowances for these duties and nobody will quibble or object to those increases.</P>
    <P>Increases were granted since the last budget and since the main Estimate was drafted at the beginning of the year. Therefore, these increases must be provided for in this Supplementary Estimate not only in respect of Army pay but also in respect of allowances for security duty, duty with the United Nations and, of course, in respect of the Reserve Forces, in particular, I would say, the FCA, who have not had any increase of any substance for many years.  Of course, the Reserve Forces are strictly voluntary and are entitled to be considered for <Col N="1918" /> increased allowances at least for the time they are in camp or in training.</P>
    <P>It is to be noticed that under practically all of the subheads the Minister has referred to today where increased provision is required, increases were included in the main estimate, if one compares the 1981 Estimate with the 1980 Estimate.  It was not just a matter of writing off something or trying to carry on with the amount of money that was provided in the previous Estimate.  If anybody cares to look they will see that there were increases so that the criticism about cuts and the statement by the Minister with regard to a failure to provide adequate money for pay and so on are not as justified as they appear at first.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly paid tribute to the battalion serving with the UN.  He visited that battalion in Lebanon and he is aware of the conditions under which they are serving.  They must contend with temperatures well in excess of 100 degrees, particularly those who make the tour of duty from May to October.  Because of the prevailing conditions there those soldiers have to contend with more than the position with regard to the PLO forces and the Israelis.  As I understand it, in all there are more than 50 factions operating in that small country and, of course, there is no shortage of arms of all descriptions. Our soldiers are doing a first-class job under difficult conditions.  Indeed, they are highly thought of by all sides for their conduct and the manner in which they carry out their duties.  In fact, they are probably the most highly thought of contingent of the seven groups serving with the UN in Lebanon at present.  That is how the Army have always carried out their UN duties abroad since they went to the Congo originally.  We must acknowledge the difficult task they undertake in the Lebanon and praise them for the manner in which they carry out their duties.</P>
    <P>There are some matters I should like to draw to the Minister's attention. During my short term as Minister for Defence I was particularly concerned about the condition of many Army barracks. Many of them are old and outdated <Col N="1919" /> and are a carry-over from the time the British forces were here.  It is very important for the morale of our troops that they have decent living conditions but some barracks are in a bad state.  I accept that some were reconditioned and improved but others are not suitable for Army personnel to live and sleep in in this day and age.  One barracks which is outdated and has poor living conditions is that in Limerick.  The Minister should try to do something about the situation there.  The Department of Defence would not have to purchase a site for a new barracks because a site of a few hundred acres ia available at Knocklisheen. Of course, because of the central location of the existing Sarsfield Barracks in Limerick it would fetch a good price if it was offered for sale and that would make a sizeable impact on the cost of providing new quarters.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the other barracks that are in need of major repairs.  One that I was concerned about following my visit to the various centres was the barracks at Cavan.  It is the most despicable barracks I know of and I do not know how people have continued to occupy and live in that accommodation over the years.  It has to be seen to be believed.  I accept that there is a proposal to remedy the situation and I believe it is at an advanced stage.  I understand it is intended to replace the barracks with a new centre.  I hope that work is getting under way or about to commence.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that more money is needed under the various subheads because the strength of the Army has been increased by 1,100 since 1 January last.  That is one explanation for the additional money needed for pay and allowances.  We are all aware that the troops were granted increases in pay and allowances since that date and any criticism of that increase in the Estimate is not justified.  I hope the strength of the Army will continue to increase.  The standard of personnel, officers and other ranks, has improved over the years.  They are to be admired for the way they conduct themselves and carry out their duties.  They deserve credit for the way <Col N="1920" /> they accept discipline particularly in relation to the extended duties they are now called on to carry out along the Border. We have troops along the Border from Donegal to County Louth and they work under difficult conditions.  The troops must also protect people's money.  They were granted increases in allowances before the change of Government and they were fully entitled to them.  They are entitled to the same treatment as other workers.  It must be remembered that they are not in a position to create pressure like other groups and they should always be considered for increases when they are granted to other sections of the community by way of pay or allowances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the Minister in paying tribute to the dedication and service members of the Defence Forces have given since the foundation of the State.  Regardless of the parties that formed the Government they could always rely on the commitment and dedication of the Defence Forces.  I agree with a lot of what has been said by the Minister and by Deputy Barrett who had experience of the Defence Forces as Minister for Defence. It is possible while paying lip service to the commitment of these men to overlook the fact that they are the only work force who do not have any kind of representation. It is now becoming quite popular in Europe for members of defence forces to want to be unionised.  I do not believe such thinking exists in our Defence Forces but we should appreciate the fact that they do not have a voice. The time is long overdue when consideration should be given to providing a pay board for the Army to consist of personnel who understand the needs and the requirements of members of the Defence Forces and who could communicate with the Minister of the day.  The setting up of such a body would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of the fact that there has been an increase in the number of recruits in recent years the Army is still 3,000 short of its establishment.  That is an extraordinary situation when one considers that we have 150,000 people unemployed. <Col N="1921" /> It begs the question: why is it that young men prefer not to do anything when they could join the Defence Forces with its excellent record and opportunities for those who wish to avail of them. At the moment, with the ever-increasing co-operation between the Garda and the Army, Army personnel find themselves on escort duty and Border duty and so on.  Yet the Army personnel are getting about half the take-home pay of their counterparts in the Garda.  This is not good for morale and warrants serious consideration.  Trained men are needed to use the kind of sophisticated equipment that the Army are using today.  But the situation is that because &ldquo;civvy street&rdquo; regards them as very highly skilled and will offer very high remuneration to these people it is difficult for the Army to hold on to them once they are trained.  We will have to take a new look at the whole situation.  We cannot expect men who have these skills to go in, give their services and be on call 24 hours a day.  I am saying this for the benefit of the Minister and the Opposition and all of the people who have to deal with these problems.</P>
    <P>From time to time there are strikes and the Army are the biggest fatigue party in the country.  If we have a bus strike they have to man the lorries.  If we have an oil strike they have to man the tankers, and in a refuse strike they have to go around and act as garbage collectors.  This is not the way to encourage young people to join the Army.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett referred to the bad living conditions.  I endorse everything he said because I know that there are men who have had to put up with conditions that would not be countenanced in &ldquo;civvy street&rdquo; for a moment.  It has always been the policy at budget time to leave the Department of Defence in the poor relation area because they cannot object. When the last resource we have in any situation is the morale and loyalty of the Army, it is short-sighted of us to short change them.  Deputy Barrett spoke about housing.  Portobello Barracks is probably the oldest inhabited barracks, apart from Collins Barracks.  It has 57 acres of prime land attached to it.  When <Col N="1922" /> it was put there it was never envisaged that the garrison would be surrounded by a city.  But time has caught up and that is what has happened.  These places would be far better off somewhere outside the city.  It occurred to me that a lot of money could be made for the Department of Defence through the sale of those 57 acres and they could then afford to provide modern and adequate accommodation for the Army.  Another dilemma is in relation to Army personnel looking for housing.  Because there was no alternative Dublin Corporation have de-tenanted some of the housing and included the people on the housing list.  But there are still many in totally unsatisfactory housing.  I am delighted to hear that the Minister is conscious of the fact that we need to improve pay and conditions.  But I appeal to him when we get down to the budget for the coming year not to allow the Department of Defence to become the poor relation and expect them to do with the lesser portion.  I am asking that they get fair and due consideration because of the important role they have played at every level in our society, and that we will make the Army so attractive that we will not be losing trained personnel to outside agencies.  If the equipment is there we need trained men to use it; otherwise there is no point in having it. I am asking also that consideration would be given to taking a new look at Army property to see what can be sold to get the money to provide suitable and adequate housing for those people.</P>
    <P>Again I would join with the Minister in the tribute that he has paid to those people because this country owes a great debt of gratitude to the men who have served in our Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to join my colleague, Deputy Barrett, in congratulating the Minister on achieving what has been achieved.  I join with the Minister in deploring the criticism of the men who serve in the Middle East.  I can never understand why people criticise those men who go out there and risk their lives.  We will recall the sermon on the Mount which says &ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers&rdquo;.  These are peacemakers <Col N="1923" /> out there and we should all be proud of them.  They are playing a big part in maintaining world peace especially today when two giant powers are growling at one another all the time and talking of war and nuclear shots.  We must be more than ever proud of those men who have gone out there.</P>
      <P>We should also mark the addition to the Defence Forces of the Women's Corps.  It is a new departure for this country and I am sure the women will equal the perfection of the men in their military duties.</P>
      <P>Deputies Glenn and Barrett spoke about the living quarters in barracks.  I know the Minister is conscious of this, as was Deputy Barrett when he was Minister. Indeed, for many years Ministers have been aware of the really bad married quarters in some of the barracks, particularly Cathal Brugha Barracks.  A start has been made there.  During my short sojourn at the Department of Defence with Deputy Barrett as Minister, the foundations of some new flats were laid.  It was appreciated by all the people there but this project was going ahead slowly.  Perhaps the Minister might consider some kind of a tie up between the local authority and the Department of Defence to provide accommodation in the city barracks.  Deputy Glenn referred to the sale of land at Cathal Brugha Barracks. There is a record on the file in the Minister's Department of a decision being taken to move in that direction.  I understand that that was changed afterwards and I understand there was some very good reason for changing it.  But perhaps the Minister would have a look at it to see if anything can be done along these lines to improve conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last, I would like to refer to the Civil Defence.  Again, during my short time as Minister of State, I travelled all around the country to officiate at various functions and exercises for the Civil Defence department and I have never seen such wonderful enthusiasm as that shown by the members for the task they have undertaken.  Not only have we a very good Civil Defence organisation but we also have a good social organisation in which <Col N="1924" /> young men and women &mdash; and some not so young &mdash; give their time voluntarily to learn about Civil Defence.  Their enthusiasm was infectious.  In any town where there is a Civil Defence organisation there is great civic pride.  I know it is hard to find money for everything but the Minister should eke out money from somewhere to provide new uniforms for Civil Defence personnel.  We promised this but the shortage of money inhibited our efforts.  It is well worth while bettering conditions for Civil Defence personnel. Their present uniforms are very heavy and unattractive.  There is a wonderful spirit in the Civil Defence organisation and they are not just marking time waiting for a catastrophe.  When there is a rail crash or when a mountain rescue team is needed these people play a tremendous part in helping their injured fellow citizens.  I also want to praise the Civil Defence organisation for their handling of the Vietnamese refugees.  They showed the typical efficiency which we have come to associate with any section of the Army.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will look into some of the matters I have mentioned: married quarters in some barracks and the provision of nicer uniforms for the Civil Defence organisation.  We should ignore criticism of the men who are serving in the Middle East.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Deputies who have spoken here this morning and who have paid a very well deserved tribute to our forces serving in the Lebanon.  They have a very difficult task to perform and operate under very hot and difficult conditions, hot in more than one sense of the term.  The situation in the Lebanon is complex and there are very many warring factions operating there which must add very considerably to the difficulties of any peace-keeping force in that region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of their task is to preserve a balance in that area between these different factions, which can be difficult to identify. To illustrate the complexity of the situation, the media have got into the habit in recent years of reporting events there.  You will find as a matter of course <Col N="1925" /> throughout the media, when they are talking about Christian villagers living in the Christian enclaves, they refer to them as the right-wing Christian militia, whereas when they are talking about Moslem villagers living in those areas they are referred to as left-wingers.  What basis there is for this has always mystified me.  They are villagers living in arid terrain, with very little agricultural land, and there are both Christians and Moslems struggling to make a livelihood out of that land in the war filled conditions which exist there.  I mentioned the point to illustrate the complexities of the situation that arise.  Having regard to the fact that our forces are operating in that area on a long-term basis, we and our politicians must take care to show a balanced and neutral position when our Ministers talk about matters affecting that area.  If they give the impression in any way that they are biased towards any of the various factions in that region, then they are making the task for our forces working there all the more difficult and complex.  The only hope that a peace-keeping force has of doing its job well is that the country they come from is known to be neutral.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the statement made by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lenihan, at Bahrain did not help the position of the forces operating in the Lebanon, because the statement contained a suggestion that we were departing from the essential neutrality which must be observed if mutual respect from all warring factions in the area is to be achieved.  The statement was damaging in that respect.  I know we are caught up with the policies and politics of the EEC and the EPC, but, to preserve the essentials of our neutrality in this respect, we must make sure that we dissociate ourselves from the unified policy of the other EEC countries.  The considerations that may motivate many countries in the EEC do not necessarily coincide with ours. Many of those countries come under the massive pressures of oil politics and the oil lobby is intense and massive.  We are as subject to that pressure as anybody else, but we are different in the sense that we are a country in the EEC which has soldiers and personnel operating in a sensitive <Col N="1926" /> area.  We should not participate in any statements or comments coming from an EEC source which would prejudice the position of those men.</P>
    <P>The total amount of money provided for in the Defence Estimate to cover Civil Defence is £875,000, a trifling sum.  I am very concerned that we are neglecting even the most basic necessary precautions that could threaten us in the event of a nuclear war.  We have had enough irresponsible talk in the last couple of weeks from Americans, statements about nuclear war being confined to Europe and setting off a nuclear war head as a warning.  This has certainly highlighted the situation.  If that were to happen &mdash; and it could happen at any time by design or by accident &mdash; I wonder what real protection there is for our people.  It is not just a matter of threatening us with a bomb.  We all know, from the incredible power and strength of these missiles accumulating in such enormous quantities in the United States and the Soviet Union, that even if they were exploded very far from our shores the radiation threat would affect us.  It will take more than new uniforms for the members of the Civil Defence to counter that situation. Has provision been made &mdash; and I strongly suspect that it has not &mdash; to provide even basic shelters to protect people here in the event of a belt of radiation coming at us from nuclear explosions in Europe?</P>
    <P>I do not intend, or want, to cause fears that any such eventuality is likely, or probable.  However, we must think about these things, as they are real possibilities. If they were to happen, it would then be too late to do anything about it.  Now is the time, when we have the opportunity to give thought to it, to make preparations for the eventuality.  The man who takes out fire insurance on his house does not expect, or want, his house to go on fire, but takes out fire insurance cover, nonetheless.  I cannot see that £875,000 for civil defence will do anything that will give very much protection in the event of a nuclear holocaust breaking out in Europe.  Some of the talk of recent times frightens me, such as of setting off a <Col N="1927" /> nuclear bomb as a warning.</P>
    <P>We must review the situation.  I do not know how much information is available to the public on civil defence.  The only item that I can recollect goes back very many years, when a booklet was circulated &mdash; I presume by the Department of Defence &mdash; giving information as to how to organise one's home to achieve some minimum form of protection for oneself and one's family.  I am sure that that must have been 10 or 15 years ago and I cannot see that any real information has been given to the public from that date to this.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and the officials of the Department of Defence to have a rethink on the situation and consider whether now might not be the time to re-examine the situation and have a long, hard look as to whether we are doing enough in this regard.  No money which could be spent on an insurance policy, which is what this is, can be over-spent. We are talking here about the possibility &mdash; albeit a remote possibility &mdash; of danger to life and limb and, indeed, to the very continuity of our nation.  Any money required to pay these insurance premiums would be very well spent.</P>

        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I compliment the Minister on bringing in this very necessary Supplementary Estimate. We have been appalled over many years at the lack of adequate accommodation for members of the Armed Forces.  There is no provision in this Estimate for funds to try to remedy this very sad situation. Many members of our Armed Forces are asked to live in severely dilapidated dwellings.  Indeed, the term &ldquo;slum&rdquo; would be a fitting description for many of the units of accommodation in the military barracks around this city and the country.  We ask the young children being recruited in the Armed Forces to face the bullet for the rest of their lives.  That is the oath which they take; that is the task which they take up.  Yet, we cannot find, within our system, sufficient funds or interest to provide adequate accommodation for them and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has always been of great interest to Members of Fine Gael and to the Minister <Col N="1928" /> personally to try to come to some agreement on the provision of adequate accommodation and a fitting environment for the patriotic youth of our country who dedicate their lives to the protection of this country and its institutions. This Estimate, unfortunately, does not contain any provision for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair was about to advise the Deputy of that position.  I would ask him not to develop, at any great length, any matter which is not referred to in the actual Estimate. The requirements of this debate would be that we concentrate on what is in the Estimate, rather than on what is omitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne (Dublin North-West) Dr. Byrne (Dublin North-West)">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I thank the Chair for its directions.  I am merely pointing out its presence by the strength of its absence from the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In looking after the Defence Forces from a financial point of view and the administration of the Armed Forces, there are many sections which could do with immediate and radical attention.  It is not sufficient merely to diagnose the problems, defects and shortcomings, but very necessary to provide treatment for these.  The Minister has mentioned provision of a subsection dealing with equipment. It has been known for many years that until the previous Coalition Government came into power the equipment of our Army was perhaps the worst in Europe.  A great drive was made then to improve the equipment and working conditions of the soldier and this took place for a number of years under successive Ministers.  However, the fact that an improvement has taken place is not sufficient grounds for complacency.  We should strive to improve the lot of our fighting soldiers, particularly as they are engaged nowadays in such hazardous roles as peace-keeping overseas, a peace-keeping scene which has changed dramatically over the past 20 years, from our first peace-keeping trip to the Congo in the early sixties.  We are now engaged in a totally new area of sophisticated armaments and weaponry and sophisticated terrorism not seen heretofore &mdash; possibly one of the most lethal and <Col N="1929" /> vicious areas of subversive type activities and attack upon the person.</P>
    <P>All efforts should be made to involve co-operation from countries with more sophisticated protection for the individual soldier &mdash; bullet-proof jackets and other methods of protecting him from bodily injury.  We saw, with great regret, the kidnapping of one of our troops in Lebanon. There is still no report of what has happened to that unfortunate soldier.  We have also seen recently 500 of our troops arriving back from a strenuous and dangerous tour of duty in the Lebanon and having all their equipment, goods and presents seized by the customs.  Both the Department of Finance and the Department of Defence could possibly have acted in a more humane manner on that occasion.  These men might have been given a little leniency and not limited to the petty amount of £27 allowed duty-free for presents and goods to bring back to their loved ones and their families here.</P>
    <P>With regard to equipment, and particularly with regard to the Air Corps and Naval Service, Baldonnel, the headquarters of the Army Air Corps, is possibly undermanned and not able to keep up with the new and more frequent landings and take-offs there.  This could be partly due to a reduction in the number of people stationed there.  I would like the Minister to have a look at this, particularly in regard to the extra strain on the small airport there in dealing with the Government's jet and other landings there.  The Air Corps are providing very important facilities to the medical services in transporting injured, infirm and acutely ill people from all parts of the country to the emergency services in the hospitals mainly in the Dublin area.  This can provide a great strain at times.  I would like the Minister to look into the number of people at Baldonnel Airport to ensure that the number is adequate to deal with the services when they are stretched almost to breaking point.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at the fishery protection vessels to ensure that they are modernised.  As we are protecting very large fishing stocks for European countries the EEC should provide some of the <Col N="1930" /> capital necessary to provide ships and equipment for fishery protection and also contribute towards the maintenance of those ships, which is very costly.  The EEC could also provide money for the Air Corps to help them to provide protection around our coasts.</P>
    <P>We all know that there are great problems in urban areas in relation to our youth.  We should ask members of the Defence Forces to provide an unarmed work corps.  People convicted of vandalism and some of the layabouts around the city area could be recruited into this corps.  Under the jurisdiction of the Army they could be immediately dealt with for any misdemeanour they commit because there is a court there and the officer in charge could impose a fine, a short-term in the glasshouse or extra duties as punishment. The Army could help to alleviate the existing situation in relation to muggers and maulers.  I emphasise that this would have to be an unarmed work corps under the jurisdiction of the Armed Forces.  They would not be trained in weaponry or how to hurt their fellow men.  Instead of places like Loughan House being built to lock up young children they could be given a decent training in such an unarmed corps.  They would have to get up early in the morning and be taught a trade.</P>

        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I was referring to this under-recruitment. Those people could be directly recruited from the courts and instead of being sent to jail they could be sent to this unarmed corps where they could learn a trade. They could be taken from the courts and given voluntary service in this work corps. This would enable them to pay back their debt to society and they could be helped to develop into people who would fit into society in two or three years.</P>

        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I bow to your ruling.  The present strength of the Armed Forces is 14,850.  I welcome the introduction of the female armed section and wish them well in their future careers.  Many people have admired the way they have taken on a new career.  I compliment the Minister and all those associated with the introduction of this section of the Armed Forces.</P>
      <P>With regard to wages I would like to refer to the money paid to people in the Army who teach different trades to members of the Armed Forces.  Different trades can be learned in the Air Corps, the Army and the Naval Services and the people who train the members of the different forces are paid out of the Defence Forces Estimate.  I would like the Minister to take a look at the trades available to people in the Navy.  There is a very limited number available to people in the Naval Service.  I would like the Minister to do everything possible to widen the scope of the trades available. This is an investment in training those people to come back into civilian life and be financially independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to commiserate with the Minister for having to bring in this Supplementary Estimate because provision was not made by the previous Administration. I hope the Minister can give attention to some of the points I have raised.  I wish him well in his appointment as Minister for Defence.  I know he has been connected with the Armed Forces for practically all his adult life.  It has been said that inside everybody's haversack there is a field marshall's baton.  In this case that has proved to be very true and there is no better man to be at the head of our Defence Forces at the present time.  I would like to express appreciation <Col N="1932" /> on behalf of my constituents for the work the Army are doing backing up the Garda Siochána in providing such excellent security over the last few years and for the excellent work they have done overseas. The public have great confidence in the Armed Forces.  Their efficiency and conduct are second to none.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank those who wished me well.  I wish Deputy Barrett and Deputy Moore well in their positions, and I hope they will be there for a long time.  While most of the comments made were very constructive, and I do not want to start a political argument on this Supplementary Estimate, I have to correct something which Deputy Barrett said. While I agree that quite an amount of the money required under the Supplementary Estimate was due to increases granted during the year, increased costs and so on, there is one factor to which I must refer.  The original allocation in the budget early this year was £82,151,000. This provided for an average strength of NCO's and men of 10,700.  When the budget was introduced the strength was 12,194.  The only way in which the men in the Defence Forces could be paid was if they were reduced by about 3,000.  I do not know whether that was the intention of the then Government, or whether this matter was not properly considered when the original Estimate was introduced. The plain fact is that there was not enough money to pay the people in the Army if this Supplementary Estimate was not introduced, because the necessary money was not provided at the beginning of the year when the budget was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the greatest sympathy with Deputy Barrett.  I know how difficult it is for Ministers for Defence to get money for the Defence Estimate.  Nobody has to twist my arm to get me to do the right thing for the Department of Defence.  I have been in this House for a long time, and my record down through the years shows that I have always been on the side of the Department of Defence.  I have the greatest respect in the world for the <Col N="1933" /> Department and the people serving in it, both civilian and military.  The House can be assured that everything that can be done to improve the position in the Department of Defence will be done.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer in passing to a couple of things Deputy Byrne said. While I would agree with many of the things he said, I would not agree with him entirely.  So far as I am concerned the layabouts of the cities and towns will not be moved into the Army to teach them manners or anything else.  We do not want them.  We will not have them. Over the years the standard of the people accepted into the Defence Forces has improved so much that it is now an honour to be accepted.  Those who are accepted have to be of good character and be people who will not let down the colours.  I should like to see things continuing in that way.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the decision of the Revenue Commissioners to tax certain items coming in here from the soldiers in Lebanon.  I was a bit annoyed when I heard that their little gifts were subject to duty.  I have to say that the Revenue Commission officers on duty only did what they were there to do. There were exceptional circumstances. The gifts came unaccompanied.  Normally Army goods should not be opened by the customs people but, at the same time, the law says a certain thing and people have to do their duty.  I hope when the matter is fully considered whatever money was paid by the soldiers coming back from the Lebanon will be returned to them.  I cannot promise that it will, but it is my wish that it should be done.  Our soldiers in Lebanon are under threat to their lives from the time they go out there until they come home.  It is poor recompense that whatever items they bring back with them are subject to duty.  The entire amount is not very high.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mervyn Taylor referred to comments made about whether they were left wing or right wing.  When the men go out there and find that on one side they are under threat from Major Haddad's forces and on the other side from the PLO forces, they do not mind whether they are left or right or what <Col N="1934" /> they are called.  They are there to prevent infiltration.  They are doing a damn good job.  We must all give them credit for it. I should like to see them treated a little better when they come home.  It is a pity that this should have happened.</P>
    <P>On the question of trades for the men in the Naval Service, they do not join the Naval Service to learn a trade.  However, I will have a look at this and see if something can be done about it.</P>
    <P>The provision of new buildings was mentioned by Deputy Barrett in particular. He was not quite correct when he talked about the oldest barracks in Ireland.  The oldest barracks in Ireland is the one in Cavan, as far as I know.  It was built in 1710 and it is still occupied as a military post.  In 1740 an officer in charge of the barracks described it as a most unsuitable building and very uncomfortable. It has not improved since 1740.  I was in it for a short period in 1940 and it was not good then.  I hope that some time later this year we will be in a position to erect a new barracks in Cavan.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that people in that area and in many other areas tend to object when it is proposed to provide a barracks in their area.  We have had far too many objectors.  The former Minister had them too and agreed that a barracks should not be built in a certain place.  I have now decided for a different reason that it will not be built there.  I consider that it is a most unsuitable site.  We have to build a barracks in Cavan.  When soldiers are stationed in a town they are as good as an industry.  The amount of money they spend is very great.  I wish people would stop treating soldiers as if they were people who were not wanted in their area.</P>
    <P>On the question of housing for soldiers, certain local authorities brush off their responsibility in this regard by saying it is a matter for the Army.  It is not. Soldiers are people.  If they are living in an area and are entitled to be rehoused the local authority should give them the same consideration as anyone else.  The problem of overholding in barracks at the moment could be solved if local authorities <Col N="1935" /> would consider the people who are overholding and rehouse them.</P>
    <P>At present we are trying to improve the living conditions of a number of people in the married quarters in those barracks.  I do not know whether this is the answer.  When people have been living in married quarters for a long time and leave the Army after a long period apparently they are nobody's babies.  The Army cannot keep them on because they need the accommodation for somebody else.  Many local authorities do not want to accommodate them.  The whole matter is under review.  My predecessors built a number of new married quarters and we hope to build more.  It is a problem which has to be looked at.</P>
    <P>I hope to go down to the Limerick barracks on Sunday week.  The question of providing new buildings at Knockalisheen is being studied at present by the military authorities.  I hope we will be able to erect a barracks there, and a number of others.  Some work has been done in Gormanston, some in Dundalk and some in Monaghan.  The whole trouble is money.  Deputy Glenn referred to Cathal Brugha Barracks.  There are two schools of thought.  One is that it should be sold and the money given to the Department of Defence.  I wonder have a Government ever sold property and earmarked the money before it was sold for a certain Department?  We all know that if Cathal Brugha barracks were sold whatever money was obtained would belong to the Government and not the Department of Defence.  I would not be too sure that that is the answer to the problem.  It may be an answer and it is being considered at present.  New buildings are being erected there.  I do not think it is an immediate problem in respect of the question of accommodation. The matter cannot be disposed of in the foreseeable future but perhaps something will be done.  New billets are being erected there and at Gormanston and we hope to increase the permanent Defence Force accommodation around Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Glenn referred to pay and conditions of service.  I think some people do <Col N="1936" /> not get the right end of the stick when they talk about these things.  The Department of Defence have kept reasonably in line with outside employment when the matter of adjusting pay arises.  When the Army are asked to do exceptional services, particularly where they are involved in strikes, I do not consider them merely fatigue parties.  I think they are doing a national job and this is appreciated even by those on strike.  It is accepted that the Defence Forces are in a special position. They are paid an additional sum for that: they are not just rushed out to do a dirty job without any payment for it.  I am as anxious as anybody else to see that people in the Defence Forces are paid well.  A young recruit starts with £86.73 per week and after about 14 weeks this rises to £101.47.  That is not bad.  After three years service the gross pay for a private is £114 per week.  I do not need anyone to twist my arm to see that soldiers are treated properly.  As long as I am Minister for Defence I will make sure that is the case.  I accept the point made by Deputy Glenn that they have to be well treated and it is right that they should be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hugh Byrne referred to landing facilities and he said something would have to be done to improve the position. He will be glad to know that progress on the modernisation of airfield facilities is continuing.  The latest improvement was the installation of a Doppler VHF Omni-range at Casement Airfield in 1980 and the replacement of the radar system at Casement is to be proceeded with.  This will enable landings to be made in poor visability conditions.  It is hoped that the radar will come into service next year.</P>
    <P>The peace establishment of the Air Corps has been increased from 869 to 1,172 all ranks to cater for expansion of the Air Corps in the field of fisheries protection and coastal patrol and the provision of a transport service.  The current strength is 764.  The question of vehicles was referred to.  We hope to provide a considerable number of new vehicles. The numbers of trucks, landrovers, motor cycles, saloon cars and tipper trucks have increased in the past few years and we hope to provide further <Col N="1937" /> supplies.  The major problem is that particularly on the Border the amount of mileage covered by the vehicles is astonishing. This applies especially to light vehicles.  If a person did not actually see what was happening possibly he would not believe the vehicles are doing as much mileage as is the case.</P>
    <P>So far as equipment is concerned, while I cannot give details because I do not think it would be in order, substantial sums in excess of £12 million have been spent in the past year on new equipment. We will continue with this work.  We are anxious to keep up with the best in the world and people cannot say now that we have not got the equipment and arms that are needed.  One of the things that shocks me is the cost of some of the ammunition needed for the bigger guns.  Somebody maintained that the cost of firing a few shots would feed a family for a year.  This is one of the things that has to be considered. A balance must be maintained in this area.  It costs an enormous amount of money to provide training but if the Army do not carry out this training they will not know how to use the guns.</P>
    <P>Civil Defence was mentioned by a few speakers.  Deputy Moore spoke about the uniform.  The original uniform was designed in 1958 and, although suggestions for its improvement were made from time to time, it remained unaltered in design and quality until 1973, when it was decided to provide an improved type of uniform made from a more refined cloth and with some changes in design.  It doubles as a uniform and working dress. A committee were appointed to examine the suitability of the present uniform for Civil Defence purposes and they have recommended further improvements. However, the cost is substantial and that is one of the matters that will have to be considered before a decision is made to change the uniform.  However, a fresh look is being taken at the situation.</P>
    <P>The question was raised whether there should be some way of fixing the rate of pay of members of the Defence Forces. It was suggested that in other countries trade unions have been set up.  While I am a great advocate of trade unions in civilian employment, I think the Army <Col N="1938" /> have been able to keep up with trade union rates, even though they are not represented by a trade union.  Traditionally the welfare of the Defence Forces is the special care of the government of the day.  All of the governments have not been slow to ensure that in the matter of pay and conditions of service the Defence Forces have kept in line with other public sector employees.  There is no immediate need for a change in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mervyn Taylor raised a relevant point, namely, the whole matter of Civil Defence.  In 1965 a Civil Defence home protection handbook was issued and approximately 700,000 copies were distributed at that time.  Further distributions were made in 1968 and in 1972 for houses built since the previous issue. Copies of the booklet are handed out to the public at the Civil Defence Stand during the RDS Spring Show and at other shows throughout the country and are made available to individuals on request. The information contained in the booklet is still substantially correct.  However, it is being re-examined with a view to bringing it up-to-date.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mervyn Taylor expressed a view that others have put forward in the past few weeks, namely, what general protection arrangements have we made in the event of an accidental or otherwise radioactive fall-out?  I am afraid the answer is: very little.  While the Civil Defence organisation are doing a good job in the circumstances, very few arrangements have been made to try to provide shelters.  Occasionally when somebody is building a house he requests information regarding any facilities he might get in the provision of a shelter but he is considered a kind of crank.  The Government must get down to the whole question of Civil Defence protection against radioactive fall-out.  There are a number of old buildings that could be used.  I propose to have a survey carried out in an effort to bring home to people the fact that the situation could be far more serious than many think it to be.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £24,504,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1981, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and of certain other services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The main Estimate for my Department for 1981 was for a net sum of £302.029 million.  The Supplementary Estimate which I am now introducing will increase that amount to £326.533 million.  It makes additional provision for £35.333 million under eight subheads, but this will be offset by savings of £2.598 million on three subheads and increased appropriations-in-aid of £8.231 million, thus reducing the amount now required to £24.405 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I comment on the individual subheads, I would like to say that the amount of the Supplementary Estimate would have been higher but for the decisions of the present Government to curtail current expenditure generally in 1981 as part of their plan to reduce the high <Col N="1940" /> budget deficit.  Deputies will remember that the Minister for Finance in his Financial Statement of 21 July 1981 said at the end of June borrowing for current purposes was £457 million or almost 90 per cent of the target for the whole year; that this had happened because of increases in current spending; that the majority of these increases had arisen because the money allocated was insufficient, without changes in policy to finance the programmes it was supposed to implement; and that if the present trends were to continue unchecked, current spending for the year would be £500 million more than the January budget estimate.  He accordingly announced that the Government had taken decisions which will reduce non-capital spending by various Departments in 1981 by £148 million as compared with what it would otherwise have been.</P>
    <P>Part of the supplementary amount now needed is to meet special pay increases for which no provision was made in my Department's original Estimate although an allocation of £80 million was included in the budget to cover possible pay increases in the civil service generally.</P>
    <P>An extra sum of £20.687 million is needed under subhead A, £9.712 million is for special pay increases, £502,000 for higher social welfare employers' contributions and £10.473 million for overtime, the provision for which had been pitched at too low a level in the original Estimate.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £3.574 million is needed under subhead B, mainly because of higher costs of travelling and subsistence by engineering staff.  The higher expenditure under this heading was due to a revised agreement with the staff governing conditions for payment of subsistence and to higher rates for travelling and subsistence approved by the Department of the Public Service.</P>
    <P>Under subhead D an additional sum of £904,000 is required to meet higher costs of conveyance of mails by rail, road and air.</P>
    <P>The additional sum of £2.217 million required under subhead E is mainly to meet increased costs of petrol, oil and spare parts for postal vehicles and because inadequate provision was made <Col N="1941" /> for stationery and office requisites and for watermarked paper and printing of stamps.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £7.3 million is required under subhead F for increased expenditure on engineering stores and equipment because of higher prices and extra requirements to meet the telephone development programme.</P>
    <P>The extra £270,000 needed under subhead J is required to meet higher cost of pensions and lump sums because of pay increases.</P>
    <P>Under subhead K3 an additional £231,000 is required to meet increased rental of data processing machines and for the purchase and lease of extra machines required for extension of computerisation within the Department.</P>
    <P>Under subhead L2 an additional £150,000 is being provided because extra receipts payable to the Exchequer in respect of cable television licence fees in 1981 will be higher than expected and the grant to RTE under this subhead is fixed as the equivalent of the net receipts from such fees.</P>
    <P>Of the increase of £8.231 million under appropriations-in-aid a sum of £1.8 million is due to recoupment of higher expenditure on telephone development from telephone capital funds.  The balance of the increase arises from refund of higher costs of operating the Post Office Savings Bank &mdash; £4.5 million &mdash; for the Department of Finance; sale of engineering stores, £325,000; compensation from the Department of Social Welfare for loss of social insurance stamp business in sub-offices, £750,000; increased staff contributions to Widows and Orphan's Pension Scheme, £500,000; and other miscellaneous items, £356,000.</P>
    <P>I already mentioned that there will be savings of £2.598 million under three subheads. The main saving of £2.351 million will be on subhead C and is due to lower expenditure on sites and buildings for telephone purposes, offset by higher expenditure on rented accommodation and electricity charges.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset, the net additional sum now required is £24.504 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to what the Minister had to say about this Supplementary Estimate and I wish to put on record that I cannot accept the reasons expressed by him for bringing in this Supplementary Estimate.  I hope in the course of my response to show that no Supplementary Estimate was necessary.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that the second paragraph of the Minister's speech came from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. It was either from the Department of Finance or from the Government.  It renews what I called the propaganda paragraph dealing with the State's finances in relation to the budget of 21 July. Seeing that it has been included in the statement I should like to put a few questions to the Minister that have remained unanswered since the Government came to power.</P>
      <P>The current deficit is stated to be £952 million.  I and many other Deputies from this side of the House asked where that figure came from.  It has never been defined.  I asked for a breakdown of it but it has never been given.  One can produce figures and it is very easy to do so but it is a different matter if one is put on the spot to give information on them so that they can be constructively criticised.  I can only assume that this figure cannot be quantified by anyone.  In their projection for the current budget deficit for this year the Central Bank have not arrived at any such figure and neither have the ESRI or any other body.  Therefore, I hope the Minister will take the opportunity when replying of giving us some definition of this £952 million.  The Central Bank have not deviated from their projected figure of about £800 million.  That is the figure they were talking about both pre-budget and post-budget.  The ESRI produced a pre-supplementary budget current deficit of £770 million.  I fail to understand how the figure of £952 million was arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk about decisions taken by the Government to reduce current budget expenditure in this year we are entitled to be given some of the facts as to where the savings have taken place.  In the budget statement of July 21 there was reference to a figure in this connection of <Col N="1943" /> £148 million.  In the Minister's speech at that time there was an indication of where part of that amount could be accounted for.  This was by way of the increase in charges being allowed to the ESB and the Minister assumed that the Fianna Fáil Government had intended subsidising the ESB to the extent of the charges that were not allowed earlier in the year.  We have been accused of not allowing the increases for political reasons but we know that the ESB applied for an increase of only 12½ per cent.  That was at the beginning of the year but when we considered the trends in world markets in respect of oil and so on and when we considered also the total financial position of the board, we decided that in the difficult economic circumstances in which we found ourselves this was not the year to sanction an increase in ESB charges. However, not only did the new Government sanction the increase but they doubled it thereby allowing the ESB to increase charges by 25 per cent.  Shortly afterwards the ESB accounts were published and showed a profit of £6.6 million. Built into those accounts was a depreciation of £28 million.  That is normal but what is abnormal is amortisation of £28 million and which we all know represents a doubling up and an improvement in the cash flow.  It was not responsible of the Government to sanction the increases in the present circumstances.  Their decision will have serious repercussions not only for the individual user but for industry during the coming winter months.  It will have a serious effect also on the accounts of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs since they, also, are a commercial concern.</P>
    <P>We should be told where the remainder of the £148 million is to be saved. Despite all the propaganda about what this Government are doing, despite the long meetings that took place behind closed doors early in July, we find from the Exchequer returns for the third quarter of this year that current public expenditure is running at just more than 5 per cent more that it was for the first half of the year.  The figure when we left office was 20 per cent greater than 1980 <Col N="1944" /> figures but that was not exorbitant when we take into consideration that the inflation rate was not very much more.  The figure now is 30 per cent ahead of the 1980 figures.  That is not in line with the sort of propaganda that is inherent in the statement of the Minister today or in any other statement emanating from the Government.</P>
    <P>Apart from the extra revenue that will accrue as a result of the supplementary budget we know that returns for the last quarter will show a big increase also but the £952 million figure has not been quantified. I hope to show during my contribution that the reason given for this Supplementary Estimate is not the real reason.  The Government are trying to put the blame for the requirements of extra money on us by saying that we did not provide for sufficient funds under the various headings.  Within the past week spokesmen of the Department of Finance have admitted that of the £332 million they have been telling us was being saved, £134 million is not a real saving, that it represents demands being made for additional equity by semi-State bodies. Therefore, this £134 million is not being considered this year.  It is being put forward into next year.  This was a sleight-of-hand in the presentation of figures to the public and to the House but I suspect that this illusory amount is part of the £952 million current budget deficit.  We are entitled to know how the balance is made up.</P>
    <P>Regarding CIE charges, the Minister will know from the records that there was no question of a postponement of increases so far as we are concerned.  In the first half of the year there was a conscious Government decision not to increase fares.  This decision was taken as part of our anti-inflation programme.  In addition, we realised that it would not make good sense to increase transport charges at a time when the transport fleet was breaking down all over the place.  To have allowed the increases would have discouraged people from using public transport whereas our aim was to do the opposite.  A Supplementary Estimate was approved unanimously here for the purpose of recouping CIE to the extent of <Col N="1945" /> £9 million.  Therefore, there is no point in the Government endeavouring to include CIE and the ESB as part of the savings they are talking of.  I shall wait patiently to learn how the £148 million can be made up.</P>
    <P>From listening to the propaganda put forward by the Government one would be forgiven for thinking that this is the first year in which Supplementary Estimates were introduced whereas we have had them for practically every year since budgets were introduced to the House. Because of the nature of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, they will always lend themselves to the necessity for Supplementary Estimates but the reasons for this must be given.  This Department are a service Department and should not be treated in the same way as any other State Department at Estimate time.  They offer a round-the-clock, 365-days a year service to the public in the area of telecommunications and also on the postal side. The public are paying for the service and they are entitled to have it.  Consequently, we must provide for any contingency that may arise in the Department during the year.  An example of such contingency was the breakdown in the lines in Clare Street not very long ago and when, if all the available people had not been put to work on the necessary repairs, about 1,400 business people might have been put out of business because of not having telex and telephone services for some time.  That would have happened if the philosophy being propagated by the Department of Finance had been brought to its logical conclusion.</P>
    <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs are a service Department.  They must be looked at and treated separately in that respect in relation to the service they perform and the way they serve the public.  The public are paying dearly for the service and are entitled to ask for and get it.  This Department are always subject to the very same increases as any other industrial project, manufacturing industry or otherwise, in the private sector. They are subject to normal increases in rates.  When the people in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs do their <Col N="1946" /> Estimates starting in July or August they are not aware what the rates will be for the following year.  They are subject to the increases that take place in electricity charges, to which I have already referred. Was anybody aware of what this increase would be last September-October or December when these Estimates were made out?  Could you look into your crystal ball and see what they were going to be?  Could the people there have been aware as to what decisions would be taken in the budget that affected the Department of Posts and Telegraphs? There have been increases in the price of petrol and oil, and the Department operate a very big transport fleet.  All those areas come up during the year for decision at various times, and it was not possible, nor will it ever be possible for anyone doing Estimates in October, November and early December to foresee what these increases would be.  There is no point in trying to put a different picture on it.  That is the reality.  I have been there for a short time and I know the reality.  You must look at reality and not be living in cloud-cuckoo land.</P>
    <P>When we look at the way the Estimates are approached in relation to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs &mdash; it is probably the same for any other Department; I have experience in only one &mdash; we see that no allowance is made by the Department of Finance for contingencies during the year.  This is the way the business is run, and when this is the way it is run you play the game by the rules.  In the private sector that would not be termed good accountancy if contingencies were not allowed for, but this is the way the system runs.  You play it by the rules and there is no point in trying to say that the rules are changing from year to year.  They are not.  They are the very same rules as always.  During this year I attempted to change the rules somewhat, and had that course been followed through the amount the Government would be seeking in this House today through the Supplementary Estimate would be no more than £5 million and it might be even slightly less.</P>
    <P>No allowance is made for contingencies by the Department of Posts and Tele-of-han <Col N="1947" /> graphs in relation to Estimates.  Neither is there any allowance in the Estimates in the beginning of the year for claims that are being negotiated freely through the civil service arbitration scheme.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs employing as they do over 28,500 employees, represent half the civil service. Surely any sensible, reasonable person looking at the situation will know full well that in the pipeline at all times there must be various claims from various sectors of that huge Department and the huge number of people employed there. No contingency allowance is made in any Estimates of any year for awards that may be made.  It is not possible to prejudge what awards may be made or what negotiations will be entered into freely during the year.  Of course, we know the approach of this Government to agreements negotiated freely in areas of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs since they came in.  The biggest item here in relation to the Supplementary Estimate is wages, travelling expenses and adjustment of allowances.  The bulk of what we are looking at here is the outcome of agreements negotiated freely and entered into freely.  No contingency allowance is made by the Department of Finance for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in advance.  Consequently you have and will continue to have a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs every year.</P>
    <P>I come to the main point and I will listen with interest to what the Minister has to say in reply.  In my time over there I examined in detail both the current and capital Estimates of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I found that the building and equipping of new telex exchanges are paid for out of current expenditure.  The building and equipping of new post offices are paid for out of current expenditure and the new data exchanges and all that goes with them in equipment are paid for out of current expenditure.  You do not need an accountancy mind or a very upper-class intelligence to know that if you build telephone exchanges and they are paid for out of capital expenditure it is not a great challenge <Col N="1948" /> to anybody's intelligence to know that so too should telex exchanges, data exchanges, new post offices and all that goes in that area be part of a capital programme.  There is a traditional reason for this which goes away back into the past.  Even the Department of Posts and Telegraphs do not mention telephones, telecommunications, telex or data.  This is one of the oldest Departments of State. It was posts and telegraphs and all that was involved in the early stages was sending telegrams.  We have moved a long way since that, but the Estimates for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have not moved with the times and with modern developments.  When I looked at the situation very closely I found that the statutory position did not allow that situation to be rectified and put right.  However, I took the opportunity early this year in this House of bringing in what used to be called a telephone Bill.  I changed it to &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo; and I made provision for this situation to be put right.  It should have been put right, but the matter has not been followed through.  The expenditure for the items which I mentioned and many other capital items still appears in the current account of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which is the wrong place for it.  Had that exercise been followed through, the legislation that I introduced earlier in this House would have resulted in up to £20 million being moved from current expenditure, where it is wrongly placed, to the capital account.  If you were to subtract that from the net figure of the Supplementary Estimate brought forward here today of £24.45 million odd, there would be little or no need for any Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>When we look at savings and where they are taking place in relation to some subheads, surely we must question whether it is the responsible and sensible thing to do.  When we talk about the reduction in subhead C of money on sites and buildings, is it good commercial philosophy to follow the road of cutting back on a development programme at this time?  We must take a commercial view in relation to the development programme. Time is money and if we postpone <Col N="1949" /> the buying of sites and the erection of buildings, does anybody suggest seriously that it is going to cost less next year or the year after or the year after that? Time is money, but the public sector apparently do not take the same view as the private sector.  They are always inclined to cut back programmes, to push them back down the line, but the end result will be that it will cost more money in the long term.  In the commercial area in which the Department of Posts and Telegraphs operate the best commercial sensible approach is to do the job as fast as you can do it.  It is going to cost less now.  It is going to bring all the other investments you have made prior to now into being much more quickly and you are going to have a quicker return on your investment and at the end of the day you are doing a better job for the country and for the taxpayer.  Forget about the philosophy of trying to do only a bit this year, only a bit next year and only a bit the year after.  That is the expensive way in the long term.  It is penny wise and pound foolish.  It is not a good approach to a commercial situation such as exists in this Department.  I hope that in that programme there will be no cutbacks of any material that will upset the programme that is there.</P>
    <P>The economy and the country need it very badly.  Exporters rely very heavily on telex and telephones.  This is their lifeline in business.  We should do everything we can to help them rather than making cutbacks in these areas.</P>
    <P>Balancing books is a philosophy which is being tossed about.  In this area that is bad business and the economy and the taxpayer will be the sufferers in the long term.  What effect will these cuts have on our economy?  I wonder what is the strategy of this Government to high unemployment when I see what is taking place, and what is reported to be taking place, in that Department.  No new jobs are being created.  Up to now no telephone installers have been employed.  There have not been any exams for trainee technicians. There have not been any promotions or new positions, although the telecommunications are is expanding. <Col N="1950" /> What will that do for our unemployed?</P>
    <P>I read with interest the budget statement of the Minister for Finance.  I thought there was a glimmer of hope and he was seeing the light of day in the area of recruitment to the productive part of the public service.  In a situation of rising unemployment and an expanding telecommunications business, it is daft to cut back on jobs that need to be filled by technicians, trainee installers, labourers, engineers and so on.  These jobs are available so why not train the young people to do them?</P>
    <P>I regret the clock has been turned back in this area.  I also very much regret that agreements freely negotiated under the conciliation and arbitration scheme when I was in office were set aside after the 21 July embargo and the Department were reneging on implementing those agreements. That is a breach of goodwill between management and unions.  What do the negotiators who have gone through a great deal of trouble to get those agreements, feel when the Government of the day refuse to implement those agreements?  I ask the Minister to look at this area again and to tell the House that agreements negotiated by a previous Minister with the trade unions will be honoured.  If they are not honoured &mdash; there is a deadline and I have heard it said the Government may change their minds &mdash; there will be trouble not only in the development programme but in the maintenance of services.  Everybody knows there is a history of bad industrial relations in that Department. We changed the situation and if this Government do not implement agreements reached during the term of the previous administration, I believe they are going along the wrong road which will affect the Department, the public and the development of our economy.</P>
    <P>I cannot see the sense of not employing the many school-leavers who are coming on the employment market.  Many of these people are suited to the jobs available &mdash; trainee installers, technicians and so on.  I cannot understand why the embargo should apply to the productive sector of the public service.  I raised this matter with the Minister for Finance last <Col N="1951" /> week and I am raising it with this Minister today because it is not good economic policy to shut the door on opportunities that exist for young people.  Why not train as many people as we can because we will need them in the future?  For too long the Department were starved of the required number of engineers.  In a projection for the eighties &mdash; having looked at the requirements of the private sector and the Department &mdash; it transpired that the universities will not produce sufficient electrical engineers to meet requirements. Over the last year engineers have been recruited to the Department.  Why should we stop recruitment now?  These people are needed now more than ever before and we should take this opportunity to recruit them so that we can implement this programme.  We should give school leavers the opportunity to take up good and interesting careers in telecommunications. They should not be stymied by the policy pursued by this Government of no recruitment to the productive sector of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>This is a big and unwieldy Department but an interesting area in which to work. In my short time in office I tried to look at the vast amount of work done in Dublin.  I am sure the Minister is having the same problem I had, that is, many people come to our clinics and ask for transfers to the country.  The initial step of decentralisation was taken by the previous Government who transferred some work to Waterford and Dundalk, but that should be only the start.  There is far too much work done in Dublin.  Too many rural people are working in Dublin, and not by choice because they would love to work in their own areas.</P>
    <P>With the development of computerisation there is more room for decentralisation. The accounts department need not be in Dublin.  By linking computer lines to the computer in Dublin that job can be done anywhere.  For that reason I took a decision to appoint regional managers, with responsibility for sending out accounts and collecting money.  We would have a far more efficient and effective service if we expanded this <Col N="1952" /> operation.</P>
    <P>An application for a telephone involves 29 pieces of paper.  We should get away from that situation and take full advantage of the computer industry by streamlining that operation.  This could affect not only telephone applications but also accounts and many other areas.  If we did this the Department of Posts and Telegraphs could be the most efficient Department of the State.</P>
    <P>Computerisation has brought many advantages.  What happened the directory inquiry computer service I had tested and which was ready to be introduced when I left office?  For a short period there was an industrial dispute which has been settled for some time.  Yet I have not seen the introduction of the directory inquiry computer service which is so badly needed by the public.  This work imposes a very heavy workload on telephone operators.  By using the new service a person could find a telephone number within a few seconds.  Perhaps the Minister would tell the House when this new service will be introduced.</P>
    <P>There are many other services which should be ready for introduction &mdash; for instance, the car telephone.  The specification was well on the way when I left office and should be ready by now.  The Minister might tell us when this scheme will be implemented.  It could be extremely useful in areas where there are difficulties in providing ordinary telephones.</P>
    <P>We are facing many technological changes which are part of telecommunications development.  Ireland is fortunate in that last year we took the decision to use modern digital technology which can bring our telecommunications service to the same level as that of our EEC partners. Many people thought this would not be possible and may still have some reservations, but if they look at the transformation of telecommunications in France between 1974 and 1981 they will see that the job can be done by the use of modern technology.  The situation in France was much worse than here.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the digital exchanges in Athlone, Kells and Bantry have not yet been opened.  Perhaps the Minister <Col N="1953" /> would clarify whether this is due to reneging on agreements which had been freely negotiated with the staff.  I believe this is the reason these exchanges have not been opened.  There has been a policy of non-co-operation with the Department during recent months.  I hope the agreements will be honoured and that the exchanges will be brought into use as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We have read in the newspapers that RTE are exerting pressure for an increase in licence fees and apparently they lodged an application for an increase some months ago.  The Minister might tell us his approach to this matter and when he will announce his decision.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to citizen band radio and the personalised radio service.  My approach to this subject was clearly defined during my term as Minister and before I left office my policy had the full acceptance of the general public and CB fans.  I had drawn up a statutory order which had not been returned from the Attorney General's office.  The use of citizen band radio is common in all western countries.  It is very difficult to estimate exactly how many users there are here but there could be as many as 50,000.  Various arguments have been put forward as to whether they should use the FM or AM frequency and I made a decision to license both for a period of two years.  During that period those using the AM frequency would have had the opportunity to eliminate all interference and to prove that AM usage causes no more interference than FM.  This was a fair response to a situation which the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are not in a position to supervise.  The resources available in the radio section of the Department would not be adequate to trace those using very high-powered amplifiers.  The body representing CB users were prepared to identify these people if they did not comply with the statutory order I had prepared so that they could be stopped from abusing the system.</P>
    <P>It appears from the statement issued by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that he has decided to narrow the two-year period to one year and that he will <Col N="1954" /> not give the opportunity to prove that AM usage causes no more interference than FM.  He has already made up his mind that AM will not be licensed after the initial period of 12 months.  This is a retrograde step because there will not be co-operation from CB users and problems will escalate.</P>
    <P>The Minister is responsible for ensuring that there is minimum interference for radio and television users.  Many of the complaints received in the Department cannot be traced back to the use of CB radio.  They are due to inadequate connections for cable television and inadequate provision for television reception in certain areas.  Citizen band users have helped many people to eliminate interference by putting certain gadgets on televisions. They were offering co-operation. Apparently that co-operation has been refused; the clock has been turned back.  That is my interpretation of the Minister's statement today.  I am asking him to have another look at it because I do not think it is the correct approach. Given the two year period, those people would be able to show to the Minister and everybody else that the situation can be changed drastically.  I do not know how the Minister will change the position if he continues in the direction in which he has been going.</P>
    <P>If the policies I followed and the decisions I made in the Telecommunications Capital Act had been carried out I suggest there would have been no reason to bring in a Supplementary Estimate for the amount now being sought &mdash; it would not have been any more than £4 million or £5 million.  I have already asked the Minister if he accepts that of the £332 million mentioned in the second paragraph of his statement, £134 million is an illusory figure, a transfer from this year to next year, that it represents the demand for equity by the various semi-State companies and that in effect it is not a saving this year because a commitment was not given to bring it in.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister, and the Government, now accept that that £134 million is not the saving they had made it out to be?  The Minister may not be in a position <Col N="1955" /> to quantify or qualify for me what is the balance of the current expenditure of £148 million about which I have asked for information.  I accept the Minister now in the House is not responsible for Finance and may not be in a position to give me the information, but if that is the position he should not have included that second paragraph in his statement.  Statements on current budget deficits are irrelevant during the debate on a Supplementary Estimate.  However, if they are made and when I as an Opposition spokesman challenge their veracity I hope the Minister will be in a position to let me have the information.</P>
    <P>If the Department of Finance continue to proceed along the old traditional lines in their dealings with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs we will have Supplementary Estimates every year.  Contingency allowances are not made by the Department of Finance: they do not make allowances for possible increases in the budget or for agreements on negotiations that may be in the pipeline under the conciliation and arbitration scheme. As long as that situation remains we will have Supplementary Estimates every year.  A commercial situation should not be approached in that way, particularly in relation to a service industry like that operated by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The approach and the treatment must be changed if we are to get accuracy in accounting and in estimation. If the approach is changed we can do away with the need for Supplementary Estimates.  That is the logical position. We cannot say in present circumstances that this is the last year in which Supplementary Estimates will be needed.  I am glad that the Minister for Finance last week acknowledged in reply to me that the procedure must be changed and that more information will have to be given not only to the House but to the general public so that we can do our job more efficiently and consequently more effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the steps being taken by the Government will result in a situation in which the work of <Col N="1956" /> every Department will be done in a more efficient manner.  I refer to the Government's proposal to bring before the House the annual Estimates earlier each year.  Then there would be a situation in which it would be the exception to have Supplementary Estimates and we would not be losing valuable time here, and the time of Ministers and civil servants, preparing and debating Supplementary Estimates for almost every Department at this time of the year when we should be dealing with the Estimates for next year. I hope we will also arrive at a position when Departments will know at this time of the year the amounts they will need to carry them through the following year.  I am hesitant to say we are wasting the time of the House in this double exercise of debating the budget in January and having Supplementary Estimates at this time of the year.</P>
      <P>I wish to repeat a number of points which I have been making here year after year.  But, before doing so, I appeal to the Minister to have the Departments pay a little more attention to the developing areas around Dublin.</P>
      <P>I represent what has been described as the fastest developing area in the EEC. One wonders if the Department of Posts and Telegraphs agree with that description, if they are alive to what has been happening, because they always seem to be chasing behind the developers.  In Tallaght there has been very little improvement in the postal service in the past two years.  The Minister may say that there are other post offices in areas near Tallaght.  I am referring to the accommodation the Department have in the new town itself.  They moved a few years ago into the main post office in the centre of Tallaght and the impression was given that it was to be a temporary move, for a year or two.  They have been there five or six years and in that time there has not been any great improvement.  The service area in the main post office in Tallaght is not any bigger, although the population has grown in the past ten years from 3,000 or 4,000 to 70,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may point out that there are post offices in Glenview and Firhouse which give some relief to the accommodation <Col N="1957" /> in the centre of Tallaght.  Unfortunately, the Minister's predecessor, perhaps for legitimate reasons, moved the Firhouse post office to a location which is of no benefit to the people in Tallaght. It serves only a small number of people in the Firhouse area.  If the Minister looks at the position of the Firhouse post office on the map he will see clearly that it should never have been put there.  If the Minister checks the records he will find that far fewer people are now using the Firhouse post office than did a year or two ago when it was at its former location. The post office is now at one of the most dangerous junctions and even the Posts and Telegraphs vans collecting or delivering to this post office break traffic regulations because they must park in an area adjacent to traffic lights at the narrowest part of the road.  There is a V-turn there where there was a traffic hold up the other day caused by the parking of a P &amp; T van which was collecting or delivering to the post office.</P>
    <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs should be in the forefront in securing accommodation in developing areas. The Department provide an essential service and frustration is caused when the Department lags behind as they have done in the Tallaght area.  The service area of the main post office is no bigger today than it was 12 years ago.  Last Saturday I was in the town between 10 a.m. and 11.30 a.m.  For all that time there were 20 to 30 persons queuing outside the post office in addition to the number that were inside.  The queue kept at that number for I do not know how many hours, but certainly for the one-and-a-half hours I was there.  It was fortunate that the weather was good.  That state of affairs will continue unless action is taken by the Department to improve the facilities there.  I should not like to have to use the post office on a Saturday morning in the cold winter wind next January or February.  I would appeal to the Minister to take every possible step to improve the facilities in the growing town of Tallaght.</P>
    <P>I have appealed in the past, either privately to the Minister or in this House, in regard to Christmas postage.  We have now reached breaking point.  The postage <Col N="1958" /> for a Christmas card is now 18p.  I asked the Minister's predecessor and his predecessor to consider a reduction at this time of year for the sake of persons who do not contact their friends from one Christmas to another.  Even that contact is put out of reach of many people.  Last year the postage was 15p.  I would appeal to the Minister to reduce the postage on a Christmas card in a open envelope to 15p as it was last year.  Last year I appealed for a reduction from 15p. to 12p.  I have not checked, but as far as I remember I did it in this House.  I have made this appeal repeatedly one year after another.  I trust my plea is not falling on deaf ears.  I would plead with the Minister to give consideration to this matter. I do not think the Department will lose revenue.  Many people have spoken to me in the last few weeks about this.  I have not invited comments from them.  I realise that the postage is not the only element of extra cost influencing people to devise some other method or not to make contact at all with their friends. There is the cost of the card.  Again, I have done a check and have found that the cost of the card has increased since last year.  It might give a headline to those in the Christmas card business if the Minister were to give some encouragement to people to send Christmas cards.  There are many people who criticise the practice but I think it is a good practice.  For parents who do not see their children for months or even years it is nice to get a Christmas card.  There are many old people who get no post except Christmas cards.  I doubt if there is a house that does not receive at least one dozen cards and there are many houses that receive hundreds of Christmas cards.  The Minister should bear in mind that revenue will not be lost to the Department by a reduction in postage from 18p to 15p, and if he reduces it even further than that I shall not complain.</P>
    <P>In regard to the television and radio service, on the whole the service is good. We have quite a good television service and many of the radio programmes are excellent.  I am sorry to say that it is my impression that too few people listen to sound radio, particularly the late evening <Col N="1959" /> programmes, which are excellent.  I often tune in when going home in the car.  I do not get a lot of time to view television and that is not a bad thing because I think we have gone too far in viewing television. If there were more listening to radio and less viewing of television the people, and in particular the children, would be more enlightened because the radio programmes are far superior to the television programmes.  Of course, there are some programmes that are suitable for television but not suitable for radio. I would urge people to listen to radio.  I did a small survey in recent times among friends I would meet and was surprised to discover that they seldom if ever switch on the radio.  There are even houses where they do not have a radio set but where they have a television set.  This is regrettable.</P>
    <P>I am constantly getting complaints from constituents and others that the sound level during radio advertising is far greater than during radio programmes. They have told me that once the advertisements come on they have to turn the radio down.  This applies in particular to old people.  However, despite the efforts of many people to tune their radios to an acceptable level for them they still find that when the advertisements come on the sound is very loud.  Some people have told me that the noise is so great at the time of the advertisements that they switch off the radio.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why those in charge of broadcasting cannot regularise the sound levels.  It is a source of annoyance to many people, particularly the elderly, and it should be investigated.  I imagine only a slight adjustment is required.  We are all aware that before we go on radio we undergo a test run to get the correct sound level and surely a similar procedure can be adopted for the advertisements.  I have heard the same complaint about advertisements on television and this is most annoying to viewers.</P>
    <P>I should like to know the reason why it has been decided to switch the main news on a Sunday evening to 9.45 p.m. If there is a reason for this change RTE <Col N="1960" /> should make it known.  Many people have complained to me about this alteration and I am sure the same volume of complaints was received by RTE.  It is too late to broadcast the news.  People are in the habit of watching the news at 9 o'clock.  The change has fooled me on occasions because I have often timed my entry to the television viewing area for 9 o'clock only to discover that it is not broadcast until much later.  Through the Minister I should like to ask RTE to consider returning the news to 9 o'clock.</P>
    <P>I appeal to RTE to broadcast more good news rather than bad news.  I have been constantly complaining about the newspapers that go fo headlines that do not lift anybody's heart.  I am sure that the headlines in this evening's newspapers will tell us of people having been killed, or a fire or a disaster somewhere. Newspapers seem to go for the bad news all the time.  The media have a terrifying responsibility to at least give a balance. In that regard they should give more good news.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that we get more good news.  There are many people in my constituency engaged in excellent work much of which is newsworthy but which is seldom referred to in our news bulletins.  An effort should be made to let the public know that people are doing good throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Another matter I should like to draw to the attention of the Minister is the reduction in the number of religious affairs programmes.  There are too few religious programmes on radio and television. I should like to know why RTE decided to push religious programmes into Sunday.  It appears that RTE feel that once the Angelus is broadcast each day that is as far as they need go.  I accept that religious programmes are shown but the number is a lot fewer than five or ten years ago.  We should have more religious programmes, because I firmly believe that a lot of the ill in our country is because there is a move away from religion. It is not that our people do not want such programmes.  Many people are going in the direction they are being led and they are being led by what they hear on radio, see on television and read in the newspapers.  I appeal to the media to <Col N="1961" /> have another look at what they are doing with regard to religious affairs.  They should put more emphasis on religion.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider my suggestion in relation to a reduction in the cost for an open letter.  I am sure that if he obtained an estimate of the cost of adopting my suggestion he would find that it would not mean any reduction in revenue to the Department because more people would decide to send Christmas cards.  Many people have already decided on the number of cards they will send this year and it amounts to a big reduction on the number they posted last year.  The Minister should not delay in announcing a reduction in the cost of posting Christmas cards from 18p to at least 15p, if not less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is the first occasion the House has had an opportunity of discussing the Department of Posts and Telegraphs I should like, on a personal basis, to pay a compliment to the former Minister, Deputy Reynolds.  I am anxious to put it on record that in my time as Minister of State in that Department I found Deputy Reynolds to be a man of foresight, enlightenment and initiative.  It was a privilege to work with him.  He gave a new thrust to the Department.  He guided it through a difficult period and gave the workers there confidence in the future.  He set a high standard in the position he held and it will be difficult for the person who has succeeded him to work at the same pace.  The former Minister deserves that tribute from me, a person who had the privilege of working with him for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with the Supplementary Estimate Deputy Reynolds omitted to mention An Bord Phoist and An Bord Telecom.  The House is aware that a Green Paper, a White Paper and the draft heads of a Bill were prepared by the former Minister.  I should like to ask the Minister when the legislation will be introduced in the House.  It was announced in the newspapers that the legislation would be introduced before the end of this session but there is not any item on the Order Paper relating to those boards.  I was amazed last week to <Col N="1962" /> read the announcement from the Department that they were not accepting parcel post.  Taking into account the fact that there were more than 20 vans in the city out of order, I thought it was wrong to deal with the problem in that way.  That should not have been the approach.  In the past requests were made to issue similar statements but the request was refused.  The parcel post is an integral part of our postal system.  It was wrong to notify the public that the Department were no longer interested in that aspect of the postal service.  It is also wrong to issue similar advertisements whenever there is a spot of trouble in the postal service, whether that trouble concerns labour relations or, as in this case, unsuitable transport.  The Department, maybe not deliberately, have destroyed the parcel post side.  It is a good business and should not have been treated in that way and I regret very much that this has happened.</P>
    <P>I also want to draw attention to the latest public relations proposals coming through the media from the Minister, and from the Minister of State to a lesser degree, in regard to the inner city deliveries, the express post and the postal bus. All those items were part of our programme when we set up the committee to investigate new ideas for the postal side of the Department.  While I welcome the enthusiasm with which they are being put forward now, I would like to point out that they were described in the national newspapers, in this House in the Estimates last year and in reply to questions in this House on several occasions. The sincerity of what we were doing should not now be evaporated by a public relations exercise.  There have not been many new thoughts coming from the Department in recent months, and a retrograde step has been taken in regard to the parcel post.  There is great potential there.  The problems must be tackled, whether they are in Sheriff Street sorting office or are connected with the type of motor equipment used to carry it.  These matters are important.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to outline the postal bus project.  When we looked at it it was not considered feasible.  It should <Col N="1963" /> be explained to the House exactly what is envisaged, when it will come into operation, where the trial is going to be and how results are going to be looked at.</P>
    <P>The service should be extended in a more localised way.  The availability of the post box is a very important facet in the postal service.  It is a bit much these days to ask people using the postal service to travel a long distance.  The number of post boxes, with a facility on them to sell stamps, should be increased tremendously so that people can use the service more easily and more automatically.</P>
    <P>I was absolutely disgusted by the action in regard to a post box on the island of Aranmore.  It was a retrograde step.  It shows the lack of interest in the island when a big public relations company are pushing a van or bus but, on the other hand, are not offering the facility of a post box.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed indeed about the philatelic side of the post office.  I was at the philatelic show in New York and I took it upon myself to talk to the Postmaster General in America concerning a joint issue of an American-Irish stamp. The stamp was produced but this date is now about to lose a tremendous amount of the financial value of this stamp because it was not publicised as it should have been.  It was a unique stamp and had tremendous philatelic value.  I am disappointed that when Mr. Bolger was here he was not given the type of recognition that he should have got at Government level.  I know the Minister gave him a good ministerial reception but the Government should have dealt with that matter in a far better way.  We have lost a tremendous amount in regard to that stamp and the Americans have taught us a lesson.  We had certain proposals as to how it should be launched but, with the change of Government, that went by the board.</P>
    <P>I want to speak also about the opening and placing of a new postal museum.  It may not be a topical subject to talk about in this House but it has the potential to be a very historical museum.  What is the present position concerning this?  We had <Col N="1964" /> suggested to certain experts that they should go to the Smithsonian Institute in Washington to see their idea of what a postal museum should be.  A museum should not be a dead place.  The experts went but I was unlucky enough after the general election not to be there to see their report.  I had made suggestions that certain stamps of a national and international interest would be displayed on a variable pillar or display unit so that children from schools who wanted to come to see it would have something new to see if they came back the following year.  I would like a brief outline from the Minister in regard to this.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is a change of policy in regard to the postal service. Perhaps the Minister would outline any new ideas he has apart from the ones we have put into motion.  I remember hectic days in the Department in regard to the Crettyard Post Office.  The Fine Gael Party gave an assurance at the time of the election that if they were returned to power they would restore the Crettyard Post Office to its original place in the village.  The decision we made was a proper one.  The file in the Department shows that there was nothing underhand going on in regard to the placing of the post office.  The person who made the application and got the post office was the person showing interest in it.  Yet some members of his party took it upon themselves to state that the Crettyard Post Office would be restored.  I would like the Minister to tell the House if he is going to adhere to the policy of Fine Gael concerning that post office.  It is a small point but it is very important and should be cleared up in this House.</P>
    <P>I wonder what has happened to the giro project.  I see from the Estimates that the savings bank part of it has cost the Department and the State a lost of money.  We had suggestions concerning a new idea for the Post Office Savings Bank or a bank giro system.  The position has not been clarified as to the proposals for the revitalisation of the Post Office from the financial point of view.  The momentum we started should be continued. Post office buildings should be revitalised. We will have to change the decor <Col N="1965" /> and make them more acceptable to the public.  I believe this can be done economically. If a new Bill is brought into the House, similar to the one which Deputy Reynolds spoke about, concerning telecommunications, an investment through capital allocation for refurbishing, rebuilding and redesigning of most of our post offices should be made.  At that time an investment of £25 million was envisaged to do this work.  If that was brought forward now it would certainly meet with our approval so that the post office staff could look forward to a new and thriving industry of service to the public, via banking or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister be kind enough to tell me if he has any proposals regarding changes in the system of sorting?  I notice several questions on the Order Paper, which have not been reached yet concerning the sorting offices.  Is there a new policy for Sheriff Street, which is the main sorting office?  I was a great defender, and still am, of the services that can and should be given by the Post Office.  It is an organisation with a unique skill and a unique staff to do a unique job and we should try to get maximum efficiency from that service.  I should like to see a new building programme, painting, decorating and a new counter service. We hope this will be done shortly.  I am sure sub-postmasters will play their part and would be delighted to do so.  Postmasters would also be pleased if this happened. I do not know how long the Government will be in office but, if we are lucky enough to be returned to power, that is one aspect of the Post Office that we will look at.</P>
    <P>I think the postman is under-utilised in the service.  He starts early in the morning for five days a week.  He knocks on practically every door.  He goes out with his bag full and comes back with it empty. This is an area we should look at because he should be returning with his bag full of whatever commodity is beneficial to the community or the Post Office.</P>
    <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs employ half the people in the public service.  The public service should not be the scapegoat for embargos and cutbacks. As Deputy Reynolds said last <Col N="1966" /> week in the House, in the last ten years in real terms the manufacturing sector cost 40 per cent, the service sector cost 30 per cent and the public sector cost 20 per cent.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs is a service department and is separate and different from most other Departments.  It gives a service and it is very difficult at the start of the year to estimate how much it will cost for a full 12 months.  The situation concerning this Department is archaic.  We left it in a very sound, solid, economic state.  It has tremendous potential, the Government now realise this and I am sure that the Minister, Deputy Cooney will do all he can to modernise the Department.</P>
    <P>With regard to telecommunications, it is difficult for us to complain about this Supplementary Estimate because the Government are spending the budget that the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government gave to them.  It is what we wanted to do and we hope it will be continued. Next year the demand will be made to produce the amount of money which we had to produce in the beginning of this year to keep telecommunications going. It will be no mean feat to find it and I am sure the Minister recognises that.  It will be very difficult for him and I wish him well in his efforts.  The responsibility rests with him to see that the programme is continued.  The programme for the telecommunications network is of vital importance because, no matter what the IDA do, for example trying to entice industry to come here, if we have not a proper telecommunications network, nationally and internationally, it is not easy to attract investment.  It should be the top priority in the Government's programme. We remember in 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1978 the cry that went up when we did not have a proper service.  It is most important that the programme continue at the rapid pace which is needed to achieve the end result, no matter what the cost.  No investment is as important at present as the telecommunications investment and the money for this must now be found, so that the growth rate will continue and the job will be done as cheaply as possible, because each week or year that passes will add to the cost.  I <Col N="1967" /> wish the Minister well in his deliberations on methods of achieving this.  We will be watching him very carefully to make sure that he fights his corner in these allegedly difficult days of Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds mentioned, but not in great detail, an arrangement concerning district management which we came to for the interim before the State boards, particularly Bord Telecom, were set up.  That issue is very dear and close to me.  I still believe that the proposals which we then had in mind concerning the appointment of district managers are of vital importance in this interim period. That is what the boards will have to do in any event, so we were doing nothing wrong.</P>
    <P>We had achieved a certain level at the time.  I believe that the posts were advertised and interviews were held.  If that be the case, when does the Minister propose to set up the district management structure and appoint the district managers? It is necessary for many reasons, the most important being that we can reach out through the districts to subscribers or those who wish to be subscribers, to have investigations, applications, queries on accounts and other contacts carried out on a local level.  I do not see why the central authority in the GPO should not give budgets and accountability to the district managers, who could take up the role of supervising those budgets.  District management should have targets in every sector of the telecommunication section and should be given budgets to meet these targets.  If they have difficulty, they should then have recourse to the central authority.</P>
    <P>I want to raise a matter which is causing great concern throughout the country. There is now no identifiable human contact concerning telephone accounts.  That should be remedied in the district management set up.  People are now beginning to feel the pinch.  There was the normal increase at the beginning of this year and, for some unknown reason, in the most recent budget of this Government a very strong increase was added on to this.  people want to question their accounts and the only way to do this is by <Col N="1968" /> making a telephone call to Dublin, which is disgraceful.  The Minister must turn his attention to this immediately.  There are peculiar telephone accounts afloat. Within the exchange system, sometimes through operators and sometimes not, there are ways by which people can transfer the cost of their telephone calls to another subscriber.  It is of vital importance that the people who are paying for those calls should have available a person with a face on him at local, or at least regional, level.  The subscriber is now paying an extraordinarily high cost for his telephone service and he should have a person with whom he can check his account.  This could be contained in the district management proposal.  The responsibility lies with the district and the district manager is the person who should be responsible.  A huge number of letters comes to the Minister from members elected to this House and from subscribers outside politics who write direct to him concerning their accounts.  Some telephone services have been cut off because people have been unable to pay their accounts &mdash; accounts which they have been querying.  I know of instances of this.  It is wrong and immoral that such a situation should be allowed to happen. I hope the Minister will act, given the seriousness of what I have said.</P>
    <P>We all remember the embargo of 1975. The then Minister was talking about every Department except the one for which he was responsible.  I hope that the present Minister will insist, at Government level, that the present embargo does not apply to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, particularly to the telecommunications side of it.  In the months of February and March of 1980, because of the embargo of 1975 on an increase in employment in the Department, there were only a few jointers available in the city of Dublin to do a most important job.  To become a technician of any degree in the telecommunications business takes time, education and severe training.  The one thing which kills that programme is an embargo, particularly on the telecommunications side of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I have put down a question to the <Col N="1969" /> House which I now withdraw as I will make the point now.  It was our intention in Government to employ a certain number of trainee installers.  Exclusive of that there was some temporary labour.  We need technicians and engineers of all descriptions on the planning staff of the Department.  We need more young engineers.</P>
    <P>I am not up to date on the telephonists side of the Department because it varies so much.  It depends on how the programme is going concerning the transfer of the manual exchanges to automatic.  I will deal with certain aspects of that in a few moments.  I want the Minister to understand that, if the embargo which the Minister for Finance spoke about in his July budget is applied, our telecommunications expertise in the Department will be badly affected.  It will take years to recover.</P>

      <P>I will not argue with the Chair.  If I developed it too far, it is because I believe it is very important.  It is far more important than money to have that expertise.  Yesterday I had the privilege of being at a function covering the final stage of the &ldquo;Telephonist of the Year&rdquo;, as I call it, on the 10 dial.  It was an idea I had.  More courtesy and kindness could be shown by telephonists.  I was delighted to be invited by the Minister to that function yesterday.  I feel it will develop goodwill towards the people in that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to something which happened during the general election campaign, concerning the telephonists at the Bantry exchange.  There are 16 central exchanges throughout the country and the programme stated clearly what we were doing.  Deputy O'Keeffe, who is now a Minister of State, made statements which appeared in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> to the effect that the Bantry exchange would hold its 10 operational system.  If that is so, I should like the Minister to state it <Col N="1970" /> here today.  If the answer is yes, I should like to know will the same thing apply to the Clifden and Carrick-on-Shannon exchanges.  It would be grossly unfair to give that facility to Bantry and to deprive those two districts of it.  If the Minister gives to one, he must give to all.  If he does not give to one, he does not have to give to all.  If people make political promises, perhaps in the belief that they will never sit on a Government front bench, I appeal to the Minister that the goose &mdash; what is the expression?</P>

      <P>I should like to know what is happening to the programme for conversion from manual to automatic.  Are we still on target?  The other day I received a letter from a group of people in south Galway who feel very discontented with the proposal to change the Portumna area to the Portlaoise area.  I had the same problem in my time and I said no.  It is a disgrace if we break county boundaries.  If we break provincial boundaries and cross the Shannon that is worse.  I was told at the time that £100,000 had been spent on cables.  If it has been spent there is no problem in making sure that it is linked to Galway.  There is great discontent amongst the staff down there who do not want to be alienated.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister be kind enough to let me know what has happened to the subscriber-carrier system?  About 50 were introduced into Dublin.  This was a new approach and it gave rapid relief. They are a success.  I know where they are installed in rural Ireland and in the cities.  They played a major part in reducing the waiting lists and were used to great benefit in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe the rumour that the stores situation is not as good as it should be.  It takes money to buy stores.  We <Col N="1971" /> made the money available and I hope it was spent on stores.  I should like the Minister to give me a brief outline of what he feels about the stores situation. A crisis should never be allowed to arise there.  It was at crisis point at one time and it took a great deal of hard work, dedication, long talks and late nights to get it finalised.  We did that and we had it rolling well.  I should hate to feel that stores might be in trouble again.  Rumour has it that stores are not flowing freely. It appears that the limited choice we had between a black and a white telephone has gone.  It would be a black day for all of us if the Minister did not make the money available to give people even that limited choice.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of kiosks. I put down a question to the Minister concerning certain kiosks.  In rural areas kiosks are very important.  Nowhere in the world would one find such abuse to kiosks as has been seen in this city.  It is now very expensive to instal a private telephone.  I should like to hear of a new policy on kiosks from the Minister.  I will not refer him again to Inismacatreer.  I have not had any word from him since. I will ask him about it soon.</P>

      <P>Good.  I thank the Minister. Has there been any policy outlined in regard to multi-channel television?  We were lucky enough before leaving office to have made the final arrangements for Cork and to have almost completed the arrangements for Galway.  We only missed out on that one by three days. Perhaps when replying the Minister will be in a position to give us details of those areas in which it is intended to provide multi-channel viewing next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not go into any depth concerning the public relations gimmickry.  I do not believe that the Minister wishes to be a public relations type Minister.  He knows how far we had gone in the direction of trying to implement the various proposals during our time in office.  I should like him to ask his Minister of State to refrain from any public relations efforts, too.  It <Col N="1972" /> is disgraceful that the Buncrana exchange, for instance, could be declared open on three separate occasions &mdash; once by myself and twice by the Minister of State, Deputy Harte.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed that the Minister of State is not here with the Minister to take note of the various points being made so that he might be in a position to understand better the various problems. I appreciate that the Minister's portfolio is, with the exception of the Gestapo known as the Department of Finance, the busiest of all and the one that involves the heaviest workload, the greatest responsibility and a huge number of problems.  That is why the Minister of State should be here to listen to the debate.  During my time in the Department the Minister and myself found it very difficult to keep abreast of everything that was going on.</P>
      <P>I suppose everybody can find a reason for saying that RTE is biased.  I know that their job at times is difficult but in recent months there certainly was some extraordinary bias on their part.  I am talking about a deputation to the city concerning the closure of the Tuam sugar factory.  I was on that deputation.  Statements were made by the leader of the deputation, by the Leader of the Opposition and by the leaders of the other two political parties but on listening to the news on the night in question we found that the leader of the deputation had had a lot to say as had the leaders of two of the political parties, whereas the leader of the other political party was not referred to.  That should not happen in a national network.  However, we shall be watching for that kind of reporting in the future.</P>
      <P>This may not be the time to talk about the new independent authority, but I wonder if the Minister has any proposals in that regard.  We look forward to the establishment of such an authority in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate could be summarised briefly in two ways.  One is that something <Col N="1973" /> should be done concerning the re-arranging of the budgetary process for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  For example, the refurbishing or rebuilding of post offices is an item that should be provided for in a new capital allocation and the same should apply in the case of data and telex systems.  They should be removed from the telecommunications side and put into the capital side.  If this were done there would be no need for an Estimate today.  If the budgetary allocations were made in a proper way the Department would be in the sound financial position in which we left it.  I hope that when it is handed back to us, whether that be sooner or later, we will find it in the financially sound and progressive situation in which the Minister found it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Conney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Conney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As they say on the stage, how could you follow that?  This has been a wide-ranging debate covering a large variety of subjects.  We touched on the philosophy of budget deficits and on the whole question of State financing right through to the sub-post office in Crettyard. On the way we had what might be described as a metaphysical flash when Deputy Killilea revealed that one of the achievements of both he and Deputy Reynolds during their term in office was to have given a new insight into life in the Department.  This is an indication of the scope of the debate, so perhaps the best way for me to approach my reply is to answer first the individual points raised and then to deal with the general financial situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds raised the question of the C and A agreements and asked if they have gone by the board.  I can assure him that any agreement that was entered into and that any awards made under those agreements must be honoured.  The same applies in the case of staff promotions, subject of course to the critical date applying.  The Deputy was not specific as to what was concerning him in that regard but I assume that what he had in mind was the IPOU agreement and I am glad to be able to tell him that the first promotions under that agreement are being <Col N="1974" /> made.  This was agreed to last week.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds asked also about RTE licence increases.  He does not know what the position is as he only reads whatever is published in the newspapers. However, he indicated in regard to other matters that he had sound information but his sources did not extend to dealing with RTE licences.  The Authority are seeking a licence increase and this will be considered by the Government in due course.</P>
    <P>Several other Deputies also mentioned RTE and Deputy McMahon was worried that the level of sound for advertising slots was higher than normal broadcasting levels.  He wondered whether the level could be reduced.  I am sure his request, if it is based on fact, will be sympathetically considered by RTE. Deputy McMahon also complained about the varying times of the main news bulletin on Sunday evenings and said that this is confusing for people who are in the habit of looking at the news at nine o'clock.  I sympathise with his point of view.  He also raised a point which has been mentioned by many people in this House in the past, including a distinguished predecessor in this office, Mr. Childers.  This is the necessity to have a balance of good news in view of all the gloomy news.  This commends itself as a general principle, although one must also take into account that sometimes good news is scarce and the media must report what happens, be it good or bad.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMahon also mentioned the lack of religious programmes throughout the week and said that there was a ritual nod in the direction of such programmes on Sundays.  This is a point which must strike a sympathetic chord but I should emphasise that the Authority are autonomous in relation to their broadcasting arrangements.  I am aware of this criticism and that some concern has been expressed about religious broadcasting generally.  There is a feeling that too often minority subjects which are radical or &ldquo;way out&rdquo; in religious terms are dealt with and that mainstream thought and views do not seem to get the same amount of time.  These are matters for the Authority but I mention them because <Col N="1975" /> they have been raised during this debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds raised the matter of CB broadcasting and took exception to my recent announcement about licensing arrangements.  His main complaint was that the transition period from AM to FM has been reduced to a year and that AM will be prohibited totally.  I must state quite categorically that I feel Deputy Reynolds when Minister was wrong in allowing a two-year transition period and wrong not to prohibit AM absolutely.  He would have had the same technical advice as I have and it is coercive to the effect that the level interference by AM equipment is intolerable. We have had a large volume of complaints regarding interference with television reception by AM-type CB equipment and there is a very great risk of interference to other radio services, to cable systems, to VHF sound broadcasting and safety services such as those operated by the Garda and lifeboats.  I felt coerced into ending a situation where AM sets could be used and doing so as quickly as possible.  The longest transition period I felt I could allow was one year.  The importation and sale of AM equipment will be prohibited from 1 January next, which is the commencement of the licensing period, and the use of AM equipment after the end of 1982 will be an offence.</P>
    <P>The channels and the transmitter output power of four watts are generally in line with what prevails for CB radio in other European countries.  As far as I can recollect all European countries insist that CB radio use only FM equipment on the grounds that AM interferes too much with existing radio services.  Once there is the possibility of interference there can be no question of allowing the use of equipment in a hobby activity which would interfere with broadcasting for public service or public safety or in connection with people's livelihood.  I make no apology for restricting the transition period to one year and totally prohibiting the use of AM equipment.  I have no doubt that genuine enthusiasts will be pleased to have their hobby licensed on the technically desirable FM system and <Col N="1976" /> with the number of channels and the output power in accordance with general European standards.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMahon raised the matter of postal services in the Tallaght area and rightly pointed out that this is possibly the fastest growing area in any European city.  He indicated that there is only one small post office in the centre of the town and another at Firhouse which he described as being very unsuitable in its location.  I am glad to be able to tell him that two further post offices are planned for the Tallaght area, one at Kilnamanagh and the other at Killinarden, and it is hoped that they will be in service in the very near future.  He also raised the matter of Christmas postage.  The level of charges for Christmas cards is raised annually at this time of year.  Deputy McMahon feels we have reached the point of diminishing returns and that the present level of postage charges will inhibit Christmas mail and cause a loss of revenue.  He felt that a reduction in the price of the stamp would have the opposite effect.  One could debate this matter at length but it would be extremely difficult to produce figures to quantify the arguments in cash terms.  It is doubtful if extra traffic would be attracted in sufficient volume to offset the loss of revenue. On the other hand, if a lot of extra traffic were generated extra handling costs might be incurred.  The matter is kept under review and after this season's postings we will have a clearer indication as to whether the gloomy prognostications were justified.</P>
    <P>Deputy Killilea asked about the Bill setting up the new State-sponsored bodies for telecommunications and post.  We confirm our commitment to have this Bill before the Dáil in the near future and, hopefully, it will be passed before the Christmas recess.  A lot of work was done on it and the White Paper had been published which represented agreement in principle.  However, there were a couple of critical areas which had not been settled, notably the financing of the companies and some other matters of fundamental importance to this legislation.  It will be a largely agreed measure and we hope it will be passed before Christmas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1977" /> Deputy Killilea spoke of the industrial dispute in the Central Sorting Office involving the non-use of vans and said the Department had advised the public not to offer parcels, that parcels would not be accepted.  He was highly critical of this, saying it was a retrograde step which he would not have taken.  To have done anything else would have been a fraud on the public because we would have been accepting parcels we could not have delivered.  The honest thing was to tell the public that parcels could not be accepted.  However, I am glad to tell the Deputy that this unofficial dispute has been settled and that the drivers have agreed to take out the vans.</P>

      <P>It is provided in the Social Welfare Acts that in the case of a person in receipt of disability benefit the combined total of disability benefit and pay-related benefit may not exceed that person's reckonable earnings in the income tax year on which his entitlement to benefit is based.  As the total weekly amount of disability benefit and pay-related benefit at present payable to the person concerned is the same as his reckonable weekly earnings in the 1979-1980 tax year, he is precluded from receiving any increase in the rate of benefit payable on his current claim.

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 29 August 1981 and was paid from 2 September, fourth day of incapacity, at the maximum appropriate rate.  All disability benefit <Col N="1981" /> and pay-related benefit due to 17 October 1981 has issued.  She claimed maternity allowance from 19 October and payment is being issued to her regularly each week.  The delay in payment of disability benefit was due to the fact that the notification of incapacity was not received in my Department until the end of September. In addition, the RSI number quoted on some of the certificates submitted subsequently was incorrect and it was necessary to make inquiries to establish the correct number before payments could be made on these certificates.</P>

As, according to the records of my <Col N="1982" /> Department, she had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions paid since her entry into insurance, she was informed she was not entitled to payment.

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit in respect of an accident at work on 16 March 1981.  There is no record however of the receipt of medical evidence of incapacity in my Department until October. Before a decision could be given on his entitlement to payment it was necessary to make inquiries as to the nature and origin of the incapacity.  On completion of the inquiries it was accepted that the incapacity was due to an accident at work and the claim was allowed.  Payment of injury benefit has been made for the full statutory period of 26 weeks from the date of the accident on 16 March to 12 September 1981.  As he is over 66 years of age, he is not entitled to disability benefit after the expiration of that period.</P>

She is at present being paid a disablement pension at the rate appropriate to a degree of disablement of 20 per cent.  The pension is paid by cheques which are issued at four weekly intervals in advance.  An examination of <Col N="1983" /> the payment record shows that all payments have issued regularly on the due dates.  The latest cheque issued on 5 November 1981 and represented payment due in respect of the period 6 November 1981 to 3 December 1981. No correspondence has been received from the person concerned in connection with the claim since 1976.  However I have arranged that an inspector of my Department will visit her at an early date with a view to ascertaining what payments have not been received by her on the due dates and to establish the reason for the irregularity, if any, in the receipt of the payments.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply, it is important that the public should be aware of any cutbacks in the financial allocations to the Departments mentioned by me and indeed any other Departments.  We are all aware of the cutbacks in Education in the last week or two.  We are aware of cutbacks in Justice and in Health in particular.  The Minister should inform the House.  A tabular statement is not sufficient at this stage. We must know.  We are aware of cutbacks in Health, Education and other Departments. There have been cutbacks in Agriculture also.</P>

      <P>In fact, the tabular statement gives a full list of each Department affected.  I will give the list of the major Departments affected.  The precise details of the matter, as the Deputy would no doubt appreciate, would be more appropriately provided by the Ministers concerned.  However, the tabular statement which I have given the Deputy, which he will have and which the public will have within a matter of an hour, will provide him with the basis to put down specific parliamentary questions to the Ministers concerned and to obtain the information.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy does not realise this but these tabular statements are available to the media as they are to Deputies at the end of Questions. Putting these figures in a tabular statement is in no way designed to prevent them coming to public knowledge.  It is purely to avoid us getting into a situation where ministerial responsibility which in respect of the Departments concerned, except the Department of Finance, rests with other Ministers, should not become the subject of questions to the Minister for Finance.  It is more appropriate, as the Deputy with his own ministerial experience will accept, that matters affecting a Department concerned, in the Deputy's case his own former Department, would be answered, if he were back in his job, by himself rather than by the Minister for Finance.  I am sure he may have had the best of relations with Deputy Gene Fitzgerald but he would have preferred at the time to answer questions about his own Department rather than have his colleague answering for him.  That is reasonable.</P>

If the Deputy really wants to create such a big fuss about this I will give him the information.  I circulated it for the reasons I have given but I am not going to be drawn into answering individual questions about each Department because we would end up wasting more time arguing.  I am prepared to give the Deputies the information if they want to make a song and dance about this.  The information is: Posts and Telegraphs, £4.24 million; Environment, £3.31 million; Justice group, £3.14 million; Education group, £2.60 million; Defence, £1.60 million; Finance group, £1.17 million and others, £3.81 million.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>In my Financial Statement in July I outlined the Government's programme for the reform of financial planning and procedures and indicated my intention to pursue this programme as vigorously as possible.  I am glad to state that proposals in this regard are now at a very advanced stage and I hope to be in a position to present proposals for the consideration of the House in the very near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

      <P>I had hoped that that <Col N="1994" /> would be possible.  It may not be possible &mdash; depending on the day the Dáil goes into recess &mdash; to have them discussed here but I am still endeavouring to achieve this.  However, as the Deputy will appreciate, it is dependent on Government decisions in regard to expenditure levels for next year.  We are all aware how difficult and lengthy discussions can be on a matter like this, but it is still my target to have the Estimates published this year and, if possible, to make some improvement.  I recognised at the time, and it was acknowledged by the Leader of the Opposition, that it is very difficult in a space of six months to change the Estimates cycle.  The proposals I will be publishing in the near future will deal with what we are proposing to do in respect of 1983, by which time there will be an adequate opportunity to change the Estimate cycle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies such as myself, private Members of the House, are outraged at the total lack of facilities for Members to pursue their responsibilities as legislators.  Does the Minister intend to bring forward the proposals which he referred to, and which I congratulate him for referring to in his budget speech, at an early date?  Will the Minister give them additional urgency because of the way this has been raised in the House today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be publishing the proposals in the immediate future. Before I answer the Deputy's question, let me say that I would hope that these proposals, while being reserved with regard to the detail, will be able to command support from all sides of the House.  I recognise that any major change that has to be made in the House should, as far as possible, be made with a wide measure of agreement within the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1995" /> I will naturally be prepared to make myself available for discussions with various interests to discuss the Government's proposals in depth and, as far as possible, to accommodate the various views that may be expressed.</P>
    <P>To come to Deputy Mitchell's question, the proposals that I will be bringing forward in the immediate future will deal solely with the financial procedures which come within my direct responsibility as Minister for Finance.  These relate to the presentation of the budget and Estimates and the method whereby these shall be discussed and the format of the documants, the information that they give and the outputs to be achieved and other measures that may be adopted to achieve better control by the house and by the public of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Measures that the Deputy is interested in concern facilities available to Deputies here in the House.  While the proposals I will be making will put a greater demand on Deputies' time, they do not in themselves actually propose significant improvements in the facilities at this stage.  I recognise that this will require to be worked on by the Government, and the Government are anxious to move in this direction to improve the relevance of the House and its ability to act as a guardian over the nation's finances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister has made references to 1983, has he decided that he may not go ahead this year with having the Estimates discussed before budget time?  Has the Minister explored the possibility of putting back the budget day to enable this to be done? In reply to a supplementary question put to him, the Minister said that he would be ready for discussion with any Members of the House about these proposals. I understood that he said earlier that the proposals were being brought before the House and would be discussed in the House.  If that is the case what purpose is he serving by meeting Members of the House?  Was he referring to the other improvements mentioned by Deputy Mitchell?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring specifically <Col N="1996" /> to the proposals in relation to the financial procedures.  There is no reason why one should confine oneself to any one method of discussion.  There is a place for public discussion here in the House. There is also a place for private discussion between Members of the House and various parties.  The fact that I suggested one does not exclude the other.  I am quite sure that if the Deputy's party wish to have a discussion on these proposals in the House when they are published, the Government will be only too pleased to accommodate their wishes.  My concern is to get the widest measure of acceptance of the proposals and of the need to make changes to improve our control over public finances.  That is what I am aiming to do and I am prepared to use any means of consultation available to me to achieve that.  I think that is a reasonable approach for me to adopt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me about 1982.  As I said in response to an earlier question by him, it was recognised on both sides of the House that there would be problems.  I indicated that it was my objective to have the Estimates discussed before the end of this year.  It is not a question now of my deciding that that should not be done.  I am still working towards that objective.  But there are many problems on the Government's plate.  The process of settling Estimates involves very detailed work.  I recollect the previous Government having to take one or two weekends down in Barretstown Castle to do this work.  It is extremely time-consuming and the Government have a lot of other things on their plate as well.  It would be rash of me to say that they would definitely be available for discussion in this House before it goes into recess for Christmas.  But it is my objective to bring them forward as far as possible within the constraints which I referred to.  But for 1983 it would be my hope to have a completely new regime in being, and by then there will be no excuse.</P>

There should be a much longer time to discuss the expenditure components of the budget rationally in the House.  The Deputy has made a suggestion about the matter which I will bear in mind.  Perhaps he might wish to convey that through the whips.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the total cost of the £9.60 tax allowance for women in the home as promised in the Fine Gael Election Programme; when it will be introduced; and the groups of women who will benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>The essential principle underlying the proposed payment is that it is tax linked and involves a transfer of half the married tax credit to the spouse at home.  The figure of £9.60 corresponds to one-half of the full credit.  If this payment were increased, then the credit entitlement of the working spouse should logically be reduced <i>pro rata.</i> This, I consider, would be inappropriate.</P>
      <P>Details of the scheme are being finalised and I intend to make an announcement in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very many questions unanswered here.  First, let me repeat my question, because the Minister has not answered it.  I have asked him what is the total cost of the tax allowance for women, the £9.60, as promised in the Fine Gael election programme. Surely that it straightforward. I did not hear the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The tax credit as such, in so far as it involves simply a conversion into a cash payment to the wife of a tax credit which would otherwise be available to the working spouse, would have no net cost whatever.  However, as the Deputy will also be aware, there is a proposal to extend it to people who are not in the tax net.  That has a net cost and I will be announcing, in the relatively near future, the decision the Government will take in the matter.  The matter will also be the subject of legislation, which it is hoped to introduce into this House before the Christmas recess.  At that stage there will be an adequate opportunity to <Col N="1999" /> discuss the ins and outs, ups and downs of this scheme and how it works.  I wish to stress that the £9.60, in so far as it is a transfer of a tax credit, has no net cost at all.  The introduction, in combination with the introduction of the tax credit system, of new, lower rates of tax will cost money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Further arising from the Minister's reply, surely he cannot say that there is no net cost in that transfer?  The administrative costs alone, even if the assumptions he is making are right, will be extremely high.  We are also given to understand that the administration of the scheme will be very difficult. Surely the Minister is not being honest when he says that the person whose spouse would not be paying sufficient tax, so that the wife could not get the full credit, will be compensated for the difference between whatever it might be? Surely there are costs there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no net cost in the £9.60 in so far as it is paid to wives or spouses of taxpayers.  That is the point I wish to establish, because there is no net cost in that operation.  It will not cost the millions of pounds people are worried about.  It is simply a transfer.  If the Government decide to extend the £9.60 to people who are not in the tax net or whose tax payments and consequent use of their tax credits are less than £9.60 per week, then there would be a net cost. The Government will be announcing their intentions in this matter.  However, I assure the House that the net cost, given the total tax collected, will be relatively modest.  In relation to the administrative costs, the answers I have given were related to the costs of revenues foregone. Obviously there will be some administrative costs involved.  The details of the arrangements for the payments are being worked out at present.  It is not possible at this stage to say what the administrative costs will be.  I do not think it is something which will cause enormous concern, but as arrangements are being worked out it is premature to put a figure on it.</P>

      <P>It might be more realistic but it would also be a lot more costly.  We were not left with a lot of money to spend. We are doing our best against a very difficult background.  It was made quite clear during the election that the £9.60 was a tax credit and would be paid only to wives of taxpayers.  I remember answering numerous questions on that subject, both in the media and on doorsteps. Subsequently, in the discussions with the Labour Party prior to the formation of the Government, they made the proposal, which we accepted in principle, that the scheme would be extended to wives of people who were not taxpayers. It is in that area that the relatively modest net cost to which I referred will arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of persons paying income tax in 1981/82 is estimated to be about 780,000.  It is not possible to indicate the number of people who are liable to tax but are not paying it, because tax evasion is, of its very nature, a concealed area of activity.  It may be mentioned, however, that 15,000 persons were brought within the taxation system as a result of the operations of the special enquiry units set up by the Revenue Commissioners in 1979 to seek out traders, professional persons and others not on record for tax purposes.</P>
      <P>As regards the loss to the Exchequer due to tax evasion, it is not possible to indicate this amount but it is to be noted that, over the last 5 years, the cases dealt with by the investigation branch produced about £10 million.  It is estimated that the yield from new cases brought into the tax net will produce £15 million over the next few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the Government statement issued on <Col N="2004" /> 9 October 1981.  This noted the report as a useful contribution to the public debate on the economic situation and one which outlined factors relevant to the discussions between the social partners on incomes increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is either yes or no.  I have not got an answer. I take it that the Minister's approach is somewhat similar to that of the Taoiseach. For the benefit of this House, could he explain to me, and perhaps to some other individuals who might be somewhat stupid like me, how that recommendation of 9.5 per cent made by the committee after some weeks of study, overnight became 6.5 per cent?  Would the Minister please explain how this modern mathematical achievement was reached and what criterion was used, in some detail, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In some detail.  To deal with the first part of the Deputy's question, if I might amplify to assist him in this matter, the Taoiseach met the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 14 August 1981 and outlined his approach at that stage to the situation.  He said that the logic behind the setting up of the committee was that an objective assessment was needed of the level of cost increases which the economy can bear.  There was no question, he said back in August, of a binding norm from the Government's point of view.  He indicated that the assessment would be open to discussion by any of the parties concerned.  Congress would also be entitled to seek their own advice.  He said that he felt that the availability of objective data would be helpful, at any rate, to congress in their own efforts to convince their membership of the need for a moderate settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was made quite clear by the Taoiseach, when the body was being established and subsequently when its report was published, that it was not considered to be a binding norm but that it was felt, in the interests of the country, that all those concerned in income determination &mdash; whether employers, trade unions or Government&mdash;would be helped by having <Col N="2005" /> an objective assessment of what the country could afford in terms of maintaining its existing, already very low level of competitiveness <i>vis-á-vis</i> the other countries.</P>
    <P>The situation in regard to the figure that was recommended by the committee is as follows: the report itself contained, in paragraph 4.2 the following statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no waffle.  I use my words carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that I know how the figure became 6.5 per cent, but tell the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should listen to what I am saying.  It is stated in the report that the assumption was that exchange rates would remain unchanged at mid-1981 levels.  This is, the report said, a technical working assumption only and does not represent a prediction that this is the most likely outcome.  Indeed, it said, no allowance is made at this stage for the recent decline against EMS currencies of both the dollar and sterling. Unless these declines are rapidly reversed, they will have the effect of significantly reducing Ireland's gain in overall competitiveness in 1981.</P>
      <P>As a result of that, subsequent to the publication of the report, the committee felt, in the light of information which became available subsequent to the report being completed, they should issue a press statement.  This was their own press statement which was based on the considerations to which I have referred&mdash;the decline in Ireland's competitiveness since the sums upon which the original report had been based had been completed.  The report is as follows, press release of 9 October 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Deputy has asked the question, he must listen again <Col N="2006" /> to the press release, because it is the answer to the question.  Perhaps if he knew the answer, he would not have asked the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows the answer as well as I do, but I am obviously not going to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I quote:</P>
      <P>Our report was prepared in mid-September and based on the best information then available.  Since that time, it has become apparent that the autumn currency changes are likely to prove lasting.  This has obvious implications for the level of Irish competitiveness in both 1981 and 1982.  On the basis of current exchange rates it is estimated that in order to maintain competitiveness average 1982 costs should be no more than 8 per cent above the average level at 1981.  In applying this norm, account must be taken of the carry-over of cost increases from 1981.  In the case of wages and salaries, subject to the present National Understanding, the carry-over dictates that a single phase increase paid at the expiry of the understanding could be no higher than 6.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>That is the press release which represents the views of the three economists themselves, on the basis of information which became available to them subsequent to the completion of the arithmetic in the report, but the possibility of such further information requiring an alteration in the figure contained in the actual report was, as I have already indicated, adverted to in paragraph 4.2 of the report.  Anyone who read the report should not be surprised that, in view of the developing trends, the three economists concerned wished to make a further statement indicating the position in the light of the further information available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that answer.  However, I do not intend to pursue the matter further because it is obvious that I will not get the answer. The Minister knows as well as I do that that is not the correct position.  Would the Minister not now agree that that com- <Col N="2007" /> mittee's recommendation &mdash; and mind you that all emanated from the Fine Gael election document &mdash; rather than being helpful or constructive in any way in achieving a national wage agreement or a national understanding, was the most harmful effort ever made by a Government and contributed enormously to the fact that no meaningful discussions took place this year &mdash; and I emphasise the word &ldquo;meaningful&rdquo;&mdash; on a new national understanding or wage agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously this is a matter of political debate.  I completely disagree with the statement just made by Deputy Fitzgerald.  The committee gave the community a great deal of very useful information about the impact of inflation and how in the inflation we have experienced in the past few years some people have gained and others have lost a terribly large sum of money.</P>
      <P>In pointing out the often very damaging socially re-distributive effects of inflation, this report will be of lasting benefit to the community and assist us as a community in seeking to combat inflation.  As far as its impact on the wage discussions is concerned, I am convinced that the availability of objective information on what the country can afford can do no one any harm.  I am surprised that the Opposition should suggest that information like that contained in the report about our true competitive position should be concealed from the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm that it is his intention, as stated in the House yesterday by the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, to tie the social welfare benefits to the consumer price index and not to use this 6½ per cent norm in determining the increases which will be applicable to those on social welfare benefits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, I will be making announcements on the Government's policy on social welfare in the budget.  It would be premature for me to make statements about what will be contained in the budget in advance of the budget.  It would be most <Col N="2008" /> unusual and contrary to normal precedent. I am sure the Deputy will be quite happy to wait for the budget.</P>

      <P>It has been pointed out that inflation is the curse of the country. What attempt did the Minister's budget make in July to control inflation?  What attempt does he intend to make to control inflation if he has learned a lesson from the committee's report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have gone into the reasons for the July budget on numerous occasions.  It has been clearly accepted by the public at large that that budget was inevitable because of the total inadequacy of the January budget for which the Deputy's party were responsible.  I repeated on so many occasions the need for taking the difficult choices taken in July that there is no need whatever to go back on it now.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept, even at this late stage, that the worth-while benefits of that report were undermined by the change from 9.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent?  If the Minister's argument were taken to its logical conclusion, would he not agree that 6.5 per cent should fluctuate and change with every single change in exchange rates?</P>

      <P>When we broke for Question Time I was dealing with specific matters raised by the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  Deputy Killilea asked about new services and was at some pains to suggest that a PR exercise had been mounted by myself and the Minister of State to take advantage in a shoddy way of the innovative thinking of my predecessor and his Minister of State.  Of course, we would not do any such thing. All we did was to announce the new services and to make sure that they will not be just thoughts in the minds of Ministers and Ministers of State but will become practical and attractive realities for the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first to come into operation will be <Col N="2030" /> the post bus.  Deputy Killilea asked me to give details of what this will mean.  I gathered from his earlier remarks that he was fully <i>au fait</i> with what it was, and that it was one of his innovations.  I am glad he now admits it was not and that it is an innovation.  I take pleasure in telling him what it consists of and hope he will agree that it is not a PR exercise but an exercise in enlightening Deputy Killilea.</P>
    <P>The post bus will be a service to carry passengers as well as mail in rural areas. I am glad Deputy Daly is here because it will be introduced initially in County Clare.  Why County Clare I do not know. Perhaps it is a good area for a pilot scheme.  The initial service will run from Ennis twice daily through Ennistymon, Lahinch, Lisdoonvarna, Corofin and other intermediate points.  There is a familiar ring about those names which recalls the words of a certain popular song.  Perhaps that is the reason why this route was chosen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no stop in Lisdoonvarna,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be a demand for it in Lisdoonvarna too.  It might serve a particular need there in bringing people and mail to Lisdoonvarna.  It will run on a circular route from Ennis through these towns and back to Ennis twice daily.  It will be a minibus bringing the mail and there will be room for a certain number of passengers.  These towns are not served at the moment on scheduled routes either by CIE or private operators. It will be an entirely new service.  We hope it will be attractive.  It could fulfill a need.  The fact that it is a circular scheme means that people in Lahinch can meet the morning bus and come into Ennis and get the evening bus back home.  The same applies to the other areas to be served.  We hope it will be on stream early in the new year &mdash; in February or March at the latest.  We will be watching it carefully.  I am sure Deputy Daly will encourage people to use it.  If it is a success, it will be extended to other parts of the country where it would be suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are working on the other new services, <Col N="2031" /> the express post and the Fax post. When the staff arrangements are made, they will be implemented as soon as possible. They are attractive schemes.  Like myself and Deputy Harte, Deputy Killilea and Deputy Reynolds are anxious to see the Post Office, the oldest public utility with a great tradition and a dedicated staff, restored to its position of pre-eminence as a mail carrier and purveyor of messages generally.  We will encourage the new board to take all possible steps to introduce as many new services as they want to.  That will be the general attitude towards the postal service.  I share Deputy Killilea's wish to see new attractive services provided by this public utility.</P>

      <P>Whether or not it is introduced will be a matter for the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  Essentially it is a banking service.  I am afraid that both he and I must put up with that situation. It is the legal position.  No doubt it is a service in which the new board will be deeply interested when they are considering the role of the Post Office and how services can be expanded.  I am confident that such services as Post Office Giro and possibly enhanced services and facilities through the Post Office Savings Bank will have their attention also.  The board will have my full support in regard to the <Col N="2032" /> expansion of any operations in these areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of interference by the Department of Finance but that Department are concerned with banking licences.  The Central Bank, too, have a role in this sphere. If they agreed to the service being provided, it would be carried out automatically after that.  There is no interference in the day-to-day running of the service.</P>
      <P>Deputy Killilea mentioned the question of telephone accounts and in that context the question of the decentralisation of telephone sales at sales offices.  He must be aware that gremlins can find their way into the system and that this can lead to accounts being puzzling for subscribers. But I take his point that these problems have to be sorted out on a centralised basis and that this is somewhat less personal than a situation in which a subscriber could go to a local sales office and talk the matter over with someone there. However, I am glad to be able to tell the Deputy that the move towards decentralisation is something on which we can find agreement.  The moves are in arrears because of the problem created by divergent staff views.  The offices concerned would be on the telephone side and would be manned by members of a particular staff association, but opening new offices in a town in which there is an existing post office can introduce other staff associations.  In that regard there are some teething problems to be ironed out. To this extent discussions are going ahead and the offices will be opened as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I would not like to forecast a date at this stage but I assure the Deputy that I agree with him on the need to press ahead with the matter as quickly as possible.  When the board are set up the question of where they wish to have <Col N="2033" /> sales points will be considered by them. Having regard to their commercial mandate I am sure that they will wish to have a good number of sales points.</P>
      <P>The Department propose to open eight sales centres throughout the country. This would leave them in a position to deal at those centres with all queries relating to telephone accounts and that will be an advance on the system that is in operation now.</P>

      <P>Deputy Killilea raised the general question of the embargo.  I shall deal with that question in my remarks about the Supplementary Estimate in general.  In that connection the Deputy asked about trainee instructors and about the recruitment of labourers.  The position is that no labourers are being recruited because of there not being any vacancies. All the vacancies were filled in the first half of the year.  However, the Deputy can be assured that any vacancies that occur will be filled with the same expedition as was the case in the first half of the year.  Trainee technicians will be recruited in the normal way.  The Deputy may have noticed the routine advertisement in the newspapers during the week by the Civil Service Commission seeking trainees.  The regular recruitment to ensure adequate staff for the continuing <Col N="2034" /> expansion of our development programme will be continued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>These will be recruited as they are required.  The Deputy may be aware that a large number of posts of trainee installers were filled but there were some disturbed views from the union side about taking people from the list that came in.  In order to satisfy everybody extra numbers were recruited so that those who were first on the list but who were not picked first would subsequently be recruited.  I mention that in order to make the point that we have more than sufficient trainee installers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Killilea referred to the &ldquo;10&rdquo; Exchange in Bantry.  The position in that regard is not as he stated. There has been a reversal of the decision to close down such exchanges.  The question of all of these central exchanges was reviewed and it was concluded in the light of local circumstances&mdash;in particular we were concerned about the ability in the short term of the designated automatic exchange in Cork to handle the Bantry traffic&mdash;to retain on an interim basis some operators at Bantry and to retain the &ldquo;10&rdquo; service but routed in another way by way of experiment.  When we ascertain how that works the same procedure may be applied to other centres in which there are operators but which are on the list for closure.  Each exchange will be considered in the light of the circumstances of the area but the one at Bantry was the first to come into focus in terms of time.  What we learn there may be of use to us in what is a difficult industrial relations problem.  In respect of all the exchanges concerned we are trying to handle the situation with diplomacy and tact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>While keeping in mind the needs of the staff we must have regard to the fact that the whole point of the exercise is to enhance the efficiency of the service.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised the question of the Portumna exchange.  I thought he was being parochial when he talked not of county boundaries being breached but of provincial boundaries being breached with the connection of that exchange to Portlaoise.  We are talking about the same country, about this small island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is no reduction in service and if staff are not to be transferred or affected in any way, it hardly matters where the plug is plugged in.  The Portumna exchange will now be parented on the Birr exchange but this will not affect in any way either staff or subscribers. No part of the Galway district is being transferred to Portlaoise.  I hope that news will make the Deputy happy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were to parent the Portumna exchange to a Galway exchange the cost would be £100,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the advice available to me.  Having regard to the justified praise the Deputy has given to the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs they would hardly advise me wrongly.  The Deputy is reflecting on the integrity of the advice they have given me by doubting the information with which they supplied me.  I accept the figure of £100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should check that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that, having regard to the scarce resources with which we have had to deal since coming into <Col N="2036" /> office, I am not prepared to waste that amount.</P>
      <P>I turn now to telephone kiosks, a subject near to the Deputy's heart.  There is a commitment to install 800 kiosks over the next three years and I share the Deputy's view that very often in a remote rural area a kiosk can be a great social amenity, although its financial viability might be questionable.  Unfortunately we must have regard to the financial viability of kiosks and certain commercial criteria must be met before they can be installed. We could not afford to install them unless there was a prospect of a commercial return.</P>
      <P>The Deputy spoke about promises and referred to the Bantry exchange.  I thought this a little ironic when I considered the promises he made prior to the election about kiosks in Galway, many of which did not come within the criteria laid down and which would have been erected for what I can politely describe as social-political reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister put the social reasons before the political ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because of a high regard for the Deputy.  I am sure he was not motivated solely by considerations of an impending election.  I am glad to tell him that the kiosk on Inishmacateer has now been approved and a letter is being sent to him on the subject.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised the matter of the subscriber carrier system.  This is a technical device to enable more connections to be made on one telephone cable in order to make better use of the lines within that cable.  Substantial quantities of these have been ordered.  They are now being used extensively and will continue to be used on such a scale to ease the backlog of applications for connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned multi-channel systems for television.  Letters of intent have issued in regard to Cork and Galway and I am not anxious to issue any more until we see how matters develop in these two areas.  Cable systems will require a high level of investment and a <Col N="2037" /> great deal of expertise.  Those who make the heavy investment required may find it in jeopardy if the quality of the picture is not good.  Subscribers who enter into a contract may not wish to renew it in such a case.  I am not anxious to proceed further until those two areas are serviced and we can see how the system is working. After that it will be a matter of drawing up a priority list based on population centres and there will be organised competitions to see who wishes to undertake this commercial risk in non multi-channel areas.</P>
    <P>I have indicated a certain philosophical difference with my predecessor as to the nature of local radio and by whom it should be controlled.  I feel it should be non-commercial and that there should be a community input.  I am at present considering how that is to be organised and I am meeting various groups who have an interest in the matter.  It should be community controlled and for the benefit of the community.  We do not want more of what we have; we want a change in style in radio broadcasting.  I cannot at this stage give a date but I would hope to bring proposals before the Government during the second month of the new year and to introduce legislation before Easter.</P>
    <P>I think there will be a disagreement between Deputy Killilea and myself as to whether the new post office in Crettyard sanctioned by him when Minister of State is sited in the best place.  There is considerable local opposition to the new site on the grounds that it is inconvenient and leaves part of the area served by the old post office at an unusually long distance. We must have regard to the wishes of the people in these cases because the post office is there to serve the community.  If it does not do so properly we should not be inhibited from putting a second post office to serve the neglected area.  At present I am having the scene examined with a view to selecting a site for another post office to restore to the citizens of Crettyard the facilities they enjoyed until my predecessor took them away.  That is democracy in action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was less than considerate of the views of the people when he agreed to the siting of the new post office.  I want to redress that omission.</P>
      <P>The Deputy was disappointed because he felt the issue of the Hoban stamp did not receive enough publicity.  This was the first joint issue between ourselves and the US Post Office.  Perhaps he was disappointed that it did not receive more attention from the media but there was a lot of publicity in the specialised stamp collecting world.  There were advertisements in magazines in Canada, Great Britain and Germany and this was additional to the normal publicity regarding new stamps.  Colour transparencies were sent to the three major television networks in the US and to RTE and black and white photographs, together with a press release, were sent to the major US newspapers.  A special presentation album containing the Irish Hoban stamp was sent to the Irish Ambassador in America for presentation to the wife of the President and the US Postmaster General at a special ceremony in the White House.  Special bulletins were also sent in connection with the Irish promotion in a New York store.  It was unfortunate that the US Post Office were not able to issue their stamp simultaneously with ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take issue with the Deputy regarding the visit here of the US Postmaster General.  We are very pleased to have such a distinguished visitor and I should like to put on record our appreciation of his assistance in this joint stamp project and in the postal scene generally.  He is making his experience and advice available to the new postal board, for which we are very grateful.  He <Col N="2039" /> was accorded the proper welcome according to normal protocol.  I had the pleasure of showing him hospitality.  He was also a guest here in the House for a formal presentation.  Therefore, I have to reject the Deputy's suggestion that he did not receive the honour he was entitled to.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked about the postal museum.  It is proposed to open it next year.  Obviously, benefits will flow from that.  Both he and Deputy Reynolds raised the question of stores.  They said there had been a cutback on the issue of stores for the telephone development programme.  I am glad to tell the Deputy that stores are freely available.  The position is much better than it was.  Obviously one cannot have an immense amount of equipment in all stores at all times because that would tie up a huge amount of money.  Shortage of money to buy stores has not been a problem, though occasionally there will be shortages of particular items in particular stores. Because of the size of the operation that is nearly inevitable, but there is no overall shortage or squeezing in the important area of stores.  Stores are basic to the speedy and orderly development of the telephone expansion programme, and this Supplementary Estimate is designed to ensure that.</P>
    <P>One public demonstration of this will take place in Athlone in a couple of weeks when the new digital exchange will be opened, followed by another such exchange in Kells.  Thereafter, there is a planned programme of digital exchanges to be opened through 1982.  These exchanges, which will provide the very latest in telephone technology, will bring immense improvement in the variety and sophistication of the services that will be available to the public.  The development this will bring will be immediately perceptible. I hope that from now on the perceptible improvement in our telephone service will do a lot to restore confidence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds asked about mobile radio telephone.  I am glad to tell him that tenders were invited some time ago. We are awaiting the closing of the tender <Col N="2040" /> date after which tenders will be examined and a contract awarded in due course. The same Deputy asked about a computerised directory inquiry service.  There were industrial problems in this area but I am glad to say these appear to have been cleared up and I hope that the computerised directory inquiry service will be in operation in two to three weeks.  It will bring immense commercial benefits with it and it will be a relief to staff because instead of having to pull out the directory and thumb through it they will be able to press a button and the information will be flashed on a screen and will be available immediately for subscribers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds criticised the second paragraph of my statement in which I referred to the general financial context in which the Supplementary Estimate was required.  He said it was unnecessary. I felt it was necessary to refer to the current deficit situation last July so that a Supplementary Estimate involving an important piece of financial expenditure could be seen in the overall context.  The Deputy queried it as being merely a propaganda statement inserted gratuitously. That is not so.  It was necessary to set the financial scene in which we are now coming to the House for money, and I was just explaining to the House why it was necessary.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening statement, the current deficit at the end of July &mdash; the borrowing for current purposes &mdash; had reached £457 million.  That was almost 90 per cent of the target for the whole year. Deputy Reynolds wanted to know where the figure of more than £900 million for the whole year had come from.  Clearly, if you have £557 million gone by 21 July, and that is 90 per cent of your target for the whole year, you must ask what will you be doing for the rest of the year.  It is a fair assumption that if you did not do anything about it you would have to borrow the same amount again in the second half of the year, unless corrective action was taken.  That corrective action was taken by the people in the election, and having regard to that mandate for the Government, that corrective action has had the effect of curtailing spending and it has also had to encompass some taxation, <Col N="2041" /> unfortunately, so that the runaway ship of the nation's finances could be brought under control again.</P>
    <P>Deputies Reynolds and Killilea said that Supplementary Estimates are not new in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, a big spending Department.  I take that point which has a certain validity, but there are items in this Supplementary Estimate that do not come within a contingency character.  They are items which should have been foreseen because they had occurred year after year for many years.  For example, the biggest item is in Subhead A which deals with salaries, wages and allowances.  We are seeking an extra £20.6 million under that heading.  I would point out to the Deputies that £20 million was cut from the Estimate originally presented at the beginning of 1981.  When the 1981 budget was brought before the House the sum of £20 million had been cut in respect of salaries, wages and allowances.  There is no provision in it for special payments even though, if the history of previous years had been looked at, it would have been quite clear to the Minister at the time and to the Minister for Finance at the time that that figure would be necessary.</P>
    <P>That £20 million included £10 million for overtime.  Overtime is not something new in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The Deputies were aware then that there is a heavy incidence of overtime in the Post Office, necessitated by the need to continue the expansion of the postal and telephone services and to deal with contingencies of the type Deputy Reynolds referred to, such as the incident in Clare Street some time ago when Dublin Corporation flooded the underground ducts and put the telephones out of action, and a large-scale operation had to be undertaken to get them repaired, involving a lot of heavy overtime.  That was not something new and it should not have been any surprise to my predecessor and his Minister of State.  They should have known that the cutting of £10 million from the Estimate would have meant that the Estimate presented to the House <Col N="2042" /> would be, to put it in the most charitable terms, less than realistic.</P>
    <P>Subhead B deals with travelling and incidental expenses.  We require £3.75 million under this subhead because of higher costs of travelling and subsistence. I would remind the Deputies that new subsistence rates had been agreed before the Estimate but were not calculated in the Estimate.  The Deputy will notice that we are looking at an original Estimate figure of £7.9 million and we are now looking for an increase of £3.5 million, 40 per cent to 50 per cent.  That is not just an unforeseen contingency.  It is due to deliberate underestimation.  As the Minister for Finance has pointed out at regular intervals, this feature of underestimation appears through every Department and must throw a lot of doubt on the financial probity of this year's first budget.</P>
    <P>There are interesting figures in subhead D, which covers the conveyancing of mail.  The figure which was provided in the 1981 Estimate was £5.18 million. We have to compare that with the figure which was the outturn under the same heading in 1980.  In 1980, the figure was £5.09 million.  So, in other words, when the 1981 Estimate came to be framed the Minister was aware that the outturn in 1980 was £5.09 million and yet all that was provided for 1981 was an extra £90,000.  Having regard to the increased costs for the conveyance of mails by road, rail and air it must have been quite clear that it was an unrealistic figure and, in fact, a sum of £5.4 million was sought but this was cut back.  So, again, we are looking now to restore more than was originally cut back.  Under that subhead also the figure in the 1981 budget in last January, February or March, whenever it was, was unrealistic.</P>
    <P>Under subhead E &mdash; Postal and General Stores, which encompasses within it the provision for buying post office vans &mdash; the amount we are seeking is £2.2 million and the amount that was sought at the beginning of the year was cut by £2.1 million, much the same as what we now have to come in and look for.  Again, this was a figure that was, to be charitable, less than real.  The estimate for 1981 <Col N="2043" /> under this heading was £7.3 million.  The previous year, the outturn was £8.1 million. So, for 1981 under this critical heading of postal vans and other postal stores, the amount was actually reduced.  That was hardly realistic budgeting and certainly I will not take criticism or worries from the Deputy opposite or from his colleague Deputy Reynolds, about our intentions towards keeping the postal service and telephone service going when they actually budgeted for a reduction of expenditure in this critical period.</P>
    <P>We go then to subhead F where we are looking for an extra £7.3 million for increased expenditure on engineering stores.  This subhead is complicated because it epitomises the point made by Deputy Reynolds: what should be capital and what should be vote?  I agree with Deputy Reynolds that the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is confused in that regard and that there are many items in the current Estimate which should be in capital.  Deputy Reynolds said he was disappointed that it was not clarified and, of course, I too was disappointed.  No doubt, there were good administrative reasons why it did not happen in the 1981 budget but hopefully we will be able to have this distinction made and the estimate position clarified for the 1982 budget.  But, again, whether it is capital or vote, there is still a shortfall of £7.3 million, which is a substantial amount of money under the heading for engineering stores and equipment. Again, I think it is ironic that the Deputies should be expressing worry about my bona fides and my intentions towards the expansion of the telephone service when they deliberately left their own estimates short by these pretty substantial sums and when they knew they were leaving them short and presented the estimates as being real estimates.  I must say they have totally destroyed their entitlement to criticise anybody else in regard to the development of the telecommunications services.</P>
    <P>Again, referring to subhead K.3, which is only a small item by comparison with the other subheads&mdash;Office Machinery and Other Supplies&mdash;as I stated in the <Col N="2044" /> opening statement we need an extra £231,000 in order to meet increased rental on data processing machines and the purchase and lease of extra machines required for the extension of computerisation. Deputy Reynolds made great play about all the services being offered and the modernisation programme of the Post Office but, again, that rings hollow when we see this subhead, designed to improve the efficiency of the Post Office by making use of modern computer technology, being underestimated.  It was actually cut by £270,000.  The figure that the Department advised was necessary was cut by £270,000 at the beginning of the year and we are now in the position of coming in here for a supplementary estimate to restore that.  We are now looking for £231,000.  So as to counter Deputy Reynold's argument that the references in my opening statement to the fact that not enough was provided were political and merely designed for propaganda purposes, I have shown conclusively that they are factual, and as to his defence of the supplementary estimate on the basis that contingencies always occur&mdash;I admit that they do&mdash;I have demonstrated that the areas of shortfall in this Supplementary Estimate could not be put under the heading of contingencies, that is, something unforeseen.  These were matters of historical experience that any Minister would know and indeed, his Department would have advised him, would have to be spent during the year, that these were commitments that would have to be met and yet, notwithstanding that knowledge and advice, the Estimate was cut and, again to use a charitable word, an unreal Estimate was presented to this House.  That is why I am here this afternoon asking the House now to approve of these extra expenditures so that we can continue to expand and maintain the postal and telecommunications services.</P>

      <P>Just two very brief questions: The first is the question of the Post Office hiring vehicles from private firms when they could do their own thing by purchasing under the easy purchase schemes that are available.  The other question is the most important one at this time when we are talking about a supplementary estimate for the Department, that is, the service being provided.  There are serious complaints by the people of the East Cork area about the service being obtained from the 10 centre in Cork.  The Minister will be aware that 11 exchanges in the North Cork area are due for automation which will mean that there will be thousands more signals competing for attention at the already very overloaded Cork exchange and the case is being put forward for consideration of the retention of Mallow, which has 14 switchboards and 37 operators, for the purpose of giving a better service to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of hiring vans in the Post Office is raised from time to time.  Inevitably, vans have to be hired. There may be an urgent need in an area and vans may not be available.  There may be servicing requirements and vans may have to be taken out of service and continuation of the work may mean replacement.  Rather than buy replacements and have an excessive fleet, vans have to be hired.  There are instances of long-term hiring where clearly it would be more economic to buy.  It is always a difficult thing to quantify.  In times of scarce capital it is a dilemma that faces many businesses, not just the Department: does one hire and save capital or does one try to scrape up the capital, put it into vans and deprive some other area of it?  This balance has to be made and it is something we are conscious of.  We try to balance all the time in favour of the best use of the public purse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the traffic that will <Col N="2046" /> come into the 10 area in Cork, I take the Deputy's point.  He may have heard me dealing with it in the context of the Bantry exchange where it was intended that the Bantry traffic would be all routed into Cork for 10 calls.  However, we were getting worried about the volume of traffic going into the Cork exchange and have altered the arrangements so that there will still be a 10 service provided in Bantry.  It is on an interim basis to see how we get on.  However, obviously, we are not going to deluge the Cork exchange with 10 calls from all over east and north Cork unless we are satisfied that the Cork exchange is able to handle it.  If that means postponing some of the changes that are intended in the exchanges in north and east Cork areas that is the way it will have to be until we make sure that in making those automatic we do not make the position worse in Cork.  There would be no advantage in that.  We are conscious of the problem and I can assure the Deputy that it will be taken into consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. E. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £113,318,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1981, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, for certain services administered by that Office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, and for sundry grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is required to meet increased expenditure arising from increases in the rates of social welfare payments from October 1981, the payment of a double week to recipients of certain social welfare pensions and allowances in December 1981, increases in administration costs and an upward trend in the numbers claiming under the various schemes.  The increases arise on all three sections of the Social <Col N="2047" /> Welfare Vote for the current year, namely, administration, social insurance and social assistance.</P>
    <P>The original Estimate, which was passed by the House in July last, was for the sum of £476,635,000.  A Supplementary Estimate for £106,420,000 was also passed by the House in July last.  The reason for taking the Supplementary Estimate at that time was the exceptional cost of increasing long-term payments by 25 per cent and short-term payments by 20 per cent from April 1981 and children's allowances by an average 30 per cent from July 1981.  It was apparent that there would not have been sufficient voted moneys available to the Department to meet these costs during the period that the House was in recess.  The sum of £106,420,000 was the estimated cost of the increases in rates of payment and other improvements in social welfare services provided in the 1981 budget.  The present Estimate is for a sum of £113,318,000, which brings total Exchequer spending on the services administered by my Department in the current year to £696,373,000.</P>
    <P>Under the section for administration &mdash; subheads A to C &mdash; the net additional expenditure amounts to £4,907,000.  This derives from increases amounting to £4,440,000 on subhead A.1 in respect of salaries, wages and allowances; £100,000 on subhead B.1 in respect of increased travelling and incidental expenses; £265,000 on subhead B.2 in respect of increased computerisation and £130,000 on subhead C in respect of an increase in the cost of telephone services.  These increases are offset by a small saving of £28,000 on subhead A.2 in respect of consultancy services.</P>
    <P>The additional expenditure on social insurance &mdash; subheads E and F &mdash; amounts to £70,720,000 which is the result of an increase of £70,644,000 on subhead E and an increase of £76,000 on subhead F.</P>
    <P>The extra amount required for social assistance &mdash; subheads G to L &mdash; is £39,453,000.  The overall increase on the three sections comes to £115,080,000. There is, however, an increase of <Col N="2048" /> £1,762,000 in the receipts from appropriations-in-aid &mdash; subhead M &mdash; which serves to reduce the net additional requirement to £113,318,000.</P>
    <P>The sum of £70,644,000 required for subhead E is the additional amount payable by the Exchequer to the Social Insurance Fund to meet the deficit on the working of the fund.  The cost of the increases of 5 per cent to beneficiaries over pension age and 3 per cent to others from October 1981, which were announced in the July budget, is £6,091,000, while the cost of the extra week's payment in December to recipients of contributory pensions and allowances is £7,294,000.  There is also an increased expenditure of £57,259,000 arising mainly from an upward trend in the numbers claiming insurance benefits during the year.  The main constituents of this sum are £29,980,000 in respect of unemployment benefit; £15,800,000 in respect of pay-related benefit; £6,440,000 in respect of old age contributory pensions; £4,050,000 in respect of disability, benefit; £1,364,000 in respect of widows' and orphans' contributory pensions; and £1,600,000 in respect of invalidity pensions. The total of these increases is £59,234,000, but variations from the original estimates in the remaining insurance schemes had the effect of reducing this figure by £1,975,000.  On the income side the estimate of £477,500,000 in receipts from contributions payable by employers and employees is expected to be realised by the end of the current year.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, final draws must be made from the Exchequer before the end of each year on an estimated basis because actual figures of expenditure and income are not available until after the close of the year.  Any overdraw or underdraw resulting will be reflected in the amount payable by the Exchequer to the Social Insurance Fund in the following year.</P>
    <P>The additional expenditure required in the Supplementary Estimate for social assistance amounts to £39,453,000.  This expenditure arises from the increases in rates of payment from October 1981 at a cost of £3,531,000; the cost of the extra week's payment in December to recipients <Col N="2049" /> of certain pensions and allowances amounting to £4,384,000 and a net sum of £31,538,000 to meet increases of £12,240,000 on unemployment assistance; £7,600,000 on children's allowances; £2,630,000 on old age non-contributory pensions; £2,754,000 on supplementary welfare allowances; £1,850,000 on free travel and £1,335,000 on unmarried mothers' allowances as well as increases under various other schemes totalling £3,183,000.  These increases are offset by a small saving of £54,000 on prisoners' wives allowances.</P>
    <P>The surplus of £1,762,000 in appropriations-in-aid arises mainly from the increase in the amount of the administration costs of the social insurance and the occupational injuries schemes which have to be refunded from the Social Insurance Fund and the Occupational Injuries Fund.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, this Supplementary Estimate is for an additional sum of £113,318,000 which is required to meet the cost of the increases in rates of payment from October 1981, the cost of the double week's payment in December and to meet other excesses on the services administered by my Department which have arisen since the original Estimates were prepared.  Deputies may wish to note that overall expenditure on social insurance and social assistance services will amount to more than £1,206 million in the current year, which is an increase of £309 million or 34.4 per cent on 1980. Expenditure in a full year at current rates will amount to some £1,330 million.</P>
    <P>If Deputies require any further information regarding the matters affecting this Supplementary Estimate I shall be pleased to furnish it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pleasure in supporting the Minister's Estimate, which is set out very clearly.  At the outset let me say that the document was not available to me until this morning and I would have welcomed having it yesterday or the day before.  I do not want to make much of that point, but I would hope that it would not be the practice in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the bulk of the Supplementary Estimate relates to the general level <Col N="2050" /> of the unemployment figures throughout the year.  The question of unemployment is not directly one for the Department of Social Welfare.  It is unfortunate that it has been running at a fairly high level in recent times and is now at 129,000, its highest level.  We are coming into the winter and can expect the demands on social welfare insurance and assistance schemes to increase.  The Department of Social Welfare can only do the appropriate bookkeeping and make the payments. At the time we left office it was quite clear that a Supplementary Estimate of approximately £77 million would be necessary.  Indeed, the Minister for Finance mentioned that figure in July when he spoke in relation to the budget. There is considerable difficulty in the Department of Social Welfare in getting correct Estimates on unemployment in the year ahead.  The figure estimated for 1980 was 86,000, but it turned out to be just over 100,000.  The average for this year then was estimated at about 104,000 or 106,000 &mdash; the Minister can supply the exact figure.</P>
    <P>There was a major capital programme of £1,700 million at that time which was expected to produce a certain number of jobs and reduce the impact on the payments of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  But, despite that, it looks as if we will have to estimate unemployment at higher levels going into next year.  From the present trend and because of the adverse impact of the Government's general policies, we will be faced with a much higher level of unemployment this winter.  I appreciate that there is a measure coming forward which will be of assistance and will be discussed here in this House quite soon.  There is a deficiency in the Social Insurance Fund of £70.6 million.  This creates a problem when looking forward to next year because we know already that the employee will have to face an increase in the pay related social insurance and health contribution.  The present social insurance contribution is 3.5 per cent and is being increased for the employee by 1 per cent and the health contribution is being increased by 1.5 per cent, giving a total of 6 per cent.  We also know that for <Col N="2051" /> those earning more than £8,500 there is an addition of 3.75 per cent.  If the number of unemployed is allowed to increase the pressure on the fund and on the contributors, both employers and employees, will become intolerable in the coming year.  What will the State's contribution be to the fund this year?  It is acceptable and reasonable that the contribution from the State to the Social Insurance Fund should increase during periods of high unemployment.  I appreciate that the Department of Finance would not welcome that statement because their interest is in bringing in the resources by other means.  The State's contribution has varied between 18 per cent and 25 per cent.  It looks as if it will be of that order this year, and I believe that is necessary.  I want to put that on the record of the House against such an increase because of the general Government policy of not encouraging deficits even of reasonable proportions.  This is one of the elements which will be important in relation to this Estimate.  By far the biggest aspect is the impact of unemployment on the whole Estimate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to a number of aspects.  I am delighted to see that there will be a Christmas bonus.  We have had a long discussion on social welfare this week so I do not intend to extend the debate unduly at this time.  There were some remarks made about the Christmas bonus to the effect that it was forced upon us last year by the national understanding. The idea originated from the Minister for Social Welfare, got the full support of the Government and was then put to the national partners as one of the possibilities to alleviate the position of those on lower incomes and on social welfare long-term benefits over the winter period.  It was welcomed and supported by the national partners, which in turn was valuable to the Minister, as I am sure the present Minister would find if that national partnership was still functioning. We were concerned last year that the Christmas bonus would be extended to all who needed it.  Its introduction was costly and it was a big step.  We were pressed at that time and I seriously considered <Col N="2052" /> covering people who were on unemployment assistance for a long period.  I am not making this as a political point, but it was the first time we had introduced this scheme and people on the Opposition side of the House raised the question of those on unemployment assistance for some time.  Would the Minister consider the situation and see if there was any way in which he could alleviate their position?  The House appreciates that unemployment benefits are considerable in the first period, diminishing as time advances and, eventually, an individual goes on to unemployment assistance, which is a particularly low level.  In that case there is a difficulty and perhaps the Minister would give some consideration to this matter. She will have the support of this side of the House in anything she decides to do in that regard.</P>
    <P>I was criticised by the Minister for Finance for spending what at that time was an estimated £77 million Supplementary Estimate which was required at the end of the year.  It is now £113 million. The £113 million is a 19 per cent increase on the basic estimate.  The £77 million was a 14 per cent increase on the basic estimate.  Given the very difficult times we are facing, I do not think this is as extraordinary as was made out by the Minister for Finance.  Looking back over the record, I find in 1973-74 the Supplementary Estimate was 29.7 per cent.  In 1975-76 it was 22 per cent and in 1976-77 it was 8.5 per cent.  So, historically, it is not the first time we have had a situation like this.  I do not mention that specifically because it was during a Coalition period of Government but it was a time when we had an international recession, a period of great difficulty and, naturally, the Minister for Social Welfare would have been under considerable strain from unemployment figures, unemployment assistance and so on.  The same situation applies today and we believe the present Government are accentuating and worsening the position.  There is still the fundamental problem of meeting the requirements during this recession.  I welcome the Christmas bonus.  The Supplementary Estimate is being used by the <Col N="2053" /> Minister for Finance to build up a case about distortion of the figures which is quite untrue and unfair.  It is not based on the facts as we know them.  If you tease out the various elements you will find this is the case probably in most Departments.  The Estimate shows that the level of unemployment reached during the year is the principal contributor to this excess.  The other elements are decisions which had to be taken by the Government in the latter stage of the year &mdash; for instance the fuel scheme.</P>
    <P>It has also been said in the House that the fuel scheme was something that would not have been reviewed and revised by the Fianna Fáil Government because they did not make an allowance for it initially.  Normally, in the July/August period &mdash; if the Minister is not aware of this, her officials will confirm it &mdash; the situation is reviewed and the moneys seen to be necessary for the coming winter are made available then. That is what we would have done.  It is the normal practice.  The Minister for Finance is wrong in suggesting otherwise. However, that is a different argument.</P>
    <P>One of the elements which is important and about which we will hear a lot more in due course is the question of children's allowances.  In the original Estimate there are very substantial increases which were applied this year by the former Government. These increases have led to a very considerable extra demand from the Exchequer and they represented a policy which was in train at that time of increasing the contribution to those who avail of children's allowances.  I am disappointed that the Department have agreed under the new policy to claw back the husband's tax free allowance, the policy to be implemented at this stage, and have not made up sufficiently the direct children's allowance on the other side.  I am referring to the proposed £12, £3 per week per child. This sounds like a great increase but except for those on the very lowest incomes and those paying no tax, it will result in a loss.  The tax free allowance at the 25 per cent rate was of considerable benefit.  It is now proposed to do away with that.  These are figures which will not show but are a clawback in relation <Col N="2054" /> to the figures on children's allowances. The position, therefore, is that many families will lose as a result of the clawback of the husband's tax free allowance. At present this is being presented as a substantial gain.  In the Estimate we have a 30 per cent increase which was given under the Fianna Fáil Government this year for children's allowances, that part of it which applied this year.  That 30 per cent increase was substantial and was widely welcomed.  If we were only to give the same increase next year, the position for a four child family would be the equivalent of £14.52 per week from next April as against £12 which is promised at this stage.  For many families this will be a set back.  It is a clawback of their tax benefit.</P>
    <P>I accept that those who pay no tax and those on social welfare benefits will gain, although the gain per head will be very small.  Had we proceeded on the lines introduced by Fianna Fáil, without any further improvements &mdash; and one must remember that we set up a committee to examine the situation in general and the Minister will have the report of that committee presently &mdash; the benefit would only be 25p per child where no tax applies.  In other words, had we, as we did last year and the year before, increased the allowance by 30 per cent next year, the total would be £11 as against the £12 promised by the Coalition. If one is going to transfer something, rather than have a sleight of hand, it should be substantial.  Even for those on the lowest level, with no tax to pay &mdash; people whom this measure is intended to benefit &mdash; it is right that they should benefit, whichever way it is delivered. However, they are not getting much benefit. Those in the lower and middle income group will lose substantially on a tax basis, because for each child they will lose £195 tax allowance.  This is something which people may not fully realise. It will have a major impact on families in general.</P>
    <P>We support the increases in children's allowances in the original Estimate and hope to see them continue at least on the lines of previous increases.  The plan which the Coalition Government have at the moment will not be good for the vast <Col N="2055" /> majority of families.  For those for whom it is an improvement, it will be a very small one.</P>
    <P>I have put down a question to the Minister for Finance.  He did not give any figures here today, but I hope that he will give me this figure.  I would estimate that the clawback will bring about £45 million to the Minister, from the £195 per child now lost.  There may be some small variations in that, but I am sure that the Minister's officials have the appropriate tables and could work that out very quickly.  The clawback would be of the order of £40 to £50 million.  If one is taking back that much money from middle income families, a lot of money is available to give to families at the lower level or to those middle income families by way of better direct children's allowances. That is not represented in the Government's proposals at present.  The cost to the Government of the total switch around would be as in the case of the £9.60, going from one hand to the other. Someone will have to pay for the administration. There will be some small improvement for those at the bottom of the scale and a very big disimprovement for people who are paying even 25 per cent tax rate.  When one comes to people paying 35 per cent and 40 per cent tax &mdash; and quite a few people with families are paying the 35 per cent tax rate &mdash; there will be a very substantial loss as a result of this trend.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success in regard to modernisation and computerisation of the Department, which is a very major undertaking.  She will be subject to sniping, as I was, from the sidelines while this process is under way.  It is a difficult process which will take some time to be fully completed.  The Minister has agreed that it is well under way at this stage.  I hope that she will not be held up in any way by restriction of funds for office machinery and supplies and for computerisation and the consultancy in relation to it.  I suspect that this is one of the areas where the Minister for Finance may not be fully pulling his weight in relation to the Minister for Social Welfare getting very substantial backup and assistance <Col N="2056" /> for the transfers and changes which are at present taking place and which are so urgent.  On the basis of this change in the administration and in the improvement and modernisation of the service, a far better service will be made available to the public.  Without those changes one could not have a better service.  A lot of nonsense has been talked here about what can and cannot be done, but none of these things can be achieved until a sufficiently powerful and effective computer system is installed and operating. These bring not only mechanical and practical problems, but industrial relations problems also.  One is adjusting the whole environment, which is why difficulties have arisen from time to time in that area.  However, these are teething problems which must be faced and overcome. The Minister will have my full support in those difficulties.  I also would seek the ultimate objective of a decentralisation of as much information and feedback as possible.</P>
    <P>It was a matter of great joy to me that before I left office I was able to have one extra video unit opened in Dublin, in Gandon House.  Because of practical difficulties it took quite some time before that unit was operating, but it was marvellous to have a visual display unit in Gandon House and Oisin House, away from Store Street, where people could come into a modern, scientific, technological, environment, to the information officers there, to see how they stood in relation to disability benefits and other items.  Of course, the objective is to go beyond that, to Cork, Galway and other places.  The first small steps have become possible.  Further improvements are taking place at the moment at the computer end, so that this type of service can be supplied around the country.  At that stage one can give a much better service locally to those requiring it.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that that should be the case.  The Deputy asked what the Exchequer contribution to the social insurance fund was this year and the answer is 30 per cent.  Deputy Woods dealt with the increased numbers on unemployment benefit which accounted for the bulk of the Supplementary Estimate before us this afternoon.  The general Estimate was based on a figure of 106,500.  The latest Supplementary Estimate is based on a figure of 134,750. When the figure of 106,500 was released, it was pretty clear that it did not represent a true estimate of what the position would be this year.  There was ample evidence from international trends in unemployment that the figure could well be a lot higher and that there was an under-estimation in that regard.</P>

      <P>Might I point out that the Estimate of the Department of Finance was 112,000 and that 6,000 was taken from the £170,000 million investment which brought us back to the figure of <Col N="2058" /> 106,000.  The Minister can confirm that with her officials.</P>

      <P>Deputy Woods also mentioned the question of computerisation and expressed a desire that computerisation should be pressed ahead with as much as possible.  I share that view. Our main concern is to ensure the elimination of any delays and the quick processing of claims.  It will be necessary in that regard to press ahead with computerisation to ensure that the information is available at the earliest possible moment.  The Deputy can be assured that we will press ahead with computerisation as quickly as possible and that it will not suffer from lack of will or lack of finance.</P>

      <P>I will share the time available to me with Deputy Walsh and Deputy O'Malley.  I should like to thank you, A Cheann Comhairle, and your office for allowing me to raise this most important matter in Dáil Éireann this evening.  I want to say how saddened I am, on this my first time to speak in this House since I had the honour of becoming a Member, that it has to be on the subject of the closure of Clondalkin Paper Mills.  Any Deputy who has ever represented County Dublin will know the tremendous contribution these papermills have made to the lives not only of their employees but the people in the whole Clondalkin area and Dublin county in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped that when I chose to make my first speech in this House I could have started on a bright note. One hears enough from the prophets of gloom and doom in Dáil Éireann.  Perhaps when the Minister for Energy has addressed himself to this subject, we may be able to <Col N="2059" /> give some hope to the 470 employees and their families who are about to lose their jobs in 26 days.  I want to quote the words of the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, speaking in Cork during the general election campaign.  He said it is hard to maintain dignity and self-respect let alone idealism in the face of unemployment Those are not my words.  They are the words of the leader of the Government. I should like to ask him this evening to honour those words and to give some hope and some dignity to the people currently employed in Clondalkin Paper Mills.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to a statement made in this House during the week by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Desmond, when he attacked the management of Clondalkin Paper Mills for their deplorable behaviour in not letting anybody know of their proposed closure and appointment of a liquidator.  This was a very cheap attack by the Minister of State on people who could not be here to defend themselves. The Minister knows, and everybody else knows, that if Clondalkin Paper Mills close it will not be the fault of the management. The fault lies fairly and squarely with the Government who are in power today.  Deputy Desmond knows well that on 6 October this year the unions attached to Clondalkin Paper Mills wrote to the Minister for Energy and asked to meet him because they feared that closure was about to happen. The Minister replied that he would be away in America and could not see them for some time.</P>
    <P>Clondalkin Paper Mills management applied to the Department of Finance for money from the Employment Guarantee Fund which would have helped to keep the mills open.  On 7 October they received a letter from the Minister, Deputy Bruton, telling them that it would not be appropriate for the Minister to give them any money from this fund to save jobs.  On several occasions the management told the IDA of their proposal to close unless they got a better deal, and unless they got some realistic offer which would allow them to continue and allow <Col N="2060" /> the lives and the jobs of the 470 people involved to be safeguarded.  They got nothing they could accept, nothing which would allow them realistically to continue in production.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, they have been pushed around from one Government agency to another.  Today with only 26 days left, there is nothing which the management could accept which would allow them to keep their industry going.  We all know that Clondalkin Paper Mills are the only fine paper mills left in Ireland.  It is a strategic industry, and one which any country should be reluctant to let go.  The Clondalkin Paper Mills have served this country well.  During the last World War, when it was not possible for us to get paper from anywhere else, they manufactured paper from straw to keep us in Ireland supplied.</P>
    <P>At all times they have been a kind and courteous firm to their employees, to the people involved and to the community of which they are a part.  Those of us who have the honour to represent the Clondalkin area know that the Clondalkin Paper Mills lie at the very heart of Clondalkin itself.  I hope the Minister as Leader of the Labour Party, a party who have waxed elequent in this House and outside it about their high regard for safeguarding employment, will honour those noble words for the 470 people in Clondalkin Paper Mills and their families.  As a Minister he has an opportunity to prove to the people of Clondalkin that he really cares about employment.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the package offered by the IDA and to the fact that the management were criticised for not accepting it.  If this package is accepted, it will mean that in 1983, without any further trading losses, Clondalkin Paper Mills will be £550,000 worse off, and if they have to close at a future date they will be £2 million worse off.  If they accept the package currently being offered, if they do not go out of business now, they will jeopardise seriously the employment of the other 1,250 people working in the subsidiaries of the Clondalkin group.  I am not trying to make this a party political issue.  As one who not only represents Clondalkin in Dáil Éireann but who also <Col N="2061" /> lives very close by, I know that many of my friends and neighbours have worked for many years in this fine industry.  Many employees have worked there for over 15 years, and some have worked there for 42 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows full well that, if this fine industry goes, the last of its kind left in Ireland, because of the specialised nature of their work and because of their age, these people will not find it possible to find alternative employment.  I want to ask the Minister for Energy and his Government to honour the commitment given before the election to the many people who face unemployment.  They now have an opportunity to give some hope, some commitment, to the people involved in Clondalkin.</P>
    <P>I want the Government to involve themselves on a joint venture basis with the group involved in Clondalkin Paper Mills and to keep this industry going.  In many other European countries the State is involved in this type of activity.  When my party in Government faced a similar closure from Chipboard Ltd. in Scarriff they ploughed State aid into that firm and kept it going.  I am delighted to know tonight that Scarriff Chipboard Ltd. is doing very well, thanks to the Fianna Fáil Government who kept it open with generous State aid.</P>
    <P>The Government have an opportunity to do the same now in this instance, to involve the State in the paper industry and to ensure that our last fine paper industry is not lost.  In terms of PAYE and PRSI contributions Clondalkin Paper Mills will contribute £2 million this year to the State but if these workers lose their jobs and have to claim unemployment benefit a further £2 million will have to be paid out by the State.  At current prices this means that the State stands to lose a total of £4 million in any one year. In addition we would be worse off by £25 million in terms of our balance of payments. In these circumstances I plead with the Minister on behalf of the workers in Clondalkin to honour the commitment given to keep the industry going and to give these workers some hope for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, was saddened on hearing the news of the proposal to close Clondalkin Paper Mills.  These mills have been in existence since the mid-eighteen hundreds.  I understand that they were closed between 1922 and 1936 but they reopened in 1936 and, as Deputy Harney has stated, they played a major role by providing paper through the war years. Since then they have played a major role in the industrial sector.  This industry is described by many as a national industry. It is the only fine paper mill remaining in the country but if it closes we will have no option but to import all our requirements of paper.</P>
      <P>There is a very fine work force at these paper mills and they have enjoyed very good industrial relations.  Some of them have 40 years' experience in the industry. If the mills close this very valuable experience will be lost.</P>
      <P>In the redevelopment of Dublin the Clondalkin area was chosen to be a new town with a population of approximately 125,000.  Naturally, at that time the paper mills were regarded as an industry that would play an important role in the development of Clondalkin and in the welfare of its residents but if the mills are closed the hopes of many young people in the area will be dashed.  The jobs of the 470 employees concerned are in jeopardy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a question of the management of Clondalkin Paper Mills taking the easy way out and deciding to close when the situation is bad.  For the past number of years they have injected a considerable amount of capital into the improvement of the works and it was hoped that the trading position would improve.  Unfortunately, that hope has not been fulfilled. From time to time, regardless of who is in government, we hear announcements from Ministers of industries being set up that are to provide employment for 50, 100 or perhaps 200 people.  Such announcements are always welcome but we must do everything possible also to maintain the industries we have and the one in question has proved its worth down through the years.  I appeal to the Minister to do everything in his power to help to avoid a closure of these mills.  The time has come for the government to play <Col N="2063" /> their part in helping to keep the industry going.  We have but one steel mill remaining and there is only one cement company though they have two factories.  We must not let our last fine paper mill go easily. I hope to hear from the Government within the coming weeks that these mills at Clondalkin will be enabled to continue to operate and that the employment of the workers there will be secure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of congratulating Deputy Harney on her very fine maiden speech this evening. There is not much reason for me to add my voice to what both she and Deputy Walsh have said.  They have put the case in a cogent and compelling fashion.  However, I should like briefly to reiterate some of the points they have made.  The first aspect of this matter that I regret is the reply that was given here some days ago by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance when he deplored what he called the failure of the company to keep the IDA and other State agencies informed of developments. I was aware a year or more ago that this company had problems and that they were constantly in touch with the agencies concerned.  I am informed that on 6 October, more than five weeks ago, they informed the IDA of what seemed to them the imminent necessity of appointing a liquidator.  Therefore, the statement made by the Minister of State and the attack on those concerned was neither true, justified nor fair and it is regrettable that such an attitude should have been adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the other speakers have said, this is not a situation in which the management concerned can be held to blame.  I have had experience of many cases where that was the situation but this is not one of them.  Indeed, the management in this case might be held to have been irresponsible if they had failed to take the action they took.  I say this because they have a group of companies under their control which are otherwise healthy but which are put in some jeopardy perhaps by the continued losses of the company in question. The number of employees in the <Col N="2064" /> other companies in the group considerably exceed 1,000.  It would be irresponsible to put their jobs in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise that in a small country like ours, an island country, there are a number of industries which are strategic.  If we were to find ourselves in some kind of war or embargo situation we would be very vulnerable if we did not have the production of some basic strategic materials and surely paper is one of those.  I could envisage the commercial and industrial life of the country coming to a halt if we were faced with the situation in which, apart from the heavy brown or packaging paper which is manufactured at another mill, we had no source of paper of our own.  During the past numbers of years we have had a long succession of unhappy events and closures in the paper, pulp and packaging industries generally.  We had the closure of the Munster Chipboard Factory at Waterford as well as the closure of the other factory there.  There was the closure also of the Athy mill and of another mill.  A year or more ago I was faced with the fact that we were about to lose our last chipboard plant but I decided that since chipboard was a strategic material we would have to continue to manufacture it.  Consequently, we devised a rescue package and I am glad to say that from all accounts this has worked very satisfactorily.  From a national point of view the Clondalkin Paper Mills, strategically, are no less important than that other plant.  Therefore, the same duty devolves on the Government at this time to act in the same way now as I acted in regard to the chipboard plant at Scarriff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to be regretted that this matter was introduced to the Dáil at this stage because negotiations are still going on in an effort to preserve the production of paper at Clondalkin Paper Mills.  I have asked the Minister to meet the interested parties and this has been arranged for tomorrow in the hope that a successful outcome can be achieved.  It would have been better if this matter had been deferred until after that meeting.  I believe it will be possible to continue paper production at Clondalkin. <Col N="2065" /> The factory is well capable of operating as a viable unit if it could do so on level pegging with its competitors in Europe and North America who receive heavy Government subsidies.  If similar subsidies were available here I have no doubt that it would be a viable project. I sincerely hope that these subsidies will be forthcoming.  I am confident that the Minister will do everything in his power to maintain the 470 jobs of those involved in paper production at Clondalkin.  They are skilled people and this country needs their expertise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely hope that some formula will be found whereby work can continue at Clondalkin.  Many of us find it hard to visualise Clondalkin without its paper mills.  I lived a considerable distance from Clondalkin but I remember some of my neighbours working there when I was a schoolboy.  Clondalkin is a fast developing area which cannot afford any extension of unemployment. I am disappointed that this problem is being kicked around like a <Col N="2066" /> political football and I regret some of the remarks made by my colleague, Deputy Harney.  I have not the opportunity to reply to them now but I will do so at a later date.  The first indication I had as a public representative from the area that Clondalkin Paper Mills were closing was when I read it in the newspapers and heard about it on the radio.  The only communication I have had from them is the press release which I am sure every Member received two days ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the problem this closure would cause in Clondalkin. I am also aware of the unemployment problem in the area and quite recently I was able to make a positive announcement concerning a new project there.  The former Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism is quite correct in saying that the problems of Clondalkin Paper Mills have been with us for some time.  They go back to 1980 and the closure of the wood pulp section.</P>
      <P>I should like to disabuse anyone of the idea that the State has stood idly by in this matter.  The IDA have been involved in an effort to put together some kind of package which would maintain the viability of the firm, but the dissatisfaction of the management with those talks led to the decision to bring in the liquidator. This was somewhat surprising because only last Friday discussions took place in my Department and the liquidator was brought in on the following Monday.  I would be the first to concede the fact that difficulties in the firm have been foreseeable for some time but the IDA and the rescue agency produced what we considered to be a realistic package to rescue the undertaking.  The package put forward by the IDA has not, however, found favour with management and this is to be regretted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to deal in detail with figures because Deputies will appreciate that there is still a possibility of continued operations.  The moneys which the IDA were willing to give to the firm were contingent on management bringing in certain structural changes to ensure a better future for the firm.  The management <Col N="2067" /> were not ready to make a matching investment.  My opinion is that the IDA were correct in their attitude because it would appear from management's approach that the funds which were to be made available by the IDA would be used in the main to reduce bank loans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The management were asked to invest £2 million in respect of which they would have received a grant of £800.000 when they ordered and paid for machinery which would take 12 months to deliver.  How would that reduce bank borrowings?  It would extend their borrowings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a consultant's report which recommended a certain course and the IDA were prepared to play their part.  Management were not. I do not want simply to hurl brickbats at management because they have their own problems and this firm has been ailing for some time.  I believe, however, that if they were to adopt a more realistic approach the firm could be brought around a very difficult corner.  The IDA stand ready to assist.</P>
      <P>There is no point in making general speeches about the unemployment situation. We are faced with the problem of a firm who are experiencing difficulties. The IDA met them half way in coping with those difficulties but management did not conclude that the arrangements were satisfactory.  I understand that the company go to Fóir Teoranta tomorrow morning for further discussions and tomorrow afternoon I am to meet the trade union representatives once more. I would hope that good sense would prevail so that the operation could be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we must pay serious attention to the report of the consultants which gives a blueprint for the survival of the firm.  If management could see their way to co-operating in regard to the recommendations of this report the IDA would stand behind the bargain already given. This would give the firm a renewed life. Management must come half way to meet the IDA in their efforts to keep the firm <Col N="2068" /> viable.  The consultants have made a complete examination of the financial and operational affairs of the mills and they have concluded that with restructuring and necessary capital investment from the management the company could once more become viable.</P>
    <P>The IDA offered a package of financing which would permit the survival of the firm.  This would call for certain capital expenditure by the group.  I accept that they must consider the interests of all employees attached to the group but I believe that if management looked at this matter correctly they would appreciate that the prosperity of the entire group has in the past been massively contributed to by the Clondalkin firm.  I believe it would be shortsighted of them to opt out and turn down the offers of financial assistance which have been made.  Closure is to occur reasonably soon and time is running out but there could still be a survival plan if all concerned would reconsider their position. The company have been unrealistic in their approach to the financial aids offered by the IDA.</P>

      <P>On the 7 August I wrote to each city and county manager and to each semi-State body for which my Department have responsibility drawing attention to the terms of the budget statement of the Minister for Finance in so far as it applied to public sector pay and asking them to ensure that the policy referred to <Col N="2011" /> is complied with in their authorities.  With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate copies of the letters in question with the Official Report. There has also been correspondence between my Department and a number of individual local authorities and bodies about the application of the policy in particular cases.</P>
      <P>Following is the correspondence referred to:</P>
      <P Just="Right">7 August, 1981.</P>
      <P>Dear Chairman,</P>
      <P>1.  I attach an extract from the Minister for Finance's Budget statement of 21 July 1981 dealing with public sector pay.  I would ask you to ensure that Government policy on public sector pay as stated in this extract is complied with in your organisation.</P>
      <P>2.  In order to ensure equality of treatment for all cases it is essential that all public sector employers pursue a co-ordinated and consistent pay policy.  It would be most unfortunate if the policy were implemented in such a way as to allow a group of workers in one area to benefit from an increase while a similar group in another area with an equally strong case were prevented from doing so.</P>
      <P>3.  Paragraphs 4-8 following indicate how the Budget statement is to be implemented and I would be grateful if you would ensure that they are complied with in so far as your organisation is concerned.</P>
      <P>4.  Where my Department gave approval for pay increases or improvements in conditions before the Budget statement on 21 July 1981 such approvals may be honoured.  If in any case such increases or improvements were not actually offered before the Budget statement, it should be made clear to the staff interests involved that the Department's sanction had in fact been given prior to the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.  It should be noted that it is the Government's intention that a restrictive view should be taken of what constitutes <Col N="2012" /> a firm offer or formal commitment, as referred to in the Minister of Finance's statement.  In this regard, it should be noted that existing links and relationships do not in themselves constitute a formal commitment and should not be so construed.</P>
    <P>6.  The expression &ldquo;cases currently before the Labour Court&rdquo; covers only those claims which were referred to the Labour Court for a recommendation before the Budget statement.  It does not cover claims at the conciliation stage.  In accordance with the established practice, all such Labour Court or Rights Commissioners' recommendations should be referred to my Department for consideration before any offers or commitments are made by your organisation in respect thereof.</P>
    <P>7.  In all cases other than the exceptions mentioned above, it is the intention that claims for pay increases or improvements in conditions on whatever basis they are made should be rejected.  Claims where the merits are weak should be rejected on that basis, with the rider that if they are submitted for adjudication (eg. to the Labour Court or Arbitration) the management side will also invoke the terms of clause 6 of the National Understanding 1980.  Claims with merit should be discussed but no offers should be made nor should management indicate the extent to which it saw merit in the claim. Instead the terms of clause 6 should be invoked at the conciliation stage.  Any alternative arrangement proposed under that clause must take full account of the fact that no further funds will be available to meet the cost of special pay increases. Even if your organisation could in fact meet a claim from its own revenue the terms of clause 6 should still be invoked with management stressing the risk to jobs generally and the damaging effects on the viability of the economy if claims are conceded in the public sector other than the exceptional ones specified in the Budget Statement.</P>
    <P>8.  To ensure that Government pay policy is applied consistently throughout the public sector and to enable the situation to be monitored I should be glad if you would send me as soon as possible <Col N="2013" /> details of claims, if any, extant in your organisation on 21 July 1981 in the form set out in the Appendix to this letter.  If further claims are received after 21 July similar details should be supplied.</P>
    <P>9.  I feel I cannot stress too strongly the need for Government policy on pay to be observed consistently throughout the public sector and I feel sure that I can rely on you to ensure that your organisation complies with Government policy as outlined in the Budget statement and in this letter.  If any doubts arise about the status of a particular claim, offer or commitment or about other aspects of the new pay policy the matter should be referred, in writing, to my Department for consideration.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Yours sincerely,</P>

    <P>I referred earlier to the need for a new approach to pay determination.  An aspect of this matter which must be improved immediately is that of special increases in the public sector.  In addition to pay provisions totalling £1,780 million in the Volume of Estimates, the Budget of January last provided £80 million to cover the cost of any additional improvements in pay and pensions arising in 1981. This provision has already been exceeded and the latest estimates suggest that, if current trends continue unchecked, the cost of public sector pay and pensions could rise by more than 25 per cent this year.  This is unacceptable, both because it would add to the budgetary imbalance and because it would represent a serious inequality at a time when the majority of employees in private sector employments are receiving only the basic terms of the current pay agreement, and some may not even be receiving these.</P>
    <P>Despite the state of the public finances, the Government are prepared to honour <Col N="2014" /> special increases sanctioned to date as well as firm offers or formal commitments which have been made before today, and would be anxious to accept, if at all possible, findings in cases currently before the Labour Court, or before an arbitration board or a review body.  However it is obvious that this is the limit.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, in the case of all other claims, the Government will request public sector employers formally to invoke Clause 6 of the pay terms of the National Understanding.  They will seek immediate negotiations with the public sector unions with a view to agreeing an alternative arrangement which will take account of the community's inability to find the resources to meet further special increases without risk to jobs and the viability of the economy.  My colleague, the Minister for the Public Service, will also invite the public sector unions to discuss the general question to the present methods of determining public sector pay and, in particular, whether the present arrangements for Conciliation and Arbitration should be modified or supplemented.</P>

    <P>Dear Manager</P>
    <P>1.  I attach an extract from the Minister for Finance's Budget statement of 21 July 1981 dealing with public sector pay.  I would ask you to ensure that Government policy on public sector pay as stated in this extract is complied with in relation to the local authorities for which you are the manager.</P>
    <P>2.  In order to ensure equality of treatment for all cases it is essential that all public sector employers pursue <Col N="2015" /> a co-ordinated and consistent pay policy. It would be most unfortunate if the policy were implemented in such a way as to allow a group of workers in one area to benefit from an increase while a similar group in another area with an equally strong case were prevented from doing so.</P>
    <P>3.  The following paragraphs indicate how the Budget statement is to be implemented and I would be grateful if you would ensure that they are complied with in your local authorities.</P>
    <P>4.  Where my Department gave approval for pay increases or improvements in conditions before the Budget statement on 21 July 1981 such approvals may be honoured.  If in any case such increases or improvements were not actually offered before the Budget statement, it should be made clear to the staff interests involved that the Department's sanction had, in fact, been given prior to the Budget.</P>
    <P>5.  It should be noted that it is the Government's intention that a restrictive view should be taken of what constitutes a firm offer or formal commitment, as referred to in the Minister for Finance's statement.  In this regard, it should be noted that existing links and relationships do not in themselves constitute a formal commitment and should not be so construed.</P>
    <P>6.  The expression &ldquo;cases currently before the Labour Court&rdquo; covers only those claims which were referred to the Labour Court for a recommendation before the Budget statement.  It does not cover claims at the conciliation stage.  In accordance with the established practice, all such Labour Court or Rights Commissioners' recommendations should be referred to my Department for consideration before any offers or commitments are made by a local authority in respect thereof.</P>
    <P>7.  It will be noted from the Minister for Finance's statement that in all cases other than the exceptions mentioned above, it is the Government's intention that public sector employers should formally invoke Clause 6 of the pay terms of the National Understanding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2016" /> As you will appreciate, it is essential that the Government's decision in this respect should be fully adhered to in local authorities.  There is, as you know, a standing requirement that no offers or commitments should be made by local authorities in respect of claims without first consulting my Department. In the new situation arising from the Minister for Finance's Statement it is vital that consultation with the Department on any claims received by the authorities under your management should take place as quickly as possible after the claims are received <i>and in any event before local discussions on them begin.</i> It is especially important that arrangements be put into operation immediately in each local authority to ensure full compliance with this requirement.</P>
    <P>8.  To ensure that Government pay policy is applied consistently throughout the public sector and to enable the situation in this respect to be monitored, I would be glad if you would send me as soon as possible details of claims, if any, extant in your local authority on 21 July, 1981 in the form set out in the Appendix to this letter. If further claims are received after 21 July similar details should be supplied.</P>

I feel I cannot stress too strongly the need for Government policy on pay to be observed consistently throughout the public sector and I feel sure that I can rely on you to ensure that Government policy as outlined in the Budget statement and in this letter is complied with.  If any doubts arise about the status of a particular claim, offer or commitment or about other aspects of the new pay policy the matter should be referred, in writing, to my Department for consideration.</P>
    <P>10.  I am also writing to the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board about the implementation of the Government's decision in so far as the Board is concerned.</P>

If the increases or improvements were not offered to claimants before the Budget statement it should be made clear that the offers were approved prior to the Budget.</P>
    <P>5.  Firm offers or formal commitments made before 21 July, 1981 may be honoured. It is the Government's intention that a restrictive view should be taken of what constitutes a firm offer or formal commitment.

    <P>6.  The expression &ldquo;cases currently before the Labour Court&rdquo; covers only those claims which were referred to the Labour Court for a recommendation before the Budget statement.

As the proposed site is 1.9 miles from the existing school the eligibility of some pupils on age-distance grounds may have to be reassessed.  This is not expected to create any difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Officials of my Department have regular confidential consultations, together with officials from other Departments, with the management of State bodies in relation <Col N="2026" /> to the implications for individual bodies of Government policy in the areas affecting their operations.  It would not be appropriate that I should divulge the content of such consultations.  In the wake of the Financial Statement of 21 July 1981, however, general guidelines were issued to State and local bodies in regard to the implementation of the policy on public sector pay announced in the statement.  The text of the letter I sent to the chairman of each State-sponsored body under the aegis of my Department on 7 August 1981 is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Dear Chairman</P>
      <P>1.  I attach an extract from the Minister for Finance's Budget statement of 21 July 1981 dealing with public sector pay.  I would ask you to ensure that Government policy on public sector pay as stated in this extract is complied with in your organisation.</P>
      <P>2.  In order to ensure equality of treatment for all cases it is essential that all public sector employers pursue a co-ordinated and consistent pay policy.  It would be most unfortunate if the policy were implemented in such a way as to allow a group of workers in one area to benefit from an increase while a similar group in another area with an equally strong case were prevented from doing so.</P>
      <P>3.  Paragraphs 4 - 8 following indicate how the Budget statement is to be implemented and I should be grateful if you would ensure that they are complied with so far as your organisation is concerned.</P>
      <P>4.  Where my Department or the Department of the Public Service gave approvals to your organisation to offer pay increases or improvements in conditions before the Budget statement on 21 July 1981 such approvals may be honoured. If the increases or improvements were not offered to claimants before the Budget statement it should be made clear that the offers were approved prior to the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.  Firm offers or formal commitments made before 21 July 1981 may be honoured. It is the Government's intention that a restrictive view should be taken of what constitutes a firm offer or formal <Col N="2027" /> commitment.  In this regard, it should be noted that existing links and relationships do not in themselves constitute a formal commitment and should not be so construed.</P>
    <P>6.  The expression &ldquo;cases currently before the Labour Court&rdquo; covers only those claims which were referred to the Labour Court for a recommendation before the Budget statement.  It does not cover claims at the conciliation stage.  All such Labour Court or Rights Commissioners' recommendations should be referred to my Department for consideration.</P>
    <P>7.  In all cases other than the exceptions mentioned above, claims for pay increases or improvement in conditions on whatever basis they are made should be rejected.  Claims where the merits are weak should be rejected on that basis, with the rider that if they are submitted for adjudication the management side will also invoke the terms of Clause 6 of the National Understanding 1980.  Claims with merit should be discussed but no offers should be made nor should management indicate the extent to which it sees merit in the claim.  Instead the terms of Clause 6 should be invoked at the conciliation stage.  Any alternative arrangement proposed under that clause must take full account of the fact that no further funds will be available to meet the cost of special pay increases.  Even if your organisation could in fact meet the claim from its own revenue the terms of clause 6 should still be invoked with management stressing the risk to jobs generally and the damaging effects on the viability of the economy if claims are conceded in the public sector other than the exceptional ones specified in the Budget statement.</P>
    <P>8.  The Minister for the Public Service in consultation with other Ministers will be concerned to ensure that Government pay policy is applied consistently throughout the public sector.  To enable him to monitor the situation I should be glad if you would send me as soon as possible details of claims extant in your organisations on 21 July 1981 in the form <Col N="2028" /> set out in the Appendix to this letter.  If further claims are received after 21 July similar details should be supplied.</P>
    <P>I feel I cannot stress too strongly the need for Government policy on pay to be observed consistently throughout the public sector and I feel sure that I can rely on you and your Board/Council to ensure that your organisation complies with Government policy as outlined in the Budget statement and in this letter. If any doubts arise about the status of a particular claim, offer or commitment or about other aspects of the new pay policy the matter should be referred, in writing, to my Department for consideration.</P>
    <P>I would be glad if you would have the contents of this letter brought to the attention of the Board/Council at its next meeting.</P>
    <P>Copies of this letter and enclosures are being sent to your Chief Executive.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely</P>
