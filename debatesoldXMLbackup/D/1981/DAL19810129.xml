      <P>I indicated yesterday that I would seek your permission, Sir, to ask the Taoiseach if he would make a statement in this House in the coming week regarding our membership of the EMS and the statement by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer that Britain is giving serious consideration to joining the EMS, and to ask what, in the Government's opinion, would be the situation for this country and what would be the consequential effects on our economy?</P>

      <P>The fact that discussions are taking place does not exonerate you, Sir, from impartiality and fairness towards every Member of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I became Ceann Comhairle my main objective has been to be fair to every Member of this House.  I did not promise yesterday to reconsider my ruling but, in deference to the Deputy's request, I did think about it.  I have been studying Standing Orders and Procedures since I became Ceann Comhairle to ensure that I administered the rules as laid down by the House while at the same time being as flexible as I can and, above all, being fair and just to every Deputy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cluskey, Deputy FitzGerald and others on occasion claimed that there is a long-standing precedent on the Order of Business for questions on matters which have no relevance to the business of the day to be permitted and that I am curtailing the rights of Members by curbing the asking of such questions.  Let me point out the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Standing Order No. 25 provides that the Taoiseach announces the Order of Business in which Government business is taken each day.  There is no motion before the House and there is no room for debate.  Over the years the Chair has permitted questions to be asked about the business for the day, about the taking of other business on the Order Paper, and about the taking of business that has been promised, and which therefore can be anticipated, and about arrangements for sittings.  There is no doubt the Chair has on occasion failed to curb an irrelevant <Col N="542" /> question or questions.  As I said to Deputy FitzGerald, I have been guilty of such lapses.  For example, there have been occasions when such questions have not only been asked but have been answered, but I do not accept that these oversights on the part of the Chair can be elevated to a practice or a precedent.</P>
    <P>I have already made my position clear on many occasions, that the only questions permitted on the Order of Business must relate to the business of the House, such as clarifying the position about the day's business, questions asking what other business will be taken, when Bills or other documents needed in the House will be circulated, and sitting arrangements. I have said all this before.  Questions on the Order of Business which are not relevant constitute a general instant Question Time.  I have previously stated here that the Chair cannot agree to this. In taking this particular course, which I regard as logical, I am simply upholding the rulings of my predecessor and I will quote from Volume 318, Column 1515&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Chair cannot and will not accept matters being raised on the Order of Business which are not relevant.  If this gets out of hand, we could have any Deputy getting up raising any matter he thinks of, that is not permissible.</P>
    <P>I must uphold this ruling and continue to implement the Standing Orders and practice.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for taking up the time of the House but I will elaborate briefly.  The Standing Orders of the House lay down rules as to the content of questions and also stipulate the notice that is necessary, for example, three days' notice in the ordinary case but at shorter notice for questions of urgent public importance of which the Ceann Comhairle is the judge. The Ceann Comhairle, therefore, sees and rules on every question before it is asked and the relevant Minister and the Department have notice of each question. I hold that the question which was addressed to the Taoiseach yesterday and the question which was again addressed to the Taoiseach today, if in order, would come within the ambit of either one or other of these types of parliamentary <Col N="543" /> questions.  The claim being made over a period is that questions on any subject can be asked on the Order of Business without prior submission to the Ceann Comhairle and without the relevant Minister or Department involved seeing it. This, in effect, means the transfer of the Powers and functions of the Ceann Comhairle to each Deputy in the House because, if this were the situation, each Deputy would, in effect, then be deciding that his question was in order.  He would be deciding that it was the responsibility of the Minister selected by him to answer it.  He would be deciding that it was not a repeat question.  He would be deciding it was not <i>sub judice</i> and so on.  It must be obvious to every Member that, if such a practice were to be permitted in the handling of parliamentary questions, the present orders system would be destroyed and we would have chaos.  The issue is fundamental to the proper functioning of the parliamentary system.  I sincerely hope Deputy Cluskey will accept my good faith and will appreciate the reasons why I cannot allow his question at this time.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat what I said before.  If the House, in its wisdom, decides on changes, I will faithfully carry out and put into effect whatever these changes may be.  When I suggested yesterday that the matter could be discussed by the Whips, it was in the context that I believed that discussions would be taking place on the whole matter of procedure generally.  It is open to Deputy Cluskey or, to any other Deputy, to raise this matter at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or through the Whips. Deputies will accept that if we have a situation where a Deputy can ask a question which he decides is important, without any reference to the Ceann Comhairle, to the Department or the Minister concerned, the Deputy would be assuming the responsibility and the rights and duties of the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>You have stated what the criteria, in your opinion, was for questions to be asked in the House.  I agree with most of what you said.  If a question <Col N="544" /> is <i>sub judice</i>, it must be ruled out.  If a question is irrelevant, it should be ruled out.  This party has, at all times, upheld the rulings of the Chair.  You also stated that what was permissible and what came within Standing Orders was the Business in the House on that day or business that would be ordered.  I asked yesterday that the Taoiseach, not yesterday or even today, but some time in the coming week, would make a statement in the House on a matter which could vitally affect the whole economy.  I see no justification whatsoever for the ruling out of that question.  Furthermore, you should be aware that Members want to see the business of the House conducted in a proper manner.  That will be the position as long as there is fairness and impartiality from the Chair, as far as, this party is concerned. In order to conduct the business of the House, like any other democratic institution, you must have the full co-operation of all the Members in the House.  Do not put that co-operation in jeopardy by a ruling which is merely against all precedents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly want to have the co-operation of every Member in the House but I do not see any reason why that question, if it was in order, could not be put down to the Taoiseach asking for the very thing the Deputy has raised on the Order of Business. I cannot allow a debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want in any way to reflect on the Chair's impartiality. The Chair has shown himself to be impartial since he took office.  He has simply, in this instance, misdirected himself in good faith.  Your own statement Sir, listed first of all what Standing Orders said.  You then went on to say that there are four or five things which you have allowed and you propose to continue to allow, which are not specified in Standing Orders but which, nonetheless because of precedent, you intend to continue to allow.  You then pick on one item that is, not general questions of any kind but specifically questions to the Taoiseach or Ministers as to whether they will make a statement on some subject or introduce <Col N="545" /> legislation on some subject, which has always been allowed.  You picked that item and you decide you will not follow precedent in that case.  It is that attempt to distinguish between the first four or five items which you are going to continue to allow and this one, which has no greater authority for that precedent, which you are not going to allow.  It is to that we take exception.  I suggest you further consider the matter in the light of that and that you should allow questions but stringently confine them, as it is proper to do, to questions relating to the future business of the House.  That is all we are asking, that on the Order of Business one is entitled to ask the Taoiseach if he will make a statement, to ask a Minister if he intends to introduce legislation and that you would rule out any other irrelevant matter, as you are entitled to do.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1981. - Financial Resolution No. 9: General (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That it is expendient to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise) and to make further provision in connection with finance.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(The Taoiseach.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to recall any budget that has been received with such universal criticism.  Of course, some of this criticism comes from interested parties, and must to that extent be partially discounted.  But what is unique on this occasion is the combination of attacks by those directly and adversely affected in particular ways with criticisms by neutral observers concerned only for the economy and for truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's business page headlines in the <Col N="546" /> papers tell their own story.  I will read the headlines from one paper. &ldquo;Fitzgerald adds to cost burden of industry&rdquo;, &ldquo;Further pressure applied to company liquidity&rdquo;, &ldquo;Omissions will seriously damage corporate sector&rdquo;, &ldquo;Expansionist budget will worsen balance of payments deficit&rdquo;, &ldquo;Gilts need new direction, not a neutral budget&rdquo;, &ldquo;Six long years of borrowing&rdquo;, &ldquo;State borrowing target unlikely to be accurate&rdquo;, &ldquo;Figures show financial disorder&rdquo;. Those are the headlines in one newspaper on the business pages, the assessment of people who have no vested interest in particular benefits, but who are there to comment impartially, on what the Minister said in his speech for an hour and three quarters yesterday.  Perhaps, in present circumstances, a budget that would have pleased the different interests in the community would have been bound to attract adverse comment from concerned and objective observers. Equally, a budget that pleased those concerned with our economic fortunes, might have been expected to have aroused hostility amongst different groups whose interests would have been hit by measures designed to get our finances in order.  But to manage to please nobody has required a unique kind of blundering which only a Government that had totally lost its nerve, and its sense of judgment, could be expected to engage in.</P>
    <P>The farming community are, justifiably in my view, incensed that so little attention has been paid to their plight.  If their income were to have retained in 1981 its 1978 purchasing power it would need to have been of the order of £1,450 million.  In fact farmers' income this year is now estimated by the Economic and Social Research Institute at £815 million, a shortfall of no less than £635 million or 45 per cent.  Of course one has to face the fact that no Government could attempt to effect a transfer of income of anything like this order of magnitude between different sections of the community.  It was inevitable that, under present circumstances, farmers should suffer some loss of income, have to tighten their belts and any politician who told them otherwise would be misleading them grossly.  But <Col N="547" /> equally any Government concerned not alone with the hardship that important groups are at present suffering but also with the survival and future development of the agricultural industry in Ireland would have made a serious attempt to alleviate these difficulties in ways that would help to halt the destruction of our breeding hered and the erosion of the productive capacity of our land.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael put forward a package of measures with this in mind.  It is not, of course, the only possible package of such measures; one could think of others, but it was designed as a serious contribution towards alleviating the problem.  The Government, bereft of any ideas of their own, and clearly still quite incapable of grasping the seriousness of the farming crisis, have contented themselves with taking several of these proposals and implementing each of them only partially. The abolition of rates which we proposed becomes an alleviation of rates. The abolition of bovine TB eradication levies becomes a temporary remission of these for this year.  Our stock relief proposal is turned into something different and much less valuable in terms of operating as an incentive to retain the breeding herd.</P>
    <P>As for our other three proposals, the Government have ignored these altogether. Thus the resource tax for 1980, of which £250,000 only was actually paid during that year, has not been remitted as we proposed.  Stamp duty relief to apply for three years to transfers of land to younger farmers, which would have cost virtually nothing in loss of duty as so few such transfers at present occur and which could have been an important incentive to such transfers, is ignored as is the vitally important proposal for interest relief.  All these are equally swept to one side.  The last, I think, is of great importance.  I must say I am extremely surprised that the Government should have omitted any reference to it or any attempt to assist in this particular area where the dangers are so great for farmers who are now at risk in regard to holding on to their farms.</P>
    <P>When one sees in the papers news of <Col N="548" /> farmers being forced to sell out in specific cases one can see how grave is the situation. What is interesting is that, in all this, the Government have not a single idea of their own to contribute as to what might be done to help farmers in their plight.  All they have done is take three of our six, emasculate them, and ingore the other three.  The only thing they have produced on their own account is an announcement their they do not intend to abolish the two tax payment dates and to revet to a single payment date.  I doubt if a single farmer was aware that it had ever been proposed to revert to the single date, and the idea that by not doing so they are being given £5 million by the Government is not likely to impress them.  The Government might as well have told them they were giving them £100 million or £200 million by not taxing them this much extra.  It looks as if the Government themselves are simply not prepared to face the farm crisis but are content to hope that Brussels will bail out the Irish farmers.  I doubt if Brussels will be much impressed.  Brussels is more likely, like God, to help those who show some sings of helping themselves within the EEC rules, as it is open to our Government to do and as the French Government, for example, have been doing.  If the Irish Government so clearly believe that Irish farmers need no serious help why should Brussels bother with this problem?  Yet that is precisely the atmosphere that has been created by the Government by their inaction.  The danger is now great that any attempt by the Minister, Deputy MacSharry to impress the new Commissioner, Poul Dalsager, will fail because his answer will be simple: if you really think your farmers are in trouble why have you done nothing about it yourselves within your own limits, within what is open to you and possible for you without breaking EEC rules?  There is no answer to that if it is put to the Minister by the Commissioner.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the PAYE sector.  Their claims to greater equity have been swept aside with contempt.  For the second year running after a 37 per cent rise in the cost of living in these two years, there is to be no increase whatever in the Personal <Col N="549" /> Allowances.  This fact was last year masked to a degree for the PAYE taxpayer by the introduction for the first time of the special PAYE allowance, and relatively little comment, therefore, was directed last year to the failure to increase the Personal Allowance.  For the second year running they have been left where they were despite the fact that the cost of living has increased by three-eighths in that period.  Moreover one only of the tax bands is to be adjusted to allow for inflation. This helps only married couples with more than £12,800 a year, or single people with over £6,700.  They represent a fairly small minority, of taxpayers.  The vast majority, something of the order of 85 per cent, 90 per cent at a guess &mdash; I have not had time to do the calculations &mdash; are given no assistance.  The rest can throw their hats at any element of indexation relief this year.  What is the effect of this?  Tax savings of £50, to £70 for married taxpayers with children between approximately £4,500 and £10,000 a year, with no savings at all for married couples without children in the commonest income range of £3,000 to £6,000 annually.  Incidentally as the indirect tax increases in the budget involve at the very least a 2 per cent increase in the cost of living &mdash; and I am putting it at its lowest; I think it would come out nearer to 3 per cent, but taking it even at 2 per cent &mdash; even the taxpayers who save £50 to £70 will all be worse off.  Thus a married man with children earning say, £7,000 a year will save £70 in income tax but he will have to pay at least £140 more in indirect taxes, losting a net £70 on the deal.  This is certainly treating the PAYE taxpayers with contempt, they know it and they have already shown that they know it.  At a time when we need greater national cohesion the Government have thus incensed both of the two main groups of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I come now to the business sector.  At the same time as the Government have acted in this divisive way they have inflicted a penal blow on businesses. After much toing and froing between the CII and Government &mdash; well publicised by the latter &mdash; all that has emerged is that businessmen must, in 1981, pay one <Col N="550" /> and a half year's tax within a single year to bolster up the faltering finances of the State for this single year.  The impact on the liquidity of many firms already in difficulties can readily be imagined. When they had, not unreasonably, been seeking some relief &mdash; even if they probably knew in their hearts that they could not get much relief in such a difficult year &mdash; they must be fairly sore at what represents a total incomprehension of their problems on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>What return do all these measures yield apart from disillusionment in so many important sectors of the community? What great progress has all this yielded towards the goal, extolled by the Taoiseach and his Ministers earlier this year, even as recently as August last &mdash; as I shall have occasion to point out in a few moments &mdash; of financial stability? How much nearer are we to reducing borrowing from last year's 14½ per cent of national output?  How much nearer are we to reducing the massive deficit in the current budget?  After all this tranuma we are precisely nowhere in respect of these two crucial issues.  Borrowing is actually higher at 15 per cent.  Do not let us be fooled by this talk of privatisation, on which I want to dwell for a few moments because there has been a lot of deliberate obfuscation of this issue and I, think we ought to try and get to the truth of it.  I am not against provatisation.  Indeed in the adjournment debate last year, in a speech prepared and made available to the Press before I had seen the Taoiseach's own speech on the matter, I incorporated the same idea.  Obviously there are some advantages in seeking private financial participation in projects that have hitherto been financed solely by the State.</P>
    <P>I would favour &mdash; and this is true of my party &mdash; the involvement of the private sector on a minority basis in public enterprises. Private entrepreneurship might bring new skills to bear on the problems facing some of these bodies, and the raising of future capital in partnership between the private and public sectors could offer an assurance against the State bodies getting <Col N="551" /> preferential treatment with respect to capital.  This would thus remove the only valid inhibition to their being allowed to compete freely with private firms in the domestic market because one of the things that, ever since the days when Séan Lemass as Taoiseach tried to make these companies and indeed Government Departments into development corporations, has held up progress in this respect is the inhibitions that exist in the public sector on competition with the private sector for the reason that the private sector holds that the public sector gets its capital not only easily but often literally free and that therefore competition between a public firm and a private firm would be unfair.  That is a fair point and it must be taken into account.  But if in fact the public firms were to raise their capital on the market through rights issues in which the subscription by the Government were to be determined by the amount that the minority private interests were prepared to put up then because their capital was raised in the same way that argument against free competition would disappear.  This country could do with free competition between public and private enterprise on fair and equal terms.  It could do with the release of the entrepreneurship that exists in these bodies of which I had personal experience in the first 12 years of my working life in Aer Lingus and which, despite the strictures on them from the opposite benches, some of which in one or two cases are certainly deserved, nonetheless contain considerable capacity for entrepreneurship which could be released in this way.</P>
    <P>But private shareholding in State companies is one thing, and the kind of privatisation now proposed by a Government desperate to appear to reduce their rate of borrowing is quite another.  Let us analyse in a little detail what this idea, as now being put forward by Fianna Fáil involves.</P>
    <P>First of all, as one powerful repressentative of the private sector said yesterday, this sector will not be content to get involved in providing capital through privatisation merely on a basis of getting the same return as from gilts &mdash; at present <Col N="552" /> just over 16 per cent.  So the capital to be provided in place of fixed interest bearing stock, which is no longer to be described as borrowing, is apparently going to cost us, the taxpayers, more than straight borrowing. I see what the private sector gets out of this, but I do not see what the taxpayer gets out of it, except for the dubious privilege of paying more for the money needed to finance public services. This point needs to be answered and I hope it will be in the debate before we proceed any further along this path.</P>
    <P>A second new form of privatisation is the extension of the privilege of an initial allowance of 50 per cent for investment in industrial buildings to industrial buildings leased to a State-sponsored industrial promotion agency, such as the IDA which then sub-leases them to individual companies.  Here the private investor, who at present is given this initial allowance to encourage him to take the risks involved in investing in industrial buildings that may or may not be let, and let profitably, is to be given the same benefit in relation to a totally secure investment with the IDA.  This seems to go well beyond what is necessary in order to get private interests to take over part or all of the industrial building programme &mdash; something, incidentally, which I am very keen to see happening, as I regard it as a waste of State capital to have it invested by the IDA in buildings instead of on grants, when these buildings could be provided by the private sector &mdash; but perhaps on somewhat less generous terms than are now proposed.  The last report I looked at involved the diversion of £43 million into buildings which could have been financed by the private sector.</P>
    <P>A third example of privatisation carried to extreme lengths is the proposed new special allowance of 100 per cent in respect of expenditure commenced after 28 January on the construction of moderate-cost rented residential accommodation, with consideration also for an appropriate incentive to involve the private sector in the provision of multi-storey car parks and toll roads and bridges. The idea involved here is excellent, and I support it in principle.  But let us reflect on just what the Government are offering. <Col N="553" /> They are saying to a man who builds a block of flats, or a group of houses for rental, costing, say, £30,000 each, and rented at say, £3,000 each, that he can receive this rent free of all tax for a period of ten years.  Do we really need to go so far to get people to make this kind of investment?</P>
    <P>Is this, and some of the other privatisation proposals, not very reminiscent of the 20-year tax remission on mining profits accorded, if I remember correctly, by the present Taoiseach as Minister for Finance to mining companies, at a time when they would have settled happily &mdash; as director's of one of the world's largest mining concerns told me themselves in the Shelbourne ten years or so ago &mdash; for a five-year remission?  They got four times as much as they expected.</P>
    <P>We, in Government, had to go through the unpleasant experience of revoking that grossly over-generous concession, at some cost to our credit as a country, because the concession was totally unjustified. I do not want to find myself in the same position again.  I believe that this House should look very carefully and closely indeed at any privatisation proposals put forward by this Government on terms that appear unduly generous and, when the time comes, if the Government force through with their majority proposals which seem to us contrary to the interests of the taxpayers of this country, this party will have to decide whether we may not have to serve notice on those concerned that these concessions might have to be revoked in favour of equitable and adequate incentives when the Government changes.</P>
    <P>I merely mention this by way of preliminary warning at this stage because I feel it is essential that a full and informed discussion takes place on this whole question of privatisation before we launch into selling off parts of the public domain at a bargain price, just in order to be able to claim on the face of it a nominal reduction in what would remain a grossly excessive level of Government borrowing, or fund-raising of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>The budget presents borrowing net of these presumed contributions from the <Col N="554" /> private sector through other channels and in other forms.  The capital programme is more honest in stating in the main text the full sum to be raised &ldquo;from other Exchequer sources&rdquo;, and adding in a footnote the fact that this total includes the £200 million to be provided, hopefully, as a result of these privatisation measures.</P>
    <P>Even this, of course, is not entirely honest, because when one reads the text of the capital programme one finds that this proposal is still at the stage where there are no commitments, so that it is not possible at this stage to make specific deductions from borrowing for particular investments in respect of private sector funded projects.  Today's papers tell us that in fact only £40 million to £50 million is likely to be available from the private sector.  If this is correct &mdash; and it is said with some authority by commentators who are well informed&mdash;then quite apart from the merits of the privatisation proposals the likelihood of their contributing £200 million is limited and we have to look for another £150 million borrowing over and above that to which the Government are admitting.</P>
    <P>So we must face the fact that no real reduction in borrowing has been achieved, and that the sums the Government have to raise to finance their capital programme represent a percentage of GNP not far off twice the 8 per cent target of the Fianna Fáil manifesto.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the current budget outturn.  There was remarkable fiddling of figures yesterday which left many people under the delusion that there was a reduction in this budget in the current budget deficit by comparison both with that of last year and that projected in the Estimates of receipts and expenditure.  I want to show that this is fallacious and a piece of financial juggling like so much else in the budget.  At the end of all the steps that have been referred to earlier, which increase the total tax burden on the ordinary income earner, which give the farmers nothing of any substance to help them with their problems and which require businessmen to pay one-and-a-half years' tax in one year, the current deficit is apparently &mdash;<Col N="555" /> and I stress the word &ldquo;apparently&rdquo;&mdash; reduced from last years' £547 million to £515 million, a reduction of £31 million or 5½ per cent.</P>
    <P>But this is not the full picture.  It is the picture for the calendar year 1981.  To get the true picture we must look to see what the effects of this budget would be, in a full year.  Let me list the additional costs, or revenue losses, involved in a full year as against the calendar year 1981.  If my estimates are incorrect, no doubt the Taoiseach or some other speaker will put me right in due course.  The social welfare increase of £111 million for nine months of 1981 would be £148 million in a full year, an increase of £37 million.  The income tax concessions of £61 million would cost £91 million in a full year &mdash; an extra £30 million.  The corporation tax additional yield of £66 million is, of course, a once-off benefit, which would not accrue again in a later year.  The Post Office arrears of £41 million from 1980 to 1981 &mdash; a highly dubious figure in any event, after a year in which expected Post Office arrears of £100 million turned out to be only £33 million is also non-recurrent. Between these four items the 1982 position on current account will be £174 million worse than that shown for 1981.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, in fairness it must be said that if the agricultural disease levy were to be restored as the Government appear to threaten, this would yield an extra £9½ million in 1982; indirect taxes would yield an extra £13 million and Post Office charges assuming the new higher charges become effective in May, would yield an extra £15 million in a full year &mdash; a total additional revenue in a full year of £37½ million.  Thus the net difference between the out-turn of 1981 and of a full year incorporating all the changes proposed in this budget, and no others, would involve a current deficit position £136½ million worse than that shown for 1981 in this budget, namely a current deficit of £651½ million.</P>
    <P>It is very important that this fact should be grasped.  The budget as presented &mdash; whatever about the quality of the prose, or the logic of the structure of its presentation, its arithmetic is ingenious &mdash; is <Col N="556" /> designed to give the impression that the Government are getting the current deficit down, not perhaps by much, but by something.  In fact it is raising the annual rate of current deficit from £547 million last year to £651½ million in 1982, namely by £104½ million, or by 19 per cent.  This means that the current deficit is being raised, and not reduced, to a higher level as a percentage of GNP, which even on the Government's own account will not increase this year by as much as 19 per cent in money terms.  I would particularly urge that the media take note of this point which is fundamental to an understanding of this deliberately complex and confusing document.</P>
    <P>So much for the general outline of the budget.  The speech itself is so shapeless and badly drafted that one is forced to reconstruct this pattern from the disjointed bits and pieces of material it contains. The Minister was displayed on television yesterday claiming personal credit for the document; I wonder if he was wise to do so in view of its exceptional incoherence and its remarkably misleading character.</P>
    <P>Already commentators and politicians are speculating as to the reason for such an incoherent and shapeless budget, achieving so little when so much needs to be done.  The Government Deputies are as puzzled as anyone else and clearly do not relish having to take it back to their constituencies tonight to explain it to their Cumainn.  They know they cannot sell it as offering any goodies that any reasonably intelligent person could conceive to be so; nor can they make any claim that it is a step towards putting right the mess into which our public finances have been falling after three-and-a-half years of Fianna Fáil rule.  They are, as we saw last night, a pretty demoralised bunch, all the more so because of the build-up that the Taoiseach's PR team gave to the budget for weeks beforehand, as a weapon with which to win an election.</P>
    <P>So far I have taken the budget at its face value.  This is being charitable. Clearly it gives something less than a full and true picture of the likely costs of government in the 12 months ahead.  Last <Col N="557" /> night on television three independent commentators were asked for their views on this aspect, and while one was somewhat less critical of the budget than the other two, all of them were agreed that expenditure would in the event turn out &mdash; as in the past two years &mdash; well ahead of the budgeted figures.</P>
    <P>In this House yesterday Deputy Bruton ably and entertainingly displayed some of the absurdities of the Book of Estimates &mdash; the Departments which were going to stop posting letters and making telephone calls &mdash; for example, the Revenue Commissioners, whose activities in this respect are to be cut back by 60 per cent in a year in which those Post Office charges are to be raised by somewhere between 17 per cent and 25 per cent, the other Departments which are going to stop travelling like Foreign Affairs whose travel vote is cut by £600,000 or almost 30 per cent in a year when travel costs will certainly rise by 15 per cent.  Deputy Bruton, also referred to the remarkable economies in Naval and Army stores that are envisaged.  One is left to wonder how many Army vehicles, Naval vessels and Air Corps aircraft will still be operational on 31 December next if all these cuts involving reductions of over two thirds are actually made.</P>
    <P>There are many other oddities in these Estimates to be teased out in due course &mdash; the two-thirds cut projected in compensation for malicious injuries, referred to also by Deputy Bruton, and the 30 per cent reduction in spending on farm modernisation schemes &mdash; one must hope for the country's sake that this is a misleading figure and that the Government do not seriously contemplate such a reduction in this area &mdash; the halving of support for agricultural schools and farms; the remarkably optimistic and totally unexplained assumption that CIE's losses will fall by £5 million, and the halving of grants for harbours.</P>
    <P>Then there are the extraordinary increases upon which the Government are counting, in appropriations-in-aid &mdash; revenue accuring to Departments from remunerative activities of one kind or another.  These are often overlooked in the Book of Estimates.  In eight Departments <Col N="558" /> alone &mdash; excluding the special case of the Post Office &mdash; increases in revenue of this kind are calculated at £46.2 million, a rise of almost 30 per cent, or double the rate of inflation expected. Does this mean that these Departments are going to increase their charges for services by twice as much as the general inflation rate, and just what will this do to the cost of living on top of the open increases in the budget?</P>
    <P>These are all questions raised by what must surely be &mdash; even including last years's &mdash; the oddest and most unconvincing, Book of Estimates ever to come before this House.  No wonder one comementator last night expressed the view that the actual outcome of 1981 in terms of current expenditure would be, £115 million more than shown in this remarkable volume of fiction.</P>
    <P>It is not only here in this Book of Estimates that we come across non-credible figuring by the Government in their preparations for this budget.  Let us look for a moment at the document distributed just before the budget, the &ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget&rdquo;.  This document tells us that although the volume of expenditure by the public authorities on goods and services showed an increase of just 2 per cent over 1979, &ldquo;expenditure increases significantly, largely because of the cost of pay in the public sector&rdquo;.  How true.  This pay increase in 1980 was no less than 35 per cent or almost double the increase in the cost of living.  In a year in which the numbers in the public service seem to have risen about 2½ per cent, this means an average increase in pay <i>per capita</i> of about 32½ per cent.  With consumer prices up 18½ per cent, this meant an average increse in living standards for public servants of about 12 per cent.  By contrast the increase in pay per head in manufacturing in 1980 is estimated by the ESRI at 18 per cent, implying an average drop of ½ per cent in living standards for those working in industry.  For farmers, incomes last year were static in current money terms, leaving them with an 18½ per cent drop in living standards, on top of a similar decline in the previous year.</P>
    <P>This contrast between the patterns in growth and decline of living standards for <Col N="559" /> those three categories raises questions of equity that cannot indefinitely be ignored especially as there is no sign of any change in this pattern.  In their pre&mdash;budget estimates, having provided for increases of £225 million or 14½ per cent in public service pay in 1981, which just matches the likely increase in inflation, the Minister then went on in his budget speech, first, to hope, then earnestly ask, public servants to consider seriously in the national interest the pressing of special pay claims on top of the national understanding.  Leaving aside the oddity of this language from a member of a body called a Government who are put there to govern, the value of these pleadings is then totally undermined by the announcement to the group who are being asked not to look for more money over and above the national understanding that the Government are setting aside a tidy £80 million extra to pay them the money the Government hope they will not look for.</P>
    <P>When one recalls that last year the Government set aside £100 million in not dissimilar circumstances and then paid out £180 million, one cannot be too optimistic that this £80 million provided this year, and more besides, will not be drawn on.  If the figure were kept to £80 million this would involve a 19 per cent increase in public service pay, which, with an anticipated increase of 1 per cent in numbers, implies an average rise of 18 per cent per person, that is a 3 per cent increase in average living standards.  By contrast, workers in the private sector are apparently expected to abide by the national understanding and to take 13 per cent, involving a drop of 2 per cent in living standards and farmers are forecast, for the third successive year, to have their living standards cut by a further 13 per cent, with a 2 per cent increase in income and a 15 per cent inflation rate.</P>
    <P>This disparity, increasing year after year, between the purchasing power of wages of public servants, who have security and pay-related pensions and of other non-agricultural workers, with no security and only very partial and generally not pay-related pensions, and that of <Col N="560" /> farmers, with no security against their farms being taken over tor non-payment of debt and no pensions at all, is difficult to defend and is a growing source of divisions within the community of which we, as politicians, must be aware.  I shall pursue the matter no further at this stage but I would not be doing my duty if I did not draw attention to these disparities.</P>
    <P>The next point in this document &ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget&rdquo; to which I wish to draw attention is its paragraph on the balance of payments.  This paragraph states, rather blandly, that the data available implies a net capital inflow of £1.120 million.  This sounds rather good on the face of it &mdash; people pouring money into the country as a good place to invest.  The reality is somewhat different. Just half of this is accounted for by Government borrowing of £564 million. While no figures have been published beyond September for the external borrowings of State bodies, judging by the fact that in the first nine months of the year they had borrowed abroad no less than £307 million &mdash; almost two-thirds of all their foreign borrowings since the foundation of the State &mdash; it seems likely that the figure for the year as a whole must have been in the region of £400 million, or a total of over £950 million borrowed by the State abroad in one form or another.  This leaves no more than £170 million net coming in by other means, including, of course, direct investment in new industries here.  This is not such a cheerful picture as appeared at first sight; and it becomes even less cheerful when one realises that, if the Government and the State bodies had not borrowed abroad something in the regions of £950 million, our official external reserves, instead of rising by £370 million from £97 million to £1,345 million would have fallen to a mere £400 million &mdash; less than what we would need to cover one months imports.</P>
    <P>The simple truth is that our external deficit is now so large and is at present rising rapidly, forecast to rise from £750 million to £900 million this year &mdash; I suspect there will be another estimate &mdash; that we are forced to borrow abroad on a massive scale, even if there are <Col N="561" /> resources at home for this purpose which could be used at lower cost, just to keep our external reserves from disappearing within 18 months, as they would disappear if we did not borrow abroad and kept the present rate of external deficit. This is quite simply a path towards disaster and we do ourselves no service by hiding the fact.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to make about this publication &ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget&rdquo; is that it is misleading with respect to the impact of the 1980 Budget indirect tax increases on consumer prices.  At the time of the budget it was officially stated that the effect on the consumer price index of the budget indirect tax increase was 3.8 per cent, and, while I contest this figure because I believe that the underweighting of items like petrol in the official index tends to understate the true impact of indirect tax increases on the cost of living, I feel that the Government should at least be consistent with themselves and not try to fob us off in this document with the misleading statement that the effect of the 1980 budget on consumer prices was 3 per cent rather than 3.8 per cent, almost a quarter lower than the figure officially published at the time by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>More serious, however, is what this document has to say about employment during 1980.  It estimates that during that year there was little or no change in the 1979 level of employment &ldquo;an increase in services employment being offset by a decline in agricultural and industrial employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to give any credit to this statement.  In the national understanding, published only in August last, the Government estimated that the increase in the labour force was 5-10,000 a year.  The Economic and Social Research Institute in their current Quarterly Bulletin provide figures indicating a 10,000 increase in the labour force between April 1980 and April 1981, substantially confirming the Government's national understanding statement on this point.  If the labour force is rising by 10,000 and unemployment is static, how could unemployment then have risen by <Col N="562" /> 34,000 in the last 12 months?  The answer of course is that the statement about there being little or no change in employment in 1980 is quite unsustainable, to use polite language in this House.  It is clear that there must have been a fall of over 20,000 in employment in the last 12 months or so.  Otherwise, with a 10,000 increase in the labour force, one could not have had a 34,000 increase in unemployment. This is confirmed by the Economic and Social Research Bulletin, which estimates a drop of 21,000 in employment between April 1980 and April 1981, the dates officially used for employment comparisons, rather than calendar years.  This involves a drop of 7,000 in industrial employment, and of 11,000 in the number engaged in services, which the Government document claims actually rose in 1980.</P>
    <P>There is a limit to the extent to which documents printed and published over the authority of the Government and traditionally subject to scrutiny by the public service that they do not contain gross misstatements of fact &mdash; in our time that scrutiny was insisted on and accepted by us &mdash; can be allowed to become totally misleading.  I can recall, as a Minister, with other Ministers discussing with civil servants this point, employment forecasts and employment estimates and putting the point to the civil servants: did they not think that there was a case that the level of employment in, perhaps, construction, was 1,000 or 2,000 higher than they thought?  We argued the case and, when they showed that the optimistic figure I was thinking of was incorrect, we accepted it.  We accepted that a figure in a document published on the authority of the Government must have been one which could be stood over, that it represented a view which was solidly based and which the civil servants themselves accepted.  In an argument civil servants win, and that is the end of the matter. You do not fake the figure.  Has that all changed?</P>
    <P>How could a Government document come out talking about an increase in employment in the services sector when it is clear that actually there was a fall of <Col N="563" /> 11,000 in that very sector, offset by 2,000 more being employed in the public sector? I should point out incidentally, that this 21,000 drop in employment in the 12 months ending in April next means that the whole of the gain in employment in industry and in services made between April 1979 and April 1980 will have been lost.</P>
    <P>These facts should not be hidden by statements in official publications which have the effect of obscuring the truth, to use polite language.  At present we are being faced with a barrage of misleading information from Government sources on every aspect of our economy, designed to cover up the appalling reality until the Government can find a convenient moment to go to the country without, they hope, their sins finding them out beforehand.  Our job is to find out their sins and display them.  That is what we are here for.  Our only trouble is that there are so many sins that it is hard to track them all down, but we will keep after them and get most of them into the public eye before the election.</P>
    <P>It is one of the tasks of the Opposition to counter this kind of activity although in this country in the past no Opposition have ever had to encounter such a mass of misleading information in official publications, as distinct from Government speeches which, traditionally, coming from the other side of the House have not been entirely accurate, publications which in the past have been accepted as repositories of objective truth.  It is vital to this State that they should continue to be so accepted and that, whatever is being done with them now, when we have a change of Government they will be so accepted again, and the public can again trust documents published over the imprint of the State.</P>
    <P>This whole campaign is orchestrated by the Government led by the Taoiseach. An example of his methods is provided by his Ennis speech on 17 August last.  I shall take four statements from that speech and compare them with the truth as now disclosed.  First he said:</P>
    <P>The Budget we introduced checked <Col N="564" /> the excessive growth of public expenditure which we could not afford.</P>
    <P>The fact is that current expenditure had risen by £501 million, or 21 per cent, in 1978, Deputy Lynch's last year as Taoiseach. This is the excessive growth of public expenditure which the new Taoiseach was to check.  In his first year it has risen by £797 million, or 27 per cent.</P>
    <P>Secondly the Taoiseach told the people of Ennis who, no doubt, were enthralled by all this:</P>
    <P>The Budget we introduced achieved much greater equity in the tax system.</P>
    <P>What are the facts?  The facts are that last year's budget had the effect that taxpayers with incomes under £10,000 a year, and with average patterns of expenditure, were left worse off.  Those with more than that income were left better off and a man with £50,000 a year, by taking appropriate measures under that budget, could improve his net after tax income by a cool £10,000.  That is what the Taoiseach called introducing much greater equity in the tax system.  To the Taoiseach equity means the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.  The word has no other meaning for this man.</P>
    <P>Thirdly he said:</P>
    <P>The general financial strategy of the Budget has been successful.  The financial targets set have been generally adhered to.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the current budget deficit exceeded that provided for in the budget by £200 million and capital spending exceeded the budget by £120 million. Borrowing exceeded the budget planned level by £320 million.</P>
    <P>Fourthly he said:</P>
    <P>The balance of payments situation has been stabilised.</P>
    <P>This statement was backed up by other Government spokesmen at that time forecasting a £575 million external payments deficit.  The fact is that the balance of payments deficit far from falling, as had been predicted, from £730 million to £575 million actually rose to £750 million <Col N="565" /> according to the &ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget&rdquo; which, in view of the other statements in it, is unlikely to make the position any worse than it really is.</P>
    <P>One is entitled to ask the Taoiseach whether he simply had not a clue five months ago as to what was happening in our economy and in the Government's own finances, or whether he knew but gave a misleading account to the people when speaking in Ennis.</P>
    <P>The outstanding hallmark of this Government has been their total inability and unwillingness to come clean and tell the people the truth about our situation &mdash; the essential first step to putting right so much that is now terribly, terribly wrong. The people are entitled to a minimum of truth and frankness from their rulers. They are not getting it now.</P>
    <P>They will get it after the next election when Fine Gael in Government will tell them the truth about the situation we will have inherited from Fianna Fáil.  We will take the people into our confidence about the measures needed to put things right.  Through open Government we will bring this country back to solvency, to prosperity, and to a situation in which the new generation can trust their Government and have a genuine hope in their future in this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The only possible gleam of hope I see in this budget is that it may prove to be the final chapter in what could be described as the rake's progress. This budget should have done at least six things.  It should have stimulated employment. It should have made some attempt to curb inflation.  It should have catered, and in some respects it did cater, for the needs of social welfare recipients.  It should have made some progress towards equity in our taxation system.  It should have recognised the very serious plight of the agricultural community and the consequences of that for many industrial workers.  It should have tried to put the public finances into some degree of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worthwhile looking at what it has done in those areas which can be referred to in one word as the economy.  First let <Col N="566" /> us look at employment, or more appropriately, unemployment.  The official figure for those registered as unemployed is approximately 123,000, although it is clearly accepted and recognised, except by people who hold ministerial office and their supporters, that the true figure is much nearer 160,000.  I spoke here in December 1979 on the appointment of the Taoiseach.  I made some observations on what I thought would be the outcome of Deputy Haughey becoming Taoiseach. It does not give me any joy to stand up here today and say that the fears I expressed then have been realised.</P>
    <P>Let us go back to the time when the Taoiseach took over the running of this State and look at the unemployment figure. Unemployment has risen by 40 per cent in that period.  There were 40 per cent more people unemployed over those 13 months than there were when the economic messiah, as he was put forward as being, took over the running of the Irish economy.  People do not see the full picture when you deal in percentages.  Let us look a little closer at the picture and at the trend behind the picture.  During most of that period 3,000 jobs were lost per month; 750 per week; or 150 every working day.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is even more serious now than those figures indicate because, since September last, that trend has doubled. In September there were 105,000 on the live register but that figure has increased in the meantime to 123,000.  In other words, the figure of 3,000 job losses per month has increased since September to 6,000.  This represents 1,500 job losses per week or a figure of 300 for every working day.  So much, then, for the economic wizard that we were told would lead us to the promised land.  There are no indications that this rate of job losses will be reduced.  Indeed, all the indicators signal an increase in the months ahead. This situation is attributable to the policies pursued and the decisions taken by the Government.  We all know that there are external factors over which the Government have no control but the blame for the greater part of the plight of the economy must rest with the Government.</P>
    <P>We have become somewhat conditioned <Col N="567" /> to the unemployment situation. Even at a time when most of Europe was enjoying virtually full employment we were experiencing a structural problem in this regard of approximately 7 per cent and, unfortunately, that figure of 7 per cent became accepted generally as being normal despite the fact that it could be related directly to the type of policies that we pursue.  There is a genuine fear among the people as to their future in employment and as to the future prospects for their children.  Unlike previous times when only such traditional industries as the boot and shoe and textile industries were in difficulty, there is now a problem across the board in industry.  The traditional industries continue to experience difficulty and that will be the case for so long as this Government remain in office. Hundreds of jobs are being lost in the meat and food processing industries. There is hardly a sector of industry that is not experiencing difficulties.  What is most frightening of all is the lack of prospects for the immediate future.</P>
    <P>This is the record of the Taoiseach after 13 months in office and after being a member of the Government for two-and-a-half years previously.  Many people who consider themselves to be in safe jobs now find that their employment is in jeopardy.  In addition there is the realisation that anybody who has reached the age of 40 and who loses his job has poor prospects of obtaining other employment. His situation is worsened as a result of yesterday's budget.</P>
    <P>The Government tell us that their job creation plans are of the order of 10,000 jobs but we have experience of their predictions in this regard in the past.  Invariably the figures have fallen far short of what were announced.  However, even if the target of 10,000 jobs were to be reached, and that is extremely doubtful, it would not compensate for the number of jobs being lost during a period of nine weeks.  All we have from the Government is an aspiration for the creation of 10,000 jobs at a time when 6,000 jobs are being lost each month.  In such a situation how could anyone who becomes unemployed have any hope of finding a job?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="568" /> The increases in petrol prices and in Post Office charges together with the cutbacks in the estimates for local authority spending will result in further job losses and will aggravate further the position I have outlined.  The inflation rate for 1980 was 18¼ per cent.  There are clear indications that it will run to at least 18 per cent in the current year.  Nearly 37 per cent inflation in two years from a Government who came into office stating categorically that inflation would be down to 5 per cent.  What they did yesterday alone will add 3½ to 4 per cent to the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>When one talks about 3 or 4 per cent inflation being directly laid at the door of the Government by their budgetary measures one has only to look at the last few weeks to see what happened.  Before we had the dubious pleasure of sitting looking at the Minister for Finance at 3.30 p.m. yesterday unleasing the latest disaster upon the people, we had increases over the last few weeks in the price of flour, bread, gas, petrol, oil, coal and drink.  That was not yesterday but in the weeks leading up to the budget.  We know, and if I am not correct the Taoiseach will correct me, that CIE have submitted an application for an increase of 25 per cent.  We know the ESB are seeking an increase although we do not know whether it is for 10, 15 or 20 per cent. What measures did the Government, led by this financial and economic wizard, have to implement the 5 per cent inflation rate they promised in 1977?  Their answer, by their own direct action, will add 4 per cent to the CPI.  Not alone will it affect people's living standards, particularly those in the lower income groups and those dependent on social welfare, but it will affect the national understanding.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech he points out clearly to employers that the only commitment they have in the second stage, if the CPI goes over 10 per cent, is, to discuss it.  That is a clear indication to any employer who does not want to meet commitments in the second stage to resist them.  Shortly after the Taoiseach came into office he appeared on television to address the people and gave industrial <Col N="569" /> peace as his message to the nation.  This was to be his main priority.  Does he imagine that what was done here yesterday and what was included in the Minister for Finance's speech will result in industrial peace or does he think he might bolt before the full realisation of the implications of the second stage of the national understanding dawn upon the people who entered into it?  If that is what he is hoping for he has less respect for their intelligence than I have.</P>
    <P>On top of that we have the prospect, and apparently the only one, for the agricultural community of some adjustment in the common agricultural policy and some increases in prices from that.  If that happened &mdash; nobody wishes it would not happen &mdash; the price of food to the consumer will automatically increase. Inflation will be even further fuelled by that.  As far as inflation is concerned, the people and the Taoiseach knew well that measures which were politically unpopular but genuinely in the national interest were undertaken and implemented by the last administration and they left the Fianna Fáil Government at the end of 1978 with an inflation rate of 7 per cent. They benefited as a result of politically unpopular decisions which were not vote-getting but which were genuinely in the best interests of the people.  The 7 per cent inflation rate was scattered in a cheap, vulgar, cynical exercise of vote getting.  They are now trapped and locked into the promises and undertakings given in the manifesto.  They are not the real victims of that, however.  The real victims are the 123,000 people on the live register who are unemployed and the thousands more who will inevitably join them as long as these policies are pursued.  They must be pursued as long as the present administration remain in office.  So much for manifestoes and financial and economic wizardry.</P>
    <P>As regards taxation, the greatest instrument and, indeed, the only effective one a Government have to create equity and social justice in a country is the taxation code.  What happened yesterday as far as taxation was concerned? What happened to the PAYE workers? They got £60 million, £40 million of which <Col N="570" /> they got through industrial strength under the terms of the national understanding. Two-thirds of the £60 million that was adjusted in the PAYE sector was got by direct negotiation by trade unions, not by the Government's actions. The £20 million was a cosmetic exercise to try to doctor up the PAYE aspect of taxation and put some face on it.  They gave £60 million, £40 million of which they had to give under the national understanding but the increase in money that will come to the Exchequer from the PAYE sector is £140 million.  They gave £60 million and will get £140 million.  This Government have consistently used inflation as their tax collector and they are doing it again in this budget.</P>
    <P>There is another side to the taxation coin at which we should have a look.  It is an incredible statement to be able to make in a society such as ours that there is virtually no capital taxation in the budget.  Out of a budget of £4,329,000,000 a total of £14 million, one half of 1 per cent, is collected in capital taxation.  That will remain the situation as long as Fianna Fáil are in Government. As I stated in December 1979, under the Taoiseach, who has his own political constituency, it is not the legitimate businessman that will be catered for; it will be the grey area, the get-rich-quick element in our society, that will be looked after.  If one looks at the budget closely one will see that such people are catered for once again.  The speculators are back in once again and they will continue to return as long as Fianna Fáil remain in power.  They will come back in as long as the Government hold the philosophy, if it could be called a philosophy, of the Taoiseach and his Cabinet colleagues.</P>
    <P>It was possible yesterday to hear the squeals, legitimate in many cases, of the real business sector when their representatives were on radio and television.  They were the people who run our factories, our shops, those who get up early in the morning, go to work and stay at work in order to try to meet deadlines or obtain orders.  There were not only squeals from the boys who put a few thousand here and there and looked for the opportunities <Col N="571" /> and openings, and their are so many of them.  The latter do not put in anything except their doubtfully accumulated personal wealth and influence.  One part of the budget opens up even more new horizons for such speculators, those who do not contribute anything to our sociaty and make gains at the expense of all who contribute, whether they are legitimate businessmen, farmers or workers.  Those boys are not squealing after yesterday because they can see the gravy train again.  Was there any attempt to introduce a capital gains tax to try to get back some of the overnight riches obtained by such people?  Was there any attempt to introduce a wealth tax so necessary in a society such as ours?  There was not, and the answer will remain the same as long as Fianna Fáil are in office.</P>
    <P>On the other side we have the financial institutions operating within the State &mdash; they are not the financial institutions of the State &mdash; and the banks, and no matter who goes to the wall they do not suffer.  Farmers who were actively encouraged to borrow money to extend their holdings and actively encouraged to take more money to modernise their farms now find themselves in difficulty and concerned that the bailiff may arrive and put them out of business.  They are worried that they may lose their homes. Yesterday we were told that a commission was looking into the question of banking and financial institutions, but if the Taoiseach is still in office next year they will still be looking into it because last year we were told the same thing.  It does not take much looking into when one realises that, no matter who is going to the wall, the profits of the banks and other financial institutions are booming. Surely it is not unreasonable to ask them to make a proper contribution to the running of the State?  There is an obligation on the Government to ensure that that responsibility is met.  It is not only the rate of taxation that should be looked into with a sense of urgency; some of the other activities of such concerns could usefully be looked into in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Last year I stated that the Taoiseach <Col N="572" /> had a political constituency.  In this regard I should like to quote from the Minister's speech in the course of which he stated:</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier of the Government's policy to encourage greater participation by the private sector in capital development.  With this objective in mind and also to generate employment, I propose to introduce a new special allowance of 100 per cent in respect of expenditure incurred on the construction of moderate-cost rented residential accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated:</P>
    <P>I am also considering whether an incentive might be appropriate &mdash; I love that word.  The Minister went on:</P>
    <P>&mdash;in relation to the provision by the private sector of multi-storey car parks and toll roads and bridges. Allowances in these cases could act as a positive inducement to the private sector to become more actively involved in some essential infrastructure requirements.</P>
    <P>I have read out a speculator's chart.  I do not think anybody could justify that approach towards providing rented accommodation, toll roads and, certainly, multi-storey car parks.  Some of the boys reading that passage last night are happy.  It is all they are interested in and the other provisions of the budget do not apply to them.  That counts.  That is the gravy train at full speed.  The other sections of the community, the legitimate business people, the farmers and the PAYE sector pay for the fuel for the gravy train.  That does not surprise me because I predicted that would happen.</P>
    <P>He went on to talk about social welfare. He announced here yesterday that increases in social welfare benefits, 25 per cent in the long term and 20 per cent in the short term for recipients, would be made available from next April.  In general I welcome those.  I am not saying, as other people have said, that they are lavish but in the circumstances that exist I suppose they are the best that one can do and it is not my intention to attack <Col N="573" /> them.  I welcome particularly the increase in children's allowances.  I believe that out of all the social welfare payments made &mdash; and there are millions &mdash; probably the most beneficial, particularly to the lower income families and particularly since it is being paid direct to the mother, is the children's allowance, and I welcome that.  However, this Government have neglected shamefully the whole area of social welfare over the last three and a half years.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that because I was involved personally in the Department of Social Welfare under Deputy Corish.  I am saying it because it is a fact.  There is so much scope for improvement in that area.  There is so much scope for useful work in that area that has been totally neglected by this present Government. Just to mention two, there is the question of pay-related pensions and there is the question of social security for the self-employed. One of them was almost complete when the present Taoiseach went into office as Minister for Social Welfare. Most of the work for the introduction of pay-related pensions was lying on his desk finished completely three and a half years back.  It is still not a reality.  A considerable amount of work had been done in extending coverage to the self-employed, but I believe that it is not an area in which the Taoiseach had his heart, and that is regrettable.  Our social security code has very many gaps which can be filled if the political will is there to fill them.  It has not been there over the last three and a half years.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on one other development.  I predicted, in the December of Deputy Haughey's appointment as Taoiseach &mdash; and it is on the record of this House &mdash; that the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty would go to the wall.  That is on the record.  I knew it was going to happen.  I knew that as far as the Taoiseach was concerned their activities had to be brought to a halt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>And they have been brought to a halt.  They have saved the <Col N="574" /> Government from political embarrassment. They have saved the Government having to answer legitimate questions that are raised and would be raised on the plight of 20 to 25 per cent of our people who live in poverty, and the Taoiseach at all costs wanted them off his back.  He has got them off his back, but at what a price, with 20 to 25 per cent in this marvellous Christian society of ours living in poverty.  If anyone sitting here does not believe it I will bring that person to within half a mile of where I am standing and I will show to him or her children who go to bed hungry every night, children who have not enough to eat, children who are not properly clothed, children who are not properly housed, and 20 per cent at least of our people are living in those conditions.  The Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty were to no-one's profit.  They were going to call it as they saw it, and they were doing that.  I knew when I set them up under the direction of Deputy Corish that the only way they could contribute towards eliminating poverty in our society was to come in conflict with whatever was Government of the day, including ours, and I told them that publicly.  As far as I and Deputy Corish were concerned political embarrassment, hassle and harassment was a very small price to pay if it would contribute in any way to eliminating poverty from our society.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not so the present Taoiseach. Their days were numbered and I predicted it in this House on the day he was appointed as Taoiseach.  I regret sincerely that I was correct in that prediction. There is not going to be any change in attitude as far as this Government are concerned.  They are happy with the <i>status quo</i>.  They like it the way it is.  The 20 to 25 per cent living in poverty generally speaking are not members of the Government. Generally speaking they do not use the political muscle which they have and which they should use.  They are too demoralised to become actively engaged in politics.  Most of them, unfortunately the majority, do not vote.  They do not <Col N="575" /> relate to our society.  We have alienated them and now we want to push them under the rug altogether.  There will be no change in that situation as long as Fianna Fáil under the present administration remain in office.</P>
      <P>As I have said, this Government are locked into their own manifesto that brought them into office in 1977.  There is a growing realisation that the Government just do not know what to do.  They are becoming more and more marked by their unsureness and gross incompetence. One could go down individually through the 15 Ministers and pick out the ones who are reasonably intelligent, well-intentioned and competent.  If you want to be less charitable you could pick out others.  However, the more competent they are in pursuing the wrong policies the greater the price that the Irish people are going to pay for it.  Therefore, we are somewhat fortunate that there is a high degree of incompetence on the front bench and an extraordinarily high degree on the second bench.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the agricultural sector is concerned agriculture is in very serious difficulties and it is not a question of profit. It is not a question of how much money they are going to make and it is not a question now, as it was two or three years ago, of whether they were going to be taxed equitably.  It is now in many cases, are we going to survive?  One thing that must be realised by urban workers and urban people is that if agriculture goes to the wall &mdash; which it can under the policies being pursued by this Government &mdash; the repercussions on industrial workers will be severe.  If proof of that is needed Grand Canal Street is about a quarter of a mile from here and 340 people lost their jobs.  That is being repeated in Leixlip and Cork and many other places.  The Government, as far as I can see, have opted out of agriculture.  As regards the agricultural community, they are told by this Government that everything is now a matter for Brussels as if they had no direct responsibility for or input to make in agriculture.  What happened here yesterday marginally improved the income <Col N="576" /> of the farming community but what did it do for farming output?  That is the important thing and that is what will count both in the long term and the medium term.  All the budget did was to retard it.</P>
    <P>I want to make one or two comments about the presentation of what have been described as the public finances, I thought Deputy FitzGerald in his usual way was extremely charitable when he recounted some facts and said that these finances were &ldquo;fiddled&rdquo;&mdash; that is what I think he said &mdash; or faked.  Would the Taoiseach take the opportunity of clarifying the questions I shall raise?  We are told that the deficit is £515 million.  In the Estimates the non-pay element is given as 3 per cent.  Seriously, could you suggest to a teenager outside the gates of Leinster House that 3 per cent would be a reasonable assessment of the non-pay element in the Estimates?  Who would believe it? I am being charitable, which may be surprising, when I say that there is approximately a £2 million under-statement in that alone.  There is the £66 million that the adjustment in the three months is supposed to give but which it will not give this year.  The real gem in regard to how deliberately misleading is the figure of £515 million is that about four days after the Estimates are published we find in this budget document that under the heading of Rationalisation in the Public Sector it is stated that in the current year with greater efficiency and greater rationalisation we are going to save £25 million.</P>
    <P>The Government are not fooling anybody but themselves.  Whatever about stopping a child outside Leinster House, if it were possible to do so I should like to ask one of the gentlemen in what is described as &ldquo;the bull-pen&rdquo; to tell us what they think of that kind of presentation of the public finances and its accuracy.</P>
    <P>I began by saying that the only hope I had of the budget was that it might be the final chapter of what can only be described as the rake's progress.  There will be no change so long as Fianna Fáil are there and it would be wrong to suggest that just because they were not there there would be dramatic changes overnight. What has been done in the last <Col N="577" /> three-and-a-half years has put our economic future in jeopardy and it will take very strenuous efforts by whoever comes after them to rectify that situation, but rectified it must be in the interests of the people.  The first step in rectifying it is to get the Government out of office and we shall do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is about the most unoriginal contribution from Deputy Cluskey that I have ever heard.  I could nearly have rehashed it from last year's budget speech.</P>
      <P>The economic conditions in which this budget is brought forward are exceptionally difficult and complex.  But its strategic objectives are nevertheless clear and direct.</P>
      <P>We must maintain economic growth and development in order to bring the national economy through this current deep recession as safely as possible.  This requires a major increase in productive investment levels.</P>
      <P>We must positively protect the living standards of the underprivileged and less well-off in the difficult economic circumstances of today.  This requires specific budgetary action in the health and social welfare fields.</P>
      <P>We must improve the structure of the public finances and provide a solid foundation for the greatly increased level of economic activity needed in the years immediately ahead.  This requires, in particular, a phased reduction in the real level of the current budget deficit.</P>
      <P>These are the strategic aims which this budget will attain.  In framing them we have rejected deflationary policies which would have involved cutting down our rate of investment, neglecting our obligation to the poor and the underprivileged, imposing additional direct taxation or seriously disrupting existing services by too severe a reduction in the current deficit.</P>
      <P>I have stated our strategic objectives clearly and simply.  The budget contains the measures necessary to achieve these objectives in present circumstances having regard to the balance to be struck between difficult, complex and often conflicting considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> In establishing these strategic objectives, we were guided by the achievements of last year in the face of the most difficult conditions in recent economic history.  I believe that these achievements in the Irish economy fully justify the Government's claim that we are coming through this recession better than most.</P>
    <P>We achieved positive economic growth in a year when the output of some of the strongest economies such as the US, Canada, the UK and Denmark was actually lower than in 1979.  We maintained our investment at a level which is the highest in the European Community and almost the highest in the OECD area.  We expanded our exports at a rate above the Community and OECD averages.  We achieved record levels of new job approvals in modern competitive high-technology industry and as a result succeeded, in spite of job losses, in at least maintaining the level of employment.  We held our external deficit to about the same level as in 1979.  It would have been lower but for the exceptional level of imports in December 1980 which, however, appear to signal and even anticipate greater growth in 1981.  We have brought down interest rates to a level which is the third lowest in the Community.  We brought down significantly the rate of inflation. We had the lowest number of days lost through industrial stoppages since 1977 &mdash; an achievement of very considerable significance in the difficult circumstances of last year.</P>
    <P>The investment plan is one of the key elements in maintaining our economic growth and development in the face of the recession.  The Government's strategy is to avail of the present falling-off in economic activity to direct unused resources into the improvement of the capacity and efficiency of our economy by a major programme of productive investment.  That is why we have decided to increase by about 36 per cent the expenditure this year on the public capital programme.</P>
    <P>Investment has been high in the last two years with fixed investment running at an average level of over 30 per cent of gross national product.  This has been one of the most favourable features of our <Col N="579" /> economy and is the reason why we have been able to achieve, last year, record levels of new job approvals.  Among OECD countries, this ratio has been matched only in Japan.  Our ability to maintain such high investment has shown that, despite the prevailing gloom around us, there is strong confidence in the business world, both here and abroad, in the future prospects of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to remain growth-orientated despite the present depressed state of world economic activity.  I have said, again and again, that deflation is not a policy suitable to our Irish economic circumstances. We wish to see the investment ratio higher still so as to increase the growth potential of the economy and provide employment opportunities for our growing labour force.  The more investment there is today, the more jobs there will be tomorrow when the current recession has passed.</P>
    <P>When assessing the investment plan for 1981, it is a sobering exercise to calculate the cost of the present world recession in terms of lost resources.  These losses can never be regained.  Throughout the western world, the loss of real resources was the equivalent of hundreds of billions of dollars with a consequent multiplying loss in world economic activity and trade. There is, of course, the cost of the recession, also, in terms of human misery as reflected in unemployment figures which are even more frightening.  At the end of 1980, unemployment in the US was estimated at almost 7½ million, in the UK at over 2 million and for the OECD area, as a whole, 23 million.  Even these figures do not reveal the full impact of the recession on employment.  The more long-term unemployment rises, the more the proportion accounted for by young people will also rise.</P>
    <P>Our consistent policy of promoting industrial development has contributed significantly to our high investment ratio. Last year we had the highest level of industrial investment ever achieved in our history.  Our policy has, therefore, proved eminently successful and has played a big part in the economic transformation <Col N="580" /> of the country in recent years. In pursuance of this policy, the investment plan makes a substantially increased provision for industrial development and promotion in 1981.</P>
    <P>Despite the world recession, overseas investment in Ireland is strong and likely to remain so throughout 1981.  The external investment is largely in growth industries such as electronics, light engineering, medicare and chemicals.  We are free for the most part of the structural difficulties affecting industry in so many developed countries today and we are fortunate that our incentives and facilities attract new technology and know-how in this micro-processor and computer age.</P>
    <P>This policy of attracting overseas investment with a high technology content has not been detrimental to the growth of our own scientific and technological capacity.  About half of the new industrial jobs approved by the IDA last year were generated from domestic resources of industrial enterprise and scientific and technological skill.  The enlargement, both nationally and regionally, of our own domestic scientific and technological capacity for growth is the major objective of the National Board of Science and Technology.  Its policies, together with those of our research, technological and educational institutions, are clearly succeeding in raising significantly our capacity to grow on the basis of our own scientific and technological resources.</P>
    <P>Government policy is directed towards the encouragement of savings to the maximum extent to finance this year's huge investment programme.  We are, also, for the first time, providing opportunities for private sector funds to invest directly in the expansion of our infrastructure.  In this way, we intend to mobilise private sector funds which seek long-term growth investments and which have not heretofore participated in the public capital programme. But to reach the investment target laid down, domestic resources by themselves will not be sufficient.  The resources available at home must be supplemented by foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong in foreign borrowing if the funds are available at the <Col N="581" /> right price and on the right terms and if the borrowing is used to create productive and remunerative projects which add to the wealth of the country and provide the new employment opportunities which are so badly needed.  There is a great deal of talk about the risks inherent in greater dependence on foreign borrowing.  This Government believe that those risks are overstated given the improvement in our productive capacity and efficiency which will result.  By putting people to work in growth and export-orientated industries, we will earn the resources necessary to repay foreign borrowing.  Foreign funds are available on favourable terms and Ireland's credit rating abroad has never been higher.</P>
    <P>Some of the critics would seem to want us to go back to the old dismal situation where we sent most of our wealth abroad, financial and human, for the development of other countries, while our own resources lay undeveloped and our economy stagnant.  In the 1950s, for example, we were, on a <i>per capita</i> basis, one of the highest creditor nations in the western world.  At the same time, we had one of the least-developed economies with an average growth rate over the decade of less than 1 per cent with high unemployment, large-scale emigration and so many of our natural resources underdeveloped for lack of enterprise and capital.</P>
    <P>It is a source of great encouragement to the Government that our approach to investment in the coming year has been fully endorsed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Furthermore, we propose to work in the closest possible co-operation with the trade union movement in seeing that the investment plan is implemented as quickly and as effectively as possible and that it promotes the maximum amount of domestic employment and economic growth.  In this connection, also, I would point out that the budgetary strategy of reducing the current budget deficit and expanding productive investment is broadly in line with the recommendations of the National Economic and Social Council in their recent report on the social and economic policies they recommend for 1980-83.</P>
    <P>Because of the level at which we have <Col N="582" /> fixed the Exchequer borrowing requirement and because we have given priority to the need for productive investment and allocated our resources accordingly, this is a budget of positive but prudent growth for the coming year.  It is a budget designed to achieve significantly faster growth than the average growth of 1 per cent forecast for the OECD area.  I want to reiterate that given the developing state of our economy we must continue positive growth policies.  These must, of course, be based on a reasonable level of Exchequer borrowing and on a manageable balance of payments deficit.  It has become increasingly obvious in recent times that the deficiencies in our basic infrastructure have been a very considerable hindrance to our general economic growth.  There are deficiencies in telecommunications, roads, water and sewerage services and other essential infrastructures which have developed over the years.  These deficiencies place us at a competitive disadvantage within the European Community and in our ability to create new and lasting employment. We are now going to correct them, as we must, if we are to increase our living standards and reduce unemployment.</P>
    <P>The relationship between high investment and employment should be clear to all.  Through this high investment, we have the capacity to provide more than 40,000 jobs a year.  Last year, we approved nearly 40,000 new industrial and other grant-aided jobs.  Employment in our private services has been growing in recent years at nearly 10,000 per year. Public sector employment has also been growing modestly in response to the increasing demands on it.  Our unemployment problem, therefore, is not caused &mdash; as it is in many other countries with low investment rates &mdash; by lack of new jobs.  It is because the recession has caused job losses in traditional industries vulnerable to the more competitive and restricted market conditions of an international recession.  These job losses, most of which will be temporary, are offsetting the gains we are making in providing new jobs.  At the same time, we are experiencing an unprecedented expansion of our labour force due to the <Col N="583" /> fact that we have the fastest growing population in the western world.  This is due both to our natural increase and to the fact that our investment in new high technology industry and the expansion of our service employment is attracting home from abroad many thousands of our people.</P>
    <P>These population trends are not contradicted by the recent passenger movement statistics as the latter are not a reliable guide to migration trends. Between 1971 and 1979, the census showed that almost 109,000 persons on balance returned to Ireland.  For the same period, the statistics relating to passenger movements showed a net inflow of only 15,000 persons.  In the year to April 1978, the passenger movement statistics showed a net outflow of 11,000 persons but in fact the 1979 census showed that there was an estimated net inflow of persons in that year of 7,000.</P>
    <P>Let us not mistake or misunderstand what is happening with employment.  We are proving our capacity through a high investment policy to provide enough new jobs to reduce unemployment but the current recession is temporarily offsetting these gains by losses in older industries. That is why we must continue to maintain our high investment in the new jobs in our economy so that as the recession passes we will achieve corresponding higher rates of increase in net employment.</P>
    <P>We must realise, however, that investment alone is not sufficient to achieve economic growth and increased employment. It must be clear to every employer and employee now that increased efficiency and competitiveness must accompany increased investment.  There is no use our providing the productive capacity and economic infrastructure if we cannot produce the products and services we market at prices at which they can be sold.  The full benefit of the investment we are making in terms of increased employment and improved living standards will materialise only if employers and employees co-operate to secure a significant increase in the efficiency with which goods and services are produced. <Col N="584" /> This basic economic fact must be fully accepted by all.  We are currently discussing with the employers and the trade union leaders what new and practical measures can be initiated this year to close rapidly the gap in productivity which unfortunately still exists between us and our more important competitors.</P>
    <P>The second strategic objective of this budget is to correct social and income deficiencies and disparities.  The budget has, therefore, made equitable provision for those members of the community who need help most: recipients of social welfare, especially the old, the disabled, the unemployed and larger families on low incomes.  We have, as we did last year, more than compensated these, the weakest members of our community, for the increased cost of living as part of our firm policy of raising every year the living standards of the underprivileged as much as we can.</P>
    <P>We have also again made substantial provision, as we undertook to do, in the second national understanding, to ease the burden of taxation on the PAYE taxpayer.  We would have liked to have been able to do more but it must be realised that the possibility of concessions this year to those in employment is limited by the priority that must be given to maintaining economic activity and increasing employment.</P>
    <P>There is now a widespread understanding of the heavy loss of income the farming community has suffered in the past two years.  This has severe repercussions throughout the economy in reduced demand for the goods and services of the other sectors.  It is not possible for the Exchequer to make good the income losses of the farm industry.  This must in great part depend on the policies of the European Community which determines the prices and market supports for our main agricultural products.  We have for the past year, at the level of the Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Council, battled to establish the case for better incomes for the farming community, particularly in the less well-off regions.  We have submitted to the Commission specific proposals for special aid for the Irish farmers and the <Col N="585" /> Minister for Agriculture is engaged in continuing discussions and negotiations on these proposals.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, we must ourselves, as a national community and in the interests of the economy as a whole, come to the assistance of the farming sector this year to the limited extent that our national resources allow.  The provision for the farming sector will help individual farmers who are in financial difficulties, improve confidence in the industry, stimulate further investment and have multiplier effects in the other sectors of the economy.  When agriculture prospers we all prosper.  When it does not, we all suffer economic loss and hardship.</P>
    <P>The third strategic objective of the budget is to improve the structure of the public finances.  This year, the budget had to take account of a number of key economic elements.  These include the level of Exchequer borrowing with particular reference to the current budget deficit; the likely balance of payments deficit; the rate of inflation; the level of overall Government expenditure with particular reference to the effect on it of the public service pay; and the level of domestic taxation.</P>
    <P>These are not particularly Irish problems. Throughout western Europe and the OECD area, Governments everywhere are struggling with the problems of public finances which have been driven off course by the continuing inflationary forces in the international economy and by the drain on resources due to the large and sudden oil-induced external deficits. In this year, we, like other Governments, have had to take a very strong self-disciplinary line.  The central problem is to reconcile the need for greater economic growth and the creation of further employment with the mandatory need to restrict Government expenditure and so curtail the current budget deficit.</P>
    <P>The Government have, therefore, in this budget, sought a balance in the public finances which restricts the current public expenditure to no more than we can afford, but contains a far-reaching programme of productive investment mainly in much-needed economic infrastructure. By severely pruning current public <Col N="586" /> expenditure to the levels that we must have and can afford, we are balancing the need for solid public finances with the need to maintain momentum in the economy and to create the type of economic and physical environment which will increase our competitiveness and our efficiency.</P>
    <P>There is fairly widespread agreement on the need to scale down the current budget deficit.  In all our preparatory work for this 1981 budget, the Government have kept this objective clearly in mind.  A major reduction in one year would be unnecessarily restrictive of general economic management policy.  The aim should be to reduce the deficit annually until it is finally eliminated. Meanwhile, the real measure of objection to a current deficit in any year should not be its nominal size but rather the proportion that size represents of gross national product.</P>
    <P>The object of ensuring that there is no excess on this year's current deficit will be helped by the expansion of the Public Capital Programme.  Different spending agencies must understand that the increased capital allocations provided will remain possible only if current expenditure is kept to the budget limits. The important thing is that the borrowing requirement for capital productive purposes should not be eaten into by excess current expenditures.</P>
    <P>In considering what additional taxation measures were necessary to meet this year's requirements, the Government kept very much in mind the need to avoid increases in the cost of basic necessities and the possible effects on the consumer price index.  The Government also sought to minimise the total additional burden of taxation so as not to penalise enterprise and endeavour at a time when the economic difficulties require increased efforts and energies.</P>
    <P>The prudent decisions we have made in this budget are designed to ensure the stability and strength of our currency.  We succeeded last year in controlling our balance of payments deficit within limits which were lower than those originally forecast.  We are confident that this year, also, we will maintain the external deficit <Col N="587" /> within substainable limits.  We are taking new practical measures under the investment plan to ensure that every opportunity of import substitution it presents is seized.  This is relevant to the fact that, for example, it has been established that some £150 million of building materials are imported annually which could be produced here.</P>
    <P>Another recent study in the public sector has identified some £150 million of products being purchased by that sector which could be produced here.  The reduction to 10 per cent from 1 January 1981, of the corporation profits tax on manufacturing industry will give a new impetus to the production at home of many products formerly imported.  I have spoken many times in the past year on the need to consider the claims of Irish consumer goods when making purchases. The new efforts being made by trade union and employer organisations to get this message over to the general public should materially affect our external deficit this year.  Our taxation decisions have also been influenced by the consideration that reduced imports are important in improving the structure of our economy. The likelihood, also, is that the exceptional increase in imports at the end of 1980 will have anticipated to some extent what would otherwise be 1981 imports.</P>
    <P>The investment plan, in itself, with its emphasis on increased productive capacity and economic infrastructure will assist our export industries.  One of the objectives of the plan is to accelerate the projects already in the pipeline and thus bring forward the expórts they will generate. Last year the value of our manufactured exports increased by nearly 22 per cent and the investment plan, together with the additional funds provided for export promotion, should sustain this upward trend.</P>
    <P>This budget should aid the downward trend in inflation.  We have passed the peak in the upsurge of the oil-induced inflation which is the root cause of the world's present economic difficulties. The reduction in the current budget deficit will also reduce inflationary pressures. Inflation this year is expected, <Col N="588" /> therefore, to be lower than last year assuming no dramatic changes in oil prices.</P>
    <P>Our inflation could, however, be increased, against the world trend, if we seek this year to extract from the economy greater money incomes than those already provided in the second national understanding.  Such greater money incomes can only be obtained by increasing the rate of inflation thus plunging the economy into a spiral of price and income increases in which the sufferers will not be those in secure well-protected occupations but those in industries which, at present costs, are already only marginally viable.</P>
    <P>In our circumstances, the impact the budget will have on regional development is of particular importance.  Increasingly for the future we must think in terms of an economy which grows because its different regions are growing.  Economic growth which is concentrated only in a few places will be limited economic growth.  It is the conviction of this Government that national economic growth will be greater overall if each region is given the opportunity to realise its full potential.</P>
    <P>The spearhead of our regional development programmes is industrialisation which is bringing modern industry to all parts of the country.  The record number of new job approvals to which I referred earlier are spread throughout the country in pursuance of this policy.  They include more than 3,000 job approvals by SFADCo and 1,200 job approvals by Údarás na Gaeltachta for areas which have special need of industrialisation if their standards of living are to be improved.  In the case of the Gaeltacht, its cultural and linguistic heritage can be strengthened only if economic and social opportunities are provided to retain the young people in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the investment plan expenditure will underpin our regional development programmes.  These include the large increases in the expenditure of the IDA, SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The effects of the expenditure on agriculture, forestry and fishing will be felt throughout the country, but <Col N="589" /> it is in the area of economic infrastructure that the investment plan will most accelerate our regional development.</P>
    <P>The widespread conversion to automatic telephone exchanges and the extension of subscriber trunk dialling will improve dramatically the communications capacity of regions hampered in their economic growth by deficient and outmoded telecommunications.</P>
    <P>Another serious impediment to regional growth has been substandard and congested roads.  The road works to be undertaken under the investment plan will correct major deficiencies in the road network at strategic regional points as part of our national plan for road improvement.  Industrial development and urban growth have been retarded seriously by the shortage of water and sewerage services.  This shortage has also led to unacceptable environmental damage and to excessive land costs due to the consequent shortage of serviced land.</P>
    <P>The increase of over 40 per cent in the provision this year under the investment plan for sanitary services will bring these essential services to many parts of the regions now suffering damage to their environment and barriers to their to their expansion and growth.  A very important regional development provided for in the plan is the extension and improvement of our growing network of local airports. An important adjunct to the range of services a region can offer are the facilities of a local airport.</P>
    <P>We are, however, not complacent about the regional progress being made and are engaged in a review of regional policy to see what improvements can be made.  The recent decision to decentralise over 3,000 civil service posts to 12 regional centres is further evidence of our concern to accelerate the provision of a fuller economic and social life in the regions.  This will be followed by further decentralisation of Government and State-sponsored services.  We have an excessive concentration of these services in Dublin where they add to unacceptable and uneconomic congestion.  Our policies are designed to bring about a better balance of population and economic and <Col N="590" /> social opportunities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I believe that, in a complex modern society, there is always need for open communication and close consultation between Government and the leaders of the main economic and social interests. The need for this is even greater in times of economic difficulty and uncertainty.  It is an essential part of our approach to maintain a continuing dialogue and exchange of views on our long-term economic and social prospects and current problems and difficulties with the leaders of the trade union movement, of the employers and industrialists, of the farmers, and of the State-sponsored sector. We are too small an economic and social unit to permit the existence of any major gap between the Government and the various economic and social sectors.  Any worthwhile economic advance must command the widespread support of the people. At our level of development, we will need all the unity of purpose and mutual understanding we can bring about between sectors and between Government and the major economic and social interests if we are to attain the level of development we need.  By realistic and constructive discussion and by an appreciation of each other's constraints and commitments we can bring about that unity of purpose and co-operation without which no nation ever succeeded in achieving its potential.</P>
    <P>There was a significant improvement in industrial relations last year in that the number of workdays lost was the lowest since 1977.  While this trend is welcome, the situation is still not satisfactory and must be further improved.  Employers, managers, trade unions and workers should follow the procedures available to them so that we can achieve strike-free conditions in our industries and in our public utilities.</P>
    <P>The problem is not, of course, confined to losses because of strikes.  There is the damaging seepage of production through absenteeism, through restrictive work practices and work-to-rule.  Many more days are lost through these practices than through straight-forward industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> We must be clear about the economic and social damage of poor industrial relations. The community, particularly its most dependent members, can be gravely inconvenienced when essential services are disrupted.  Our economy requires industrial peace if it is to function normally and effectively.  It is on the successful operation of employment-giving enterprise that the well-being, the welfare, and the standards and services of our entire community, depend.</P>
    <P>Everyone, therefore, must be concerned vitally about the health of the country's industrial relations, and I believe that our people will insist more and more in the future that those responsible for industrial relations should ensure that the arrangements of collective bargaining will work smoothly and that confrontation will be replaced by co-operation.</P>
    <P>Delay in improving our competitiveness will have serious effects on our economic performance and consequently on our living standards and on our capacity to sustain our expanding population and workforce.  It is vital to the success of all our plans to expand our share of the world's markets from the one-half of 1 per cent achieved in 1979.  An Irish industrial sector which is non-competitive will not even maintain, much less increase, that share for us.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations in their impact are no longer a matter for ourselves alone. Our whole future as part of the developed industrial western world is involved.  Our place in the international economic league of nations depends on the efficiency of our industry and our agriculture.  Interruption of our vital services by industrial action, official or unofficial, affects the entire performance of our national economy. There is no room for complacency.</P>
    <P>Everybody should understand that the economy of the European Community as a whole is in trouble and under pressure. In different regions of the world, new industrial capacity is coming into being and developing levels of efficiency and productivity that far outstrip those prevailing in the traditional industrial centres of Europe.  We must meet this <Col N="592" /> challenge or sink steadily into second or even third-rate economic and social status.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that industrial relations are not, of course, a one-sided or even a two-sided affair.  A good industrial relations climate in an organisation is the product of a variety of different factors.  From the employer, it requires consistent and unceasing attention at the highest level of the firm.  It requires skilled and experienced personnel management. It is affected by the whole attitude of the management towards its employees, including concern for the facilities and amenities available to employees and the health and welfare services provided for them.  It also includes efficient organisation of the work with the objective of giving maximum job satisfaction to increasingly skilled workforces.</P>
    <P>From the employees it requires responsibility, loyalty to the firm and support for their trade union leaders, pride in their work, competent and efficient work practices and willingness to compromise and to co-operate in initiatives to improve employer-employee relations.</P>
    <P>From the Government, it requires effective institutions staffed with experienced personnel and endowed with the resources necessary to enable them competently to discharge their mediating functions.</P>
    <P>A good industrial relations climate is not easily created.  To maintain it requires constant and patient effort.  It is, however, a pearl of great price.  There is no other simple way by which we can do more to make our standards of living and our jobs more secure.</P>
    <P>This is a budget which has been prudently but positively constructed.  Even though it has a major central thrust to maintain the drive and momentum of our economy in the face of the recession it is nevertheless wide-ranging in the scope and depth of its economic and social provisions.</P>
    <P>Taken together with the investment plan, this budget is designed to stimulate the economy and to provide the investment which we need to improve our productive capacity and economic infrastructure, <Col N="593" /> to increase employment and to lay a secure foundation for faster growth and development.</P>
    <P>It also ensures that the economic and social problems of the various sectors of our society have been alleviated to the extent that our resources permit.</P>
    <P>I would like, before I conclude, to reject the views of all those who can make only gloomy predictions and assessments and who ignore the fundamental and growing strength of our economy.</P>
    <P>The Irish economy of former days is now in course of transition into one with a large, modern, diversified and internationally-trading industrial sector; a comprehensive, efficient services sector; and an agricultural sector based on modern scientific farming and business methods.</P>
    <P>Because of the growing strength of our economy, we are coming through the present world recession reasonably well and better than most.  Our potential for growth is great.  This provides a sound basis for our currency and our credit.  Our public finances, carefully managed in the interests of supporting the growing structural strength of our economy, are organised in accordance with the highest international standards.</P>
    <P>What we need now is greater confidence in our potential and more effort to realise it.  At the same time, we must realise that the economy will grow faster and we will all be better off if we give our personal commitment to contributing as much as we can to the economy rather than trying to extract what we can from it by any possible formula that can be devised.</P>
    <P>This budget faces up to our problems and opportunities.  It gives assistance where assistance is needed, it maintains a careful balance between prudent financial management and economic growth, it restrains current expenditure while expanding productive investment.  It is the right formula for the needs and circumstances of today and the opportunities of tomorrow.  It provides us with the economic framework we need to support us safely through what will be a difficult year but which should also see the beginning <Col N="594" /> of the end of the present acute world economic recession.</P>
    <P>I have not a great deal of time to deal with some of the points raised by the Leaders of the Opposition but I should like to mention a matter raised by Deputy Cluskey and I hope he will accept what I have to say about the proposals in the budget to provide a tax incentive for the provision of moderate-priced rented accommodation.  I should like to tell him from whence that proposal emanated.  It did not emanate from some of those scurvy speculators who are the bane of Deputy Cluskey's political life.  In fact, in the course of our investigations we discovered that some of the pension funds -not speculators but the people who mind the pension funds of the workers of this country &mdash; would be happy to invest in this type of accommodation, for which Deputy Cluskey will admit there is a very great need in our circumstances.  They would be prepared to invest pension funds for the provision of low-priced rented accommodation if this concession were made available to them.  It is from that direction that this proposal emanated and it is designed to ensure that the pension funds of our workers and employees are used to provide low-priced rented accommodation for them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald criticised my Ennis speech because he claimed I was wrong in my projection of the balance of payments deficit.  I was wrong but at that time of the year the balance of payments deficit and the balance of payments generally seemed to be going very satisfactorily. If I was wrong over a six-month period Deputy FitzGerald will admit that the Central Bank were wrong in a period of only one month when they had to <Col N="596" /> revise very considerably their deficit figures. If the Central Bank can be wrong from one month to another, surely it is not all that discreditable for me to be wrong over a six-month period in regard to these figures.</P>

      <P>From every platform, from every commentator throughout the whole media, this Government during the past few months have been barraged with advice to cut current Government expenditure and we have sought to do that.  We have worked long, hard and patiently at doing so.  Then when we produce figures which show that we are trying to keep Government expenditure under some sort of control in 1981 Deputy FitzGerald can only say that the figures are misleading and false.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the House that there is a very basic and fundamental dishonesty in Deputy FitzGerald's approach to this budget.  On the one hand he runs with every hare for additional expenditure; on the other hand he hunts with every hound for cutting Government expenditure and reducing the budget deficit.  Let him make up his mind.  If he wants to pander to the PAYE sector and give them more concessions than we have given or if he wants to pander to the farmers and do far more for them than we have done, let him say so and quantify what he would do, but let him not, at the same time, try to put forward the inconsistent argument that he would cut Government expenditure and reduce the budget deficit.  These two things are not compatible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither of the two Opposition leaders made any reference to the international scene.  I want to remind the House that this budget is brought forward in very difficult world trading circumstances.  In one of this morning's papers there is a statement by Count Otto Lambsdorff, <Col N="597" /> Economics Minister of the German Bundesrepublik, and I quote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The times of the easy life have passed for the time being,&rdquo; Lambsdorff said, presenting a gloomy economic forecast for the coming year. The report predicted negative growth in the economy and little narrowing of the country's £7,000 million current account deficit, the largest of any Western industrialised country.</P>
    <P>That is the situation in which the German economy finds itself.  Up to recently the German economy was one of the strongest and most powerful in the world. If the German economy finds it difficult to come through this recession &mdash; I need not point to Northern Ireland or Great Britain and indicate the economic difficulties being experienced there &mdash; there must be a greater understanding of the efforts of this Government to bring our small vulnerable open economy through this recession.  There must also be a greater appreciation of the efforts we have made in this budget to try to support the economy through the difficult year of 1981 to the best of our ability while, at the same time, making sure that those people who have a special priority in our planning, the poor and the underprivileged, are reasonably well looked after in this budget.</P>

      <P>We just heard a very general, bland speech full of pious aspirations and appeals to the people's better nature, but what we did not hear, and what we never heard when these appeals were made over the past few years, was any clue as to what government is about, which is making effective decisions for the management of this country.  That bland, general, superficial appeal, rounded off by a fairly petty and somewhat ill-tempered conclusion, indicates <Col N="598" /> to all thinking people that this Government have been, and presently are, without leadership or direction in the economic affairs of this country.  The overriding impression created by this budget is that the Government are engaged in some kind of blind man's buff, a game of pin the tail on the donkey, with the Minister for Finance not just blindfolded but blindfolded in a fog.</P>
      <P>The credibility of the Government, already faltering and tottering, has, in my view, been shattered.  The people know that despite the bland assertions the agonised appeals to people's better nature, as if somehow the public took a perverse delight in making it difficult for Fianna Fáil, and the ever present difficult international situation whenever they are in power, as if all around a sea of troubles particularly assails this party in power &mdash; although in the period 1973-77 when real honest endeavour was being made in the face of extremely hostile and destructive criticism no reference or concession was made to the international recession &mdash; the truth is that this budget has befuddled and confused everybody.</P>
      <P>It disappointed every sector of the community.  It failed the industrial and commercial sectors because it does not offer any way forward out of this spiralling depression of unemployment statistics. It has been in stark contrast to the pledges and promises made by this party when they came into power.</P>
      <P>I do not take particular relish from the dismal failure of this Government to date.  I am an Irishman first and I want this country to succeed and prosper. Therefore I do not exact great glee from the Taoiseach's admission that he was wrong a few months ago at Ennis, although he carefully avoided saying how he was wrong about other figures which even then were clearly wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process of selectivity carefully underlines and permeates the whole background to this budget.  All the background papers, the illusory investment plan, the so-called &ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget, 1981,&rdquo; all have an unprecedented degree of inconsistency and contradiction &mdash; the blind man's buff, the pin the tail on the donkey syndrome, <Col N="599" /> a Minister for Finance wandering in a fog without plans or vision.  I do not blame him; he is not his own master.  No one in this House or outside truly believes he was the author of that incoherent and confused document we listened to yesterday &mdash; a cumbersome, lumbering presentation of contradictions, innocuous statements and pious aspirations.  However, when we got down to the fine print we saw that the essential definition of government, the steel of knowing how to run a country and that you have the people with you, the steel of a united party behind a coherent plan, all that was missing because, of course, it does not exist.</P>
    <P>We know the Government gave certain undertakings when they came into office. Their budgetary strategy, which is not merely a fiscal statement but also a social statement, is an example of how they undertake the implementation of those pledges.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with consumer prices.  In their election programme Fianna Fáil undertook a nine point programme to deal with prices, which could be summed up in point No. 2 which says:</P>
    <P>Government policy must be directed towards discouraging increased costs and prices in all areas where it has control or influence.  This policy has been absent in the last four years.</P>
    <P>I will not bore the House by referring in detail to the other eight undertakings but they included reference to overhauling the National Prices Commission, investigating middlemen's margins, the full dissemination of relevant information at least once a week, controlling monoplies by legislation, considering price control as an important matter and inquiring into the accounting practices of the ESB.</P>
    <P>The public know that for the first time ever price increases are totally out of control.  Their sense of depression and confusion is compounded by the fact that there is no evidence to suggest that this Government by their day-to-day policy or budgetary strategy have any interest in, concern about or idea of how such proposed increases should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>There was a time &mdash; and this may be a <Col N="600" /> central point emerging from this debate &mdash; when a budget was a meaningful economic statement, usually annually, of a Government's thinking.  Government strategy was revealed in these annual statements.  That is no longer the case, because the concept of annual budgeting has been debased.  We no longer have this annual major exercise.  Indeed, the moneys spent and misspent yesterday can be contrasted with the hundreds of millions of pounds which were run through this House in supplementary estimates during the year, without any major demur, except a sense of exasperation that we did not have a choice.</P>
    <P>In the area of prices, the budget in itself, by the admission of the Minister for Finance, who could hardly be alleged to have erred on the liberal side and by the admission of economists and today's media, immediately adds about 2½ per cent to the consumer price index.  When the cost of increased fuels, increased petrol charges, increased postal charges has percolated through the economy, when they have snowballed and added to the various costs of servicing industry and business, the true impact of the budget on prices will be far closer to 5 per cent. We should add to this not just yesterday's increases but the increases which have been occurring daily and the increases already applied for and awaiting approval from the National Prices Commission. We were told yesterday in the budget that the increases in fuel charges would not be levied on CIE.  More selectivity. Is it not a fact that there is at present awaiting the nod of the NPC &mdash; which of course will occur, and then the approval of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, who could sometimes be construed as almost taking a perverse pleasure in such increases &mdash; a proposed 25 per cent increase in respect of CIE increased fares?</P>
    <P>In the first week of January we saw very substantial rises in petrol, coal, oil products, town gas, bottled gas and in alcoholic drink.  Even more is to follow. Petrol jumped by 6p to 11p a gallon depending on the brand.  Coal rose by £4 a ton to £83 in Dublin, a jump of 14 per cent.  We had increases in foodstuffs and <Col N="601" /> this week we had increases in a very essential item &mdash; babyfood.  Budget by instalment is the manner in which the Government offloads its economic mismanagement, its inability to tame our economy.  Among its most distressing omissions is not that it has actually failed, because failure is a human trait, but that it has apparently shown the public it does not care.  There is no attempt at Government beyond these bland appeals.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough.  The people now know, as never before, that those who are supposed to deliver, those who had the magic and who rose to power in the Government in a rush of blood to the head occasioned by fears for their survival, are not magical &mdash; they are myth. There is indecision, changes of mind, admissions of being wrong, no plan, the total rejection of the Fianna Fáil manifesto and the rejection of even the symbol of economic planning and development, both in the person and in the office of the former Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue. The truth is the Government are stumbling from crisis to crisis and, on its way, causing inestimable damage to the economy. This is the Government that was going to get the country moving again. The only things that are moving are dole queues shuffling inexorably forward.  It used to be fashionable for this party to tell the Government between 1973 and 1977 that the true unemployment position was 50,000 greater that the admitted unemployment figures.  If that criterion is to apply today, it means that there are 170,000 people out of jobs.  Where, in yesterday's budget, was there concern for these people?  Where was the major investment in basic economic and commercial infrastructure which would regenerate the economy?  It was the worst of all worlds.  Timorously taking from here, timorously giving to there.  There is no strategy, no coherence or no plan. How could there be?  You can only plan if you have the resources and if you have not abused those resources.</P>
    <P>The level of borrowing of the Government, unprecedented as it is, has simply meant that the Government have mortgaged their chance already of borrowing their way out of trouble.  Borrowing, in <Col N="602" /> itself, is not a sin.  It is a sensible, economic strategy if that borrowing is used properly but it was not used properly.  It was misspent and frittered away.</P>
    <P>One cannot help but have a certain sympathy for a Minister for Finance at present.  They should change the doors of the office of the Minister for Finance for a revolving door, they come and go so quickly.  It is an indication of the seriousness with which the Government approach the job that they have managed to change their Minister for Finance three times in a matter of months, in the same way as the present Minister for Finance will shortly be changed at the first available opportunity given to the people.</P>
    <P>I know, the Minister knows and the public know, not just from the crestfallen faces and the slightly worried brows of Fianna Fáil backbenchers, who are sensitive to the true mood of the people, and they knew yesterday in their hearts that the budget could be the beginning of the end for them.  I am not primarily concerned about the political survival of either side of the House, only for the well-being of the people.</P>
    <P>Yesterday was a bad day for the country. The commentators, since then, have exhibited their inability to understand what is meant by this budget.  The only conclusion to be deduced is that it was made up as the Minister went along, in the hope that he would not offend too many people in case there might be an early election and to give him more time to hope, Mr. Micawber like, that something would turn up on the day.  Something rarely does and it will not on this occasion because the primary blame which the Government must accept, is for having spent three and a half years in charge of the country and bringing it to a state unprecedented in its history.</P>
    <P>In recent times, the value of the £ has fallen, the number of tourists has fallen, consumer spending is down, investment in machinery is down, the volume of building and foreign earnings is down and the volume of the IR£ has fallen against all our major trading partners, averaging, according to the Government's own figures, in the order of 10 per cent, but, <Col N="603" /> most dramatically of all, against sterling, the currency of our biggest single export market.  The fall against sterling was 22 per cent and is still falling.  The punt is now the sick old woman of Europe, so much so that serious questions relating to our position in the EMS, relating to the revaluation of the Irish punt, to the very economic stability of this country now come into question.</P>
    <P>Consumer spending fell in volume by 1 per cent, investment in machinery and equipment fell by 10 per cent in volume, while in building and construction the decline was about 8 per cent, all of these areas essential to economic progress and job creation.  There was a drop in real terms in foreign earnings from tourism, with the total number of tourists down which in itself is extraordinary when one considers the state of the punt; even that we cannot do right.</P>
    <P>There was a volume drop in imports of capital goods and materials for further production, clear barometers of the economic well-being of a country.  Output of manufacturing industry showed an overall drop having risen in the first quarter of the year.  Of course the balance of payments is becoming increasingly derisory. Even though the Government were saying in mid-November that the deficit would be smaller than in 1979 it finally totalled £750 million, an increase of £20 million, despite what the Government said in 1979.  But then this Government have never valued very highly what they have ever said on any issue.  There is one memorable line in the election manifesto of that party in relation to industry and job creation based on natural resources and I quote it exactly:</P>
    <P>There are tens of thousands of secure jobs only waiting to be created. The former Taoiseach of the Fianna Fáil Party said unequivocally and unambiguously in an RTE interview that if, at the time of the next election, there were to be in excess of 100,000 people unemployed in this country then the people would be justified in changing the government. No amount of ambiguity or double talk can eradicate or confuse that inducement to the people of this country. <Col N="604" /> If, therefore, the perhaps somewhat jaundiced desire for a change of government on this side of the House cannot be accepted too willingly by the public, at least let them listen to a man who is universally accepted as being someone who worked long and hard with some degree of real concern on his part for the people of this country; he said: change governments.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the paper entitled &ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget 1981&rdquo;, which is a Government paper &mdash; even allowing for its erroneous statements in some cases, as has already been pointed out by our party leader and by our spokesman on Finance, Deputy Bruton, allowing for that tendency to hyperbole, shall we call it &mdash; it is nevertheless a damning document, one which, on every front where economic regeneration is important, admits to failure, despite the clarion call in the introduction to their election manifesto in 1977 which said:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes that this manifesto gives young men and women their best chance to participate in the building of a better and stable future.  It is a blueprint for leadership which, by the firm and just administration of law, esteem for enterprise, and concern for the individual, will bring back that sense of confidence and interdependence which is essential to the growth of peace and social progress, and of our cultural heritage and place among the nations of the world.</P>
    <P>Prices were to be tackled and, as for jobs, there were tens of thousands of secure jobs only waiting to be created.  In my constituency there are, in places, 60 per cent of the able-bodied men without work and the best we can do for them is to offer them an increase in their payments of the order of the rate of inflation of last year.  These men and women, indeed not just in my constituency alone but all over the country, are entitled to work, to the dignity of work, and it is the job of the government of the day to make sure that work is created.  How can they do that because they made false promises, created artificial expectations incapable of being fulfilled and in respect of which they are now reneging one by one? <Col N="605" /> One of the more colourful promises in 1977 was the abolition of car tax.  Gradually it has insinuated its way back.  Yesterday, for most car owners, car tax returned at a rate comparable to that obtaining when this Government took office.  Therefore, car tax is back.  I am waiting for the Government to produce a house registration fee to replace rates and I would like the Minister to deny specifically that consideration is being given to that scheme in the frantic efforts of this Government to get money from anywhere.</P>
    <P>The Government's paper &ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget 1981&rdquo; admits, in case it needed admitting which it hardly does, that unemployment rose during the year, that the current budget deficit and the Exchequer borrowing requirement exceeded the budget estimate. What did not?  Consumer spending is estimated to have declined in volume by about 1 per cent in 1980.  This estimate is supported by the trend of the retail sales index.  In relation to current spending of public authorities expenditure by them on current goods and services showed a volume increase of about 2 per cent compared with the previous year. But gross domestic fixed capital formation is estimated to have declined by 9 per cent in volume in 1980.  Investment in machinery and equipment fell by 10 per cent in volume while in building and construction there was a decline of about 8 per cent. 1980 it says, tongue in cheek, was another difficult year for tourism.  It is estimated that the total number of out-of-State tourists fell by 4 per cent in 1980 compared with 1979.  When one takes into consideration the extra money being spent on our efforts to lure tourists here the cost per tourist now is an all-time high.</P>
    <P>In relation to the balance of payments the paper says that there was a net capital inflow of about £1,120 million.  Of course what it does not say is that most of that is simply Government borrowing, though the implication is that somehow it is a spontaneous investment of financial and other confidence in the infrastructure and future of this country.  It is not that.</P>
    <P>In agriculture, for the second consecutive <Col N="606" /> year, output has been adversely affected.  Of course the weather and so on are blamed.  I do not want to delay the House unduly except to give those two clear examples of the way the Government have mismanaged this country: a 37 per cent increase in the cost of living in two years, an increasing unemployment pattern of the order at present in real terms of 150,000 unemployed, that despite the pledges and undertakings in their manifesto of 1977.  If this side of the House are asked can we do better the answer must be an unequivocal &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and, even for the fainthearted, it can reasonably be concluded that we could hardly do worse.  Every document the Government put their hands to gets into this area of duplicity.  Let us look for a moment at the document entitled &ldquo;Second National Understanding for Economic and Social Development&rdquo;.  Indeed one of the major by-products of yesterday's budget may very well be the breakdown of this national understanding.</P>
    <P>We note the undertakings given here to create jobs, to invest in, for example, local authority building and construction. We note the Government agreement that the question of family income supports warrant special attention.  None of these has been implemented.  Things are going to be made more difficult by the increasing tailspin into which the commercial and industrial life of this country will be put by the increased levies in yesterday's budget.</P>
    <P>We all know in this House that if we are to have full employment we must have a healthy agricultural sector and a healthy industrial sector.  The Government unfortunately seem to be fainthearted in these areas and gave a little to some but not enough to anyone.  In re-reading the Minister's statement I came to the conclusion that it had been rewritten suddenly and abruptly for some reason.  It is not a clear-sighted coherent statement of financial policy.  It is erratic and contradictory and when one reads all the cumbersome waffle about, for example, the Government deploring the growth in unemployment which has been forced upon them, one is amazed.  That is the line of the Opposition.  Let the <Col N="607" /> Government not waste their time declaring it but let them go and solve it.  We heard the same again this morning from the Taoiseach, referring to the question of industrial peace, when he endeavoured consciously or otherwise to evoke memories of an American President when he advised the people of this country to ask not what the country could do for them but what they could do for the country.  It is sound advice but it has to be accompanied by real evidence on the part of the Government that they mean business.</P>
    <P>One could argue about the budget deficit, not about the basic miscalculation because no one miscalculates on these matters, but about the basic attempt at hoodwinking the public by implying that the deficit is reducing.  I want the Minister to say categorically whether or not the full year figures will in fact show a substantial increase on the figures in the budget.  Is it not the case that the figures in the budget and the figures in the Taoiseach's presentation refer to the calendar year and that the true figure would in fact show a very substantial increase to about £640 million?</P>
    <P>We are losing jobs at the rate of 200 per working day.  I truly wish there was some way we could stop this spiral because the effects on the economy will be disastrous.  The social welfare increases, welcome in themselves, change nothing.  All they do is attempt a holding operation.  The position of social welfare recipients has been in the month and a half prior to the budget, and will be in the next months, largely eroded by the inflationary impact of price increases, particularly of consumer foodstuffs and basic essentials such as fuel, clothing, light and, in some cases, transport.  By no stretch of the imagination can the Government be said to have done anything other than fail abysmally on prices and on jobs.</P>
    <P>There are other failures.  I wish I could point to something in yesterday's budget about which one could be enthusiastic, and I say that genuinely.  One is always pleased to see money being spent in the direction of encouraging young people. <Col N="608" /> Well, that marginal expenditure is somehow evocative of the kind of gimmick that we saw in a similar stroke last year in relation to the spending of a similar sum, if I remember correctly, on hurleys. We have even in the budget the usual, though somewhat declining tradition, of tugging the forelock in the direction of the Irish language.  Why it is necessary for a Minister to lapse into Gaelic in a few derisory lines in the middle of his budget speech is beyond me.  It is another indication of hypocrisy not just of the Government but of many people on this island in relation to the question of the language.</P>
    <P>But the real issues, as always, are issues of economic well being and these issues are being mishandled by the Government. There is a deficit of £651 million though the Government will have us believe it was £547 million.  The Book of Estimates &mdash; and no one in this House will deny this &mdash; will be supplemented and complemented month in and month out by large Supplementary Estimates. This book is a fiction of the Minister and the Minister knows that.  It is there for putting a face on budget day except that in this case it has failed.</P>
    <P>The central issue therefore in this budget is the credibility of our Government, their inability to manage the economy. They have shown and are showing no idea of coherent strategy, no plan. They have not got a plan that the Opposition might disagree with; they have no plan at all.  This is all being done with mirrors and it changes all the time even more rapidly than the number of changes in the Office of the Minister for Finance. The economy is increasingly out of control and so we get these straw catching appeals in yesterday's budget.  We have reference to the discovery by the Minister for Finance of the ailing seed potato industry.  This Government's hope apparently is in the seed potato industry.  Every little hope and every possible option is eked out but not the central ones, the ones central to the management of our economy, which are control of inflation, some attempt at regulation of incomes, all in the context of a clear economic strategy which should also have a significant <Col N="609" /> place for redistribution of resources where they are long overdue.  But that kind of fundamental change is indeed a luxury in the aftermath of a budget which is not even a fundamental document but which is largely cosmetic in nature.</P>
    <P>The burden of indirect taxation shows another way in which the Government are failing.  The old reliables, as they are known, regularly get hit and in some cases I am not going to cry too many tears.  But does it not show the barrenness of ideas when the only resource of our sovereign Government, this Government with an unprecedented majority, when it comes to increasing taxation is to extract money from an area in which despite its being arguable that there might be discretion is for many many people not discretionary? The old reliables are taxed because they are precisely that, reliable because people in fact, though they may say they have a choice, have not in relation to cigarettes, alcohol, transport. There is a very interesting feature in the Book of Estimates and in yesterday's budget which it is worthwhile pointing to and that is that certain ministries did better than others.  The ministries which seemed to me to fare better were those where it might be said, with respect to the others, that there was a certain independence of spirit.  The Ministers who are arguably more compliant got less. Those interested in that thesis can look it up for themselves.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt about who wrote this document yesterday and it was not the Minister for Finance.  On three occasions this morning, the Taoiseach referred to the need to curb the current budget deficit. Despite that and the attempt at hoodwinking, the reality is that the opposite prevails.  Why do the Government not come clean and honestly present the facts?  Why try to obscure the facts? Prices are increasing on a frightening scale and inflation has been increasing at the rate of 18 or 19 per cent.  These are the hallmarks of an economy that has gone out of control especially when allied to the increasing jobless total.  The prospects for unemployment are staggering when one adds the numbers who will <Col N="610" /> leave school in six or eight months' time to the Government's pathetic commentary in their Economic Background to the Budget, in relation to jobs.</P>
    <P>They say that competitiveness is also of vital relevance to employment prospects in 1981, as if this is new thinking, on the assumption that domestic pay costs are in line with the terms in the understanding, which is highly arguable in view of the clear jolt which the national understanding received yesterday.  They say that the employment increases resulting from the improvement in economic performance should offset job losses and at the same time absorb a substantial increase in the labour force.  They also say that in addition the existing level of unemployment could be reduced if through improved competitiveness job losses could be kept to a minimum.  They will not be and this talk about improved competitiveness is like a signpost to nowhere.  What inducements were there in the budget to improve competitiveness? Where is the encouragement to improve productivity?</P>
    <P>When we on this side of the House talk about the frightening growth in the public service and the fact that we are now paying 60p in every £ of taxation to fuel the public service, it does not mean that we would support or wish for cutbacks in the service being provided.  We are talking about the clear need for the Government to put their house in order, to increase productivity in the public service, to set targets for the public service and to reduce waste.  That could be done and no one would have to suffer the loss of the benefits provided by the public service.</P>
    <P>On page 9 of the Economic Background to the Budget we are told that it is estimated that, on average, during 1980 there was little or no change in the 1979 level of employment, an increase in services employment being offset by a decline in agricultural and industrial employment. That is simply not true.  There was a reduction in service employment of the order of 11,000 and it is without foundation to suggest that there was not a net decrease in employment.  The compensatory increases do not amount to the figure in the budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> Our leader made a point this morning which was not properly answered by the Taoiseach that is that there is increasing unhappy evidence of a lack of factual objectivity about the background papers on which we as responsible parliamentarians are supposed to make our judgments. There are untruths in these documents and if the Minister wants a list of them he can have them.  I do not like that trend and it does a disservice to all of us. Yesterday's budget and the reaction to it is a clear and timely indication that this Government's days are numbered.  I do not know how long they have nor does anybody else although I expect that that concern is uppermost in the minds of those who framed the budget.  As a present Minister of the Government used to say &ldquo;The people out there know&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that there is no hand on the tiller and that the economy is drifting, lumbering from crisis to crisis.  It is a pity because people are longing for leadership and for feeling that the country is going somewhere.  We have so many potential resources.  Indeed the Fianna Fáil Manifesto refers to the need for the State to retain control of the conversion process of minerals, oil and gas and gave the impression that there would be a modern Wells Fargo.  It has not happened because somewhere along the line the train has run off the tracks.  Much of this is attributable to the debilitating effect of the internal problems of Fianna Fáil.  Any party is entitled to internal problems but they should be sorted out in opposition. Enough is enough.  We have had this wrangling, this division, this incoherence, this contradiction for about a decade in the Government party.  The time has come to call a halt.  The country is suffering.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil election manifesto of 1977 will be a monument to broken promises in our political history.  I defy the Minister to point to the fulfilment of the pledges in the manifesto in any area, not just in the economic area and to say whether or not the strategy in the manifesto and its implementation is still the policy of this Government.  It cannot be. This budget does nothing more than buy <Col N="612" /> time until the Government expect to have an opportunity to begin again.  It will not work.  Our people are enlightened and are willing to give any Government a chance.  This Government got their chance and fluffed it.  At the end of their three and a half years in Government unemployment is up, it is the age of a 75p punt and the 80p pint, our currency is the most devalued in the EMS and our rate of inflation in the CPI is the highest of any nation in Europe, except perhaps Italy.  That is part of their shameful record.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why a Government brazenly tries to put a good face on it instead of saying that the country is in difficulty and that they need everybody's help.  The Minister pretends, ostrichlike, that it will be all right on the day.  The Minister for Finance tells us that the Government deplore the growth of unemployment that has been forced on us. That is another anaemic example of the pathetic lack of ideas in this weighty document.</P>
    <P>The people want to know when the Government will start running the country instead of running in front of the country, whether they can control the economy or let it control them, whether they can honestly face up to the issues of the day, draw a line and say no further in certain areas and when they can honestly point to injustices in our society and correct them.  The St. Vincent de Paul Society made a very good submission prior to the budget and pointed out the real needs of people in this category. I do not want to sound churlish or begrudging.  We are grateful for small mercies.  I want, however, to make it clear, lest it might go abroad, that nothing has changed for people in this category that people in some cases still have incomes which will buy a pair of shoes in the same way as their incomes bought them this time last year.  The price of a pair of shoes has gone up and their incomes have gone up in order to buy the same pair of shoes that is all it means.</P>
    <P>In the appendix to the document issued by the St. Vincent de Paul Society, in relation to the family allowances of a <Col N="613" /> two-child family on average earnings, where they depict the family allowance as a percentage of gross average earnings for the country as a whole we find an interesting table.  It shows that the percentage in Belgium is 14.1, Holland 9.1, Britain 8.7, France 8.4, Luxembourg 7, West Germany 6, Denmark 3.9, Italy 3.1 and, at the bottom of the league, Ireland with 2.2 per cent.  That is a family allowance as a percentage of gross family earnings throughout the country.  Yesterday's increase, which does not take effect for many months after the prices increases take effect, will improve that picture fractionally but, on my calculations, not enough to remove us from the bottom position on that ladder.</P>
    <P>The distribution of resources of wealth here is as unjust now as it was a week ago or a month ago.  It is important also to say, in relation to what might very well be a good public relations exercise in regard to Social Welfare, that the position during this decade has disimproved for people in that category.  There is a lot of soft talk about abuse in this area.  We know there are abuses in this area but we do not hear the same shrill, strident demands to get rid of corruptions at board level or certain other levels. Unemployment benefit as a percentage of average disposable income for a married couple plus two children in 1973 was calculated to be 59.9 per cent.  What is the position in 1980?  It is 46.4 per cent plus yesterday's increase.  A myth is being propagated that we are improving the lot of these people.  When you add that very pathetic picture to the fact that there is no suggestion in the budget statement as to how those new jobs are to come about all one can say is that the prospect of people without jobs is very grim indeed.</P>
    <P>It does not give me any pleasure to speak in this manner but I suffer from the same exasperation as many other people in the community.  I have listened to what the commentators have had to say since yesterday to see if one could find some pattern or some strategy out of the garbled mumblings we heard but I cannot find any except holding on steadily until we get over the next crisis or the next election.  I know that there are people on <Col N="614" /> the Government benches as well as on those benches who have a better vision of our future and a brighter dream for the people than that lamentable dereliction of Government duties.</P>
    <P>I know the country has the resources in manpower and natural resources as well as the will to do a lot better than the pathetic example of Government we have had since the present Taoiseach came into power.  He has shown behind the veneer of panache an inability to make choices, a lack of courage in the choices he makes and running away from the responsibility he fought so long, so hard, and, on occasions, viciously enough, to achieve.  That is a pretty bad record.  The time of the Government is up.  I hope the days of the country are not numbered before that and that the mess which is being created, soaring price increases and rising joblessness, will not be irreversible in a short period.</P>
    <P>The people deserve better than they got yesterday.  They are entitled to know where the country is going and where the Government think they are taking it.  If yesterday's document is any example the outlook is very bleak because nobody seems to have any idea.  The image I have of the Minister for Finance, apart from having a prepared script handed to him to read, is of a man lost in a fog and blindfolded.  I do not believe he has any idea of where he is going.  I hope there is not too much destruction before the people have a chance to articulate their concern, and disappointment because the Government got their chance.  They are not taking it and their time is running out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal, first of all, with some of the points raised by Deputy Keating, Deputy FitzGerald in particular and also echoed by Deputy Cluskey.  It is an affront to the House for the Leader of Fine Gael to come in here and present a speech like the one presented by Deputy FitzGerald today and attempt to mislead the House by suggesting that in some way the figures, to which the Minister for Finance has referred, in particular the deficit figure, <Col N="615" /> are false.  Deputy Keating said there is an attempt at hoodwinking, that there is a list of untruths in the speech, in arriving at the deficit figure.  Deputy Cluskey echoed that and lauded Deputy FitzGerald for his incisive and very brilliant mind in seeing through those figures and the pitfalls and wrongs which are in them.</P>
      <P>This is very like what we heard before from Deputy FitzGerald.  I was surprised to see that he came out so blatantly this time and he was so obviously wrong that it is quite disconcerting.  He said that in effect the true current budget outturn should be £651 million on a full year basis.  He said that this is not the full year picture but then said it is the picture for the calendar year 1981.  What year are we discussing?  Surely Deputy FitzGerald recognises that the accounts for the year under the Constitution, and as practised here, year in and year out, are prepared for the particular year in question.  If you want to consider this year as part of next year, you have to take totally different sets of figures and make totally different comparisons.</P>
      <P>I find this particularly interesting because he gives a list and I assume it is part of the list to which Deputy Keating referred.  He says that social welfare increases totalling £111 million for nine months of 1981 would amount to £148 million in a full year.  From that he deduces that £37 million extra is not taken into account by the Minister for Finance.  Of course that is nonsense, because the full year arises next year only, and many other things arise in the context of next year.</P>
      <P>Let us look at what is likely to happen in relation to the figure he mentions for next year.  He has not told the House that, because of the income from pay-related social insurance and the increase to £8,500 which is part of the national understanding agreement, an additional £53.3 million will be brought in, which more than swallows this famous £37 million to which Deputy FitzGerald referred.  The whole thing is a nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it grossly misleading and most irrelevant to the business of this House. Unfortunately, it has probably gone out <Col N="616" /> for the evening papers or perhaps tomorrow morning's papers.  It is a sad reflection on the Leader of the Opposition that he has to indulge in this kind of hoodwinking, if you like, and chicanery to try to lead people astray.  I listened to Deputy FitzGerald here and in my room where I was doing some work.  I can understand that he is confused by the responsible attitude of the Government. I could pick various illustraions of that from what he said.  This is the last straw for the Leader of the Opposition who is supposed to have some understanding of economics.</P>
    <P>He brought in that figure of £37 million and tied it to this year's deficit.  He said we were supposed to bring that forward from next year into this year's deficit as part of a contribution towards raising the Minister's deficit from £515 million to £651 million.  I never in all my life heard such nonsense.  Hearing it in this House from the Leader of the Opposition is going a bit too far.  It is here in print and will appear on the record of the House. The less time given to that type of confusion the better.</P>
    <P>I have given the figures for social welfare. Even from glancing at them, and from a most trivial knowledge of the other figures mentioned, it can be seen that something similar happened in their case.  This is one of the reasons why Estimates for the Department of Social Welfare at the beginning of the year are often below the final outturn for the previous year.  The next year will take in the increase in income which is coming in any event without taking in budget increases at that time.  I felt I could not proceed without referring to that because it is a total nonsense and I am quite surprised at it.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Keating kept referring to the level of employment and the actual number of jobs.  I can add something to that as Minister for Social Welfare.  The level of employment contributions gives no indication that there was a fall-off in employment.  We receive the contributions from the employees and the level of the contributions does not indicate that there was a reduction in the number of contributors. <Col N="617" /> On the contrary, it indicates an increase. It is confusing because, on the one hand, we are losing some jobs and on the other hand, we are creating jobs.  We have a burgeoning population.  An interesting point I found as Minister for Social Welfare was that the contributions were increasing, indicating that the actual number at work was increasing.  I throw that in because I am aware of it from my own experience.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should stick to a logical argument.  He raised a point and I have said something which relates to it.  This budget clearly reflects the Government's realistic and responsible economic strategy for the coming year.  It is directed at the creation of a sound financial and economic base, greater equity in taxation, and the protection and improvement of the welfare of those who are most vulnerable in our community.</P>
      <P>Since becoming Minister for Health and Social Welfare I have constantly expressed my concern and that of the Government for the plight of the old, the infirm and those depending on social welfare payments and I have had the full support of the Government in the measures which have been taken to improve their position.  I believe that this budget gives clear evidence of my own and the Government's genuine concern in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the measures being taken in this budget for social welfare, that is, increases of 25 per cent on long-term payments and 20 per cent on short-term payments, almost 30 per cent on children's allowances and other improvements, the position of social welfare beneficiaries has been greatly improved. A particular example is that of the widow with three dependent children whose income, including her children's allowances, rises from £49.25 a week to £58.40 a week while the income of a couple receiving old age contributory pension rises from £40.15 a week to £50.20 a week.  Payments to social welfare recipients have now reached a level at which <Col N="618" /> we as a community are doing something worthwhile.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that the new rate for a couple receiving old age contributory pension is now over half the average earnings of workers in the industrial sector. The social welfare income of a widow with three children is also over half the average industrial wage.  The Exchequer provision for social welfare in 1981 is expected to be of the order of £582 million which is more than double the amount provided in 1977 and shows clearly the commitment of the Government to raise the real living standards of those who are genuinely in need in our society.</P>
    <P>This budget comprises six main elements covering the areas in which I have a special responsibility.  There is a general and very substantial increase in the rates payable to all social welfare beneficiaries; a major increase in the rates of children's allowances; a special package of improvements for the disabled to mark the year of the disabled; a fundamental development of the maternity benefits scheme; a further substantial development of the national fuel scheme and the extension of the free telephone rentals scheme to include recipients of disabled persons' maintenance allowances and United Kingdom retirement pensioners resident in this country.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Health and Social Welfare I have received many representations from individuals and organisations interested in promoting the welfare of social welfare beneficiaries and the disabled.  In conjunction with my colleagues in the Government I have chosen these major priority areas as the ones to which the available resources should be committed this year.  Naturally I would like to be in a position to meet all of the worthwhile suggestions which have been made to me.  Nevertheless I think Deputies will agree that we are making a further major and unprecedented commitment of resources to those who are most in need in our society.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the budget last year I referred to the very real financial difficulties facing the Government in 1980 and to the concern being expressed by <Col N="619" /> many groups and individuals that the inevitable pruning of public expenditure might lead to a standstill or, even worse, a cut-back in the social welfare area.</P>
    <P>However, as I stated at the time, these fears were shown to be groundless and rate increases of 25 per cent for long-term payments such as old age pensions and 20 per cent for short-term payments were greater than most people expected.  The increases of £1 a month for the first child and £1.50 a month for each other child in the children's allowances scheme were also much higher than anticipated and represented a percentage increase of about 28 per cent for a family of three children.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the cost to the Exchequer of those increases of £90.2 million was the highest such allocation ever made for the social welfare services in any budget.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the substantial increases given last year and having regard to the continuing economic difficulties throughout the world, it might have been considered that the allocation for social welfare improvements in this year's budget would be restricted. Instead, the Government have repeated last year's percentage increases in general social welfare payments and in the case of children's allowances have exceeded them.  This is a performance which must surely be accepted as a clear indication of the Government's concern for the problem of income maintenance for the lower income groups.</P>
    <P>The two successive increases of 25 per cent in long-term payments since April 1980 are equivalent to 56 per cent over this period.  There are also of course the special Christmas bonus payments of a double week to these groups.  Similarly, in the case of children's allowances the increase during the two years is 71 per cent for the first child and 63 per cent for the second and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>The Government have not only fulfilled their commitment to maintain the living standards of those depending on social welfare payments but have improved them in a very real way.  What is also important is that this has been <Col N="620" /> achieved with only the minimum increase in the pay-related social insurance contributions. The net increase in the overall rate of the contribution is only 0.25 per cent for both employers and employees. I am sure that neither the employee nor the employer will object to this small increase having regard to the worthwhile purpose for which the money is intended. For any employee earning £100 a week the additional contribution is only 25p a week.</P>
    <P>The increase in social welfare payments is 25 per cent on long-term payments and 20 per cent on short-term payments and the rates for dependent children have been increased by amounts ranging from 40p to 75p per child per week.  Those receiving increases of social welfare payments for dependent children will also get the children's allowance increases.  The increases in the general scheme of children's allowances are designed to ensure that lower paid workers as well as those in receipt of social welfare payments would benefit.</P>
    <P>The increases in children's allowances, which will operate from July 1981, are £1.50 for the first child and £2 for each other child.  The rate for the first child rises from £4.50 to £6 a month and for each other child from £7 to £9 a month. This is a percentage increase of 33.3 per cent for the first child and of 28.6 per cent for each other child.  For the average family with three children the percentage increase is 29.7 per cent from £18.50 to £24 a month.  For a widow with three children on a contributory pension the combined rate of her children's allowances and child dependant increases will go from £26.75 a week to £30.25 a week. In the case of a person on disability or unemployment benefit who has three dependent children the combined rate of payment for the children alone will go from £21.05 a week to £23.90 a week. These payments are of course in addition to the increased personal rates of payment being granted.</P>
    <P>The increases in long-term pensions and allowances will give a contributory old age pensioner under 80 years of age an additional £6.15 a week from April next, bringing his rate of payment to <Col N="621" /> £30.65 a week.  If he is married with a wife under age 66 he will get a total increase of £10.05 a week, bringing his pension rate to £50.20 a week.  If he is over 80 years of age or is living alone or if his wife is over age 66 the supplements payable in those circumstances are also being increased by 25 per cent from April next.  These increased rates also apply to retirement pensioners.</P>
    <P>Widows who have contributory pensions are getting an increase of £5.65 a week in their personal rates of pension, which are going from £22.50 a week to £28.15.  The rates for dependent children are being increased from £7.50 a week to £8.25 a week.  A widow with three dependent children will, therefore, receive a pension of £52.90 a week as from April next or £7.90 a week more than she now receives.</P>
    <P>On the non-contributory side the maximum personal rate of old age pension for a pensioner under 80 years of age goes from £21 a week to £26.25 a week, which is an increase of £5.25 a week.  If the pensioner is living alone he gets a supplement of £2.05 a week and if he is over 80 years of age he gets a further £1.90 a week.  Such a person would be entitled to a total pension of £30.20 a week from April next.  He would also be entitled to free travel, free electricity, free television licence, free telephone rental and fuel allowance.  If the pensioner is married his rate of non-contributory pension goes from £31.55 a week to £39.45 a week, which is an increase of £7.90 a week.  If he is over age 80 his rate of pension increases from £33.05 a week to £41.35 a week, which is an increase of £8.30 a week.  Where his wife would be entitled to a pension in her own right the income of the couple is being increased at the maximum from £42.00 a week to £52.50 a week or by £10.50 a week.</P>
    <P>Widows in receipt of non-contributory widows' pensions as well as recipients of deserted wife's allowances, unmarried mothers' allowances and prisoner's wife's allowances are getting an increase in the maximum personal rate of payment of £5.25 a week bringing the rate from £21.00 a week to £26.25 a week at April next.  The rate being paid for dependent <Col N="622" /> children is being raised from £6.90 a week to £7.50 a week.  A person in any of these categories having three dependent children will, therefore, have her weekly payments increased from £41.70 a week to £48.75 a week.  This is an increase of £7.05 a week.</P>
    <P>As I have stated previously, there is not quite the same need in the case of those receiving short-term welfare payments. Most of these payments are of short duration and many qualify for a pay-related supplement which has the effect of giving the recipient a high proportion of his former earnings.  He also has the prospect of resuming employment at some stage, a development which is not likely in the case of an elderly widow or an old age pensioner.  Bearing this in mind I think it will be agreed that an increase of 20 per cent in short-term payments is a considerable achievement and must be regarded as more than maintaining the living standards of the persons concerned.</P>
    <P>The increases in short-term payments mean that a recipient of disability or unemployment benefit will get a personal rate of payment of £24.55 a week compared with £20.45 a week at present.  This is an increase of £4.10 a week.  Where the recipient is married the rate goes from £33.70 a week to £40.45 a week, an increase of £6.75 a week.  There are also increases in the rates being paid for dependent children.  Thus, for instance, a beneficiary with a wife and three dependent children will go from £50.50 a week at present to £58.85 a week at April next.  This is an increase of £8.35 a week.</P>
    <P>On the assistance side recipients of unemployment assistance in urban areas will get an increased maximum personal rate of £20.40 a week at April next compared with £17.00 a week at present, an increase of £3.40 a week.  In rural areas the increase will be £3.30 a week.  There are also increases for child dependants and for adult dependants.  A recipient of unemployment assistance in an urban area who has a wife will go from £29.25 a week to £35.10 a week, which is an increase of £5.85 a week.  If he has a wife and three dependent children his rate of <Col N="623" /> assistance will go from £43.95 a week to £51.20 a week, an increase of £7.25 a week.</P>
    <P>I think that most Deputies will agree that these increases are substantial and must be seen as improving in a real way the situation of those depending on unemployment assistance.  I am glad to say also that all smallholders, including those on notional assessment of means, will get the 20 per cent budget increases this year.  In other words, all smallholders, regardless of whether they are in the factual or the notional system, will receive the full 20 per cent budget increase this year.</P>
    <P>Taken in conjunction with the increases in children's allowances which will operate from July next the provision made by the Government in this budget for social welfare beneficiaries represents a significant improvement in their capacity to maintain themselves and their families. If we look back to the situation which applied since 1977 this improvement becomes apparent.  I am including in this statement tables which illustrate the improvement and I will now quote the following examples:</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that FCA officers have recently received communications from the inspector of taxes demanding certified statements of earnings received while on FCA training for all years ending 6 April 1980 and the reasons why such demands are made at the present time in the light of the fact that all such officers incur far greater expense during the course of their voluntary duties than the amount of gratuity or payment received by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has recently been brought to my attention and I have been in touch with the Revenue Commissioners about it.  The position is that FCA officers receive two kinds of payments:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a gratuity in compensation for expenses incurred and</P>
      <P>(b)  payments for annual training and for any security duties performed.</P>
      <P>The gratuity is not chargeable to tax but the other payments are of the nature of emoluments and, as such, are liable to tax.  If the gratuity covers the expenses incurred by the officer he could not be given further compensation for those expenses by way of a deduction in computing the tax due on other payments made to him.</P>
      <P>If, however, expenses in excess of the gratuity payment are incurred by any officer particulars should be supplied to his inspector of taxes to enable such additional relief as may be due under the Income Tax Acts to be given.</P>
      <P>It may be added that, if an officer is aggrieved by the decision of the inspector, he is entitled to appeal against that decision to the Appeal Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Inspectors of taxes must from time to time issue requests for information to persons in receipt of income which is properly chargeable to tax.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1976, when <Col N="628" /> legislation was introduced to enable PAYE to be applied to payments from public service sources, tax has been deducted from whole-time FCA personnel and those engaged on continuous security duty.  In cases of this nature the Revenue Commissioners are supplied annually with particulars of payments made by the Department of Defence and in March 1977 they began the preparation of lists of people the Deputy is referring to.  That is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the normal situation is that an FCA officer does two weeks summer or winter training?  I served in the FCA for 21 years and can speak from personal knowledge.  Such an officer for the rest of the year is incurring considerable expense for which he gets no payment.  It should be accepted that any FCA officer who is merely getting a gratuity and two weeks emolument for annual training has no net benefit.  Would the Minister accept that this is a fair and reasonable approach leaving out those who are on semi-regular duty?  Would the Minister accept as a principle that such persons should not be hounded by the Revenue Commissioners? They are doing enough for the nation without getting that in response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained the position that the preparation of these lists began in March 1977.  I said in my reply that gratuities are exempt, that it is the other payments that may be calculated. I also understand that in practice no account is taken by the Department of Defence of payments less than £250.  A direction is being issued from the Revenue Commissioners that individuals who appear on Department of Defence lists will not be pursued for any years prior to their appearance on this list and sympathetic consideration will be given to the circumstances if back years payments are looked for.</P>

      <P>In case the Deputy gets the wrong impression, I said that the Revenue Commissioners had issued a directive.  I did not say the Minister had. The Minister does not have that kind of power.  The gratuity is exempted.  The question of the emoluments goes back to the presentation in March 1977 by the Department of Defence to the Revenue Commissioners of the amounts of payments in such cases.  Any sums less than £250 are not reported to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i>
        <Col N="634" /> I am obliged to the Minister.  I should like to point out that I understood the Minister for Foreign Affairs to state that it would be a breach of the directive to apply these funds to any county which was not a Border county.  For the Minister's information I should like to tell him that it is now being argued that because one can gain access through Sligo to Border counties it qualifies.  The Minister should bear in mind that that same argument could be made in relation to Dublin Airport or any other airport that is miles away from the Border.  The Minister should observe the directive strictly and apply all the funds to Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim and Donegal, the five Border counties.</P>

      <P>The detailed subhead information sought by the Deputy can more appropriately be raised when the group of Estimates for my Department comes before the Dáil.

      <P>How will the Office of the Minister for Finance cut travelling expenses in a year in which he, as Minister for Finance, increased petrol by 15p a gallon?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <P>The allocation under this subhead was £108,000 in 1980 and £100,000 in 1981.  I am satisfied that economies can be achieved in travelling and incidentals, and that subhead is not confined to just travelling.  It covers other incidentals.  The Deputy will have ample <Col N="637" /> opportunity of going into the details of all these Estimates as we did last year.  As a Government we made more time available than any recent Government for debating Estimates, even on a Friday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How were travelling expenses and other incidental expenses exceeded last year in a manner that the Minister considers they can be reduced this year, particularly in view of the increasing costs of travel inflicted upon the motorists, civil servants and others by himself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy obviously finds it hard to grasp the reply I have made and I do not intend to go into the details of the Estimates today. Travelling includes travelling and incidentals and I am going to insist that there will be economies in that part of the Vote in the coming year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one final question. Does the Minister expect a diminution in the rate of prosecutions by the Director of Public Prosecutions which will enable him to save £5,000 on general law expenses or does he anticipate postponing cases until next year so that the money can be provided next year instead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Deputy asked me that question and I will now give him the factual position.  As I said earlier, the Deputy will get all the information he needs when Estimates time comes along.  I will reply to his question now.  The allocation in respect of the general law expenses subhead which covers expenditure on various expenses in legal cases, expenses of State solicitors and costs awarded against the State in the above Vote, was £15,000 in 1980 and £10,000 in 1981.  In fact th expenditure in 1980 was about £10,000 and a repeat of this amount is estimated to be sufficient for 1981.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister why £15,000 appears in the Book of Estimates in view of the fact that the Book of Estimates is supposed to contain <Col N="638" /> the actual amount spent last year, not the estimated provision?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Book of Estimates in respect of the previous year is supposed to contain not the provision made at the outset of the year but the amount spent?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="639" /> Finance the expected rate of inflation for 1981 used for the purposes of determining the adequacy of the provisions for expenditure made in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No particular rate of inflation was used in determining the adequacy of the provisions for expenditure made in the Book of Estimates.  The voted capital services received an average increase of 23 per cent; the pay and pension estimates allow for the cost of both phases of the 1980 national understanding pay agreement; and service of debt and similar items were provided for on the basis of actual requirements.  The remaining items were settled on a cash basis which reflected generally the Government's intention to curb the growth in current expenditure.  It should be noted, however, that many of the expenditures included in the last category, for example grants at fixed rates, do not automatically increase as prices rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How can one realistically have a Book of Estimates with projections for the following year if one has no projection as to what the rate of inflation between one year and the next is going to be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is normal practice with regard to the Book of Estimates. The Deputy amuses me in some of this insinuation or suggestion because his party have constantly been critical of the necessity for curtailing current expenditure. I have committed myself to do it.  I intend to do it and I have said that there are items in the Estimates apart from pay, pensions and so on, grants for example, which do not necessarily have to carry any increase.  In other words it is a genuine effort to contain within reason, without doing it too severely, Government spending.  The Deputy will have adequate opportunity of discussing the details of the various items, the various subheads and the various votes when it comes to Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the cost of these organisations to <Col N="640" /> which he is making an allocation which has not reflected the rate of inflation will in fact be increased by the rate of inflation and that therefore he is proposing a reintroduction? In order to see the extent of the reintroduction it will be necessary for the Minister to make some projection as to the rate of inflation.  Therefore, I ask him if he does not consider that Estimates which have no projection at all for the rate of inflation during the year to which they apply are not genuine Estimates.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>Proposals which resulted from discussions between the Department of Education and representatives of the managerial and teacher organisations have yet to be placed before the Annual Congress of the Irish National Teachers Organisation next Easter for approval.  In the circumstances I am not yet in a position to issue a revised constitution of boards of management and rules of procedure and I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to comment in detail at this stage on aspects of the proposal referred to in the questions from the Deputies.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that there is widespread opposition to and criticism of his proposals both from parents and from clerics in particular in relation to the failure to ensure that parents can continue to play a part in the selection of assistant teachers?  Would he take that into account before making any final decision in the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a reasonable inference to be drawn from the proposals that the parties to them are all of opinion that the chairman of a board of management, who is usually an unmarried cleric, has a greater competence in the matter of appointing teachers of children than the parents?  How can the Minister reconcile that with the statement in the Constitution about the importance of parents and families as the primary educators of children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of parents is fully recognised, as the Deputy says, in the Constitution and in our practice in <Col N="645" /> the management of primary schools.  This is not a question of management at all but a question of selection of teachers. Certain agreed proposals came from this negotiating team and these will come up for consideration at the congress and it would not be helpful for me to make any comment on them.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say in what way the rights of parents are recognised, if as he has said they are recognised, when he has said that the proposals to be considered were made by a team which excluded any representatives of the parents?  Does that not involve totally excluding the rights of parents rather than their vindication according to the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The rights of parents are recognised in the fact that parents play a very important role in the management of schools.  That is precisely the point I made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The point the Minister made is that the proposals are now being put forward as a result of consultation between bodies of people excluding the parents.  How does that vindicate the rights of parents?  He has excluded them and he has three bodies of people, excluding parents, recommending that the parents should continue to be excluded from this function?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that the increased salary and conditions of employment recommended in the interim report of the review body on teachers' pay emphasised that the increased salary is justified only if it is overtly recognised that supervision, substitution, parent contact and pastoral care are integral parts of the teaching function and essential to the proper running of a school; if he agrees with that recommendation; if so, whether the provisions are part of the recently accepted increases in teachers' salaries and conditions of employment; if not, whether he intends to implement these recommendations; if so, when and how; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the statement in paragrah 2.6 of the Interim Report of the Review Body on Teachers' Pay adverted to in the question.</P>
      <P>In this connection I desire to state that it is recorded as follows in Agreed Report No. 4/80 of the Conciliation Council for Teachers in connection with an agreed recommendation for revised salary scales for teachers with effect from 1 September 1980:</P>
      <P>The Official Side said that they were prepared to offer the revised scale on the condition that it must be regarded as fully comprehensive and inclusive, that is, that no additional payment would arise in any circumstances in respect of any functions discharged by teachers as part of the duties of their posts in their individual schools.</P>
      <P>The review body also stated at paragraph 2.6 of their report that the response they would wish to see generated from the teachers is that the requirements in relation to supervision and so on would be met by them generously in the part they play in the moulding and development of their pupils.  I fully endorse this statement and I may add that I feel confident that the teachers will wish to associate themselves with it and co-operate in its implementation.</P>

      <P>The permanent accommodation available at the Waterford Regional Technical College is adequate for enrolments in the current school year. Additional accommodation is, however, being rented from the Department of Defence to allow for anticipated growth in enrolments arising from planned new educational schemes.  The lease of the premises for the additional accommodation is for a period of three academic years.  An application has not been received from the board of management for a permanent extension to the college. If such an application is received in due course with full supporting evidence as to the need for it, the matter will receive full consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) I consider that the 350 places approved for this school is adequate having regard to past enrolment trends and the numbers expected to be leaving primary schools in the area for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>(b)  In 1979-80 and 1980-81 the creation of 200 additional posts was authorised in second level schools over and above the normal allocation of teachers to cater specifically for remedial education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> These posts were allocated in the areas of greatest need from among the applicant schools.  It was not possible to include Rosscarbery Convent School in the allocation.</P>
    <P>(c)  The position is that this school already has grant-aided facilities for woodwork.  Grant-aid for metalwork facilities in this school would not be justified on the basis of the level of utilisation of such facilities which could be achieved.</P>
    <P>(d)  The pupil-teacher ratio of 19:1 in the case of secondary schools is of general application and may not be departed from in the case of individual schools.  Payment of part-time teachers, where such are employed may be made from the funds available from the capitation grant and the grant in lieu of tuition fees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to look again at his own projections, which I fear are based on financial considerations rather than on the actual facts.  Will the Minister accept that this school is an exceptional, unique school in an area where there is no vocational school?  In that situation it cannot be classified with the ordinary secondary school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;in the light of there being no vocational school in the area, this school fulfils a function greater than <Col N="656" /> the ordinary secondary school?  It takes in people of all types who would need special consideration from the remedial point of view; it takes in people who may not have an academic bent and therefore it needs support from the point of view of metalwork and woodwork.  Would the Minister accept that it is a special case and that special consideration should be given to it?  By merely classifying it with the ordinary secondary school it is not getting a fair deal, nor are the parents and, in particular, nor are the children of the area.</P>

      <P>I met a deputation from this school and know all about the school. It is a splendid school.  As the Deputy says, it is true that it is a special case. Cognisance is taken of this fact in the provision of the woodwork teachers for that school.  That is an unusual feature for secondary schools, as the Deputy knows.  Unfortunately, on the basis of a study of needs, we were not able to give a remedial teacher, as yet, to that school.</P>

      <P>First of all, I resent &mdash; although I know that the Deputy was being facetious &mdash; calling people who study woodwork and building construction hewers of wood in any kind of sense except the facetious sense.  The question of the metalwork teacher has been gone into, as the Deputy knows.  I have been in correspondence with him and with Deputy Walsh and with the principal of the school about it already.  We cannot, as of now, sanction a metalwork teacher for the school.  It is my ambition to increase the intake to the training college <Col N="657" /> for metalwork teachers, which will have a problem due to an extension of the course somewhat later on, so that every post-primary school eventually will be able to have metalwork and engineering workshop theory and practice, as it is called, with senior level teachers and building construction and woodwork teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be seen, for example, that an old age contributory pensioner received £13.90 a week in 1977, and now in 1981 he will receive £30.65 a week.  In the case of a widow on a contributory pension who received £12.60 a week in 1977, she will now receive £28.15 a week in 1981.  An old age non-contributory pensioner and his wife who also qualifies for a pension could receive between them at the maximum £23.50 a week in 1977.  In 1981 they will receive £52.50 a week.  This is real progres and however much we would like to see even greater amounts being paid to social welfare recipients it has to be accepted that the improvements made since 1977 are far in excess of what would be required by the rise in the consumer price index over that period.  I have no doubt whatsoever that under a Fianna Fáil Government rates of payment will continue to improve in future years by the greatest amounts which the economy can bear.</P>
      <P>Further evidence of the progress being made in social welfare is the level of payments here relative to those in the United Kingdom.  For many years the standard argument was the inadequacy of payments under our system <i>vis-á-vis</i> those payable in Great Britain or the North of Ireland.  That position has been overtaken now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> For example, in 1974 an old age contributory pensioner got £1.50 a week less than his counterpart in the United Kingdom by way of basic flat rate pension while a widow on contributory pension got £2.20 less than her counterpart.  This position has now largely been reversed. The rate of old age contributory pension from April 1981 will be £3.50 higher than the flat rate retirement pension in the United Kingdom while the Irish widow's contributory pension will be £1 more than the flat rate widow's pension in the United Kingdom.  However, earnings related supplements to pensions in the United Kingdom can raise pension levels there for those persons who qualify for them.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, it is my intention to publish a White Paper shortly on a new income related pension plan.  Our new rates of flat rate disability and unemployment benefits will also exceed the rates payable in the United Kingdom.  The only area in which the United Kingdom and indeed most of our partners in the EEC are still ahead of us is in the field of family allowances.  We are examining the question of family income support and of the possibility of channelling more support to poorer families.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, when comparisons are made between the rates of children's allowance in this country and the rates of family benefits in the United Kingdom, it must be remembered that in the United Kingdom the tax free allowances for children have been withdrawn.  The disparity between our provisions for children and those in the United Kingdom are therefore much less than it might appear and the substantial increase in the rates of our children's allowances last year and again this year, which will together cost some £42 million in a full year, show clearly the extent of the Government's efforts to bridge this gap.</P>
    <P>Last year I showed how the amount of Exchequer revenue allocated to social welfare had risen from £276 million in 1977 to an estimated £447 million in 1980. In fact the 1980 figure reached £497 million and it is expected that this will be £586 million in 1981.  Over a relatively <Col N="703" /> short period, therefore, the Exchequer subvention towards social welfare expenditure has more than doubled. Progress of this magnitude is unprecedented in our history and represents a real advance in caring for the aged and other needy groups.</P>
    <P>In order to concentrate on improving rates of payment, I have put forward just a few other improvements for inclusion in this budget.  They are, however, ones in which I have a particular interest and which I think are important.</P>
    <P>The first improvement is in the free fuel scheme.  There have been many exhortations from Deputies, voluntary organisations and others to increase the value of the fuel vouchers issued by health boards or under the urban schemes operated in certain cities and towns.  The case was made that the rise in the value of the vouchers did not match the rise in fuel costs.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that last October I introduced a national fuel scheme which was the first such scheme to apply to the whole country.  Approximately 29,000 additional pensioners and others are estimated to have benefited this year under this new scheme, bringing the total number of beneficiaries to 115,000.</P>
    <P>At the same time I increased the value of the vouchers under existing schemes by 33? per cent.  I did this precisely because of the rise in fuel charges and because I have a special interest in the plight of the aged and the infirm.  I am extremely pleased that the Government have decided to increase the value of the fuel vouchers by a further 50 per cent with immediate effect bringing the annual rate of assistance to £90.</P>
    <P>The supplementary vouchers for £1 per week will be printed immediately and distributed as soon as possible.  This, I am confident, will go a long way towards helping those eligible under the scheme to meet their heating requirements during the remainder of the heating season. In cash value the fuel vouchers will now be worth double the amount which applied last year.  This is a significant advance and one with which I am particularly <Col N="704" /> happy.  I regard the free fuel schemes as having a high priority in social welfare development and would wish to implement further improvements when resources permit.</P>
    <P>The next area of improvement is in the free telephone rentals scheme.  This scheme, as Deputies are aware, provides the full cost of the yearly telephone rental for persons aged 66 or over who are receiving a &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; allowance from my Department in addition to their pension or who would qualify for the &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; allowance but for the fact that they are living with one other person who is permanently incapacitated.  In the case of eligible persons who apply to have telephones installed my Department will pay the advance rental which is required by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs before a telephone can be installed.  In some cases this advance rental can be as high as seven years where the applicant is in a remote area.  In addition to the ordinary rental my Department will also pay any rental charges in respect of an amplifone, a plug, two sockets and a bellset where this is required by the applicant.</P>
    <P>As this is the year of the disabled the Government have decided to extend the scheme to cover recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowances who are living alone or with one other person who is also permanently incapacitated. This is a very desirable extension of the scheme which should prove to be a boon to those whose mobility is impaired and who up to now have had to rely on visits from others to provide them with aid in an emergency.</P>
    <P>We have also decided to include in the scheme a category of pensioners on whose behalf representations are constantly being made.  I refer of course to recipients of United Kingdom retirement pensions who are over age 66 and who are living alone.  Deputy Harte has raised this point several times.  These are mainly Irish nationals who happen to have spent the bulk of their working lives in Britain or Northern Ireland.  They are already treated on a part with recipients of pensions from my Department in relation to the schemes for free travel, free electricity, <Col N="705" /> free television licences and free bottled gas.  It is my belief that they are in the same need as other pensioners of having access to a telephone in an emergency and I am delighted that we have been able to include them in the free telephone rental scheme with effect from April next.</P>
    <P>An important development in social welfare is the introduction of a new scheme of maternity allowance for working women.  As Deputies know, the Minister for Labour will be introducing shortly legislation to give working women a statutory right to maternity leave.  I shall be providing a new and improved scheme of maternity allowance for those women.  The cost is included in the current budget provision for social welfare. I propose to ease the contribution conditions for the allowance; to extend the period of duration to 14 weeks and to grant an improved rate of pay-related benefit from the first day of the maternity leave period.  The scheme will be designed so that a woman on approved maternity leave will receive an overall weekly amount, including the value of any tax refund, corresponding to her average net earnings.  Furthermore, in order to ensure a reasonable level of payment to women on below average earnings and those whose earning power may have been reduced by sickness or unemployment, I am arranging that a minimum level of payment, related to average earnings of females generally, will be paid.</P>
    <P>Deputies will agree that this is a major social advance for women at work and together with my colleague, the Minister for Labour, I am proud to be associated with the introduction of this new scheme.</P>
    <P>The existing maternity scheme will continue to apply to women who do not qualify for paid maternity leave.</P>
    <P>The increases in social welfare payments announced in this budget speak for themselves and, as was the case last year, go well beyond what might have been expected in the present economic climate. In this connection I agree with the sentiments expressed in the Report of the National Economic and Social Council on Economic and Social Policy for the <Col N="706" /> period 1980 to 1983 that &ldquo;those most in need must not suffer from changing economic fortunes which they are powerless to control&rdquo;.  The Government have shown once again that they have a genuine concern for those relying on social welfare and will always do whatever is needed to protect their interests.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, particularly pleased with the very substantial package of improvements for disabled persons.  It is an indication to my own and the Government's commitment to improving the quality of life of the disabled and to meet the reasonable expectations of the organisations and interests working on their behalf.</P>
    <P>In preparation for this, the International Year of Disabled Persons, I established a national committee and an advisory council to promote and co-ordinate activities for the year.  At my request the committee submitted proposals to be considered by the Government in the context of the budget.  I am particularly pleased that in relation to income and benefits the Government's package for the disabled has gone even further than requested and in addition has provided a number of significant further improvements. The list of improvements, when taken together, is, by any standard, quite impressive.</P>
    <P>Allowances have all been increased by 25 per cent with effect from 1 April in the disabled person's maintenance allowance, the infectious diseases maintenance allowance and the blind welfare allowance. The total increase in these allowances since April 1980 is 56 per cent. No-one can deny that these are very real and worthwhile increases in the space of 12 months.  As Minister for Health and Social Welfare I have been concerned at the problems posed by the lack of an allowance for dependants of disabled persons.  With effect from 1 October next, an allowance of £10 per week will be payable in respect of each dependent adult and £4 per week in respect of each dependent child of those in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
    <P>I am especially pleased that I have been able to introduce this major improvement <Col N="707" /> in this year.  It is a recognition of the right of the disabled person to be treated on the same basis as other members of the community.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe in the desirability of supporting and caring for people in their own homes.  I greatly admire families who struggle with great determination and courage to provide loving care to their handicapped children at home, often at great personal cost to themselves and other members of the family.  It is, therefore, very gratifying that we have been able to increase the domiciliary care allowance from £35 to £45 a month, with effect from 1 April.</P>
    <P>The mobility allowance was first introduced in 1979 by this Government.  I am confident that the increase in the allowance from £150 to £200 per year and its extension to those who are living in Cheshire Homes and similar institutions will be especially welcomed.</P>
    <P>Transport problems in moving about feature very large in the difficulties faced by the disabled.  An increase from £1,000 to £1,500 in the motorised transport allowance will further help the disabled to obtain employment.  Also I am glad to see that in order to avoid imposing additional taxation on handicapped drivers the Minister for Finance has arranged that the existing rebates on motor vehicle fuel will be increased to match the duty increases which are being introduced.</P>
    <P>Isolation and loneliness are among the other serious hazards faced by the disabled. Recognising this the Government have decided to extend the free telephone rental scheme to all those in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance, who meet the conditions which apply at present, but without the age limit.  This is a very significant concession and one which will bring a greatly increased sense of security to many people who would never otherwise enjoy the benefits of one of our most widely used means of communication.</P>
    <P>The disabled do not want to be treated as people with less independence because of their disability.  They wish to live as normally as possible.  One of the frustrations for many disabled people who live <Col N="708" /> in residential care is the shortage of personal spending money.  Because of my concern to regularise their position, I am increasing the average spending or pocket money allowance from £2.50 to £4 per week from April.  In some instances it has been as low as £1.50 but the increased allowance of £4 will now apply all over.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increases in tax allowances which will benefit the disabled. These increases will be a benefit to blind persons, to those who are totally incapacitated and to parents of incapacitated children.  The request to remove VAT from wheelchairs and other medical aids for the disabled has been made by the national committee and by many organisations representing the disabled.  The complete relief from VAT announced in the budget will, no doubt, be acknowledged by the disabled as further evidence of the Government's practical concern for the disabled.</P>
    <P>These improvements mark a notable commencement to the International year of Disabled persons.  Later in the year, the green paper on services for the handicapped will be published.  I know that the disabled will look to this green paper as a major step in the development of the attitudes, the environment and the services which will enable them to achieve the goal of full participation and true equality.  I am confident that we will, as on this occasion, be able to meet these expectations and where possible, exceed them.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in supporting my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in this budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with a large number of commentators, I find this budget to be a considerable disappointment. Apart from the social welfare increases, which I welcome, there has not been anything of significance in this budget.  In many ways it is an exercise in national political deception.  It is customary for individuals in opposition to be critical of the budget but I strongly feel that the purpose of yesterday's budget, which is the continuation of a series of economic decisions taken since last October, <Col N="709" /> is to prepare the way for a general election around June and that the Taoiseach and the Cabinet, insofar as they are consulted by him, hope to get to the country before the end of June or the beginning of July so that the deceptive basis on which this budget is formulated will not become apparent.</P>
      <P>There is not the slightest indication in the speeches made by the Taoiseach or any other Government speaker of any intention to face up to the real budgetary, public expenditure and revenue problems facing the country.  The decisions which have to be taken will of their nature be intensely unpopular, but from reading this hotch-potch of a document there is no evidence of anxiety on the part of the Taoiseach to tell the Irish people the truth about the financial situation of the country.</P>
      <P>I have been here for 14 or 15 budgets. As we know, the Taoiseach changed the way the budget was formulated.  I gather he had consultations with individual Ministers. The information gathered was then co-ordinated in his office.  A whole series of <i>ad hoc</i> decisions were handed over to the Minister for Finance.  That Minister got the Estimate drafts for 1981 from various Departments.  The Taoiseach was so horrified by these figures &mdash; around 15 per cent or 16 per cent increases in non-pay elements &mdash; that he sent them back to the Departments to be reduced.  These figures were cut again. When they came to the Taoiseach a second time I understand they were sent again to the Departments who were told that the increases must not be more than 3 per cent.  That is how we finish up with a 3 per cent increase in the Book of Estimates.</P>

    <P>I know how some of the staff in these Departments approach this exercise although I have not spoken to any of them.  I am aware of the developments in various Departments when trying to respond to the Taoiseach, who wanted to present and succeeded in presenting a Book of Estimates which was deceptive, providing just enough money to carry on until the middle of 1981.  Therefore if the curtains are pulled early in June, we will not have the figures for the first half year <Col N="710" /> and nobody will be able to prove the nonsense that this budget represents.  The truth of the Irish revenue and expenditure situation in terms of the current budget is not contained in this document.</P>
    <P>I do not fault the Minister for Finance. He was very much a new boy to an old game when he arrived in the Department of Finance late December.  This is quite evident from this document if one reads it and tries to pick out any strand of activity in it, whether it is the main stream of thought relating to public borrowing or if it relates to job creation or public expenditure.  This is a series of disjointed decisions which are allegedly designed to be a coherent budget strategy.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Taoiseach's speech today &mdash; and took a copy of his speech to read in the quiet of my room &mdash; 30 pages of incredible waffle, delivered by the Taoiseach, who is a very astute, sensible and sane man, 30 pages of bland exortations and observations about the international scene, OECD and so on.  Does the Taoiseach intend going to the country in May or June and hope to get away with creating the impression at national level that all is well and that there is no need to worry?  From the cursory examination I have made of the budget Estimates and the revenue and expenditure projections for 1981, I think there is a great deal to worry about.  It has been argued that the Opposition would be well advised to keep to hell out of Government for the next few years because the position is now so impossible that to put it right political decisions of extraordinary harshness and decisiveness will be required and the Irish people will baulk at such a prospect. There is no joy facing the Opposition in considering this.</P>
    <P>Last Tuesday I put down a series of questions to the Minister for Finance about some basic economic indicators and about where this country stood on a series of important economic indices.  In Question No. 297 of 27 January I asked if he would state the proportion of public sector borrowing requirements financed externally in respect of the years 1977, 1978, 1979 and 1980.  The figures given were: 1977, 37 per cent, 1978, 38 per cent, 1979, 51 per cent and 1980, 60 per <Col N="711" /> cent.  In short, the proportion of public sector borrowing requirements which we have borrowed externally rose from 37 per cent to 60 per cent between 1977 and last year.  That is not a healthy indicator for an economy trying to recover and to drag its way out of a recession.  It is anything but a healthy indicator, no matter how one looks at it.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Finance another question on that day, if he would state the extent to which investment was financed from domestic sources in 1977, 1978, 1979 and 1980.  I also asked him the estimated extent to which the investment was financed externally for each of those years.  The domestic financing for 1978, this is in Question No. 296 of the same date, was £852 million.  In 1979 it was £885 million and in 1980 it was £894 million.  Bearing in mind the rate of inflation, we see a real drop in terms of domestic financing over that period, in terms of the financing of investment in the public capital programme from domestic sources.  Let us take the totals in terms of foreign financing, in 1978 it was £388 million, in 1979 it was £672 million and in 1980 it was £962 million. That is an alarming trend in terms of financing our public capital programme, bearing in mind the relativity of the Irish £ and the enormous repayment problems, both in capital and interest, which we face.</P>
    <P>Another indicator, which is of interest is national debt as a percentage of GNP. One has to bear this in mind.  In Question No. 295 which I asked last Tuesday, I was told that the national debt as a percentage of GNP for 1977 was 79 per cent.  In 1980 it was 83 per cent.  In 1979 it was 91 per cent and in 1980 it was 95 per cent.  That is the provisional figure for last year.  The national debt, as a percentage of GNP for the past four years, has gone up from 79 per cent to 95 per cent.  That is the outcome of the domestic budgetary economic management policies of the present Government.  There is no denying these facts, they were supplied to me in written reply last Tuesday and, as usual, when replies come in written form, the <Col N="712" /> media, for the most part, ignored them.</P>
    <P>I also asked a couple of further interesting questions.  In Question No. 293, I asked the Minister if he would state the increase in foreign borrowing in 1978, 1979 and 1980 and the extent to which this increase represented the increase in total debt.  He gave me the increase in actual terms.  The increase in Exchequer foreign debt for 1978 was £25 million.  In 1979 it rocketed to £479 million and in 1980 it rocketed again to £670 million.  If you take that as a percentage, the increase in Exchequer foreign debt as a percentage of increase in total debt &mdash; in 1978 it was an increase of 3 per cent, in 1979 it was an increase of 35 per cent and, in 1980, of 49 per cent.  One does not have to be a junior economist in a most uninformed commercial bank in a backwood economy to know that these are trends which are of major consequence in terms of the domestic budgetary policy of any nation state.</P>
    <P>I will quote two more answers and then I will rest my case in terms of the economic indicators.  I asked the Minister for Finance, in Question No. 292, the percentage of foreign debt which will fall due for repayment within the next five years. The Minister said that of the Exchequer foreign debt at the end of the last December, 47.7 per cent of the total expressed in Irish £s at current exchange rate will fall due for repayment within the next five years.  There is a scenario for any Minister for Finance taking office after the next general election.  In the next five years in office he will have to repay no less than 47.7 per cent of the total foreign debt expressed in Irish £s at current exchange rates.  That is something which would encourage anybody in Opposition to say &ldquo;Look, you can have it for another five years, we do not want to be in office because of what the Government have done in the past three or four years&rdquo;. That is a scenario that would be well worth while in some respects.</P>
    <P>There is another index which is of interest.  I asked in Question No. 290 on last Tuesday the estimated cost of the interest payments and the capital repayments of servicing the external debt in 1980 and 1981.  In 1980 the cost of interest <Col N="713" /> repayments was £164 million and the estimate for this year is a staggering £219 million.  Ministers can well appreciate the implications of that particular servicing. The cost of repayment of principal in 1980 was £83 million and the cost of principal repayments in 1981 will be £116 million.  Therefore, the situation is worsening.</P>
    <P>Having outlined these somewhat gloomy economic indicators, because basically they apply to the essential ingredient of economic management, namely the money supply, the debts supply, the external debt ratios of the Irish economy, I come to the situation which faced the Government in this budget.  So anxious, if I might make a global statement initially, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, was the Taoiseach in 1980 to please every single sectional interest of the community, in every conceivable way, and so uncertain was he of his position at that time with Deputy Colley still breathing down his neck on security issues and having failed to give him his loyalty &mdash; he has never given him that loyalty; he would not even propose him as Taoiseach, never mind giving him his loyalty &mdash; that he handed out £240 million in income tax relief alone last year.  He so crucified himself that this year he came naked to the budget table and could only provide a miserable, inadequate £60 million, £40 million of which he had already committed in the national understanding.  Therefore he came in here yesterday with a stop of £20 million on income tax.</P>
    <P>If one takes the details of the estimates of receipts, non-capital receipts, income tax is estimated at £1,210 million, for 1981.  In 1980 it was estimated at £1,014 million, which represents an approximate increase in 1981 of £200 million over last year.  I know there are included in that figure directors; contributions but they have not changed very much, that is, tax receipts from company directors and so on.  In terms of the 850,000 employees in the country, they will be paying in 1981 &mdash; on the estimates provided before the budget &mdash; an additional £200 million.  The Taoiseach came in and, because he had committed himself to £40 million on the national understanding, he had to deduct <Col N="714" /> that, no option, this was the give-away to get a wage inflationary national understanding. Therefore there were £160 million gone.  In addition he gave another £20 million of tax relief in the budget itself.  The net outturn is that for 1981 income tax receipts are estimated at £1,150 million which is exactly £140 million more than in 1980.  There is in fact no tax relief at all contained in the budget.  And there will be a further increment due to the Exchequer from the second phase of the national understanding next June.  Naturally that assists buoyancy but is taken into account in the growth of income tax itself.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that most people last evening were very chagrined, to say the least, when they appreciated that this year the most that anybody earning between £5,000 and £12,000 annually would get was £70 which would hardly pay for the increased price of petrol and the increase in other indirect taxation?</P>
    <P>This brings me to the main point I want to make in relation to the strategy of the Taoiseach.  Frankly I am not interested in the strategy of the Minister for Finance; he does not have a strategy; he does what he is told on two sides, first of all, by the Taoiseach and, secondly, by the Department of Finance.  The officials there tell him what to do because he does not know, he has not had the experience.  He has not been even three or four months in the Department to find out what is going on so he is completely dependent on them and their advice.  Simply because he was not long enough there he had no opportunity of putting his stamp on budgetary development&mdash;and indeed I have great personal regard for him.  Being a Minister for Finance in any country is an extremely difficult task.  Indeed, it is one Ministry in which I should think one must be up all night for six months before tackling one's first budget and making a personal impact on the situation obtaining. Therefore, for all practical purposes, this is yet another budget of the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, and we must view it in that light.  The light in which we must view it is that the Government, by virtue of their historic manifesto ideology and their approach in successive <Col N="715" /> budgets over the past few years, have circumscribed revenue capacity, have so compressed it into such a narrow revenue context that the whole of the country's tax revenue situation now rests on two or three principal struts.  That is a dangerous and inadequate situation.  This means also that it will not be possible in this country in the years ahead, no matter what any politician might think about it, to finance national economic development. One cannot finance national economic development in any country if one relies simply on two or three main pivots of taxation, and I shall explain what I mean to the House.</P>
    <P>In this country there is yielded from the taxation or revenue side, from customs and excise duties approximately 34 per cent; one-third of all taxation is yielded at that level.  This year, on the income tax side, we will be getting approximately 40 per cent, the other bigh plank of revenue income.  Then value-added tax yields yet another 20 per cent. I must emphasise that it is quite impossible to run a budget of £4,300 million by depending on three planks of revenue &mdash; customs and excise duties comprising 34 per cent, income tax 40 per cent and VAT almost 20 per cent, and no other taxation, because for all practical purposes this Government have abandoned all other forms of taxation, and here again I shall explain what I mean.</P>
    <P>For example, what do estate duties really mean at present in terms of Irish revenue tax?  I know they loom large in people's minds.  People think that estate duties are those millions of pounds that people pay.  In this country they constitute. 1 per cent of revenue.  For all practical purposes, as a contributor to national revenue, to financing economic and social progress, estate duties are almost irrelevant.  Then we must ask ourselves: what is the contribution of capital taxation to national revenue intake?  Last year it was. 6 of 1 per cent.  Therefore for all practical purposes we do not have a capital taxation structure in this country. In fact we would be better off saying to the unfortunate civil servants in the Department of Finance on the revenue <Col N="716" /> side &ldquo;There is your redundancy money; will you all go away to the west, buy little cottages for yourselves and have a pension for the rest of your lives&rdquo;&mdash; because .6 of 1 per cent of revenue is, for all practical purposes, irrelevant.  We get an income from corporation tax of about 5 per cent.  In so far as it has made a contribution it is a valued contribution towards economic and social expenditure. We have had a commotion about agricultural levies.  I never heard such a rí-rá about the contributions from agricultural levies as I have heard in the past two or three years.  Yet the total contribution from agricultural levies towards the total expenditure on economic and social progress was .2 of 1 per cent.  In other words, last year excise duties and customs duties brought in £9 million; income tax brought in £1,000 million; value added tax brought in nearly £500 million.  These were the principal ingredients. We got £130 million from corporation tax, roughly 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>My fundamental criticism of the Government is that they abolished a wide range of tax options and if one does that one finishes up crucifying oneself trying to get enough money to pay for the current Estimates, and the whole economic strategy in terms of managing the country will go haywire.  I do not want to use these terms in any excessive or emotive sense.  I am stating what I believe to be the reality.  I will give a few examples. We abolished road tax, a £50 million option which has been poured down the drain for the past three years.  We abolished rates <i>in toto</i> without batting an eye-lid.  This year alone the Exchequer has to find £125 million to recoup local authorities for the abolition of domestic rates.  We must remember that these are annual costs and not just once off costs. Every year the money has to be found. We abolished the prospect of some kind of a system of capital taxation to the tune of £20 or £30 million.  As a result of all this we are inevitably going to finish up boozing ourselves into keeping the country going by paying customs and excise duty on drink and tobacco, or by paying more and more in income tax, and the spread of taxation around the country <Col N="717" /> imposing and equitable burden on the sections of the community who should be in a position to pay their fair share is increasingly circumscribed and the spread does not exist any longer.</P>
    <P>I know that Fianna Fáil came to power saying that they could abolish all those taxes and have no worry, and here we come to the famous recipe of Dr. Martin O'Donoghue &mdash; promoted vigorously by the present Taoiseach when he was in office even though he consistently overspent in the Department of Health because he was determined to embarrass the then Minister for Finance, Deputy George Colley, and supported by the rest of the former Cabinet &mdash; buoyancy, growth and greater industrial activity. From the competence of people investing in the Irish economy we would have a growth and a buoyancy of revenue from the other taxes, customs and excise, corporation profits tax and value added tax; so big would be the growth that we could abolish all the other taxes.</P>
    <P>There was only one complication about the scenario.  There was no growth.  There was a failure to anticipate that there might be a recession and hence we have the Taoiseach in here with a budget which has no reality in relation to the demands of public expenditure.  We have a budget here with a cooked Book of Estimates because we are going to have an election in mid-year.  Of course there is a provision for a 3 per cent growth.  Anybody in their sane senses, as my own party leader said here this morning, even a child in the street, would know that there is no way whatsoever that the non-pay elements of ordinary public expenditure can be constrained to 3 per cent.  I know that as chairman of one of the largest local authorities in the country.  Take the construction industry indices affecting the Office of Public Works.  In relation to construction projects at the moment, the ordinary mickey mouse order one puts out to get a door put on a garda barracks, the index is running at 24.6 per cent.  That is what we have to find in Dublin County Council.  The index for road making material is 30 per cent if one wants to fill a pothole on an Irish main road.  Yet the Minister allows 3 per cent.  That would be <Col N="718" /> swallowed up in the petrol increase alone which will affect the departmental Estimates for travelling in 1981.</P>
    <P>Therefore my central point is that the Taoiseach wants to jolly us along, keep us all quiet and happy, go to the Ard-Fheis in a fortnight's time and say that these are the Estimates and that anybody who questions them is impugning integrity of his Civil Service, fine upstanding public servants who would not do a thing like not doing what they are told to bring it down to 3 per cent, and that these are authentic documents. But we said last year, and I particularly said, that there was no way that the country could be run within the constraints imposed on it in the 1980 Book of Estimates. Of course at the end of the year we passed here &mdash; and we had to pass because there was not a shilling in the Department of Finance &mdash; £240 million of Supplementary Estimates just to keep the country ticking over to the end of the year.  I would like to see the faces of the gardaí on Border duty, or the Army out in the Lebanon, or the fellow in the central boiler works in Government Buildings if they were told that their pay cheques could not be issued this week because the Government have put a limit of 3 per cent and a lot of money had been spent on non-pay elements and there was none left for pay.  We would not have a strike on our hands; we would have a riot.  These estimates have no reality in terms of the effects they will have on Government expenditure.  This is a con job which the Taoiseach could not sustain in rational argument.</P>
    <P>It was tragic that there was little emphasis in the budget on any effort to review the issues of job maintenance, job protection and job creation.  I have seen about 15 budget statements during my time in this House and one could pick out without difficulty the contributions of the different Departments.  But if one read through this document one would begin to wonder if there was a Minister called Deputy O'Malley.  Is there anything in this document which refers to the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism?  Apart from a few paragraphs about industrial relations <Col N="719" /> there is nothing obviously from the Department of Labour about schemes for job maintenance, employment subsidies, youth employment and so on.  The Taoiseach called in each Minister, told them what they would get in 1981, decided what was to be done and threw them all out.  This is not a Cabinet document because the Cabinet cannot get on with one another.  There is no input from Deputy Colley, Minister for Energy.  Is there any reference, apart from minor references to minor schemes about saving in terms of energy conservation, to the role of the Department of Energy?  There is nothing.  I am seriously disappointed at the absence of any new proposals or an analysis of the situation having regard to the fact that 200,000 persons are now unemployed.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House to the cost of this development on the unemployment front.  In recent weeks a great deal of attention has been focused on unemployment in the UK where 2.419 million people are now unemployed. Many of them are Irish and quite a few of them have come home.  We know that, as public representatives who meet Irish people when they return having become unemployed in the UK.  A recent parliamentary answer in the House of Commons put the cost to the State of the unemployment of a married man with two children who had been on average earnings, at £6,000.  That £6,000 was arrived at by estimating that half of it was lost in revenue and the other half was lost in the cost of benefits which had to be paid to the person.  If one takes the rate of pay of the male industrial workers here and the rate of unemployment benefit, the cost to the Exchequer is in the region of £5,000 per annum for a married man with two children.  That does not take into account the hardship and the humiliation of people in this position.  Not only do the Government have to pay out unemployment benefit or assistance but they must be paid pay related unemployment benefit as well.  Where a person is unemployed the State must forego the PAYE return, the PRSI return and unemployed persons also generally <Col N="720" /> become entitled to a medical card which costs money as well.  We often tend to forget that.  Some of them also are entitled to a reduction in their differential rent.  The total cost is probably nearer to £5,500 per annum for the State to maintain an unemployed person.  We tend to regard an unemployed person as some one who collects the dole but it is a lot more than that in real terms.  We could add on the loss of production, the loss of profits to the company concerned, the loss to industrial growth and the loss to the GNP of the nation.  One could add on many more thousands of pounds in that context.  It seems inevitable that another 5,000 workers will be on the live register this year.  The cost to the community as a whole on those figures would be an additional £30 million per annum. I strongly submit that in the budget estimates produced here for 1981 there is no provision for that kind of increased cost that the community will have to face.</P>
    <P>It is disastrous that in that budget statement there is no analysis of the true economic and social cost of unemployment. A lot of work of that nature has been done in the UK.  The real problem facing us is how can we spend money to keep workers in jobs and to protect employment, to tide them over a period of recession, with subsidies or employment maintenance schemes so that people do not have to become registered as unemployed. There is no analysis of that in the budget.  The Government's approach is an appalling mish-mash of <i>ad hoc</i> decisions with little impact on the true economic position.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the increased price of alcohol.  I drink and so do some of my friends but at the risk of being hit over the head with a pint in a pub I am not unduly worried.  Last year we spent £2 million a day every day of the year on booze alone.  In 1978 we spent £485 million and in 1979 we spent £570 million on drink.  I believe that last year we spent close on £660 million on drink, very nearly £2 million a day.  We have a serious alcoholism problem and serious absenteeism from industry arising out of alcoholism.  A great many of the problems which public representatives meet <Col N="721" /> are directly attributable to alcoholism. We come across problems in relation to broken families, deserted children, undernourished children, and children who suffer from the absence of a father or a mother on the booze.  We know, how easy it is to spend the end of one's working life or social life entertaining one's friends in the pub.</P>
    <P>I believe if we have to pay some extra money in order to finance the social and economic development of the country we should not complain a lot.  I regard that as a source of revenue which has desirable side effects.  I know there are many people who will not like my saying that because the drink lobby behind the counter or in front of it is very strong.  I do not oppose that aspect of the budget. I hope the money will be spent on job creation for the unemployed, those who cannot afford the price of a drink.  The rest of us should be able to afford customs and excise duties on half of what we spend provided the money goes into job creation.</P>
    <P>There are some notable things missing from the budget.  I am disturbed at the decision to demand from the business community the payment of one and a half years' tax in 12 months.  I do not know where that decision came from.  It certainly did not come from the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  The CII believed that imposition would not be put on industry this year.  It is a very bad decision in the middle of a recession to impose that type of taxation levy on the private sector and the manufacturing sector.  When Deputy Richie Ryan was Minister for Finance he had many approaches to introduce something like that but he resisted them.  He must look like a saint in heaven or the most reasonable man on earth compared with those who would take that type of silly decision. It is extremely difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>There should have been some review of the extent to which we would try to encourage Irish people to take holidays in the country.  I know it is not a major issue but at the moment we spend £200 million a year of Irish currency taking holidays abroad.  There are many people who spend holidays in Tenerife and <Col N="722" /> other places in the sun but this is paid for in Irish currency.  For every £10 million spent here, when people take their holidays at home, a thousand jobs are created and kept here.  That is an area which should have been examined but like all decisions in relation to economic and social development that kind of decision would be very unpopular.</P>
    <P>There is no reference in the public capital programme to any provision for the demands made by NET who have been looking for £90 million to keep 1,400 jobs in existence.  I cannot understand why the Government did not take any decision to provide this money for NET.  Perhaps we are facing NET No. 2 because it looks as if the decision to provide, at a cost of £200 million, a natural pipeline, for political purposes, from Cork to Dublin, trailing off into Limerick, on to Clonmel, through Kilkenny and on to Dublin will become NET No. 2,.  All the reports and all the analyses made in relation to that Government proposal show it to be uneconomic, and unjustified by virtue of strict economic analyses.  Even with the demands of the Dublin Gas Company and the people who use gas in Dublin the whole thing looks as if it is a non-starter.  The Minister for Energy, who has to show that he is doing something in his Department, has come down in favour of it.  I predict it will be NET No. 2 and we do not want that. In the absence of any provision for NET in the capital budget and the decision put into it, which I believe is a wrong one, the budget is unbalanced.</P>
    <P>The budget shows that the Taoiseach wants to go to the country as soon as he can.  He has not satisfied anybody.  The PAYE sector, the farmers and the business community will not thank him for what is in it.  His backbenchers will not thank him because of the petrol increase in it.  I met enough of the Government backbenchers during the election campaign when they all told me: &ldquo;He is not just an ordinary politician.  He is not an ordinary Minister.  He is somebody quite special and capable of taking quite distinctive economic and social decisions.&rdquo; In fact, he has provided to be not much different from the rest of us, a very ordinary <Col N="723" /> politician producing a very mediocre and nondescript budget.  Given a couple of months at the job, some of us could do a lot better in terms of economic and social balance and dealing with the realities of the financial situation.</P>
    <P>This budget will not make much impact, but it will probably enable the Government to struggle on.  With 32 office holders, we now have more Ministers and Ministers of State than we have had in the history of the State.  We have never had so many Ministers, Ministers of State and civil servants, and never was so little produced.  This Financial Statement shows that, whatever else is happening in the Cabinet, and whatever else is happening at Minister of State level, the ideas are pretty sparse on running the country, managing the economy and getting the State-sponsored sector moving in a rational and coherent way, and the effect on the economic situation is very serious.</P>

      <P>Deputy Harte knows I am telling the truth.  This hurts the Opposition. The budget is all right with me once it gives increases in social welfare.  I am not an economist.  I have heard some awful speeches from people who claim to be economists on the other side of the House.  In their theorising and in their doctrinaire approach to economics, they never dream of producing a social welfare document like this.  I challenge the Opposition to say where they want cuts made in the social welfare allocations. They hedged this morning.  They tried to smirch the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Budgets are not about elections so far as I am concerned.  The budget is intended to distribute the national wealth in such a way that people who most need help will be given it.  This is what has happened in this budget.  We put tax on drink, cigarettes and other things.  The people who will pay will be taxed because they indulge in expenditure on these items.  We did not tax the blind pensioner, the old age pensioner or the disabled person.  In this year of the disabled we have introduced more relief for them <Col N="725" /> too.

Deputy Harte might ask his leader to spare one word of praise for the Government who introduced this magnificent document on social welfare.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, if that is what the Minister has received notice of I cannot raise legitimately other matters at this stage.  Although what the Chair has outlined is not what I intended, I shall leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking here about school transport for children attending primary schools throughout the country.  This is a service that has been in operation for many years and which costs a considerable amount of money.  This cost is related, for instance, to the cost of diesel and also to the cost of wages paid to school bus drivers.  Obviously, the cost in both these instances will increase in 1981 compared with 1980.  Wages will increase in line with the terms of the national understanding. Diesel prices would have increased anyway but the budget, in the case of many vehicles which operate on petrol, has increased the cost in addition to whatever increases might occure in the normal process of the operation of inflation. This situation led me to query the Minister about a number of savings which he proposes to effect in the provision of a number of services which come within the Department of Education but I am <Col N="728" /> interested in particular in the savings proposed under the heading of school transport.</P>
    <P>According to the Book of Estimates &mdash; Vote 30, subhead D. 3 &mdash; the Minister was provided last year with £20,420,100 for school transport.  The original provision under this subhead in 1980 was for £16 million but towards the end of the year a further sum of £4,420,100 was provided by way of a Supplementary Estimate.  The fact that this money was provided late in the year in the form of a Supplementary Estimate suggests that the £16 million provided originally was insufficient.  One would expect that in circumstances in which inflation is of the order of 18 per cent &mdash; perhaps less or perhaps more&mdash;the provision for school transport in 1981 would have been greater than the relevant provision in 1980, that is assuming there would not be cutbacks in the school transport service or the introduction of some other means of raising money under this heading. However, in the Estimate laid before this House about two weeks ago we find that the provision for school transport is only £20 million or £420,000 less than the amount provided under the same heading last year.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured by way of supplementary questions to ascertain from the Minister the reason for this reduction in the service and whether it is the case that a charge for the service is to be levied.  I endeavoured to find out also from him whether the £20 million was less than the amount actually spent last year.  There may be a distinction between the amount actually spent and the amount provided. Perhaps the Department, though provided at their request with a total of £20,420,100 did not spend all of the money.  In a sense I was giving the Minister the benefit of the doubt by asking him to tell us whether all of the money was spent and, if not, whether the saving was significantly less than the £20 million provided this year in which case the Minister might be able to argue that the reduction this year is not a real reduction. However, the Minister did not answer the question.  He satisfied himself by saying that in his view and in the view of his <Col N="729" /> officials the amount spent was sufficient. How can it be sufficient to spend only £20 million this year when it was decided that a similar amount was sufficient last year? These same officials are the ones that the Minister is relying on now for his claim that the additional £420,000 is not necessary this year.  I have grave doubts about the whole process of estimation that is being engaged in by Departments and I am fearful that, perhaps, the Departments are being encouraged by Ministers who wish artifically to reduce the Estimate provisions under the various subheads in order to bring about phoney reductions in public spending, in other words, to give figures that are not realistic.</P>
    <P>I would draw to the Minister's attention his particularly bad record in this regard.  Had he been asked in January of last year the sort of question I am asking him today he would surely have replied that the £16 million that was being provided in the original Estimate was sufficient for school transport for the year whereas it turned out to be £4 million short.  He tells us now that £20 million is sufficient in this regard this year although this figure represents a reduction of £420,000 on what was provided last year at his request.</P>
    <P>In this situation I wish him to explain, first, why it is estimated that a sum which represents a decrease of £420,000 on last year's figure is sufficient this year and, secondly, I should like him to tell us whether the £20,420,000 provided last year was actually spent and, if not, how much was spent.  The Minister may claim that if all the money was not spent last year some of it can be put into account for this year, thereby allowing the provision for this year to be less than would be the case otherwise.  I do not believe that that is a legitimate excuse but I am commenting on it in case the Minister should seek to bring in this point as an excuse for the reduction.  I will have no opportunity of replying to whatever the Minister may say.  The position as I understand it is that in a heading like this any money that is not spent in a given year must be handed back to the Department <Col N="730" /> of Finance.  If £20,420,000 was provided last year and only £20 million was spent the balance is not available to the Department of Education this year.  That does not apply in the case of grant-in-aid funds but in the case of voted moneys such as this.  If the Minister tried to give that as an excuse it would not be a truthful one.</P>
    <P>I am raising this matter with a view to getting hard information as to what is really intended, what was spent last year and an honest answer from the Minister backed up by statistics and facts related to experience last year as to whether he can prove that the £20 million provided for school transport this year, which is less than that provided for last year, is sufficient in view of inflation and the cost of running the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must correct Deputy Bruton when he said that the provision for school transport was for primary schools.  The provision is for primary and secondary schools. I reiterate what I said already that my officials and I had a look at the school transport scene for 1981.  That is the job with which we were charged and we came to the conclusion that an adequate and satisfactory service would cost us £20 million in 1981.  We were not involved in examining minutely, as Deputy Bruton wants us to do, what the system cost in 1980.  We were concerned with 1981. Deputy Bruton should know that that is what the Book of Estimates is about.  It is about 1981.  I was amazed, when a Fine Gael Deputy asked me at the end of last year whether what we were voting was money for 1980 rather than 1981, that a Deputy would not know that when we are voting moneys in a specific year we are voting them for that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton seems to have a thing about school transport.  I do not know why.  He is always exercised about whether we will be able to provide an adequate transport service.  I have an idea it may be a guilt complex because the House will remember that he had responsibility as junior Minister in that Department. It was during his consulship that Deputy Richie Ryan, then Minister for <Col N="731" /> Finance, flew his kite about charging for the transport.  This created such a bruhaha that Deputy Ryan, who is cute if nothing else, did not mention it any more.  It was under that consulship that the Hyland Consultancy were asked to report on school transport.  Their report was published and it advocated a charge for the transport.  The conclusions of the consultants were presumably along the lines on which Deputy Bruton and his overlord, Deputy Ryan, were thinking at that time.</P>
    <P>I will not make reference to the nitpicking aspect of what Deputy Bruton has raised.  I will not make any reference to the fact that in all we are providing for education, up on £700 million this year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He said he had great doubts about the whole process of estimating and was unworthy enough to suggest that we were artificially reducing the figures for some <Col N="732" /> nefarious purposes which he did not mention. He used the word &ldquo;phoney&rdquo;.  The only place I see anything phoney with regard to school transport and a stupid mistake in assessment was when Deputy Bruton was in charge of this area.  He said that the service would cost a certain amount of money and it cost £2 million less in the particular year.  What was Deputy Bruton's purpose in making that estimate at that time?</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton's efforts here to pretend that officials of the Department and I are dishonest in our figures should be condemned by the House.  It is a question of do as I say now in my Savonarola role, not do as I did.  The figure which may be read in the Book of Estimates of £20 million for school transport for 1981 is one which we arrived at &mdash; not claiming infallibility &mdash; after all due consideration.

      <P>I presume the £100 million mentioned by the Deputy refers to the total 1979 revenue delayed until 1980 as a result of the postal dispute.  Up to £53 million of this was tax revenue, £5 million was social insurance contributions and the remaining £42 million was Post Office revenue.</P>
      <P>In 1980 Post Office revenue collected was about £65 million below target partly because of a fall in traffic on the postal side and a slower growth in telecommunications business during the recession, partly due to greater difficulties in collecting revenue from business firms for the same reason, but mainly because it was not possible to bring the issue of telephone and telex bills up to date by the end of the year.  It is now expected that £39 million of telephone revenue and £3 million of telegraph revenue which was due to be collected in 1980 will fall into 1981.</P>

Actual borrowings in 1980 showed an increase of £49 million over the budget estimate.  The increase over the budget estimate arose mainly in the case of the Agricultural Credit Corporation Ltd., the air companies, the ESB and Bord Gáis and was due to a variety of causes such as increased activity, increased costs and to internally generated funds being less than expected.</P>

      <P>Estimates for the number unemployed are published only in respect of <Col N="666" /> the month of April.  For other months, the only indicator of unemployment is the live register.  The number on the live register was 103,500 in June 1977 and 122,200 in December 1980.  I should draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the live register, while providing a reasonably reliable guide to changes in unemployment, is faulty as a measure of the absolute level.</P>
      <P>The targets in the White Paper &ldquo;National Development 1977-1980&rdquo; relate to net increases in employment. Figures published by the CSO show that net employment increased by 80,000 between April 1977 and April 1980.  This increase is equal to the total target set by the Government for the period from mid-1977 to the end of 1980.  At this stage, it is not possible to measure precisely the net employment change from April 1980 to end 1980.</P>

      <P>Although I have no function in this matter, on humanitarian grounds I have made inquiries.</P>
      <P>I understand that the coroner directed that a post mortem examination be held but that on receipt of the results of the post mortem examination he was satisfied that an inquest in relation to the death was not necessary.  The coroner's certificate to the Registrar of Deaths for the area was returned for emendation and unfortunately was mislaid at that stage.</P>
      <P>Following a request by the Deputy to the corner to have the registration of the death expedited, a death certificate issued to the next of kin on 23 January 1981.  I am informed that the coroner has no record of receiving any application for a copy of the report of the post mortem examination of the deceased person.  This report can be made available on request to the coroner.</P>

    <P>Various preferential rates of duty apply to footwear and clothing if imported from countries with which Ireland, as a member of the EEC, has preferential trading arrangements.  Goods of the kind mentioned could attract preferential Customs treatment depending on the precise description of the goods and the particular <Col N="686" /> third country of origin concerned. Footwear and clothing which comply with certain rules of origin and consignment would be likely to attract Nil rates of duty if imported from EFTA. Mediterranean (except Spain), ACP/OCT and GSP countries.</P>
    <P>However, in the case of</P>
    <P>(i)  certain clothing originating in Cyprus, Malta, Yugoslavia and the GSP countries and</P>
    <P>(ii)  certain footwear originating in Yugoslavia and the GSP countries.</P>
    <P>the quantity which may be imported at a Nil rate of duty is limited.  This quantity has already been reached in respect of certain clothing from some GSP countries. Importations of these goods will attract the full rate of duty for the remainder of 1981.</P>
    <P>Further details of the relevant customs duties and preferential arrangements are set out in the Customs and Excise tariff of Ireland and the annexes thereto, copies of which are available for examination in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>In addition to the aforementioned Customs duties, anti-dumping duties apply to certain goods in the categories mentioned. Men's working boots are liable to an anti-dumping duty of 28 per cent <i>ad valorem</i> if wholly or partly made in or consigned from Czechoslovakia. Blouses, blouse shirts, shirts and similar articles wholly or mainly of synthetic textile fibres which are wholly or substantially produced in the Republic of South Korea are liable to an anti-dumping duty of 40 per cent <i>ad valorem.</i></P>
    <P>Apart from chargeability to Customs duties, there are also certain prohibitions and restrictions on the importation of footwear and clothing.  In general, these goods may be imported only on production of a licence or authorisation from the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism.</P>

      <P>The cost of repealing section 23 of the Finance Act, 1976, is estimated to have been £2 million in the year 1978 and £3.5 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>It would not be possible, without undue expenditure of time and effort, to detail all the individual reforms, large and small, particularly in relation to methods, which have been effected in each Department arising from the continuous and sustained activity of the Department of the Public Service in these fields. I would point out that the reform programme mentioned in the Financial Statement in 1978 must be seen in the context of the job creation programme also announced in that statement.  The purpose, therefore, was not to secure staff reductions but to ensure the efficient and effective management of the public service as expanded by job creation.</P>
