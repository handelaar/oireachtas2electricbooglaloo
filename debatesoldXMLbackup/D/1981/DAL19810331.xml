      <P>I am aware that there have been some complaints about the quality of coal offered for sale in this country in recent months, though only three specific complaints have come to my notice.</P>
      <P>These complaints are being investigated and though full details are not yet available the complaints basically seem to stem from the fact that coal from Poland&mdash;our principal supplier for many years past&mdash;has been available in limited quantities only in recent months.  The shortfall has been made good largely by suppliers of American coal, some of which was, I have been told, not altogether suitable for the Irish market, nor as acceptable to consumers as Polish coal. I have also been told that there has been a recent improvement in this respect and that everything possible to obtain the best available coal for the Irish consumer is being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of Coal Distributors Limited in Dublin has been examined on a number of occasions since the merged company was established in the early seventies.  There is no evidence that their position has been abused.  My <Col N="431" /> recollection from when I dealt with these matters is that there is evidence to show that the price of coal is cheaper in Dublin than it would be if we had not this arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The complaints came from Cork mainly rather than Dublin, and Coal Distributors Limited do not import coal into Cork or distribute it there.  The American coal is a different type coal.  The American producers were not in the habit for the past 20 years or so of producing what we regard as domestic coal.  They produced steam coal in the United States.  It took the mine operators about 12 months to produce coal of a quality and in a fashion which was more acceptable to the Irish market.  It is still a different type of coal from the Polish coal.  It is the view of many people that perhaps it is not as good as the Polish coal.  We hope the position in Poland will improve.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no specific plans at present for the setting up of a wind farm anywhere in the country.  The objective of the programme on which I have embarked is to establish that wind is an economic and reliable source of energy.  The initial phase of this programme has two broad objectives, firstly to measure and analyse data on the country's potential generally and to identify the most suitable locations for harnessing <Col N="432" /> this energy; secondly, to test and demonstrate the suitability of particular wind machines for different locations and applications.  In a written reply to a question in 10 March I gave up-to-date information on the present stage of development of the programme.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the logical and effective development of this programme requires that we should progress from study and demonstration of individual machines to similar work on small clusters of machines and that the construction of extensive clusters or wind farms is further down the road.</P>
      <P>As well as proceeding with our domestic programme, we are keeping in constant and direct touch with developments in other countries, in particular those which are pioneering the development of wind power on a substantial scale.  A decision to force the pace of development by getting involved in large-scale projects without going through the essential earlier stages which I have outlined, could have results which would be counter-productive and very costly in terms of performance, safety and unacceptable effects on the environment generally.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle also, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the information requested by the Deputy in relation to budgeted and actual expenditure in Lesotho, Tanzania, Zambia and Sudan.  Since our assistance to these countries involves expenditure in Ireland as well as in the countries concerned, in order to calculate the real increase or decrease, it would be necessary to take into account many factors, including rates of inflation in Ireland, the recipient countries and exchange rate fluctuations. This could only be done with excessive difficulty and cost.  In any event it would not give a true picture of the development of our programmes in these countries since this depends on the rate at which projects can develop as well as the availability of funds.</P>
      <P>The amount provisionally earmarked for development education in 1981 is £40,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if his Department's co-financing with Irish non-governmental organisations of developing projects in the Third World has effectively ceased this year because the amount allocated in the 1981 Estimates had already been fully committed in 1981; and, if so, whether he intends to resume support of the valuable work carried out by these voluntary agencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The funds available this year form the Bilateral Aid Fund for the co-financing of development projects with non-governmental organisations have already been earmarked either for projects carried forward from 1980 and earlier or for new projects.</P>
      <P>Having regard to commitments in other areas of bilateral aid, the amount which could be allocated for the co-financing scheme in 1981 is not as great as I would have wished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> It is my intention to provide additional funds for co-financing in 1982 insofar as this may be possible within the overall level of available funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that. Certain moneys were made available in 1981.  The bulk of the money available in 1981 was in respect of projects which have already been decided upon in 1980. Some money was available in 1981 for new projects and that money has been allocated to the new projects.  There will not be any further new programmes under this heading in 1981.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he accepts, in the light of the Central Bank estimates of GNP and inflation, that the Official Development Assistance budget for 1981 represents a drop in real terms as a percentage of GNP, by comparison with the 1979 and the 1980 ODA Estimates; and what the amounts should be in order to increase their value in real terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the allocation for overseas development assistance this year is £18 million as against an out-turn of £16.22 million in 1980 and an out-turn of £13.18 million in 1979.  At this stage it is not possible to say definitively what percentage of GNP the 1981 allocation will represent since GNP estimates are subject to subsequent adjustment which must await the confirmation of prevailing economic factors.  In the meantime I am not able to comment on the matter of an increase in real terms referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept the figure provided in the CONGOOD ODA targets for which his predecessor in the Department of Foreign Affairs gave full support?  Would the Minister also accept that the moneys that should be provided in this year would amount to £30.1 million to maintain the target to bring us in line with the figure of 0.35 per cent which is an interim figure of GNP and that therefore the Government have reneged on the promise given by Fianna Fáil in office by an amount estimated at approximately £12 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="447" />
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have reneged on no such promise because the figure for ODA has almost trebled since the Government took office in 1977 from £6.3 million to £18 million in 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister is not familiar with the facts because the figure relates to a percentage of GNP and not to absolute sums.  Would the Minister not accept that the considered estimate by all interested bodies and all professional bodies is that we should if we are to maintain ourselves on target be making a contribution in ODA of £30.1 million. By the Minister's admission we are making a contribution of only £18 million and therefore there is a shortfall of about £11 million.  That is a betrayal of the commitment repeatedly given by Deputy O'Kennedy as Minister.</P>

      <P>At the Eleventh Special Session of the UN General Assembly on development matters held in August-September 1980, a text on procedures and time-frame for the proposed global negotiations was agreed on by all delegations except three.  Discussions on the proposed negotiations, and in particular <Col N="448" /> on the agenda, continued at the 35th Regular Session of the General Assembly and will resume again as soon as possible.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the concept of &ldquo;like-minded&rdquo; is one used to describe the very flexible and informal discussions which take place from time to time between some of the developed countries which have similar views and approaches to the question of development co-operation. The so called &ldquo;like-minded&rdquo; countries are not an exclusive group&mdash;in fact there is no institutional arrangement as such in their regard.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs why following his statement in Seanad Éireann on 19 November 1980 that the Government were committed to the achievement of the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for official development assistance at the end of the 1980s, the Irish delegation to the UN indicated on 5 December 1980 that the target might not be reached within the specified time scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no contradiction between my statement in Seanad Éireann on 19 November 1980 and the statement made by the Irish delegation to the UN on 5 December 1980.  We are committed to exerting our best efforts towards reaching 0.7 per cent of GNP for official development aid as soon as possible. What the Irish delegation said regarding the 0.7 per cent target, on my instructions, was: The Government of Ireland have accepted the 0.7 per cent aid target and intend to reach it as soon as possible, <Col N="450" /> although it may not be feasible for them to do so within the specified time frames....</P>
      <P>The statement reflects the commitment of the Government to the target and also the Government's honest assessment of this matter in the light of the difficult world economic situation.  In a similar vein, in Seanad Éireann during the course of the Brandt Report debate, I said... &ldquo;we hope to achieve 0.7 per cent of GNP by the end of the decade&rdquo; (Seanad Official Report, vol. 95, col. 226, 19 November 1980).</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs how much of the 1981 development co-operation budget it is proposed to allocate to development education; and how this compares with the equivalent figures for 1979 and 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The expenditure on development education in 1979 and 1980 and proposed for 1981 are as follows: 1979 &mdash; £86,091; 1980 &mdash; £28,930; 1981 &mdash; £40,000 (proposed).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully agree that development education is an essential part of our Development Co-operation Programme.  Since 1978 specific funds have been set aside for development education under our Development Co-operation Programme. These funds have been used to finance activities, such as seminars and films, undertaken directly by my Department and to co-finance development education activities by non-governmental organisations. Although our development education programme is still at an early stage of development.  I believe that good <Col N="451" /> progress has already been made in increasing awareness in Ireland of the Third World and I am particularly happy that such a wide variety of people, including schools, youth groups and many adult groups including the trade union movement, have become involved in this work. I can assure the Deputy that it is my intention to expand the development education programme in the future, taking into account the overall level of funds available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate why the expenditure dropped from £86,000 to £28,000 and has now risen to £40,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1979 figure included substantial expenditure on films and travel for development education purposes.  In 1980 we were obliged to reduce expenditure in these areas.  However, the assitance given to non-governmental organisations was largely maintained. Moreover, the provision for development education this year is almost 40 per cent greater than the total expenditure in 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the unprecedented generosity and concern of the Irish people as expressed in the Lenten Trocaire collection, does the Minister not agree that money spent directly on development education in this country would have a multiplier effect far beyond the sums involved here?  When one takes inflation into account, it is obvious that there has been a cutback in assistance by the Government.  Will the Minister give an assurance to the House that extra funds will be made available for development education purposes?</P>

I receive records of the Special Committee's meetings as well as copies of its reports and studies on various aspects of apartheid.  My recent statements on the apartheid system and on the proposed IRFU rugby tour in South Africa have been lodged with the committee and are being circulated as committee documents.  I believe that the committee have done valuable work in highlighting the evil of apartheid and I recently had the pleasure of meeting in Dublin a representative of the committee, Ambassador Gbeho of Ghana, to discuss the Government's policy towards apartheid and their concern about recent developments in South Africa.</P>

      <P>As in previous years I joined in a message to the Secretary General of the UN from the Foreign Ministers of the ten member states of the European Communities which emphasised the opposition of the ten to all manifestations of racial discrimination and in particular to the apartheid policies of the Government of South Africa.  In addition, Ireland informed the UN Secretary General of our voluntary contributions for 1981 to four UN funds to aid the victims of the South African régime: the UN Trust Fund for South Africa, the UN Educational and Training Programme for Southern Africa, the UN Fund for Namibia and the UN Publicity Fund against Apartheid.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take questions Nos. 34, 35 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>The general position of the Government in relation to the policies they will pursue on the Security Council was set out in reply to a question on 9 December last in which I indicated that the Government intended to play their part in efforts to resolve whatever international disputes would be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the commitment given by the Minister and Deputy O'Donoghue on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party in this House <i>vis-á-vis</i> the pursuit of internationally agreed sanctions against South Africa, could the Minister be a little more specific as to what action, in the form of initiatives, this Government&mdash;which <Col N="455" /> now has a seat on the Security Council&mdash;propose to take in the coming year, if any?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to offer my apologies to the Deputy.  I am afraid the remaining pages of the answer to these questions were put at a later part of the brief and not where they should have been.  I thought I pulled up rather sharply.  I shall re-read the full reply:</P>
      <P>The general position of the Government in relation to the policies they will pursue on the Security Council was set out in reply to a question on 9 December last in which I indicated that the Government intended to play their part in efforts to resolve whatever international disputes would be considered by the Council. I also said that where Ireland had established positions on particular issues our policy would continue to be based on those positions.</P>
      <P>The attitude of the Government towards mandatory sanctions against South Africa has been stated on several occasions.  In my address last September to the 35th General Assembly of the United Nations I urged the Security Council to continue its consideration of selective measures to increase the pressure for change within South Africa.  In line with this policy Ireland has, within the UN, endorsed a number of specific proposals for concerted action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, we consistently supported the idea of an arms embargo; and since the embargo was imposed by the Security Council we have observed it.  Measures to strengthen the implementation of the arms embargo will be discussed by the Security Council in the near future on the basis of a report from a Special Committee established by the Council to monitor the embargo.  Secondly, at the General Assembly last year we co-sponsored a resolution urging the Security Council to consider the cessation of all new foreign investment in and financial loans to South Africa.  Thirdly, we supported a resolution requesting the Security Council to consider a mandatory embargo on the supply to South Africa of petroleum and petroleum products.  In addition, <Col N="456" /> fourthly, we have declared ourselves ready to consider further action by the international community&mdash;effective, coordinated measures, on a considered basis&mdash;to bring pressure to bear on South Africa to abandon its apartheid policies.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies' questions indicate international sanctions against South Africa will be examined at an UN/OAU international conference to be held in Paris from 20 to 27 May.  Ireland will be represented at the Conference.  We voted in favour of resolutions calling for the organisation of such a Conference at the last two Sessions of the General Assembly and we were represented at a meeting of the Conference's Preparatory Committee in New York from 11 to 13 March.  In addition our Permanent Representative to the United Nations has been in contact with the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, who is also the Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid, about Ireland's participation in the Conference.</P>
    <P>Finally I should emphasise that the Government are gravely concerned at the maintenance of the apartheid system in South Africa and at the threat which the recent actions of the South African armed forces in Angola and Mozambique pose to the stability of the region and to international peace.  The Government will consider the possibilities for further international action in the light of the deliberations of the Sanctions Conference and of consultations with the other members of the Security Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the Minister's detailed reply, could he indicate &mdash; leaving aside all the its and buts &mdash; that this State will clearly support and actively campaign for an agreed system of an oil embargo on South Africa and that if necessary it will not, as it has done in the past, abstain at the United Nations Security Council, in deference to European political co-operation because of the vested interests of certain other Community Members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the reply pointed out, we have already supported a resolution requesting a mandatory embargo <Col N="457" /> on the supply to South Africa of petroleum and petroleum products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do this Government propose to actively campaign within the process of EPC for such an embargo having regard to the known opposition of certain major member states of the Community?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made it clear that this is our view.  As the Deputy will appreciate, there are some inhibitions on our total freedom of action on a matter such as this caused by our membership of the Community which we cannot entirely ignore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying to the House that, up to a certain point, we are prepared to go along with all these nice phrases but that if Germany, Britain or France put the squeeze on us, we will bow down and abstain?  Is that what the Minister is saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already pointed out to the Deputy that we supported a resolution asking the Security Council to consider a mandatory embargo on the supply of petroleum and petroleum products. We cannot go much further than that on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the effectiveness of an oil embargo has, at best, about three years before they replace it with SASOL?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland abstained in the vote at the 35th General Assembly on the resolution dealing with apartheid in sports because of references in the text to the International Declaration against Apartheid in Sport and the draft International Convention against Apartheid in Sport which call on Governments to take action in regard to private organisations and individuals and which it was considered might give rise to constitutional and legal difficulties.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise that our abstention on this resolution does not in any way detract from our absolute condemnation of apartheid or from our adherence to the Olympic principle of non-discrimination in sport.  In casting its vote at the General Assembly Ireland made it clear that it would continue to uphold the Olympic principle and to act in accordance with the spirit of the International Declaration on Apartheid in Sports.</P>

      <P>The Community's humanitarian aid to E1 Salvador was approved by the Council on 17 March in Brussels and will be distributed to the people most in need in E1 Salvador through the International Red Cross. This humanitarian aid consists of (i) approximately £268,000 in emergency aid from Article 950 of the Community Budget and (ii) food aid, consisting of maize and rice, amounting to 1,050 tonnes of cereal equivalent.  Ireland strongly pressed for an early positive decision on this Community aid and we are pleased that we can now make a practical <Col N="462" /> contribution towards relieving the suffering of the people in that country.</P>
      <P>The Community has also lent assistance to E1 Salvador refugees in Honduras. At the end of 1980 a contribution of approximately £172,500 in emergency aid from Article 950 of the Budget was made available to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for its programme of assistance to the refugees.  In a further decision, the Community has since provided emergency food aid assistance for these refugees amounting to 2,000 tonnes of cereals and 100 tonnes of milk powder.</P>
      <P>The Government of the United States, through diplomatic channels, has communicated to us, as it has to other governments in Europe, its concern about shipments of arms from Cuba and other Marxist States to E1 Salvador.  We have indicated, in turn, our support for resolutions of both the UN General Assembly and Commission on Human Rights which &ldquo;call upon governments to refrain from the supply of arms and other military assistance to E1 Salvador in the current circumstances&rdquo;.  We have also expressed our continuing disquiet about reports of widespread violations of human rights, including the killing of thousands of civilians, on the part of the E1 Salvador security forces and armed groups allied to them.  I am glad to note that the United States has signified that it regards as a priority in solving the E1 Salvador crisis the holding of early elections and the urgent implementation of political and social reforms.</P>
      <P>The question of severing diplomatic relations with the United States is not under consideration by the Government. Ireland's relations with the United States are close and friendly and of considerable importance to this country.  What is more, our diplomatic relations enable us to have useful exchanges with the Americans on many issues of interest to both countries, including issues on which our approach may differ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government through our representatives at the United Nations in New York is in frequent contact with the representatives of Latin American countries including Latin American members of <Col N="463" /> the Security Council who share many of our concerns about E1 Salvador.  Because of their geographic situation and diplomatic representations these countries are well informed about the situation in E1 Salvador.</P>
    <P>We are aware that efforts are currently being made to bring the parties in the E1 Salvador conflict together for negotiations. I can assure the House that Ireland strongly supports any moves to promote a negotiated solution to this crisis.</P>
    <P>My Department has been in touch with Irish missionaries in E1 Salvador through intermediaries.  I do not believe that it would be appropriate, in view of prevailing circumstances in E1 Salvador, to disclose details of the content of the exchanges which have taken place.</P>

      <P>As from yesterday, staff in the Benefits Section of my Department who are represented by the Civil and Public Services Staff Association have refused to answer telephone inquiries regarding <Col N="466" /> disability and associated benefit claims. I wish to make clear that this relates specifically to that Benefit Section and does not include a whole range of other benefits like treatment benefits, invalidity pensions, death grants, unemployment assistance, social assistance allowance, widows' pensions, orphans' pensions, retirement pensions and the like.</P>

      <P>This specifically relates to this section.  I understand from the executive of the association that the staff, who have been under considerable pressure in recent months, have decided that the answering of telephone inquiries must be discontinued for a short period to enable them to concentrate on bringing benefit payments up to date.  The Deputies will appreciate that the implementation of the budget increases in the various payments administered by my Department creates very severe pressure at this time of year.</P>

      <P>The 400,000 pension and allowance books have been issued in time &mdash; that is, before tomorrow.  The staff are to be congratulated on the work which they did between budget time and now, in having all these various pension books out in the post offices in time for 1 April. In addition, about 440,000 children's allowances books must be issued to claimants in time for the beginning of June and this work is also under way in the Department.  Talks are continuing with the staff association concerned, with a view to having the normal telephone <Col N="467" /> service resumed at the earliest possible date.  In the meantime, Deputies who wish to inquire about payments in individual cases may telephone my office.  As the facilities there are limited, I would appreciate if this arrangement is availed of only in urgent cases.</P>
      <P>As regards the payment of benefits, there has been a progressive improvement in the position in recent weeks.  In addition, claimants are now co-operating to a much greater extent with the requirement that they quote their RSI and old insurance numbers on all claim forms, medical certificates, and letters to my Department.  As a result, payments are now issuing in nearly all cases within a day or two of the receipt in my Department of medical evidence of incapacity. Many claimants are receiving payment in advance of medical evidence.  It is hoped, therefore, to have payment of benefits back to normal within the next few weeks.  The public offices of my Department are continuing to deal with inquiries from personal callers and are transmitting details of the cases to the relevant benefit sections to be dealt with.</P>

      <P>The Minister is, no doubt, aware that when Deputies &mdash; as has happened from my personal experience &mdash; telephone the Department of Social Welfare requesting that they be put through to the Unemployment Benefit Section they are told that their call to that extension will not be accepted, and the same thing happens as regards maternity and disability benefits.  I ask the Minister to accept that no-one is reflecting on the efforts of the staff in Aras Mhic Dhiarmada, but why is the Minister passing the buck when the responsibility rests on his desk?  It must be the first time that a Deputy of this House has been deprived of the privilege and right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill does not propose to effect any substantive change in the liquor licensing laws.  It is designed to clear the way for an extension of the Dublin Metropolitan District Court District to include most, if not all, of Dublin County.  Such extension of the Dublin Metropolitan Court District was recommended by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in their Twelfth Interim Report and it is a necessary measure to ensure the efficient organisational structuring of the District Courts in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>I am advised, however, that, unless this Bill is first enacted, there would be a possibility that the extension of the court district as proposed might have the effect of extending to Dublin County licensing provisions which at present are applicable in Dublin city, but not in Dublin county.  The reason this is so is that section 35 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962, provides that, for the purpose of the Licensing Acts, the county borough of Dublin shall be deemed to include the whole of the Dublin Metropolitan District Court District and such borough and district shall be deemed for the purposes of those Acts, to be a city.</P>
      <P>There are significant differences in the law relating to the sale of intoxicating liquor in its application to the county borough of Dublin on the one hand and Dublin County on the other.  For example, different conditions apply in relation to the granting of new licences in the borough and in the county.  Another example is the afternoon closing from 2.30 to 3.30 p.m. which applies in Dublin City but does not apply in Dublin County.  Differences also apply in relation to the availability of exemptions for special events; general exemption orders and the opening of licensed premises on Sundays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal position in regard to the &ldquo;city&rdquo; of Dublin, (that is, for the purposes of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts) is that any extension of the county borough automatically extends the &ldquo;city&rdquo; but the <Col N="543" /> effect of any extension, or indeed contraction, of the Dublin Metropolitan District Court District is not clear.  I think it is reasonable that any area incorporated into the county borough should attract the &ldquo;city&rdquo; provisions of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts but there is no good reason why the application of those Acts should be affected by changes in the court district. This Bill proposes, accordingly, that section 35 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962 be amended to put beyond doubt that the reference to the Dublin Metropolitan District therein is a reference to that district as it was at the passing of that Act and that the application of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts is not affected by any change in the court district effected under the Courts Acts.  In other words the Bill proposes to maintain the <i>status quo</i> in relation to the operation of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts in Dublin city and county.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the Bill may need to be amended to cater for two relatively minor points.  The term Dublin Metropolitan District is used also in the Registration of Clubs Acts and the Bill ought to cover that also.  The definition of &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; for the purposes of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts includes a reference to the Dublin Metropolitan District and that aspect also needs to be covered.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Deputy Keating Deputy Keating">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a very slight and largely technical measure which, in essence, does no more than clarify section 35 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962, and, in itself, is not a matter of great weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret the Minister in passing did not take this opportunity to outline the other important measures needing attention and legislative change in the context of a Bill which grandiosely is termed the Intoxicating Liqour Bill, 1980.  One could reasonably have concluded that something more significant than a mere clarification of a section in an Act almost 20 years old would be included.  Therefore, I regret we did not on this occasion &mdash; I gather there is no likelihood of it happening soon &mdash; get an opportunity to discuss <Col N="544" /> the real issues in relation to conditions of licensing, aspects of employment, conditions of sale and many reforms necessary, some of which have been outlined by the Garda Representative Body and other interests relating to the important and growing needs in the worrying area of intoxicating liquor and all its implications.</P>
    <P>I wish to express regret also that we have been given a Bill supported by a statement by a Minister which tells us &ldquo;...the Bill may need to be amended to cater for two relatively minor points&rdquo;. It is not asking too much of the Minister to tell us clearly whether the Bill needs to be amended or not.  He leaves us in an even greyer area than usual.  I ask the Minister to reply as clearly as possible if he has fully considered the whole of the 1962 Act, not just in relation to geographical jurisdiction in the Dublin city area but other aspects of that Act which may need updating in the light of prevailing trends.  Does he intend to introduce at an early date legislation which will deal with the real issues in this area, such as the widescale abuses in certain respects which have been well outlined to the Minister and to many of us in the House by organisations, some with vested interests like the vintners' association, but all of whom are at one about the need to update the law?  I do not intend to broaden the debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It would sometimes appear that the will of Governments and of the Legislature is being frustrated by some of the interests referred to by Deputy Keating.  This is the kind of Bill that could be dealt with more effectively by a committee of the Houses.  It is ridiculous to think of the entire House meeting on a Tuesday afternoon to discuss this piffling measure.</P>

      <P>It has some significance, of course, and if it has to be done it must be done, but within the terms of reference of the Bill we are made aware of some of the anomalies with which the licensing system is riddled.  A net consisting of a number of holes tied with string is a fair description of our licensing laws. In the third paragraph of the Minister's speech we are faced with the fact that for the purposes of the licensing laws people living in different parts of the State are treated differently.  I represent a constituency which is partly in the city and partly in the county of Dublin and there is nothing more laughable than the idea that when you cross this administrative boundary, this mythical line, you are suddenly a different kind of person as far as drinking is concerned.  Those in my constituency who live on the city side of the boundary would be considerably affronted by the idea that they need to be protected by the licensing laws from being able to drink between 2.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Likewise, residents in the county area of my constituency, if they ever paused to think about it, would be equally affronted by the various assumptions that are made about their drinking behaviour, about the different laws, standards and regulations which are <Col N="546" /> applicable to their social drinking as compared with the social drinking of their friends and colleagues on the other side of the administrative boundary.  Here we are dealing basically with a 19th century situation, to some extent carried into the twenties, in which cities are deemed to be dens of iniquity, their inhabitants more prone to drunkenness and all the other vices and therefore to be protected at all costs and prevented from access to alcohol except under strict conditions.</P>
      <P>It is true that there is considerable strain and stress attached to living in many of our cities today and it may even be true that this prompts more ready recourse to alcohol by people under stress and strain in these areas than by those who live outside them, but the answer to these problems is not to create a licensing system such as the one we are now fiddling with in this Bill which makes artificial and arbitrary distinctions between people, depending on their places of residence, or between the holders of licences depending on where the licences are situated.  The answer is to create cities that are reasonable and as far as possible non-stressful places to live and work in.  If this Bill has any significance at all it will point to the absurdity of the distinctions in the present licensing system, and I hope the Minister's overall review will not be long delayed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This Bill reminds me of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  Article 2 provides that &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; shall mean the island of Ireland, and its territorial waters, and Article 3 states that the laws of Ireland shall apply only to the area previously known as Saorstát Éireann. The Minister has told us that this Bill is paving the way for an extension of the Dublin Metropolitan District to include practically the whole of County Dublin. But in the next sentence he told us that the laws which apply to the metropolitan district shall apply only to the old area, to the metropolitan district as it was on the date of the passing of some other Act. It is just a replica of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="547" /> I should like the Minister to tell us what exactly is the effect of the inclusion of most of County Dublin in the Dublin Metropolitan District.  What effect will that have on the administration of justice? What change will it make for the part of County Dublin that is being brought into the metropolitan district which is not in it now?  I should like to have my mind clarified on that before the Minister concludes. The Bill is known as the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1980, an Act to amend the licensing Acts of 1833 to 1977. An Act was introduced in 1960 and another in 1962.  Those two Acts did more than anything else to create the machinery for granting the multiplicity of extensions and exemptions that have been so much complained about over the last number of years.  Strange as it may seem, those Acts were brought in by the present Taoiseach when he was Minister for Justice. One never knows what might be ahead of the Minister of State.  Those Acts very badly need to be updated because they are loosely drawn and are being availed of to apply for and obtain late night extensions by the thousand. For example, in one of the Acts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputies who said that the Minister of State and the Minister for Justice should have availed of this opportunity to update certain aspects of the law.  I will deal with this matter in the broadest possible sense.  There are certain aspects of the licensing laws, particularly with regard to extensions, exemptions and occasional licenses, which are causing grave concern to a broad section of the community.  They are causing worry to parents, embarrassing young people, causing absenteeism from work and damaging this country socially and economically&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This part of the licensing legislation needs to be changed and the Minister is running away from that task.  The Minister of State said he appreciated that this was a social evil and promised to bring in a measure to deal with it.  He has not done that.  He brought in this Bill which the Chair decided is a non-event.  I blame the Minister and the Government for failing to tackle this problem in a realistic way.  This is 1981 and the criteria laid down in 1962 do not have any relevance to today's circumstances.  The whole thing needs to be changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is intended to pave the way for the necessary reorganisation of the Dublin Metropolitan District Court which is very urgently needed. The existing position where areas in the north city suburbs, such as Ballymun and Finglas, are served by the District Court sitting at Kilmainham is very inconvenient for the residents of those areas as they have to travel past the central city courts to reach the courthouse at Kilmainham. These areas could be far more conveniently catered for by the metropolitan district courts at the Four Courts or by the establishment of court venues in those localities.  Similarly, parts of Ballyfermot to the west of the city could be more conveniently catered for at Kilmainham but are, in fact, in the Dublin metropolitan district and are serviced from the city centre courts.  A re-alignment of these areas can only be made if the Dublin Metropolitan District Court district is extended to include all the areas involved.</P>
      <P>To achieve an integrated and rational District Court structure in Dublin city and county it is essential that there be maximum flexibility in relation to the venues at which cases can be taken.  This flexibility can only be achieved if the whole of the city and county are included in one District Court district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Difficulties arise for the legal profession in particular in identifying the exact location of the existing metropolitan district boundary as it cuts through densely populated suburban areas.  An extension of the metropolitan district boundary to make it coterminous with the county boundary would eliminate this difficulty. <Col N="551" /> These are the reasons that have been justifiably recognised for the proposed technical change.  The preparation of legislation for changes in the licensing laws is in train at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the essential difficulty here appears to be the anachronism of the existing city boundary and because there are many other anomalies created by the city boundary being outdated by the spread of the city, does the Minister consider that his provision seeking to rectify that, with respect to a specific area of application, is at odds with other areas needing change which as yet have not been attended to?  Second, and more important, would it be better if he or his colleague or somebody on the other side introduced a measure to deal with the essential problem which is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to ask, before I was interrupted, whether or not the Minister felt that the best way to deal with this issue would be to deal with the fundamental problem which is the outdated city boundary, because there are anomalies throughout every sector of law and administration arising from that and <Col N="552" /> not just in this area.  The Minister may say that that is a matter for his colleagues. However, I am wondering about the mechanics of dealing with such anomalies, whether in education, where there are school meals problems, or in local authority housing, where different subsidies apply.  The fundamental problem is the outdated city boundary which means, as Deputy Horgan and others have pointed out, discriminations or differences in attitudes of central and local government, depending on which side of the road one lives on in certain parts of Dublin.  Could that be dealt with?  That would mean the clearing up of all of these various peripheral and downstream areas.  Otherwise we are going to get a long list of such Bills under various headings and, presumably, have the same interesting but fairly academic debate on each of them.  Why not tackle the central problem?  That is what I would like to know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to confirm the Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit and Motor Vehicle Lubricating Oil) Order, 1981, which was made on 4 March under section 8 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Minister's request the Restrictive Practices Commission carried out an <Col N="555" /> inquiry under section 5(1) of the Act into the operation of the Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit) Orders, 1961 to 1975, into any other matters germane to the operation of these orders and also into conditions which obtain in regard to the agreements under which stations which are company-owned but not company-run are operated.</P>
    <P>The principal orders which the commission considered were made in 1961 and 1972.  The 1961 order regulates the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system of trading &mdash; the system under which a retailer undertakes to deal exclusively in one brand of motor spirit. The 1961 order also prohibits certain restrictive practices in relation to the supply and distribution of motor spirit and lubricating oil.  The 1972 order imposed a ban on the opening of additional company-owned petrol stations for a period of three years.  This ban was extended by several orders the latest of which was made in December, 1980 and it extended the ban to 18 March 1981.  I am advised that when this Confirmation of Order Bill is passed the order becomes retroactive.  Provisions of the order being confirmed will apply from 4 March, the date it was made.</P>
    <P>I attach particular importance to a number of recommendations made by the commission for the amendment of the existing orders.  The first, affecting the supply and distribution of motor spirit, is that it should be illegal for a petrol wholesaler to fix a minimum delivery level to uncontracted outlets at more than 4,000 litres &mdash; 888 gallons &mdash; in the cases where only one grade is being delivered or 5,000 litres &mdash; 1,100 gallons &mdash; where more than one grade is involved.</P>
    <P>Deputies will probably recall that early in 1980 one of the major oil companies informed its uncontracted customers, that is, non-solus customers, of its intention to introduce a minimum delivery of 5,000 litres &mdash; 1,100 gallons &mdash; of one grade or 7,000 litres &mdash; 1,500 gallons &mdash; where more than one grade of petrol was involved.  The commission considered this development very relevant to their terms of reference and they reopened the inquiry to deal with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> A representative of the company which made the proposal accepted that the setting of a minimum delivery of 5,000 litres &mdash; 1,100 gallons &mdash; would automatically exclude those stations which at present have storage for only 1,000 gallons.  In fact, it appeared to the commission that stations with 1,000 gallon tanks could consistently take deliveries of no more than about 4,000 litres &mdash; 888 gallons &mdash; because these tanks can contain up to 70 gallons of slurry and, in addition, the order would be even less than 930 gallons since allowance has to be made for a carry-over; the trader would not want to run out of stock before a delivery was made.</P>
    <P>There is a large number of stations with 1,000 gallon tanks and I do not consider their level of efficiency to be so low as to justify their disappearance from the market. Furthermore, their disappearance would cause problems for the consumers. For these reasons we have decided to agree with the commission that the proposed 5,000 litre &mdash; 1,100 gallon &mdash; minimum delivery could not be accepted.</P>
    <P>However, we are satisfied that the few 2,500 litre &mdash; 500 gallon &mdash; tank stations are in a different class, and it is quite probable that in any event they will not remain in business much longer because they are unlikely to meet the cost of converting to metricated petrol pumps &mdash; something which has to be faced shortly.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, in the interests of efficiency and economy in distribution, petrol suppliers should be free, within reasonable limits, to decide on levels of minimum deliveries and I am satisfied that the commission's proposals are fair and reasonable.  The order provides that where a wholesaler decides to fix minimum deliveries they may not be lower than 4,000 litres &mdash; 888 gallons &mdash; of one grade or 5,000 litres where two or more grades are a delivery.  The provision merely empowers the companies to introduce these minimum deliveries and I hope that, insofar as possible, companies will adopt a more liberal policy than the letter of the law provides for.  In particular, I would urge the companies to give the smaller-capacity outlets reasonable <Col N="557" /> time should they opt to increase their storage facilities.</P>
    <P>The second important recommendation in the report which is provided for in the order relates to the ban on additional company stations which has been in force for about nine years.  The restriction is in the public interest because, otherwise the overall share of the retail market held by the petrol companies would be much greater with the undesirable results of increased rigidity in the market and the danger of restrictive or discriminatory practices.  Company retail outlets numbered 476 in 1979 compared with 514 in 1973.  Retail sales by company-owned stations fell from a maximum of 38.1 per cent of total sales in 1973 to 35.7 per cent in 1974 and did not exceed 36.8 per cent in 1976, 1978 and 1979.  It is clear that the orders stabilised the number of company-owned stations and their share of the market.  The removal of the restrictions would not be justifiable but it is accepted that some modification is called for.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the existing orders were designed to leave such a share of retail sales in the hands of independent retailers &mdash; those who are not tied to petrol companies &mdash; that it would be possible for new wholesalers to enter the market.  However, it was represented that the ban on new company-owned stations made it impossible for new wholesalers to set up a number of retail stations around which to build up a network of independent retailers.  Deputies will appreciate that a new wholesaler in any line of goods has problems and that a new petrol wholesaler &mdash; perhaps an unknown quantity so far as the trade is concerned &mdash; might find it very hard to entice retailers from their normal source of supply.  There is no intention of sabotaging the existing wholesalers but we are satisfied that the emergence of new wholesalers, who could, perhaps, exploit non-traditional sources of supply of petrol, should get certain minimum facilities.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, we have provided in the new order that every wholesaler, existing and prospective, should be free to have 20 retail outlets.  Some have more than 20 <Col N="558" /> at present and they will be free to retain as many as they have, but any company with fewer than 20 stations can make good the short-fall.  And, of course, new wholesalers can open up to 20 stations, which should give them a reasonable launch into retail distribution.</P>
    <P>There was a provision that allowed a station to be opened within three miles of the site of a station from which traffic had been diverted by road developments or which was compulsorily acquired.  This did not enable companies to respond to changed conditions in relation to new housing schemes, shops, factories, traffic flow and so on.  To provide for this, there is a provision in the order that any company should be free to open up two new stations in any year if it divests itself of a like number in that year.</P>
    <P>It has been calculated that the provision to allow additional company stations, subject to a maximum of 20 per company, will not increase significantly the petrol companies' share of the retail market; and, of course, the opening of new or replacement stations will be subject to the Planning Acts.  What has been provided in the order is no more than reasonable.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Commission reported that in 1978 234 out of 478 company-owned outlets were held under short-term arrangements &mdash; that is to say, licences or agreements with a term of less than three years.  I am satisfied that these figures have not changed significantly since 1978.  Evidence given at the inquiry made it clear that the legally weak position of the short-term operators in their dealings with the companies, particularly as regards security of tenure, was a great cause of concern in the retail trade.</P>
    <P>The companies took the position that if they were to give longer leases there would be undesirable consequences for them as long-term lessees could concentrate on other activities at the site at the expense of petrol sales because of the low margin on petrol.  It was reported that average through-put in existing long-lease outlets is very much lower than in other company outlets.</P>
    <P>While no evidence was found that in general the companies have treated their <Col N="559" /> short-term operators other than in a reasonable and humane manner, it is clear that the lack of security of tenure of a station is likely to leave an operator more susceptible to pressure in such matters as trading hours, rents, promotional activities and so on &mdash; most of which will, or be likely to, add to selling costs without a guaranteed comensurate increase in profits.</P>
    <P>What we are providing for in the order is that all short-term operators of company stations should be holders of licences which would run for three years with a right of renewal on fair and reasonable terms unless the company discontinues the operation of the station for a stated reason and in accordance with prescribed procedure.  In general terms, the reasons for terminating a licence are: failure of the licensee to perform his statutory duties; failure to pay money due to the company; serious breach of contractual obligations; failure or inability to run the station satisfactorily; reaching an age limit set by the company; or the decision of the company to dispose of their interests in it, to close it down or run it otherwise than through a licensee.</P>
    <P>Where the question of a breach of contractual obligations or the failure or inability of the licensee is disputed, the licensee has the right to go to arbitration; and where the company decides to dispose of it, close it down or run it otherwise than through a licensee, the licensee will be entitled to compensation.  The notice to be given is prescribed.  Ordinarily it will be three months but in exceptional circumstances &mdash; if there is a serious threat to property or life or any other incident classifiable as <i>force majeure</i>&mdash; the notice can be reduced to whatever in the circumstances is reasonable.</P>
    <P>All existing licences will be deemed to contain provisions indicated in the order and the existing licences should be, in practice, in all respects the same as licences drawn up after the order comes into force.</P>
    <P>Where the question of compensation on termination of a licence arises, the amount of the compensation will consist of (a) payment of one-fifteenth of the <Col N="560" /> licensee's net income for the previous 12 months for each year a licence or short-term lease has been held continuously, plus (b) the full cost of redundancy payments due by the licensee to employees, plus (c) payment of the wholesale price of stocks held by the licensee.  There is a provision which applies where a company say that they propose to dispose of a station, close it down or run it otherwise than through a licensee and it turns out that this reason for not renewing a licence is spurious.  In that event the compensation will be doubled.</P>
    <P>The order provides that disputes in the matter of rents, trading hours, engaging in other activities &mdash; that is, other than the sale of petrol or oil &mdash; should also be arbitrable.</P>
    <P>The arbitration arrangements will be binding on both parties and the arbitrator will be a person appointed by the President of the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
    <P>What I have outlined are the main provisions to give better security to short-term occupants of stations.  Needless to say, I would have no objection to their all getting long-term tenancies which would have the protection of the Landlord and Tenant Acts, but this is not something which could reasonably be imposed on the companies and &mdash; perhaps more important &mdash; fair terms and conditions on which long-term leases would be offered would often be beyond the capabilities of short-term operators. Many of them, I feel sure, simply could not afford to pay the higher charges which could reasonably be expected when a company tied themselves under a long-term lease.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations of the commission was that the existing orders should be consolidated and it is in everyone's interest that people inquiring into the law relating to motor spirit distribution should not have to work their way through a series of orders.  Therefore, much of the order we are confirming reiterates such basic statutory rules as the ban on differentiation between traders of the same class; the circumstances in which suppliers may and may not apply different terms and conditions to different classes of traders; exceptional circumstances <Col N="561" /> in which supplies may be refused; provisions relating to solus agreements; the prohibition of certain agreements and arrangements to restrict persons rights to trade, and so on.  The basic rules have been in force for 20 years and except for some minor additions and amendments made &mdash; mainly in 1972 &mdash; they have stood the test of time and are still appropriate.</P>
    <P>In addition to the major additions I mentioned earlier, there are a few others I think I should draw the House's attention to.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in an existing order that a solus agreement shall not be for a term in excess of ten years and no loan agreement, mortgage or hire purchase agreement can require a retailer to tie himself to a supplier after the expiry of his solus agreement.  So far as it goes, that is still a good provision.  But Deputies will appreciate that, if a retailer who is not a solus retailer still owes money to a supplier after his agreement, lease or licence expires, it will be difficult for the retailer to cut himself adrift and look for a new supplier.  I have no grounds for suggesting that a retailer would often want to look for a new supplier but the commission recommended, and we have accepted, that a supplier should be free to pay off in advance, and in a single payment at any time he chooses, money due to a supplier whether the amount was due in one payment or in instalments. The order provides that, where there is interest payable, it should be reduced by such amount as may be appropriate having regard to the date and the amount of the repayment.  But the interest, whether or not it is reduced, has to be repaid at the same time as the repayment of the capital sum.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that a supplier should be free to require a solus retailer to keep a petrol station open during reasonable hours, but the commission recommended, and we have provided, that the times of opening and closing should be left for the retailer to decide.</P>
    <P>In the course of the inquiry one supplier considered that the use of their brand name and trade mark should be restricted to the contracted independent <Col N="562" /> and company-owned stations.  They said that during the petrol shortage in 1978 some stations were selling petrol which purported to be their brand whereas it was obtained from another supplier. They considered that this could lead to quality control problems and was not fair to their image.  I am satisfied that the company had a grievance in certain respects and there is nothing in the order to prevent a supplier from recovering, or requiring the removal of any sign, which would convey to the public that a special degree of association existed between that station and that supplier.  On the other hand, however, the public are entitled to know what brand of petrol is being sold from a pump and there is a provision in the order that a wholesaler shall not prohibit, restrict or penalise the display on a pump used for dispensing motor spirit an indication of the brand being dispensed by the pump.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the order we are confirming contains all the provisions required to regulate in a fair and equitable way the trading relations of petrol wholesalers and retailers.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see the Bill before the House after such a long time. Many people with interests in petrol retailing and, I am sure, the companies themselves were anxious to know what would be contained in it, and we know now what is contained in it.  The Minister of State finished off his contribution by saying that he was satisfied that the order contained all the provisions required to regulate in a fair and equitable way the trading relations of petrol wholesalers and retailers.  I think he is to some degree expecting too much from the order and being too optimistic in relation to its implementation.  There are sensible recommendations both in the commission's report and incorporated in the order concerning the distribution end of the business, such as the degree of market share which any company should have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the contradictions in the speech of the Minister of State and what is in the retail grocery order, something about <Col N="563" /> which I will be talking later on this evening. The position in relation to the minimum volume for delivery purposes at 880 gallons is a sensible approach and it is accepted in the trade that any retailer who has not a capacity of that kind of volume is really not in a viable position to continue trading.  I appreciate also that there are in some few circumstances cases where this is so and I accept the encouragement by the Minister of State to wholesalers not to pull the carpet too quickly from under those people so that they can continue trading and providing a service for their customers albeit for a short period.  The other restrictions on the further extension of the number of outlets is a welcome innovation and the indefinite continuation of the previous order can be accepted as a sensible and workable approach.</P>
    <P>The report contains figures in relation to company-owned outlets held by licensees under short-term arrangements.  It would seem that about half of the company-owned stations are still run along these lines.  Short-term arrangements are defined as a period of less than three years.  The order now being confirmed by the Bill has what I would regard as shortcomings and has serious implications for the people involved who have waited so long for the publication of the recommendations.  There are concessions in the order.  It is accepted, and in the commission's report it has been stated time and time again, that the position which obtained up to now in relation to short-term licence holders was very vulnerable.</P>
    <P>In the commission's report it is stated that, while it was accepted that long-term tenants were more or less adequately protected by the Landlord and Tenant Acts against the danger of non-renewal of term-expired leases or of renewal on much worsened terms, it was maintained that short-term tenants and licensees were being deliberately kept in a position that their occupancy of their stations could be unilaterally terminated, or the terms of the occupancy unilaterally altered to their disadvantage, at any time a current agreement expired.  That statement <Col N="564" /> of fact was accepted by the commission and I also accept it.</P>
    <P>Having admitted that, the commission should also have accepted the fact that there are two categories of people running the stations.  There are long-term lessees who are protected under the Landlord and Tenant Acts and short-term lessees for whom there is no protection at all.  What do we find?  A gesture made towards these people.  This has come up over the past two or three years when orders were being confirmed for the continuation of restrictions on the expansion of company-owned outlets.</P>
    <P>When he was asked by me and other Members of this House about the unsatisfactory position of these people the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, always had the stock reply that he was awaiting the recommendations in the commission's report.  He got that report and accepted the recommendations without question despite the fact that he is on record in this House as being in total sympathy with them and their untenable position in relation to the companies from which they leased outlets.  He created expectations among those people that he would do something when the time came, but that it was wise for him to await the commission's report.  He awaited it and we now find that a gesture is being made towards relieving the burden which has been on their shoulders for years.</P>
    <P>Up to now these people were subject to an annual renewal of the licence.  This yearly renewal has now been extended to a three-yearly period at the end of which new terms, conditions and regulations can be included in the new agreement which the lessee may or may not accept. If he accepts the new conditions, everything is fine.  In the normal trading experience new conditions of this type apply extra burdens on the lessee.  The company are in a very advantageous position. They can change the conditions for leasing their property at three-yearly intervals. The one to three year extension is a relief to some degree.  The kernel of the problem is insecurity of tenure.  That same insecurity is still there.  Tenancy by right is still denied to those people.</P>
    <P>This is a very strange approach by the <Col N="565" /> commission and the Minister.  There is a very strange admission in relation to the Landlord and Tenant Acts.  In paragraph 6.12 it is stated that the petrol companies had devised systems which avoided the constraints which the Oireachtas had intended should rectify the imbalance of power between owners and occupiers of sites.  This House debated in detail the Landlord and Tenant Bills.  Down through the years the petrol companies have devised methods of avoiding the provisions of those Acts.  They succeeded in avoiding the constraints of those Acts. Even worse they will continue, and are being allowed to continue, to avoid those constraints.  When those Bills were being discussed it was the intention of this House that these constraints should apply to those people.  The obvious thing to do was to ensure that these companies would not be allowed to avoid the provisions of the Acts which were meant to apply to them as well as other landlords.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 6.13 reads:</P>
    <P>The SIMI also considered it unreasonable that an operator who had made a substantial investment of money and time in running a business should be liable to eviction at short notice when his agreement expires.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 6.14 of the commission's report states:</P>
    <P>The petrol companies for their part made no secret of the fact that one of the reasons they prefer short-term leases or licences is in order to avoid incurring the restrictions of the Landlord and Tenant Acts.</P>
    <P>Those are astounding admissions in the commission's report, from which one would expect some positive approach that would eliminate the facility to avoid the restrictions of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed to provide the kind of protection this vulnerable category of people need so badly.  Their expectations on this were built up by the Minister during the past 18 months.  The only thing they have now at their disposal is that they can resort to arbitration.  The only time they can resort to a court is if <Col N="566" /> they are accused of trespassing.  I assume their services would have been dispensed with by the company and they would be deemed to be trespassing on company property.  In all other cases of renewal of agreements and licences they can only resort to arbitration.  After the confirmation of this order anybody who signs an agreement arising out of this order is signing away his constitutional right to have recourse to the courts.  There is a case awaiting judgment in the Supreme Court, Irish Shell <i>v</i> Costello.  The High Court found in favour of Irish Shell and the client appealed that judgment to the Supreme Court.  Judgment is expected to be given on whether or not the agreement between the company and the operator of the retail outlet is a tenancy agreement or purely a licence.  That question has yet to be answered.</P>
    <P>The commission are in fact stating that the licence is not a tenancy clause.  The Minister is seeking to confirm an order which in effect is saying the same thing even though the Supreme Court have not given judgment on this specific question. There always has been provision under the 1954 Arbitration Act for the president of the Incorporated Law Society to set up a body.  The kind of cases arbitration of this kind was meant for are cases of a limited matter.  This is not a limited matter.  We are talking here about the livelihood of people and the taking away of a livelihood by somebody else.  I do not believe anybody except a judge sitting in a court is in a position to give a ruling on such a serious matter.  It is not a limited matter in the legal sense.  If one looks at the legal, social and moral position here one realises that there are cases of individuals and their families who have given 20 or 30 years of their lives and their investment to building up turnover and sales in a retail petrol outlet.  They have spent long hours working in those retail outlets but they have no right to tenancy or no right to having any input to any form of agreement that might be put before them for signature.  The only thing they have now is a three year licence period which replaces the annual licence period and they have resort to arbitration in certain cases.  They have not the right, <Col N="567" /> which in all justice any person in the country should be entitled to, the right to go to court and fight their case if they feel, on legal advice, they have a case to make.  I do not believe the order goes any way towards meeting the expectations of those people or meeting their rights as citizens of this country.</P>
    <P>The question of whether or not their agreements are tenancies or licences has still to be answered.  It is a very important question because if they are tenancies the Landlord and Tenant Acts applies to them and they are given the full backing of Acts of the Oireachtas.  The Commission have admitted that those companies have been avoiding this.  That is the reason why half of the operators of those petrol stations are today on short-term leases.  The companies will not allow them long-term leases because if they do those retailers will come under the terms, provisions and restrictions of the Landlord and Tenant Acts.</P>
    <P>It is a very disappointing day for these people.  While the matters concerning distribution, market share and so on are important in their own way to the people affected by them, surely they are peripheral to the major item that was being discussed, the outcome of which was eagerly awaited, the status of petrol station operators operating on behalf of companies.  It is unjust and it cannot stand up morally.  Many people have spent 20 and 30 years with their families working alongside them and they have invested thousands of pounds to improve their lot and by doing so they increased the sales of the company for which they operated.  Now the companies refuse to grant them the basic rights which other people take for granted.  This commission stopped short of granting them the rights to which they feel they are entitled and now the Minister's order is also stopping short of giving them rights which other people take for granted.  Going through the commission's report one can always expect some reference to what is happening in the UK.  In paragraph 6.30 of the report in relation to the interest of the company and the interest of the operator, <Col N="568" /> disagreements between them and so on, there is a reference to what is happening in the UK.  It says:</P>
    <P>In this connection, our attention was drawn by some of the companies to an arbitration scheme operated by their associated companies in the UK in circumstances broadly similar to those with which we are concerned.  We have made some enquiries about the operation of this system and we are satisfied, having received legal advice, that certain features of it would be suitable to Irish needs.  Our recommendations are set out in the following paragraphs.</P>
    <P>We are again looking over our shoulders at the UK without looking at the pitfalls and the shortcomings in their scheme. We are accepting from companies who operate schemes to their own advantage in the UK their recommendations in relation to what is operational in the UK. Could we not for once in our lives stand on our own feet and approach this as a problem relating to Irish people who have been under severe pressure from multinational companies who do not know their own strength?  It is a very disappointing order for the people, who expected more from it in relation to their vulnerable position as operators of company owned outlets.  The Minister ought to take another look at this order and he should look at it as purely an Irish problem.  Many of these people have been exploited and this exploitation will continue.  The overall result is that people are still left in much the same position as they were.  They are deprived of the rights to which they are entitled and which most of us take for granted.</P>

      <P>My principal criticism arises in relation to the third paragraph of the Bill and it is an administrative criticism in this regard.  At the Minister's request the Restrictive Practices Commission carried out an inquiry under section 5(1) of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, into the operation of the Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit) Order.  Am I right in assuming that it took three years to get the report in relation <Col N="569" /> to the motor spirit inquiry?  I find it incredible that it should take three years to do this work.</P>

      <P>I am not <i>au fait</i> with the general operation of the Restrictive Practices Commission &mdash; I am most familiar with the prices side of the investigations of the National Prices Commission &mdash; but there is a very serious need for strong public criticism where a notice of intention to have an inquiry is published in 1978 and we get the report in 1981.  An explanation is owed for that.  A great deal of the work of the Restrictive Practices Commission is unduly prolonged. Whether one holds the Examiner, the Restrictive Practices Commission or the Minister of the day responsible, we in the Houses of the Oireachtas are not unduly concerned.  We are concerned that many of the inquiries appear to be very protracted.  While I accept that many of the matters are extremely complex, I think that people who work full-time on such matters should be able to produce reports in a reasonable time.  For example, in July 1977 a decision was taken to hold an inquiry into below cost selling but it took the Restrictive Practices Commission 18 months to report on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> If the motor, oil and petrol industries are to have confidence in the operations of the Restrictive Practices Commission it is obvious that the reports of the commission will have to be issued within a reasonable time.  If a person took a case to the Supreme Court he would get a decision more quickly.  I ask the Minister to take note of my critical comments on this matter.</P>
    <P>Generally, I accept the recommendations in the Bill before us.  To a substantial degree the provisions in the Bill will meet current needs and it is important that they be implemented as quickly as possible.  It will be necessary to assess the situation over a period of a year or two. As soon as the order is implemented there should be a through and continuing monitoring of its effects over the next two years and the Minister should not hesitate in his own right, to bring in further amendments if they prove necessary. The Minister should give specific responsibility to staff in his Department to have the situation monitored and he should publish a progress report within 18 months or two years.  At that point we will be able to assess the effectiveness of the measure.</P>

      <P>I wish to make one point which relates to the provision that certain matters are to be arbitrated.  I notice that the report from which Deputy O'Toole was quoting refers, as so often happens, to what occurred in England.  It refers to an arbitration practice of the same material in England although I do not know if arbitration in that country has a statutory basis.  The report Deputy O'Toole was using states that the Department here, having taken legal advice, were of the view that the arbitration system was suitable to Irish conditions.  I do not know what form the legal advice took.  I am not an expert on restrictive practices law and I cannot claim to have digested very thoroughly the order and the legislation that has preceded it.  However, it appears to me that the Minister and his Department would want to go very carefully here.  If the Minister can satisfy the House on this, if discussion on Committee Stage is <Col N="571" /> postponed until next week, it may turn out there is nothing in what I have to say.</P>
      <P>There are three provisions in the order where arbitration is mentioned.  The first is the provision referring to the termination of a licence.  Incidentally, I should like to point out that the form in which these orders are debated here is very inconvenient although I accept it is not the fault of this Minister or his Department. It is extremely difficult to have to go through an order containing 30 pages without the assistance of side notes and heavy type for the number of articles in the way that Bills are presented.  Government Departments should submit orders in the format used in the bound volumes of statutory rules and orders.  That would make things much easier.  Article 28 (4) states:</P>
      <P>Where a licence is terminated in pursuance of clause (iv) or (v) of paragraph (2)(b) of this Article, the licensee may refer to arbitration the question whether the supplier concerned was entitled to terminate the licence, and the supplier shall join in the reference and the licensee and the supplier shall be bound by the award of the arbitrator in the arbitration.</P>
      <P>What we are talking about is the termination of a licence which has a certain legal status.  That licence may amount to a ticket for his livelihood on the part of the licensee.  It is not just a dog or radio licence we are talking about but a licence to run a business on which a person may depend for his livelihood.  We are talking in connection with the termination of something that may be just as serious for a person as is striking off the roll for a solicitor.  In the context of solicitors the Supreme Court has said plainly that to deprive a man of his livelihood is a very serious matter and cannot be described as a limited matter which Article 37 of the Constitution permits, in civil cases and non-criminal matters, to be decided by persons and bodies other than judges and courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one is talking about the termination of a licence in this kind of context <Col N="572" /> one is talking about something which is inherently not suited to decision by an arbitrator.  Of course, people are free contractually to bind themselves in any way they like.  They can bind themselves by contract into even very serious things, even things which will amount to depriving them of a livelihood if they go wrong. I can see no reason why parties might not privately agree to submit such dispute as might arise between them to arbitration and to be bound by the result.  Such agreements are quite common in the world of insurance.  But they rest on contract, they rest on a freely negotiated arrangements between the company and the proposer, the person who wants to be insured.  That is not, or does not seem to be, the case here.  What seems to be the case here is that the licensee, in other words, one party in this situation, is being given the right to refer the question to arbitration and, if he does that, the supplying company is bound to join in the reference and both himself and the supplying company, the supplier, are bound by the award of the arbitrator.  In other words, if I may just start with a company &mdash; although of course with a company one would not pretend that the matter in their instance is a question of their livelihood&mdash;the company is apparently at the option of the licensee, or of the former licensee, and the company is apparently bound to accept and is bound by the award of an arbitrator.  So far as this dispute is concerned between the company and the supplier, the company is deprived of that which it otherwise would normally have and which in my view it cannot be deprived of, namely, its right to resort to the court for a determination of an issue of law.  And this is an issue of law, if I have not misunderstood the purpose of the order, because it is an issue arising on a legal regulation of this area which the Minister here proposes. I do not want to be polemical about it and I may have misunderstood the law.  I began by saying I had not studied this measure very carefully; in fact I did not even realise it was to be debated today until Deputy O'Toole drew my attention to it around lunchtime. However, from the short examination <Col N="573" /> I have given it, it seems to me that, from the supplier's point of view, no question of an option arises.  He is apparently being forced into an arbitration, forced into accepting a method of adjudication other than the adjudication of a judge in a court.  There is ample authority in this country for the proposition that there is a basic right to resort to the courts &mdash; and I do not mean to an arbitrator but to the courts &mdash; for the settlement of a dispute.  In particular the High Court is given, by Article 34, a full and original jurisdiction in the power to determine all questions and matters of law or of fact, civil and criminal.  Therefore, a purported subtraction from that power of the High Court by this article here, I think is questionable &mdash; that is, so far as the supplier is concerned.</P>
    <P>Of course the licensee is in a different situation.  The wording of the sub-article here is:</P>
    <P>....the licensee may refer to arbitration the question....</P>
    <P>Laymen find it difficult to understand that word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I must say I do not find it easy to be sure about it myself always either.  In an instrument like this the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; does not always mean exactly what it seems to mean.  There are contexts in which &ldquo;may&rdquo; means &ldquo;must&rdquo; and I am not sure which one is here intended. I think that on the whole, it is intended to be an option.  I cannot imagine it is intended that the law, in the sense of the courts and the judges, should be ousted by the operation of this sub-article but I should like to be told that plainly by the Minister.  On the face of it, it looks as though the licensee whose licence is terminated because of an alleged breach of contract, for example, has the option to have the question of whether or not he is in breach of contract determined by an arbitrator rather than a court but that if he wished he could insist, go ahead and have the matter decided by a court by bringing a declaratory action against the supplying company.</P>
    <P>But if it is genuinely an option &mdash; in other words, if this is intended to be in ease of the licensee, to give him a facility <Col N="574" /> which he otherwise would not have &mdash; I honestly think it should be made somewhat clearer.  If, on the other hand, what the Minister intends is to exclude the court altogether from the option of this scheme, in my view that is very questionable. We are talking about a very serious matter from the point of view of the licensee &mdash; not perhaps from the supplier's point of view but from that of the licensee.  We may be talking about his livelihood.  And if it really is intended to exclude the court and judges from determining questions on an issue on which his livelihood may depend, then, for what it is worth, my view is that this order will be invalidated, will be struck down by the High Court quite soon, as soon as the first licensee wishes to challenge it.</P>
    <P>Sub-article (4) of Article 29 contains a similar provision:</P>
    <P>Where a supplier refuses,..., to grant another licence upon the expiration of a licence, the licensee may refer to arbitration the question whether the supplier was entitled to refuse to grant the other licence and the supplier shall join in the reference and the licensee and the supplier shall be bound by the award of the arbitrator in the arbitration.</P>
    <P>Here again it looks as though the licensee is being given an option.  It looks as though, in ordinary language, he is being given merely the facility of having an arbitrator appointed, though that of course still does not avoid the hardship on the supplier who appears to be, if the order means what it says, prevented from having his ordinary resort to the court. But if it does mean that the licensee is obliged to resort to an arbitrator, and if the Minister's intention is to prevent them from resorting anywhere else, then it is just as questionable as the first of these provisions.</P>
    <P>The third one is in sub-article (2) of Article 32, Which says:</P>
    <P>Where there is a question whether compensation under this Order is payable to a person by a supplier or a dispute or difference as to the amount of such compensation, the person may <Col N="575" /> refer to arbitration the question, dispute or difference and the supplier shall join in the reference and the person and the supplier shall be bound by the award of the arbitrator in the arbitration.</P>
    <P>Here again I think the House would like to be told plainly whether or not this is an attempt to exclude the courts.  If so, depending on how serious the matter is, I would imagine that it is constitutionally fragile.  I do not want to raise an alarm about this.  I would be perfectly happy if the Minister says &mdash; well, he can say either of two things; it may be that I have misunderstood the thing; it may be that there is no such intention, that I have misunderstood this or that I am ignorant of some item of law which would answer this question quickly and simply.  But, if that is not the case, the Minister I hope would at least say &mdash; and this would satisfy me fully &mdash; that he will ask the Attorney General's Office to look at this aspect of his order between now and Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputies for their general acceptance of the Bill.  I shall try to deal as best I can with the questions Deputies have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I do not accept that there has been any change of mind on the part of the Minister in relation to acceptance of the commission's recommendations. The recommendations which have been implemented confer a security not previously enjoyed.  When licenses expire, they are renewable.  This right can be lost only in certain circumstances and, for the greater part, where it is lost compensation must be provided.  It would seem, therefore, that the new conditions for these operations will generally be so improved that licensees could enjoy all of the rights of a tenant under the landlord and tenant legislation with the exception of the right of assignment.  The essential thinking was that all rights pobsible, up to the right of assignment, should be enjoyed.  To facilitate this the <Col N="576" /> provisions we enacted were the only ones possible.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of arbitration, it is suggested that it is far better to provide specifically for arbitration than leave it to a small trader to go to the courts so that in this way the costs and delays involved in protracted hearings might be avoided.  Again, it is not intended that a person be debarred from going to the courts.  Deputy Kelly raised a question in relation to the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  The intention is that it should be optional.  It is not the intention to preclude access to the courts.  The exercise of the option would ordinarily be cheaper and quicker and the provisions are accordingly considered as being a facility for the licensee.  It is not intended to deprive the licensee of the right to go to court.  I trust that satisfies Deputy Kelly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt.  Let me briefly say that that certainly satisfies me so far as the licensee is concerned. However, the supplier is still stuck because, if the licensee opts for that mode, the supplier is apparently bound by an arbitration and is apparently kept from resorting to the courts.  That is the case if the words of the order mean what they say.</P>

      <P>The order itself has gone a long way towards helping to improve the existing situation.  The question of the Supreme Court was raised by Deputy O'Toole.  Here, again, if any amendment is considered desirable on foot of a court decision there is then the possibility that introducing such an amendment would be given consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond raised the question of the length of time taken for this report to be put forward.  The position is that <Col N="577" /> the Restrictive Practices Commission have many things to deal with.  It was not a question of their sitting down for a whole 15 months on this particular item. They have been dealing with many other matters and must, from time to time, deal with matters which are regarded as urgent.  This has not helped towards having the report produced as quickly as we would have liked.  Another point is that, apart from the actual drafting of the order and printing of the report, the Minister is required to consider the common good before deciding to proceed with the making of the order.  All these matters had to be gone into before the order was made. In relation to a matter raised by Deputy Desmond, orders made under the Act are monitored by the Examiner of Restrictive Practices.  If any problems are uncovered, such remedial action as is necessary will be urgently taken.</P>
    <P>I think that covers, as briefly as possible, most of the points raised by the Deputies.  Again, I thank them for the manner in which they have accepted the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a small point to make in relation to subsection (3) of this section.  The basic objection of Members on this side of the House last week to the cut-off point or the minimum figure applies here also.  This is the question of the £100.  Our argument of course, would be, that the opportunity for claims should apply to any amount.  There is no justification, morally or otherwise, for limiting the actual jurisdiction, as it were, under the section.</P>
      <P>When goods are stolen the loss is frequently greater than when property is damaged.  Is there not therefore a case to be made for applying the Act to goods stolen?  The Bill does not allow for the recovery of such loss and it seems to us to be unjust that such a situation should be created.  We argue that the section should be reconsidered in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said the last day, it is not proposed to make an alternation in the Bill which would eliminate the cut-off point.  I justified the Government's action when I suggested that the £100 cut-off point proposed is in excess of the £5 which was fixed in 1898.  I pointed out also that this limit will be examined in the light of changes in the value of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We made this point on section 6, but I do not recall the Minister answering it in relation to subsection (1) <Col N="579" /> of this section which deals with the number of people who have to be together, tumultuously and riotously assembled, and causing the damage.  Where fewer than three people are so gathered together to cause damage the owner of the property is liable to lose out. Obviously that is wrong.  If two people inflict malicious injury or damage it is a matter of no consequence to the person who suffers the loss whether there were two, three or more people involved. Three or more people is derived from the definition of unlawful assembly in common law and there does not seem to be any logical or just basis for it here.  At the worst it should be reduced to two people &mdash; I do not think you could have unlawful assembly of one &mdash; but the loss suffered is the same and the entitlement to compensation should not have any relationship to the number involved, which in these circumstances is irrelevant.</P>
      <P>To my mind it would be more difficult to prove that malicious damage had been caused by three or more people.  One person might be apprehended and convicted although it was known that other people were involved.  When one person admits that he or she was involved in inflicting damage, that should be adequate, but it is not in the Bill.  What does the Minister feel about that?</P>
      <P>Coming back to the cut off point of £100, I honestly cannot accept what the Minister said.  Since we discussed the matter last week I made some inquiries and I understand there are significant numbers of cases of malicious damage of about that sum or less.  Unfortunately, such damage is inflicted on people who were less able to afford it, the kind of persons who are likely to have less property to be damaged.  If you have an elderly or an old person whose home is attacked, whose doors are kicked in or widows broken, it is most improper to disentitle such a person in regard to compensation. Such people are debarred from even applying for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to say that once again we have here a Bill clearly giving advantage to those of property and strength in the community.  It is unjust that the ordinary <Col N="580" /> person will not have access to the law. Why should a person be forced to suffer loss without compensation because the amount is less than £100?  That sum could be the difference between life and death; it could certainly cause great hardship to people of that kind.  What is an old woman to do if her windows have been broken in?  Why should she have to replace them herself?  It is not adequate to say that this anomaly has been in the law up to now.  I accept that perhaps it is not any worse now, but it is fundamentally wrong that any damage inflicted maliciously should not be open to a claim for compensation.  The cost of administration is a secondary matter which does not have direct relevance to the question of giving justice to people.</P>
    <P>Apart from anything else, this provision can have the effect of encouraging the inflation of claims.  In other words, a person who has a claim for £80 or £90 can inflate it to more than £100.  Here we are creating two-tier justice.  People with less property are far less able to bear small losses than those with large properties.  I do not advocate it, of course, but if there is to be distinction drawn it should be in the reverse direction &mdash; people with substantial property and standing might be entitled to less compensation.  If we accept the idea of malicious damage being compensated for we should accept it without this type of insidious and unjust discrimination.  Earlier the Minister said he would consider this before Report Stage.  If he said so I accept he will do it in this respect, but I suggest he should also do it in relation to subsection (1).</P>
    <P>The Bill in relation to goods being stolen is important.  The loss suffered can be just as great as damage done to property. It is no answer to say that a person should be insured against such loss.  I would think, therefore, that we are retaining anomalies that we should have the guts to get rid of.  It is quite wrong that a person with very little means who suffers the loss of £80 or £90 worth of windows or doors finds that he is unable to claim at all while somebody else can claim damages of £120 or £150.  Both of those two points are fundamental to this section and I do not think we can let them go <Col N="581" /> lightly.  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider his attitude in these two respects at least.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have previously said, I will give consideration to this matter on Report Stage.  Deputy Keating should know also that section 25 will indicate that the amount of £100 can be varied by Ministerial Order, and not necessarily upwards; it can be varied downwards in certain situations that might require that that be done.  At the moment I am satisfied, subject to further examination, that what is prescribed is satisfactory and will meet the vast majority of cases equitably.  On the question of obtaining compensation, I am also satisfied that there are other channels that people can use in this regard.  By that I mean the right of people to insure their property.</P>
      <P>In relation to three people comprising riotous, tumultuous assembly, this does not in any way preclude an injured person from seeking compensation where only one person is involved.  The fact that three people are involved would clearly indicate that there might have been an attempt in the first instance to intimidate or to use an unusual amount of violence against a person or against property.  The definition of riot calls for three persons. It is the only situation in this Bill where there is an additional compensatory feature, that is, under section 6, loss resulting from riot can be compensated for. The fact that three people must be involved for the purposes of the definition of riot as we know it at common law does not do any more than clearly reflect the aggravated attack or aggravated type of malice that would be entered into. The fact that one may be involved simply means that it is not a riot but there is no question of any person being denied his right to compensation just because of the number of people involved.  I hope that clarifies the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we leave that, would the Minister be willing to comment on the request I made in relation to the possibility of application for compensation in respect of larceny?  There are <Col N="582" /> times when the loss suffered by somebody as a result of having goods stolen can be as great or even greater than the loss suffered when the property is damaged. It seems logical that it should be open to compensation as well.  For example, there may be circumstances where a person's car is stolen and is subsequently found semi-vandalised.  It may be that the person would be better off if the car had not been found at all because then he would be entitled to compensation under the fire and theft clause of his insurance policy whereas, if the car is found again and is badly vandalised he is not entitled to such compensation from the insurance company.  With the delays in getting payments of compensation from the local authority, he is worse off than if the car had not been found.  That seems extraordinary and there seems to be a problem here.  I wonder if the Minister will comment on that aspect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that to extend the area for which compensation can be claimed to include larceny would be unnecessary for a number of reasons, apart from the fact that we must be realistic. Deputy Kelly said the last day that I made the point that consequential loss was not being prescribed for in the Bill because we did not have the necessary finances.  The State, like every other organisation, has limited resources and we must ensure that they are used wisely and with the greatest possible effect accruing from the manner in which they are spread around.  Even if it was not unnecessary to extend the area to include larceny it certainly would be premature to do so.  We have gone quite a considerable distance in section 6.  The inclusion of property unlawfully taken in a riotous situation from certain areas is new and extends the scope of compensatory cover over a very wide area.  The phrase &ldquo;unlawfully taken&rdquo; does not necessarily cover larceny but, to some degree, it would cover the larceny of property in a certain context where a riot occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister see an anomaly in the situation where someone whose car has been stolen would be better <Col N="583" /> off if the car were not discovered?  It so often happens that, having recovered the car in a semi-vandalised state, the person claims compensation for malicious damage and finds that after waiting two years he gets only part of his claim. There are times when both the idea of theft of property and the consequential losses are, in effect, aspects of the malicious damage or loss suffered by the person. To be logical and consistent, we should not build into a Bill aspects of law which almost invite people to exaggerate the circumstances of the unfortunate occurrence in order to ensure that they will get malicious damage compensation. If a person finds that his means of livelihood, say, a van or a lorry, is stolen and vandalised or put off the road, he is entitled to compensation for the loss incurred but not for the loss of earnings arising therefrom.  I do not understand that logic. The Minister has said that it is not necessary to include larceny but he did not justify that statement.  He said also that the State's resources have to be expended wisely.  That is fair enough.  But if budgetary considerations or financial policy are dictating what is included, then let us say so.  I want to argue on the grounds of natural justice that it is reasonable to request compensation for losses arising from the malicious infliction of damage or injury along with compensation for the damage caused to, for example, a vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree fundamentally with the Minister on that point.  I think it is quite wrong that when two people suffer the loss of their car, one person's car being recovered, the other person's car not being recovered, the second person is the one who suffers becaused his car has been vandalised, is off the road, requires all kinds of repairs, and it takes a couple of years to get the money back.  People have almost a vested interest in not recovering the car.  That is wrong.  Likewise in the case of a man who drives a lorry for a livelihood, his lorry is stolen, put off the road by vandals and perhaps he has to wait for a month or two until a part arrives which is needed to repair that <Col N="584" /> lorry.  He loses £100 wages per week.  He cannot claim for anything.  That also is wrong.  Therefore, whatever has been done up to now is not appropriate.</P>
    <P>I have a basic reservation about the question of the cut-off point of £100.  I am pleased the Minister has agreed to reconsider that.  Perhaps we will have a review of the situation on Report Stage which will bring equal justice for everyone in that respect.</P>
    <P>I want to state our disagreement with the Minister in relation to the question of larceny and the question of consequential loss, both of which seem to be rightly the area within which a claim could be made in some circumstances, in respect of which in this Bill no opportunity arises, regardless of hardship and the fact that both of them arise directly from malicious injury, deliberately and wantonly inflicted.  This Bill rules out the possibility of such a claim.</P>
    <P>Section 5, as amended, agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of the same arguments apply to this section.  I will not repeat them.  The question of consequential loss arises in subsection (4).  The same arguments apply.  I find subsection (2) a little wordy.  It reads as follows:</P>
      <P>For the purpose of subsection (1), damage shall be taken to be maliciously caused only if caused &mdash; (a) by a wrongful act done intentionally without just cause or excuse, or (b) wantonly,...</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to beware of too many negatives.  If an act of damage is maliciously caused only if caused by a wrongful act intentionally, that is adequate. I do not understand how you can have a wrongful act done intentionally with just cause.  That is probably more in the area of semantics than law.  These matters should be reasonably legible to the layman as well as the lawyer.</P>

      <P>On that point, it would be fair to describe an act done wantonly or intentionally as a malicious act done recklessly or without due regard to the consequences which it would inflict.  The section provides something new for the first time in Irish law.  Heretofore, the English Riot Damages Act, 1886, provided for compensation for the unlawful damage to property or loss which occurred in certain situations in a building or within the curtilage of that building. The Criminal Damage Compensation Act Northern Ireland Order, 1977, also applies.  It is a new departure for us and greatly extends the scope in the area of compensation, together with the fact that larceny, if it occurred during the course of a riot, from a building or from a yard surrounding the building or attached to it, within the curtilage of the building, that property could be compensated for under this new provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The preliminary notice in section 8 (2) in which we talk about a person seeking compensation under the Act shall, within 14 days after, as the case may be, the damage was caused or the property was taken, serve, in accordance with this section, preliminary notice, in such form as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Minister, of his intention to apply for compensation.  I wonder if that notice might be published in a newspaper circulating in the area.  Would there be any merit in such a proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 10 (2) a ratepayer shall be entitled to appear at a hearing.  If the application is not published, there does not appear to be much benefit to the ratepayer by giving him this right.  How is the ratepayer expected to know that he or she is entitled to be present at such a hearing if there is not some way of communicating this to the general public?  I am talking about a provision which would be analogous to the statutory requirement in relation to planning applications which should be included in the local newspapers.  It would bring home to the community the fact that they are paying for malicious damage.  Sometimes this is lost sight of.  It is money which is being taken from classrooms, hospitals and all the services which are needed.  Therefore, regular publication of notices in <Col N="587" /> local newspapers, and national newspapers where appropriate, indicating that these hearing were going to take place and that the ratepayer was entitled to attend would not just be sound from the point of access by the public but would be very good public instruction.  Nobody will forget that this erosion of standards is going on and that they are paying directly for it.  Therefore, the Minister might like to consider that point.  I agree that the preliminary notice should be served within 14 days.  I think it is seven days at present.  The shortness of the time is, presumably, to ensure that bogus applications are not made.</P>
    <P>However, I am often troubled by these provisions.  I have argued many times that there are many circumstances under which it is impossible for a person to make an application within the deadline. There are some people who are not as <i>au fait</i> as others with the exigencies of the law in this respect.  If a person is entitled to claim malicious damage, it is very wrong if he or she should be subject to loss merely because he or she, for good reason, did not complete the application within a week or two.  If a person has a claim it should be open to being lodged within the statute bar limit of six years. It is not as if one would have a vested interest in delaying the application to get inflated compensation, because if a person decides not to claim for two years that is his problem.  He will get the real value at the time of the incident, not the current value or the updated value due to inflation.</P>
    <P>There are cases where a person has lost a malicious injury claim because he did not fill up an application form.  He might not be able to read, he might not know to whom to go, he might be in hospital, sick or injured, he might be out of the country when the property is being damaged, he might forget about it, or he might be suffering another loss or trauma.  These people are being deprived because they have not filled up the forms.</P>
    <P>I would like to be clear if we already have provision for the extension of time particularly in cases where people are in hospital or are sick.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> I understand that the Court, under the present law, has power to extend time under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, section 21 (2), and one or two other appropriate legislative measures.  In case of doubt and in order to ensure that we are encouraging equality of access to law, not giving it begrudgingly after somebody has gone through the rigour of getting a Court adjudication to grant an extension of time, I believe there is a case to be made for putting this provision into this Bill so that the time can be extended.</P>
    <P>The following words might be appropriate &mdash; that the powers of the court shall include power to extend or vary the time prescribed for doing any act pursuant to this Act, including the taking of any proceedings in relation to the application in any case where it appears to the judge that such extension or variation is just and reasonable.</P>
    <P>That would mean that if someone had wantonly, to use the Minister's word, or had been involved in a wrongful act unintentionally without just cause or excuse, such person would not get the benefit of the doubt from the judge.  I have had, and I am sure the Minister did too, many people coming to me saying they did not know where to get the form or to whom to go, that they did not know they had to fill in the form, that they told the Garda and did not hear any more about it, or any one of a hundred good reasons.  These genuine cases should be guaranteed equality of access in terms of their liability to lodge a claim and should be fully compensated at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Under the previous section if a claim is less than £100, under this legislation the Minister is liable to tell the claimant he is not entitled to claim because the amount is too small.  As we will deal with that point on Report Stage, I will not go into it in detail now.  I am making the case for writing into this legislation the possibility of extending that time on reasonable grounds and I ask the Minister to consider it sympathetically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the right of the ratepayer to come to court and be heard.  I do not think it would be <Col N="589" /> necessary to provide here for the publication of the serving of the notice.  The serving of the notice has been changed; it is now served on the member in charge of the Garda station in the locality where the malicious damage was done and on the local authority.  The publication of the service of such a notice would not be of interest to a person living outside the locality.  If a person has relevant information, he may wish to tell it in court.  It is only after investigation that the Garda know all the facts.</P>
      <P>A claim for malicious damage cannot be compared with a planning application. A person living some distance from the area in which the application for planning permission is made could be interested but, in the case of malicious damage a person would have to live very close and know a great deal about the occurrence. He would probably be in a position to comment on the background to the situation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned making the community aware of the compensation being paid.  This is a very valid point.  It is desirable that people should be informed of the money they have to pay for the actions of wrongdoers in their community.

      <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>Any ratepayer of a local authority which is a party to the proceedings shall be entitled to appear at the hearing of an application for compensation under this Act and be heard by the court in relation thereto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from that that any ratepayer of a local authority which is a party to the <Col N="591" /> proceedings shall be entitled to appear at the hearing of an application for compensation but that is not at one with what the Minister said a short time ago.  The Minister expressed the view that somehow such matters concerned only a small number of interested parties.  It is a new concept in practice for ratepayers of a local authority area, such as those in Dublin city, to take such a clinical interest in the proceedings that they might take up the opportunity of participating in or being present at such hearings.  In principle it is a good thing that they should know about that.  I venture to suggest that they do not know of their right in the matter and there is no way they will know unless something positive, such as I suggested, is done about it.  The possibility of them attending should be published and any such application should be accompanied by a brief notice outlining details of the hearing and the fact that people are entitled to be present.  The mechanism is in existence in relation to the Planning Acts although I am aware that there are some dissimilarities.</P>
    <P>There is no point in giving people a right unless they know where, when, how often and in what circumstances they can take it up.  We are being a little hypocritical if we tell people they can be present but it is not intended to tell them where or what will happen.  It is not good enough to tell them that if they are anxious to know what will happen to ring the law department of the local authority concerned and if they are not too busy and are anxious to give the information sought &mdash; there is no guarantee that they will tell the person anything because there are no laws relating to any type of access to information here &mdash; they will learn the details of such applications. That is not good enough.  It would be a positive advantage for the average ratepayer to be regularly presented in the media with the knowledge that their money is being spent on malicious injury claims by virtue of the relatively low and declining standards in the community.  It would be a positive incentive to get people thinking along the lines of improving standards if they knew about such access <Col N="592" /> and that they could participate.  There are many voluntary groups, community or residents associations, or individuals, who might engage their attention in such situations to the benefit of the community.</P>
    <P>The price of creating such an awareness and bringing about such participation is very small.  The right contained in subsection (2) should be communicated to those it is intended to apply to, otherwise it is a right that will not be used. The Minister knows that.  It will be a pity if this good provision is not exercised.  I cannot see it being exercised unless the Minister adopts my suggestion.  Does the Minister agree?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the right has existed since the Act of 1898 means that it is known to many people.  It should be remembered that this provision only affects those who can make a worthwhile contribution to such applications.  The people concerned would live near to, or have been near, the place where the malicious occurrence took place.  Otherwise they would not have much to offer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>A person in attendance at such a case may suddenly find that he or she could benefit by lodging a similar claim to the one at hearing.  Such a person may be in a position to offer helpful evidence as to the integrity or otherwise of the applicant.  The Minister's reply is in direct conflict with the spirit of the subsection which states that any ratepayer may attend the hearing.  The implication of the Minister's reply is that this will only concern the few people directly involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In Dublin city for example that could mean 750,000 people. What does the Minister mean by &ldquo;ratepayer&rdquo;? It is important that the ratepayer gives notice prior to the hearing because otherwise it could lead to an injustice.  A ratepayer may have evidence to give to the Court but in the short time available it might not be possible to deal with it.  In other words, is there a case to be made whereby the ratepayer who is anxious to attend should put his submission on record or give notice of his intention to participate so that his contribution may be validly assessed and the best use made of it?  Otherwise we are in a situation where his participation would be pointless and would not be maximised in terms of its benefit.  I should like to suggest the inclusion of the following provision: &ldquo;Provided the ratepayer serves notice on the local authority and the applicant one month prior to the hearing of the application for compensation.  The reasons for the appearance and the statement of the evidence to be given by such person and a statement of submissions to be made by such person shall be given within the said time.  The applicant for compensation may waive the said time stipulation of one month.  If the application appears in the court list for hearing less than one <Col N="594" /> month after the ratepayer could, having regard to the time factors involved, have served such notice herein before referred to, the judge shall, unless the applicant waives the time stipulation, adjourn the case&rdquo;.  That is designed to ensure that a person who can honestly make a useful contribution to a hearing will have that contribution considered prior to the hearing so that people on both sides can evaluate it and make the necessary response to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>A ratepayer is a person who held that status prior to the abolition of rates on private houses and agricultural land by the Government.  Even though they do not pay rates they are not deprived of the status they held prior to the abolition of rates.  The Deputy felt there was no provision for the ratepayer who felt he could make a contribution to do so.  Any ratepayer has a right to attend in court and a right to speak.  If he has something to contribute it would be normal to accept that in the first instance he would go to the Garda or the local authority or both and make his contribution. It would be expected of a normal interested ratepayer in the community who had knowledge or a contribution to make in court at some time to communicate first of all with the investigating body, the Garda, or the local authority who at the end of the day might have the responsibility of spending his money in an area of compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave that then. Under subsection (2) are there any circumstances whereby a sharp legal brain might adjudicate that this section excludes anybody who is not paying rates?  After all, it does say &ldquo;Any ratepayer of a local authority which is a party to the proceedings&rdquo; and so on.  A ratepayer is someone who pays rates.  People who have been de-rated, quite rightly, by this Government are not paying rates. There are circumstances, therefore, under which this section could apply only to the business or commercial sector.  If language means anything, a ratepayer is someone paying rates.  It is all very fine for us to nudge, nudge, wink, wink, and <Col N="595" /> understand that we really mean people who were paying rates prior to that date that this new arrangement came into being, but I can see a problem here. Somebody might say that a person is not entitled to be here as he is not a ratepayer, by reason of the definition of the word.  Should the term be &ldquo;person resident in a local authority area&rdquo;, &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; or something else which would not be as exclusive as &ldquo;ratepayer&rdquo;?  The average person today is not a ratepayer, whatever else he is.  People are taxpayers, unemployed and many other things but they are not ratepayers.  There are also ratepayers in our community.  Therefore, we have two categories of people, those who pay rates and those who do not.  On the face of it, this section applies to those who pay rates, and I see a problem here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is telling me that the people entitled to be party to a proceedings and to appear at the hearing of an application are any people in a local authority area.  Is that not the sense of the section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated that anybody who would wish to make a contribution in court either for or against in <Col N="597" /> this situation as a ratepayer is defined by other legislation.  A person who was not a ratepayer and has something to contribute in court has the right, responsibility and duty to go along to the Garda or the local authority, and either party or both parties will be glad to have whatever information or views that person has to offer or contribute that would be relevant to the proceedings.  The person who is not a ratepayer as defined in the 1978 Act is not necessarily precluded because he is not a ratepayer, on the basis that he has the usual opportunities and rights to go along and make his view known to the investigating body or the body who might ultimately be compensating him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason the ratepayer is mentioned is that the ratepayer is going to pay the piper and it is only right that that person should have a very special mention.  The Deputy by his earlier comments was concerned only about the fact that there was not greater circulation of information to ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 17 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978 has described who is now a ratepayer even though such a person may be in receipt of full rates relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem and I want it cleared up.  The Minister of State is saying on the one hand that a ratepayer as traditionally defined has an entitlement to be party to and to be represented at this kind of hearing and that others may go to the Garda and be represented indirectly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The ratepayer may do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="598" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Right, but in view of the fact, the reality, that nobody except those in the commercial sector are paying rates, such a discrimination is illogical and unreasonable because the rates are now funded from central Government revenue raised on all people.  I had hoped that this section did not create two standards and two different categories of people. The Minister of State now confirms that it does and that some people, those classified when rates were payable &mdash; a system we have abolished because we considered it unjust &mdash; still retain rights which applied to such an unjust status &mdash; unjust not because they paid rates but because the whole system of rates was unjust and presumably that is one of the reasons that it was abolished, and there may be other reasons somewhat less worthy.  Why are we apparently now re-writing into law two different sets of entitlement to participate in disputes affecting the hearing of malicious damage claims?  That is what the Minister has said and if that is the case it is fundamentally wrong.  Rates now are raised out of Exchequer funds, right across the board regardless of ownership of homes or otherwise.  Therefore, it is quite wrong that somebody who would have been paying rates if rates were continued has the capacity for direct participation which others have not.  If the Minister thinks this is the best way to do it, I should like him to have another look at the section between now and Report Stage.  Perhaps we are not getting the facts of the case.  I should imagine anybody living in a local authority area would be entitled to participate in a hearing. That is not what the Minister said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to be smart or slick.  I raised this point to be helpful.  I am very clear on what the Minister said.  He said that a person who was defined as a ratepayer under the Act to which he referred was entitled to direct participation and to be present at the hearing.  Those not paying rates, for example, local authority tenants, a very substantial number of people, and people <Col N="599" /> in private rented accommodation, and there are 300,000 to 400,000 of them, are not entitled to direct participation but are entitled to go to the Garda and get them to make an impact on the situation.</P>
      <P>Bad as that was when rates were being paid, because then there was some degree of <i>rationale</i> in the argument, now that rates have gone it appears the Minister is saying that this distinction, this discrimination, is being perpetuated.  If it is, it should not be.  It is quite wrong.  I wonder is the Minister clear on what he is actually saying to us today.  I do not believe that is the spirit or the letter of this Bill.  The whole difficulty arises from an anachronistic use of the word &ldquo;ratepayer&rdquo; which should not be there.  By the time the lawyers are finished with it the word &ldquo;ratepayer&rdquo; will mean a person who pays rates.  I want the Minister to clear up this matter.  Are we saying that only those who are liable to pay rates as of old are now entitled to direct participation in a hearing for malicious damages and that others have a lesser and inferior right?  Is that the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Ratepayers as described in section 17 of the 1978 Act are people who have not lost status as ratepayers for the purposes of any enactment solely by reason of being made an allowance under this Bill.  That is the Local Government Act, 1978.  Examples of the enactments in which there are sections which come to mind are sections 76 to 79 of the Local Government Act, 1946, which give ratepayers a say in changing the names of towns, townlands, streets and localities, and section 22(2)(c) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, which gives certain rights to ratepayers to make objections to draft development plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost everybody who possessed property paid rates prior to 1977.  That situation has changed and the status which people held at the time by reason of the sections I have referred to has not changed from the point of view of this Bill.  I said ratepayers were people who got special notice in the area of malicious injuries because they were the people <Col N="600" /> who would have to pay ultimately through the local authorities.  The Deputy made the point that the taxpayer is now the person who has to pay &mdash; not totally.  In so far as recoupment from the central Government is concerned, the taxpayer comes into it over 20p only, and that is a variable figure.</P>
    <P>Quite a considerable number of people in various parts of the country are paying rates on land over a certain valuation, or paying rates on business property.  I am satisfied that the retention of that status for the person who is not necessarily paying and the person who is paying is proper.  I am satisfied that there is no discrimination and that no legal person can have any objection to something already prescribed in law.  I cannot anticipate what people will see in any section, but I must make a reasonable attempt to ensure that it is constitutional and valid.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in this section which excludes anybody, apart from those described as ratepayers, from making a contribution or communicating information to the two bodies I have referred to and, through them, to the court if there is some relevance, or significance, or usefulness attached to their comments or their information.  At present more and more people are anxious to avail of that.  Very regularly people come forward to assist the Garda in their inquiries, or to communicate with the local authority in the knowledge that they are engaging in a community spirited act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is on very thin ice in this area.  The Minister has confirmed my worst fear which is that, despite the fact that rates were abolished ostensibly because they were an unjust and inequitable tax which appeared to be imposed regardless of ability to pay, positive discrimination will be caused &mdash; or affirmative action is the current expression &mdash; based on a system which we agreed to be unjust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill does a person in private rented accommodation, a flat or a bed-sitter, or a person in a local authority house, or a person in a mobile home, have the same right as people who are <Col N="601" /> paying rates on agricultural land, or on commercial buildings, to participate in the same way and at the same level in the hearing referred to in subsection (2)?  Is there equality of access and participation in relation to those categories of people? That is my question and the Minister says the answer is no.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>They have a different form of access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I suggest there is a major affront to equality of treatment under the law in this respect.  It is of no advantage or solace to tell people they can go to the Garda if they are in one category and, if they are in another category&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>They still go to the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they may enjoy the benefit which going to the Garda will bring them, plus the right of direct participation in the hearing, which is denied to the first category of people.  The first category are now in a minority.  Fewer people are not paying rates than the number of people paying rates; whether they be rates on agricultural land or on commerical enterprises, the reality is that the average citizen no longer pays rates.  People in local authority dwellings do not pay rates and 300,000 to 400,000 people in private rented accommodation do not pay rates.  None of these people in entitled to participation in the hearing in the way in which a casual reading of this Bill would imply.  That is wrong.  The way to correct that wrong is to get rid of the anomalous word &ldquo;ratepayer&rdquo; and change it for some other word which means what we want it to mean, which is that any sensible person with something to offer is entitled to participate in a hearing about the expenditure of public funds. That is what it is about, and not creating and furthering distinctions based on a system which was done away with because it was unjust.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to the Minister's more rapid progress in that respect.  I will even be charitable and go so far as to say that he did it for the right reason &mdash; that it was an unjust system.  I am talking now about recreating injustices.  Why should a person in a local authority flat or a person from Roscommon who is working in the public service and living in a flat in Dublin and who is concerned about malicious damage not have the same right to go along to the court and make the same sort of contribution at the hearing as anybody else, particularly when that anybody else is no longer paying money into the public purse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>One would be led to believe, listening to the Deputy, that the ratepayer who has direct access, because of the special status provided by section 17 of another Act, could come in to court and avail of that right, as prescribed in this section, to the extent that he could talk as long and as far away from the point as the Deputy has on this particular section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The court would have a right to ensure that there was relevance attached to that person's use of a right. I am satisfied that, if that person had something to communicate to the court from the point of the view of the local authority interest or the Garda interest, in the main the vast majority of people would go to either of those bodies or any other agencies involved in the investigation. That includes people other than ratepayers.  The Deputy is prepared at this point in time to give the knock to the hundreds of people in the country whose property is very often damaged.  The malicious act is very often perpetrated against those people.  The Deputy is prepared by a change in the existing legal <Col N="603" /> provisions, which are sound and properly established, to throw them out the window and to deny the business people, who have enormous sums invested in property and their contents, the right of access to the courts.</P>

      <P>That is what the Deputy is suggesting by changing the status.  He is now equating the business interests of the country, the people who have property, with people who may not have any property.  I do not see how the Deputy can, in fairness, deny people a right, which has been long established, the right of a ratepayer to direct access to the court.</P>

The combination of balderdash and whitewash which I have just heard, completely evading the central point, is simply not good enough.  I do not wish to be misrepresented.  It is not in the spirit of this discussion that the Minister should do so.  I assume that the Minister of State has made an error and that, when he has a chance of looking at what has been said during the last half hour, he will have the decency, on Report Stage, to correct what he has just said, that I have endeavoured to take rights from people.

I have argued from the beginning that this word is now anomalous and should be removed unless we want to recreate or continue two distinct categories.  If we are to continue with two distinct categories it might be logical if those categories really meant people who are paying rates &mdash; that is, commercial interests, farmers and certain other groups &mdash; and those who do not.</P>

      <P>There is another group who are in the grey area.  They are the people who used to pay rates but no longer do so.  The <i>rationale</i> the Minister has put forward for continuing this hierarchy of rights might apply, in the thinking of the Fianna Fáil Party, to people who continue to pay rates, which is exactly where we started.  My fear is that <Col N="606" /> people who pay rates are only those referred to in the section.  What about the people who no longer pay rates but who enjoy this right?  The Minister of State would say that they owned their homes before the Act came into operation.  My reply to that is:  What about the people who bought their homes since the Act came into operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>They have the same status because the basis for giving them that status is something which makes them different from people who do not own homes.  That is the difference the Deputy is not prepared to recognise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave it at that and let the record clearly show that we are today overseeing a situation where a basically unjust and inequitable taxation system &mdash; that is, rates &mdash; abolished by the Fianna Fáil Government, is now being used as a basis not just for perpetuating but for recreating, every time a person buys his or her own home, a difference in relation to entitlement to participation in a hearing affecting the expenditure of public moneys between those people and people who are in private rented accommodation, of whom there are 350,000.</P>

      <P>We are all aware of considerable changes that have taken place in the retail grocery trade in the past 20 years.  The pattern of retailing has changed enormously and, while some changes have been good, some have damaged the industry and individuals involved in it.  Much of what has happened has been due to the evolutionary process of modern attitudes in relation to the retail industry.  My party are watching closely the development of the retail industry and we know that in the past number of years certain damaging things have happened.  I expressed concern last July that, if these trends were allowed to continue, we would reach a stage where the concentration of power would be in the hands of a few to the detriment of many, including the consumer.  More recent activity in the industry has convinced me that this development has quickened and that we are now much nearer a situation where that concentration will come into the hands of a few unless some restraint is placed in their way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The so-called price war now raging and the intemperate trends which emanate from certain quarters gives cause for concern. One cannot but express disappointment at the order which was discussed last week in that it did not take account of the ominous signs of the quickening imbalance in the retail grocery trade.  We have now reached the stage where between 45 per cent and 50 per cent of turnover in the grocery trade is in the hands of five companies.  Worse still, in the greater Dublin area between 70 per cent and 75 per cent of the turnover in the trade is in the hands of these five companies.  At the same time we have diminishing numbers in the independent sector due to the methods adopted by these people to up their market share. This trend is unhealthy and it must be stopped because of the serious long-term implications for the many thousands of shopkeepers, the consumers, the manufacturers and the economy as a whole. The Parker report entitled &ldquo;The Effect <Col N="609" /> of Supermarket Development on Independent Retailers&rdquo; gives graphic expression to the position in which independent retailers have found themselves and will continue to find themselves and it shows the necessity for the introduction of some kind of legislation that will curb to some degree the uncontrolled expansion of multiple retail outlets.  The Restrictive Practices Commission Report on the Enquiry into the Retail Sale of Grocery Goods below Cost at paragraph 2.21 says:</P>
    <P>Most of the multiples indicated that they planned continued expansion. Where one multiple opens a new store in an area already served by another, the trade which the former gains may be largely at the expense of the latter, but overall it is to be expected that the opening of new multiple branches will bring about a further transfer of trade from the independent to the multiple sector.</P>
    <P>That is a statement of fact by a commission who took evidence from informed sources and who are convinced that this is the position.  We are talking about a market which is worth something like £900 million per annum.  We are talking about an industrial sector which caters for between 35,000 and 40,000 employees at a time when employment levels are as we know them to be and we are obliged to take steps to ensure in so far as we can that no further jobs will be lost for whatever reason.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with some aspects of the grocery trade.  Section 2 deals with the controlled expansion of multiples.  The kind of power proposed in this section exists already in section 2(1)(a) of the 1978 Act dealing with mergers, takeovers and monopolies.  That Act has very positive powers which, if they had been used, would have had a favourable effect on certain developments over the past few years.  The word &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; is used in this Bill.  Again, that is taken from the Act of 1978 which defines &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo; as an &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo;.  The control to be exercised by the Minister in section 3 of this Bill is also to be found in section 11, 12 and 13 of the 1978 Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="610" /> Section 4 deals with licences.  This is a new concept in the retail trade here but it is not unique.  Indeed, our uniqueness lies in the fact that we have not this kind of control, as have other countries.  In looking at legislation enacted by other countries one cannot but be struck by the action taken by them and the time that action was taken.  For example, in West Germany there are restrictions on developments in excess of 1,500 square meters of retail floor space.  Those restrictions have existed for some years.  There are further restrictions in relation to location and so on that have been implemented by local chambers of commerce.  In Holland, where the multiples have not the share of the market they enjoy here there are similar location and spatial restrictions. In Italy where only 10 per cent of the total market is in the hands of multiples, the licensing system has been applied for a number of years and the same situation exists in France.  In Britain the same kind of movement is taking place.  The policy adopted in the UK stresses the necessity for local planning authorities to take into account matters such as the convenience of existing shopping centres, the effect that out-of-town developments would have on existing shopping centres and the effects on community life generally.</P>
    <P>All of these restrictions have been in operation in most western European countries for a number of years for the simple reason that they saw that the degree to which multiples or multinationals controlled or were seen to control the retail market was unhealthy for the trade generally and was not favourable to shopkeepers or consumers.  There is reference to this throughout the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission on below cost selling.  In one section in particular there is reference to the fact that we have not yet reached the stage where, in opinion of the commission, there should be interference.  One must ask the question, at what stage do the Commission consider that interference is warranted? The multiples have a 45 per cent market share.  Does that have to rise to 50 per cent or 60 per cent before interference <Col N="611" /> is warranted?  In other countries they moved to control the situation when 25 per cent or 30 per cent of the market was in the hands of a few multiples.</P>
    <P>The restrictions in this Bill are designed to control the uncontrolled expansion of multiples.  The Bill should not be interpreted as a multiple-bashing piece of legislation.  Far from it.  It is envisaged that if this Bill is implemented the industry as a whole will benefit in that there will be proper, controlled expansion providing the kind of competition that is needed to facilitate the consumers.</P>
    <P>Last week we had the spectacle in this city of a major multiple announcing the closure of seven retail outlets.  They used that most abused term &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo;&mdash; a word that is used in this House <i>ad finitum.</i>  What it means bluntly is that this company having purchased retail outlets from another multiple some time ago in a takeover that should not have been allowed in the first instance found that their business was not of the volume they expected and they were not prepared to continue trading.  Of course while they traded other outlets with less muscle went to the wall.  These people have no social responsibility to consumers in any area, so they just up and go, having caused the damage.  I understand this is called &ldquo;mining&rdquo; in the industry.  It is something synonymous with an open-cast miner going into an area and decimating the face of a locality.  Having done his job, having extracted whatever money or anything of value there was in the area, he just leaves the place decimated, its face ruptured and fractured.</P>
    <P>That is what is happening now.  Indeed, one will find that the whole concept of future rationalisation will be along those lines, getting bigger and bigger units, covering larger catchment areas in a widening circle, having no concern at all for the mobility of people who have to travel distances to shop in these centres.  There are sectors of the community who are not as mobile as others.  For example, there are people who do not own cars; there are old people; people who are at a disadvantage in other ways.  These people <Col N="612" /> do not have the kind of access to these out of town centres that I or you have, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  If we allow this uncontrolled development to continue more and more of the independent type outlet will close its doors.  Since 1961 we have seen the number of retail outlets in this country in the independent sector cut by half, from approximately 17,500 to 8,500.  It must be regarded as a serious situation in which that kind of thing is allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>The restrictions incorporated in this Bill are meant to curtail that expansion, not to stop it, to curtail it and ensure there will be orderly development and expansion of the retail trade both for multiples and for the independent sector. One must assume that one of the reasons the retail sector has not been able to compete with the multiples in the past is that they see no future in the business. Investment by them in their private business is not worth while, in particular in country towns and rural areas because of the ever-present threat that a multiple will apply to the local authority &mdash; be it an urban council or county council, whether in Mayo, Kerry, Galway, Donegal or Monaghan &mdash; and proceed to build a monster of 10,000, 15,000 or 20,000 square feet beside them.  In no way can they compete with that kind of pressure. Therefore the restrictions on the uncontrolled expansion of multiples would, I hope, be an incentive to the independent sector to invest in their own business because they would now see a future for themselves and be guaranteed that niche of the market.</P>
    <P>In no way should this Bill be seen as bolstering up inefficient independent grocers. It is meant for the progressive, positive approach that is needed if these people are to compete with the multiples in the interest of the consumer and for the common good.  Section 4(9) gives the Minister power to withhold a licence in the event of information given to him not being adequate in his opinion.  That is a fair requirement.  Indeed, it is incorporated already in the Casual Trading Act. It would appear the Minister is of the opinion that the current state of the industry does not warrant any intervention <Col N="613" /> or interference by means of any form of legislation to curb the expansion of the multiples.  He contends this on the basis that the multiples do sell many staple foods at a lower cost to the consumer. Therefore, he sees himself as pro-consumer at a time when, as I have said before, we have nearly half our total trade in the hands of five multiples, some of them multinationals.</P>
    <P>I read with interest today the contribution of the Minister of State in relation to the retail petrol outlets.  Perhaps I might be permitted to quote from what he said in relation to the uncontrolled expansion of company retail outlets:</P>
    <P>The second important recommendation in the report which is provided for in the order relates to the ban on additional company stations which has been in force for about nine years.  The restriction is in the public interest because otherwise the overall share of the retail market held by the petrol companies would be much greater with the undesirable results of increased rigidity in the market and the danger of restrictive or discriminatory practices.</P>
    <P>That is today's story in relation to retail outlets in petrol.  We have the very opposite approach being applied here in relation to the grocery trade.  For the life of me I cannot see the logic of this approach today as against that applied in relation to the grocery trade.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the recent price war.  I should like to say a few words in relation to section 7, which concerns itself with below cost selling.  I expressed the opinion in this House last week that the attitude adopted by the commission in reporting on this phenomenon is probably fairer than might be accepted today, because at the time that report was compiled there was no hard experience of a price war or below-cost selling.  It was spasmodic, peripheral to the issue, it was not causing any great trouble.  But the Minister comes along and confirms an order which accepts the recommendations in that report despite the fact that he has had the experience of having lived through the current price war.  In the <i>Irish <Col N="614" /> Independent</i> of Thursday, 29 January last there was a heading:  Tesco Admits War (to wipe out our opposition).  This is very intemperate language from a multinational and we know that that company has the resources to wipe out the opposition. Once the opposition is wiped out we are aware of the consequences because in the past we have had the experience &mdash; it is in the Parker Report &mdash; of what happened in Arklow and New-bridge when a multiple store moved in.</P>
    <P>Many retail grocery businesses have had to fold up.  Why was that?  Because they were squeezed out by the competition. One might have said then that that was to the benefit of the consumer, but we know now that that is not the case. Once one creates a monopoly and once the opposition are lying down dead, it is very easy to call the tune, and the tune is being called in different areas of this city and country at present by multiples, who know that nobody can compete with them.</P>
    <P>The Minister made great play of the fact that both the Consumers' Association of Ireland and the Irish Housewives' Association were in favour of below cost selling; according to their evidence at the Commission's hearing.  This is a factual statement, they were.  However, neither the CAI nor the Irish Housewives Association had experience then of the kind of price war which is now being waged. To be fair to them, both organisations, in the light of their experience of the current price war, have come out publicly and stated that they are opposed to it because it is not in the interests of the consumer.</P>
    <P>As one would expect, the multiples who gave evidence were naturally in favour of below cost selling because it suited their sales policy and methodology for squeezing the opposition.  Amazingly, again in the light of the experience of the current price war, one multiple has come out publicly and appealed to the Minister to intervene and stop the price war and a second multiple &mdash; as is no secret around the city &mdash; while not coming out publicly, have used channels to the Minister asking him to intervene and stop this below cost selling because it is damaging to them and they will not be able to <Col N="615" /> persist in it.  The opposition is too hot for them.  We are now talking about a different situation altogether.  In this Bill, my party have suggested that below cost selling be prohibited.  The effect this will have in the market place will be beneficial, not only in the mid-term and long-term, but also in the short-term, to consumers in this country.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are now hurtling towards a situation where monopolies are being set up here is something which warrants immediate attention.  I have mentioned already the retail trade and below cost selling in relation to the consumer. I now come to the manufacturer. It is an open secret that multi-nationals here, while they pay lip service to the &ldquo;buy Irish&rdquo; campaign in many cases are importing vast amounts of foreign manufactured foods.  Recently a figure was mentioned of 10,000 tonnes of chips.  The idea of importing that quantity of chips into Ireland, if it were not so serious for the economy, would be a huge joke.  Multinationals use manufacturers, squeeze from them terms which are not available to the small, independent grocer.  It is well known that multiples in this city cover shop-lifting by adding 4¼ per cent to the price, when the normal is 1¼ per cent.  It is also well known, that multiples with many outlets squeeze three monthly terms from manufacturers who are eager to sell large quantities of goods to them, even at the moment.  In the meantime, who keeps the manufacturer going?  The legitimate wholesaler and the small retailer do.  They pay cash on the nail, while the multiple is using its cash flow, through its investment bank or its self-owned finance company, to make extra millions per year.  The end result is that the cost to the manufacturer increases, with the result that he makes an application to the National Prices Commission to increase his price.</P>
    <P>These are hidden costs.  I wonder if manufacturers applying for an increase in price to the National Prices Commission, in telling the commission the reasons for the application &mdash; the normal running cost, overheads, heat, lighting, wages, salaries, petrol and oil costs &mdash; also mention <Col N="616" /> the terms they give to multinationals. In the long run, that kind of increase is detrimental to the consumer for whom the multinational is shedding crocodile tears.  These are the questions which should be asked.  This Bill is designed to provide the kind of competition in the industry that the independent sector will rise to, that the consumer and also the manufacturer can benefit from, that will retain employment and a high level of usage of Irish goods.</P>
    <P>Finally, we are a small economy.  We are dependent on Irish people in most cases, to do their utmost to ensure the health of this economy.  I have no gripe against international companies, multi-nationals or multiples.  In relation to any category of business, the moment one allows a monopoly to be created, one is heading for trouble.  This is happening in this area of industry, the retail trade.  The proof has been staring us in the face for a number of years, yet nobody has taken adequate action.  The chance arose last week in relation to the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission.  The Government failed to take action on that. There is, on our statute books at present, adequate provision to do what this Bill is proposing to do &mdash; in the Restrictive Practices Acts and in the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies Act of 1978.</P>
    <P>The only new proposals in this Bill are in relation to the curtailment in relation &mdash;to licensing and the provision in relation to below cost selling.  Fine Gael and I feel that the intervention by legislation at this time is warranted to save this industry from falling into the hands of people who have no obligation to consumers or to anybody else.  They are there to make large sums of money once they have created a monopoly.  They can call the tune, and the day when we can walk round to the corner of our street at 7.30 or 9.30 p.m. to get a loaf or a packet of cigarettes from a small grocer is fast disappearing. That type of trader is on his way out unless we take immediate steps to safeguard him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced <Col N="617" /> in response to what its promoters would describe as a crisis situation in the retail distribution of grocery goods, or more particularly in the retailing of grocery goods by the non-multiple sector. The Bill proposes far-reaching measures of a type which demand that the need therefor should be justified beyond a shadow of doubt and that, assuming there is evidence that a need for corrective action exists, the remedy is in the interests of the common good.</P>
      <P>The Bill's promoters would justify their proposal with reference to the number of closures of retail grocery outlets over the past number of years, to the expansion of the multiple sector and the implications of such expansion for the independent outlets, to the involvement of externally based enterprises in the multiple sector and the implications that this has for Irish industry.</P>
      <P>It is not denied that there have been significant reductions in the number of retail outlets.  Unofficial statistics for the years 1966 to 1977 show a decline in that period in what could be described as &lsquo;all grocery outlets&rsquo; from 17,500 to 11,600 approximately.  The fall off in one category included in these figures &mdash; grocery with public house &mdash; could be substantially explained by conversions of these establishments solely into public houses, either <i>in situ</i> or through the sale of the liquor licence for a new outlet.</P>
      <P>There is no reason to assume that the decline in numbers has since been halted, but it should be noted that this trend is by no means confined to this country. With one exception, in all EEC countries there has been a steady expansion of market share by multiple chains accompanied by a fall in the number of outlets. While statistics are not always comparable, the decline in some other countries in somewhat comparable periods is recorded at percentages as high as 38.</P>
      <P>While I accept, therefore, that there has been a reduction in the number of outlets, I do not accept that the reasons for such decline arise solely, or mainly, from the practices of multiple outlets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes in the grocery trade over the last two or three decades, sweeping enough indeed to justify being described <Col N="618" /> as a revolution, are the result of a variety of influences, technological, social and organisational.  The most basic change, on which the others to some extent depended, was the rapid growth of prepackaging to the point where nearly all the items in a grocery store are prepackaged. This facilitated the development of self-service.  By transferring the tasks of cutting, measuring, weighing and wrapping to the factory, and of selecting and collecting goods to the customer, these twin developments took away from the shop assistant a considerable part of his or her former duties.</P>
    <P>Other developments, such as the introduction of weighing machines which indicated the price of odd amounts not prepackaged, further reduced the assistant's work.  Such changes brought a substantial reduction in the amount of work to be done in grocery shops which resulted in time in a decline in the workforce.</P>
    <P>That this decline in the numbers engaged was reflected in time in a reduction in the number of shops was ensured by certain other developments.  The spread of car ownership meant that many shoppers who had been accustomed to shop on foot locally now found it more convenient to commence one-stop shopping, and transferred their custom from a small local shop to a larger shopping centre where they could satisfy more of their needs in one visit.  This led to, and in turn was stimulated by, the development of grocery supermarkets, whether multiple or individually owned, any one of which could handle the trade which had formerly sustained a number of smaller, traditional shops.  Much modern shop equipment and lay-out which facilitated goods handling and customer movement could be accommodated only in larger establishments and gave these a further advantage in efficiency.  With rising standards of income, a number of small neighbourhood groceries which had afforded a subsistence to their owners came to be no longer regarded as providing an acceptable living and gradually went out of business, often on their owners' retirement.</P>
    <P>Shifts in population naturally also had <Col N="619" /> an effect on the distribution pattern.  The overall increase in population did not lead to an increase in shop numbers because it was greatly outweighed by the factors just mentioned, but it must be assumed that without it the decline in shop numbers would have been even steeper.</P>
    <P>The fall in the numbers of shops in some rural areas where the effect of supermarket competition is very limited is no doubt attributable in part to the decline of the rural population.  The areas where population has grown fastest, newly urbanised areas on the perimeters of cities and large towns, are precisely those which have been most attractive to the supermarket multiples, and for planning or other reasons the extent to which these new areas have been serviced by newly opened independent grocery shops is notably limited.  Smaller shops, run by the proprietor with little or no help, are today largely confined to rural areas and to the central areas of cities and towns.</P>
    <P>While these developments had the effect of bringing about a substantial reduction in the number of shops, it is generally agreed that they have been to the considerable benefit of consumers, bringing in their train the advantages of wider choice, one-stop shopping and, on the whole, lower prices.  It will be seen therefore that the decline in retail outlets was due more to normal forces of change, which entailed the development of the multiple chains, rather than to any specific abusive practices by multiples.</P>
    <P>The effects of these normal forces of change were not confined to the area of grocery distribution alone.  Many areas have been affected and, indeed, many have disappeared, not because of any practices engaged in by competitors but because demand for services provided had changed or disappeared.  At an early stage in this revolutionary process it was recognised that there was a need for a policy framework within which the various economic sectors would develop in accordance with the interests of the common good.  One reflection of this policy was the enactment in 1953 of the Restrictive <Col N="620" /> Trade Practices Act which facilitated the tackling of various undesirable practices which existed.</P>
    <P>Under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, the Fair Trade Commission were established and given the powers to carry out inquiries into the supply and distribution of goods and to make recommendations to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for action to deal with any abuses identified.  Shortly after their establishment, the commission noted that there was creeping paralysis of price competition in large areas of distributive trading and a tendency towards the freezing of distributive arrangements without allowance for economic change.</P>
    <P>Among the practices which were recognised as being widespread were limitation or regulation of entry to trade, resale price maintenance by manufacturers, price fixing and margins fixing by trade associations, punitive action against traders who have not observed such fixed prices or margins and various other devices which were alleged to restrain or suppress competition unfairly or to the disadvantage of the public.</P>
    <P>One of the first areas which received attention by the commission was the grocery sector and in view of the clear importance of this sector this was not surprising. This was the first reflection of a concern that competition in this sector should be fostered but that such competition should be fair and healthy, a concern which has been evident up to the present.</P>
    <P>The first inquiry was held in 1955, at a time when the extent of price competition was quite limited, a number of products were still subject to price control while others had their resale price fixed by the suppliers, and the modern type of supermarket had not yet emerged.  The main issue at the inquiry was whether resale price maintenance was contrary to the public interest.  In their report, the Fair Trade Commission concluded, <i>inter alia,</i> that price competition at retail level would be beneficial to the public and they recommended that individual or collective action designed to secure the maintenance of resale prices should, therefore, be prohibited.  On the other <Col N="621" /> hand, they deemed it necessary to have certain safeguards against excessive price cutting; it was recommended, for example, that a supplier should be permitted to withhold goods from a retailer who was selling the goods to the public at a price lower than the wholesale price charged to retailers for the goods.  The commission also examined and made recommendations in relation to terms and conditions.  In essence, they sought to maintain as much flexibility as possible &mdash;and their recommendations were designed to ensure that terms and conditions of supply would be reasonable and would be applied equitably to all persons seeking supplies.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce gave effect to the commission's recommendations in the Restrictive Trade Practices (Groceries) Order, 1956, which he subsequently amended in 1958.</P>
    <P>This order established, in effect, a framework within which the grocery sector could develop to meet the changing demands of an increasingly sophisticated consumer as efficiently as possible, while, at the same time it prohibited any practices which might have unjustly or unreasonably enhanced or adversely affected the position of parties involved.  In order to ensure that the objects of this legislation were achieved, it was subjected to review on a number of occasions and the primary legislation was replaced by the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, which, among its new provisions, created the post of Examiner of Restrictive Practices, whose duties include the investigation of any aspect of the supply and distribution of goods and the monitoring of the operation of orders made under the Act.  At the initiative of both the examiner and the commission the specific legislation applying to the grocery sector was reviewed on a number of occasions and the legislation amended to cater for changed conditions.</P>
    <P>Probably the greatest area of concern in these reviews related to the operation of the provisions concerned with the terms and conditions upon and subject to which goods were supplied and the ability of persons to obtain improvements in those conditions.  This reflected a recognition <Col N="622" /> of the changing structure of the trade entailing expansion of the multiple sector and changes in the traditional role of the wholesaler.  The object of the legislation which was enacted following those reviews was to ensure that suppliers made goods available in accordance with standard terms and conditions which they were required to maintain and that where supplementary terms were made available, their application should be in accordance with specific guidelines established.</P>
    <P>The most recent full-scale review in this area was ten years ago, in 1971 and, while some of the legislation enacted on foot of that review has subsequently been amended in an effort to bring it into line with more modern conditions, it must be acknowledged that the basic changes that have occurred in the structure of the sector since 1971 must lead us to ask the question, &ldquo;Are the conclusions reached in the context of grocery distribution in 1971 valid in the conditions prevailing to-day?&rdquo; For example, there is at present a widescale campaign by certain parties representing wholesalers and retailers for the introduction of a mandatory allowance by suppliers to wholesalers to reflect the economies achieved by suppliers because of the wholesale function.  This question had been considered by the commission in inquiries in 1956 and 1971. In their report of the 1971 inquiry the commission reported that while functional differences in terms existed in a substantial number of cases on paper, it emerged in the course of the inquiry that supermarket multiples were usually in receipt of best terms from the great majority of suppliers, so that in practice functional discounts did not provide a net benefit to the wholesaler compared with the multiple.  It was suggested in the course of the inquiry that the wholesalers should receive an additional discount over and above those available to retailers in recognition of the services they perform for retailers.  The suggestion was opposed by manufacturers, the multiples and one wholesaler.  In the circumstances of the trade then pertaining, the commission outlined their conclusions generally, as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" /> they had serious reservations whether functional discounts were any longer appropriate to the structure of the trade;</P>
    <P>a wholesale differential could help to maintain inefficient wholesalers in operation;</P>
    <P>allowing slightly lower discounts to multiples and slightly higher discounts to wholesalers would be likely to create a highly unstable situation because different suppliers would apply the differential differently;</P>
    <P>conceding the differential could lead to multiples establishing wholesale warehouses to qualify as wholesalers;</P>
    <P>manufacturers could not bear the cost of granting a wholesale discount without increasing prices, possibly ultimately leading to imports;</P>
    <P>changing distribution channels might be decided on by manufacturers, including, in particular, own delivery if the differential were to be conceded.</P>
    <P>The commission concluded that they did not consider that a supplier who does not provide a differential for wholesalers in his terms of supply is discriminating unfairly against them, or offering terms that in their effect are contrary to the public interest.  On the other hand a supplier, who believed that a differential for wholesalers would contribute to the efficient and economical distribution of his goods, should be at liberty to provide for it in his terms of supply.  In effect, the commission consider that the giving or withholding of a wholesale differential is a matter for the individual supplier in his judgment of his requirements.  The mandatory allowance was not, therefore, provided for in law.</P>
    <P>It is considered now, however, that there have been developments in the meantime which could make it necessary to re-examine whether conclusions reached in 1971 remain valid in today's circumstances.  Chief among those developments are:</P>
    <P>(1)  the change in the structure of the grocery trade, notably the growth of the market share held by the multiples, the change in the traditional wholesale function in that part of the wholesale <Col N="624" /> trade now represented by cash and carry establishments and the disappearance in large part of direct delivery by suppliers to non-multiple retailers,</P>
    <P>(2)  the growth in buying power, a consequence of which is that, whereas at an earlier time a supplier might have decided to allow or not to allow a wholesale differential in particular cases primarily in the light of the respective costs involved, he is more likely today to be influenced by pressures from one or other group of his customers, and,</P>
    <P>(3)  the increased facility today with which Irish goods can be replaced with imports.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that circumstances have so changed in the trade since the last full inquiry that there appears to be, at least, a case for re-examining the considerations relating not alone to the question of the wholesale differential but to the general question of terms and conditions upon, and subject to which, goods are supplied.  It is also pertinent to refer at this stage to the impact of structural change on suppliers in their application of terms and conditions.  Much has been said and written about the level of concentration in the ownership of multiples and the effect this has on suppliers.  In this regard it is noted that buying on behalf of the independent outlets has, for the greater part, been concentrated in the hands of one body representing independents. It will be acknowledged, accordingly, that there appears to have been a concentration in buying points to a figure of six.  While not all increases in buyer concentration and buying power are undesirable, it would seem appropriate that the extent of buyer concentration should be ascertained, with a view to considering the need to prevent the accretion of unacceptable levels of buying and selling power.</P>
    <P>It would also seem appropriate that the merits of introducing a system of preventing the abuse of buying power which might be practised by dominant firms should be considered.  It is also desirable that forms of price discrimination which systematically favour powerful buyers or threaten to eliminate small firms from the <Col N="625" /> market &mdash; whether suppliers or retailers &mdash; should be investigated, especially when the price differences are not based on differences in cost.</P>
    <P>It is because of concerns in these areas in particular that it has been decided to request the Restrictive Practices Commission to hold a full-scale inquiry into the supply and distribution of grocery goods.  The promoters of the Bill we are now discussing will probably ask why, if we acknowledge the existence of problems in this area, we are not pressing ahead at this stage with legislative proposals to remedy them.  The answer to such a question is, yes, we acknowledge the existence of problems but it would be foolhardy to rush in with purported solutions without first examining in the greatest detail, and in the light of today's changed conditions, the extent of the problems and their causes and, in the light of the conclusions of such examinations, determine the course of action which is in the interest of the common good.</P>
    <P>I am absolutely satisfied that such investigations should be carried out within the framework of the appropriate law, the Restrictive Practices Act.  We have seen over the years the benefits of availing of the facility afforded by this Act, and its predecessors, to deal with unfair and unjust practices, and the freedom of trade enjoyed, and consequent benefits which accrued to all from the supplier to the consumer, are a fitting return for those who strove against many entrenched interests to achieve a healthy, competitive, internal market.  The appropriate body under the Act to carry out such an inquiry is the Restrictive Practices Commission and I have the utmost confidence in their ability to isolate the practices which operate against the common good and to recommend courses of action which while dealing with the problems identified will best serve the common good.</P>
    <P>Before I proceed to consider the Bill, I should like to refer briefly to a number of matters which have been suggested as justifications for introducing the Bill. Great emphasis is being laid by many <Col N="626" /> persons on the influence of foreign-owned chains in the Irish market and the implications of this involvement for Irish industry.  It is also being suggested that the alleged high level of imports of foodstuffs is in some way attributable to the presence of these foreign-owned companies in the Irish market.</P>
    <P>As regards the level of imports, a pretty dismal picture is being painted by different persons of the volume of imported foodstuffs.  In considering these statistics, it should be borne very much in mind that the volume of imports of products which compete directly with home produced goods is nowhere near the figure being tossed about.  If one is to express concern about the level of imports, it is surely misleading to include in statistics in support of figures for imports of products such as bananas, oranges, grapes &mdash; including sultanas, raisins and so on &mdash; and other fruits and vegetables which are not and could not be grown in this country.  Notwithstanding the fact that the statistics can present a picture which is misleading, it is of course acknowledged that there is a problem in relation to food imports.  But the way to tackle this problem is not to proceed in the manner proposed in the Bill, that is, to impede the development of the types of outlets which are accused, in large part, of responsibility for the level of imports.  In this regard, it should be noted that there is strong support in the multiple sector for Irish products and, indeed, one of the foreign-owned multiples which has been subjected to much criticism is recognised as being one of the strongest supporters of Irish goods.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there is a problem in this area and, in order to deal with this, among others, a Working Party on Import Substitution was established in August 1980 under the chairmanship of the Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism &mdash; in fact, I am the present chairman of the working party.  At that time it was acknowledged that the volume of competing imports of food products represented, by any standard, a considerable volume of goods and, <i>prima facie,</i> should provide considerable opportunities for <Col N="627" /> the expansion of manufacture and employment in Ireland.  It was considered that, for example, there were promising manufacturing opportunities in fast-food products, fruit juices and processed fish products, if backed by effective marketing. So that any opportunities could be exploited, the Irish Goods Council, in liaison with the Industrial Development Authority, have been examining the situation with a view to identifying those areas offering possibilities for substitution. Industry is also being encouraged to pay greater attention to new product development particularly more specialised products away from the &ldquo;main stream&rdquo; products as these offer some of the best future growth prospects for certain sectors of the Irish food processing industry.  Additionally, renewed approaches are being made by the IDA to food firms to take up the attractive 50 per cent grants available towards salary, materials and consultancy costs of developing food products.</P>
    <P>As regards the role of the food distribution sector, agreement was reached in September last at a meeting of representatives of wholesale, retail and manufacturing interests, under the chairmanship of the chief executive of the Irish Goods Council, that for an initial six month period, the wholesale and retail trade would:</P>
    <P>&mdash;initiate no new importation of primary food lines</P>
    <P>&mdash;enter into discussion with Irish manufacturers with a view to substitution of lines currently imported</P>
    <P>&mdash;where imported products are sold by an Irish manufacturer, procure those products from that manufacturer rather than through external sources</P>
    <P>&mdash;undertake special steps to ensure that the Irish-made products are highlighted on their shop shelves.</P>
    <P>Based on the outcome of a recent survey, the following are some results of this initiative:</P>
    <P>&mdash;with the exception of a growth in importation of chickens and eggs from Northern Ireland, there is no evidence of other primary food lines <Col N="628" /> having been imported since the agreement was negotiated</P>
    <P>&mdash;one major multiple, and two groups, have initiated discussions with a number of manufacturers with a view to substitution of Irish for imported products and with regard to new product development</P>
    <P>&mdash;the practice of &ldquo;parallel imports&rdquo; has been discontinued,</P>
    <P>&mdash;in the main an effort has been made by the multiples to highlight Irish products.</P>
    <P>Finally, there were fears expressed in some quarters that the so called &ldquo;price war&rdquo; would lead to an increased volume of imported food products by the various multiples but there is no real indication that this has occurred.  In fact, it has been noted that the relationship between home manufacturers and the multiples has improved.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that there is ample scope for action to deal with the problem of imports without resorting to the introduction of controls over the operation of types of retail outlets who are accused of being largely responsible for the high level of imports.</P>
    <P>As regards the implications of foreign ownership of some multiples, it has been suggested that the controls proposed in the Bill are necessary to curtail development by these companies, which, it is suggested, is possible only because of the availability of external finance which allows either subsidisation of price cutting campaigns to enhance the success of developments or direct subsidisation of expansion.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am opposed to the proposals contained in the Bill which I regard as constituting an interference with our long held belief in freedom to trade.  Accordingly it has been decided to request the body established by law to carry out such inquiries &mdash; the Restrictive Practices Commission &mdash; to hold a full scale inquiry into all aspects of the supply and distribution of grocery goods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The reaction of the people engaged in the grocery trade was evident last week when every county sent their <Col N="629" /> representatives to parade before us, indicating very clearly that they were conveying the sentiments of the people in the grocery trade around the country.  Their voices cannot be ignored and it would be foolish if the Government ignored their legitimate objections.</P>
      <P>The Government appear to be giving their approval to below cost selling.</P>
      <P>Nobody is suffering from delusions. We all know what below cost selling means.  I do not think any consumer could be deceived by this practice which we all know, is not for the benefit of the consumer. Its long-term aim is to exterminate competitors and having done that, they will increase prices.  Short-sighted people will not look to the future.</P>
      <P>Supermarkets give a service in areas only where there is a relatively high population, possibly not lower than 17,000 or 20,000.  They open up in these areas because the pickings are relatively high. They are not interested in more sparsely populated areas.  The small grocers provide a very good service in those areas. In the past week we have seen the disappearance of six or seven multiple stores because there were not lucrative pickings in those areas.</P>
      <P>If the Government do not preserve the grocery trade by helping the small trader they will be doing the consumers a disservice. The grocery trade employ about 40,000 people.  In recent years many small family concerns have closed because of supermarket takeovers.  The people must decide now whether to support the family grocer or the large supermarkets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the cost of petrol and transport had reached such a high figure, there was a tendency to travel long distances for bargains.  In the years ahead I hope the people will be sensible and recognise the people who stood by them in their very lean days.  We had economic wars and recessions but the family grocer provided the goods needed by large families and carried their debts until those families were in a position to repay them.  There is some recognition and some goodness in every family, I hope it will be applied <Col N="630" /> properly in determining what the people need.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of trading to be considered when the multiple enterprise &mdash; foreigners in many cases who come here not to serve the people but to make profit &mdash; and the local small grocer are compared.  The retail grocery trade will only be preserved if we all recognise that it is not possible to continue if the big concerns are permitted to take the good pickings while the small trader is left to make a living by working irregular and long hours.  I hope the evidence displayed by the grocers last week is properly digested by the Minister and the Government.  They should come to a wise decision and give the small retailers the recognition they deserve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion which relates to a matter which is causing great concern throughout the country. Deputy Taylor has referred to the many changes that have taken place in the retail grocery trade in the last decade.  We have all seen tremendous changes taking place.  We all remember the traditional family business in towns or the small shops in rural areas, but in many cases that scene has changed dramatically.  The small-scale operator has been replaced by the multinational combines.  To a certain extent that change was inevitable but the time has come when we must take stock of the trend of this development. The growth of monopolies is a dangerous thing.  Appropriate legislation is necessary to ensure the survival of the independent retailer and the traditional family concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy O'Toole on initiating this debate and on the understanding he has shown of the situation.  The proposals he has put forward are reasonable.  I hope there will be a similar response from the Government. I was disappointed at the attitude adopted by my constituency colleague, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  His initial reaction to this case when it was put to him some time ago was over-rigid.  He appeared to be totally inflexible.  There are many social arguments in favour of the case put forward <Col N="631" /> by the representatives of the independent grocers last week.  Those representatives protested, in an orderly and responsible way, outside Leinster House and subsequently held discussions with many Members. I had a long meeting with the group from Limerick while Deputy Taylor met the representatives from Clare.  I was very impressed by the case they made.</P>
    <P>We are fast approaching a monopoly situation here.  That is bad economically and commercially.  It is also bad from the social point of view.  The constituency I represent here and the province I represent in the European Parliament is the most important food producing region in Ireland and it is for that reason that I am alarmed at the enormous increase in food imports.  The figures are growing dramatically weekly.  It is common to find food products from other countries on display in many of the big stores.  The growth of the combines has contributed to an increase in imports of food products. That is disastrous from the point of view of our economy and our balance of payments. It is ludicrous to think that such products are imported when we are producing them at home.  Foreign food imports are being dumped here through the channels operated by the large multinational combines while we must spend a lot of time and money in search of foreign markets for our products.</P>
    <P>The approach of Deputy O'Toole to this problem is the correct one and this has been accepted by the representatives of the independent grocery trade.  While I am not an expert on the situation in Europe in this respect I have some knowledge of the legislation that exists in some countries.  The Belgian Government some time ago, when faced with a similiar problem to that which exists here, introduced appropriate legislation to deal with the matter.  Legislation catering for the orderly development of the retail trade is to be found in West Germany, Holland, Italy, France, Britain and Belgium.  The Belgian experience in the past two decades was similar to ours, increased market share by multi-nationals and the resultant drop by over 50 per cent in small retail outfits, and the Belgian Government <Col N="632" /> sought to apply corrective action through legislation when the independent outlets held 77 per cent of the market share.</P>

      <P>I have given permission to Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i> to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the private notice question taken today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I was alarmed and even shocked to hear this morning that the Minister for Social Welfare had apparently given a direction that the disability allowance section of his Department was not to be available to the general public, Senators or Deputies for the time being.  I put down a private notice question to have this alarming state of affairs confirmed and to find out what the Minister proposed to do about it.  I was equally shocked at the reply that the Minister gave and his attitude in general towards this alarming situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that for a considerable time now, many months, the social welfare beneficiaries who are in receipt of or entitled to sickness or disability benefit find it impossible to get their benefit paid in any sort of time.  I am told very often by constituents that they have furnished eight, nine, ten and more certificates without getting any payment, which means that they are waiting for their benefit for ten weeks.  That is a very traumatic experience for these people, many of whom are married men with no other means of support for themselves, their wives and families than the social welfare benefits to which they have contributed by stamps in the old days and by payrelated social insurance at present.  When they lodge these certificates and the payment does not come they are with their backs to the wall because in many towns the small grocer has gone and these people simply have no credit.  When they find on Thursday or Friday that they have run <Col N="633" /> out of money and are presented with a long account in front of them there is nothing for them only the supplementary benefit, which used to be home assistance, payable by the community welfare officers of the health boards, who do their best, but they cannot be in every place, they cannot be available around the clock, and some of them live a distance from the towns where they are required. In a nutshell, when these beneficiaries cannot get their social welfare benefit paid on time on the very day on which it should come they are in trouble.  It might appear strange to the Minister or other people that a day would make a difference, but if you run out of money and cannot get credit a day is a very long time.  The seriousness of the position was brought to light by Deputy Pattison and other Deputies who put down about 50 or 60 questions for oral answer here one day and highlighted the whole performance. The Minister had various explanations and excuses, but the fact is that people continue to suffer the loss of this benefit and the experience is nothing less than traumatic.</P>
    <P>We Deputies who hold clinics in provincial towns know that these people come to us or to our houses or telephone us in desperation.  It is nothing short of that and I can understand it.  If they can get credit it is not so bad, but maybe some of these unfortunate people are not regarded as creditworthy through no fault of their own.  Maybe they have a drink problem, maybe a big family, maybe they have run into debt and the grocer, the butcher or anybody else will not finance them for ten weeks and more while they wait for their social welfare benefit.  These people come to Deputies only in desperation and when other attempts to get their benefits have failed. Certainly Senators and Deputies telephone the Department of Social Welfare only when they regard the matter as very urgent.  I often think what an experience it must be for those unfortunate people who ring up the Department themselves and have to pay for the phone calls, are pushed about from one place to another and wait on their end of the phone for a <Col N="634" /> long time.  When it comes to telephoning the Department things have got serious and the people are in desperation.</P>
    <P>I was told this morning that the telephone service of this section of the Department of Social Welfare was literally closed down and that anybody who rang up was told, &ldquo;We are sorry.  I am not allowed to talk to you or take messages from you.  I cannot deal with you&rdquo;. That is the position at present.  It is any wonder that we put down a private notice question and that I was concerned when I understood the Minister to say that everything would be all right in a few weeks?  My goodness, what are these people going to do in the meantime?  The least they are entitled to, instead of cutting of the telephone service in this section, is that additional lines would be installed so that they could be told the position, messages could be taken from them and the Minister could get in touch with the health boards and say, &ldquo;Look after these people until we get order restored to the chaos which at present prevails in my Department&rdquo;.  This is the second Department in modern times &mdash; by that I mean the last 12 months &mdash; where chaos has been created.  The Department of the Environment housing section closed down altogether &mdash; doors, phones, the lot &mdash; and chaos has been prevailing there for the last 12 months.  I repeat that the last straw today was to be told that, until further notice, no phones, no contact.  As I have said, instead of cutting off the phones more phones should have been installed and these people should have been placated and messages taken from them, and the Minister should have communicated with the health boards.</P>
    <P>I am told that this may be a matter for another question but I am told also that the system simply has broken down. When I said today that files were lost the Minister seemed to suggest that I did not know what I was talking about, but there is not much difference between files being lost and particulars of cases by the tens of thousands being blotted off tapes, and that is what I am told has happened.  I am told that these things were taped and in <Col N="635" /> some mysterious way the particulars had disappeared off the tapes, and that paying social welfare benefits in the Minister's Department at present is a hit and miss business.  Hundreds and maybe thousands of people who are entitled to benefit are either not getting it at all or they have to wait for months while people who are not entitled to it might be paid. If that happened in any private concern or private business the person concerned would be out of business.</P>
    <P>Deputies and Senators&mdash;I do not pretend to have any particular virtue myself &mdash; come into contact with these people week after week.  You are not very long in public life until you realise why people work themselves into a state when their social welfare benefit or assistance does not arrive.  They are like paupers until it arrives, and they are hungry until it arrives.  I am asking the Minister in the name of my constituents who are thus affected, and in the name of all the social welfare beneficiaries to open up the telephone lines and to open up offices so that these people can be interviewed and have their position explained to them.  They should have not to telephone Dublin. Until this chaotic state of affairs is remedied, the local health board should open up an emergency temporary office where people can give information and be attended to.  If necessary, somebody from the health boards should go to Dublin every day, or every two days, and bring the complaints with them.  The Minister should get this matter straightened out. I am giving way to Deputy Harte.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>A very serious situation has developed.  In addition to what Deputy Fitzpatrick said about the terrible hardship being inflicted on ordinary people who unfortunately find themselves out of work due to sickness, or redundancy, or being laid off for a temporary period, families who were used to spending incomes of £100 plus per week now find themeselves living on 50 per cent of that figure.  They have to wait for eight, nine or ten weeks before they are paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In frustration and despair they appeal to Deputies saying: &ldquo;For God's sake get <Col N="636" /> on to the Department of Social Welfare. We have tried to telephone them dozens of times.  When we get through to them we are sent from one section to another and we spend pounds and get no satisfaction.&rdquo; Until recently with a great deal of effort Deputies could communicate with the Department.  Today I was told by the telephonist on the switchboard in the Department that the sections dealing with unemployment benefit, disability benefit and maternity benefit will not accept calls on their extensions.  The Minister says this applies only to disability benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked today to be put through to the section dealing with unemployment benefit and I was told politely by the telephonist who answered the telephone that they would not accept calls. She explained politely to me that she did not work for the Department of Social Welfare but that she did work for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The system has broken down completely. The staff cannot cope with the work.  No advance preparation was made for the new computerisation system the Minister talks about.  Newly recruited staff were brought in as an emergency measure. They are totally unfamiliar with the working of the Department.  I am told on good authority that the staff are on the point of mutiny.  They blame the Minister because he is not interested in social welfare. He is more interested in the Department of Health.  Rightly or wrongly, these accusations are being made against the Minister.  As the weeks and months go by I am beginning to think there is something in those accusations.  The Minister is far more inclined to deal with the problems in the Department of Health than with the problems in the Department of Social Welfare.  If that is so, it is time for the Taoiseach to take note of that fact.  There are junior Ministers in other Departments, but there is no junior Minister in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, Deputy Hussey is responsible for children and young people.  I am told that conditions in the Department of Social Welfare are appallingly bad.  The staff are complaining because they are forced to work in overcrowded and cramped conditions. They are under-staffed.  They are being accused by the general public of being inefficient.  They are completely frustrated by the lack of interest the Minister is showing in their plight.  The switchboards in the Department are out of date and cannot cope with the load.  The blame for this rests with the Minister or the former Minister, now the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Haughey was an Opposition shadow Minister, every time he got up on his hind legs to talk about the Department of Social Welfare he criticised delays.  There were always delays in that Department but they were never unreasonable as they are at the moment. As an Opposition spokesman Deputy Haughey pledged that, when Fianna Fáil got back into office, they would put an end to all the delays in that Department. I do not know who is responsible for the present chaos, whether the Minister inherited it or caused it by his lack of interest.  Either the Taoiseach or the Minister is responsible.  I am not terribly concerned about which of them is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no planning to update the system which the Minister now uses as an excuse for the delays.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has given the Minister an idea about what could happen.  There is no reason why the community welfare officers should not be able to pay out money to these <Col N="638" /> unfortunate people.  They did this work during the postal strike.  This is just as serious an issue and as big a crisis as the postal strike was a year or so ago.  If families have no money they cannot wait until tomorrow for the cheque.  I appeal to the Minister to forget his vanity and get away from the flash bulbs, the cameras and the front pages of the daily newspapers. It is said that public relations is a very important part of public life but it is not the most important part of it.  Doing your duty and your job is the most important part.  The Minister has been described as a nice, pleasant, friendly person.  I accept that.</P>

I appreciate if somebody wants to make a query about a delay.  With regard to delays we had a long debate, which came near to leaving the Social Welfare Bill late.  I am glad that, by taking specific action, we got that through in time and all payments will be made tomorrow.  The new old age pension books, the widow's pension books and all the other books are in all the offices and I congratulate the staff for that.  I note that the Opposition this afternoon and this evening did not refer to that, nor did the congratulate the staff on it.</P>

    <P>I know the old age pensioner, the widow and the other recipients, who will have no problems once they get their books in time, appreciate the work done by the staff.  I am sure they also appreciate the time, effort and attention which I gave to bringing in the two biggest increases ever given from any side of the House in the history of the State.  I resent Deputy Harte's suggestion that I have no <Col N="639" /> interest in Social Welfare and that I do not give time to it.  I sit in the Department of Social Welfare every day and I am as long there as any other Minister in any office and probably longer than in most other cases because there is a heavy burden of administration there.</P>
    <P>With regard to the questions raised, there is no ministerial direction whatsoever. I explained that in my statement and if Deputy Fitzpatrick had read it he would have seen it.  We are talking about industrial action taken by some of the staff of my Department.  I did not give any direction and I do not want the situation there at the moment.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to that and I sought a compromise in relation to it. We undertook a variety of compromising measures.  These are industrial relations matters.  If this was in an industrial complex or in a business the Deputies here would allow the business to work out its industrial relations.  They are not prepared to do that in this case.  They jump on the bandwagon the very instant there is the scent of publicity.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harte talks about publicity. The only publicity I ever get is by doing work.  I do not go out looking for it.  As far as the action is concerned there are talks under way at the moment.  There will be meetings tomorrow in relation to it with the Civil Service Staff Associations. If the Deputies were so concerned about having telephone operations fully restored surely I would have thought they would be anxious to see that something was done, that talks were taking place and efforts being made to solve the situation. I might also tell the Deputies that I have done a lot of things to try to solve the situation.  Overcrowding was mentioned. The executive of the staff associations know that we have got additional alternative accommodation in Gandon House to which the staff will be able to move in the very near future.</P>

      <P>There is overcrowding. Deputy Harte should try to be a little more respectful to the House.  I did not take from the Deputy's time when he was speaking.  We had discussions with the staff associations and we took every measure that was requested with the exception of cutting of the telephones because we are not anxious to do that. Although we have done that, and the work is running quite smoothly within the Department and the backlog is clearing quite well, the staff decided to take this limited from of industrial action.</P>
      <P>I want to make quite clear what is happening.  The public office are taking queries written on a prepared form and these are taken to be dealt with straight away.  The Benefits Section are working and they see their approach as being in the public interest in assisting to get things completely back to normal.  This is why they have requested that the Benefits Section would have freedom from telephone queries, and that queries would come in on paper and they would then be dealt with.  They have made arrangements for dealing with them.</P>
      <P>There are four telephone lines operating from my office and I am making provision to provide further lines to deal with the queries of Deputies and Senators. I do not visualise Deputies or Senators having any difficulty in communicating with the office and through the telephones there.  It would be wrong to think that the problem is not being overcome. It is greatly reduced now.  One could get the whole thing out of perspective. Under disability benefits 70,000 people receive payment each week and 46,000 of those people receive automatic payments on a monthly certificate.  The Deputies are talking about the balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained to the House on previous occasions the problems which arose with regard to RSI numbers and other matters. Those have been reduced since because we have been advertising and have shown people how to use the RSI numbers.  They are using them and getting used to them.  It was a major change <Col N="641" /> and relates to the updating the Deputies spoke about.  A lot more needs to be done in regard to updating.  The total computer capacity needs to be updated. There is a programme coming up in relation to that.  Once that is done we will be in a better position because we will be able to have videos at a long distance from the centre.  We cannot have them under the present system at any real distance from the centre.  Once they can be put at a real distance from the centre we can operate with regional offices.  We cannot operate like that until we have that type of system.  I am very anxious that we get to that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a different thing from talking about the telephones.  The problem is not so serious now.  I know the extent of the backlog and the problems which had to be dealt with.  Those problems are greatly reduced.  The delays which occurred a few weeks ago have been dealt with by the staff working week-ends and a lot of overtime, by bringing back additional staff to the Department who had experience of that section to help clear the backlog.  We have taken a lot of measures to do that and the effect has been very good.  That is why I was very disappointed the staff decided to take this action.  We will continue with our discussions to try to find a solution.  In the meantime, I assure the Deputies that my office will be available. I am doing everything I can to provide the communication Deputies need.  I find they do not need as much communication as they did some time ago.  I asked the chief executive officers of the health boards a few weeks ago to be more flexible with the provision of supplementary <Col N="642" /> welfare when they find people with difficulties. They have given me an undertaking they will do this.</P>

We are doing our utmost and we have provided everything that can be provided.  We will be able to move some of the staff into Gandon House in the near future.  There are two floors provided there now.  The staff and we have been seeking this for quite some time and we are very glad that we now have that facility.  It will give us some extra space and will overcome some of the difficulties.</P>
      <P>The staff say they want to be left free from telephones in the Benefits Section because the telephone was going right through to the person working on the benefits.  They felt that was upsetting things.  The telephones are still operating to my Department and I am trying to provide whatever service I can by taking their requests and having them dealt with as quickly as possible.  I ask the Deputies to bear with us while we try to resolve the difficulties with the staff.  It is an industrial relations situation.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>At the time of the explosion on board the <i>Nellie M</i> this British vessel was at anchor 300 yards off the coast at Moville, County Donegal.  The vessel was checked and made safe by the security forces of the State and the Receiver of Wreck is now proceeding to discharge his legal functions in the matter and for that purpose is in touch with the ship's owners.</P>
      <P>Our position in relation to the waters surrounding Northern Ireland was set out by the Minister for External Affairs in the Dáil on 17 November 1970 (columns 1429-1434, volume 249 of the Official Report) and by the Taoiseach on 29 February 1972 (columns 674-676, volume 259).</P>
      <P>The Irish Government accordingly claim that these waters are ours.  However, the Irish Government are also aware of the existence of a counter-contention that the waters around Northern Ireland are British.</P>
      <P>It is unlikely that the conflicting claims in relation to this matter can be resolved outside the context of an overall solution to the Northern Ireland problem.  As has been stated previously, this is not a legal question but fundamentally a political one which requires a political solution.</P>

      <P>The expenditure included the purchase of a second Gazelle type training helicopter. The saving, £118,723, was due mainly to the fact that VAT on the purchase of the helicopter did not fall due for payment within the year, 1980.</P>
      <P>For 1981, the provision under subhead 0.2&mdash;Aircraft&mdash;of the Defence Estimate is £2,330,000 made up as follows: (1) Aircraft and equipment, £1,230,000; (2) Maintenance, £1,100,000.</P>

As I indicated in reply to a previous question in connection with this company (volume 325, columns 65-67 of the Official Report), the matter has been brought to the attention of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  I understand from the director that his investigations are continuing and that he would welcome the receipt of any specific complaints or information which members of the public may wish to bring to his attention or which the Deputy may have in his possession to assist him in his investigation.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would suggest to the Deputy that if he or any person who has had dealings with the company feel that there is evidence to suggest that Garda inquiries should be initiated in the matter, then of course it is open to them to make a complaint to the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>Circulars 21/80 and 22/80 relate to procedures for the employment and payment of substitute teachers during national teachers' absences, which became the responsibility of school boards of management with effect from January 1981. The terms of the circulars become applicable where circumstances arise necessitating the employment of a substitute teacher.  It would appear that 13 schools in the Dublin 11 area have been involved in the employment of substitute teachers since 1 January 1981.  Copies of the circulars are, with the permission of An Ceann Comhairle, being circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following are the circulars referred to:</P>
      <P Just="Right">Circular 21/80</P>
      <P Just="Center">Employment and Payment of Substitutes.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Circular to Chairmen of National School Boards of Management and Principal Teachers.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1st January, 1980, a revised system will be introduced for the employment and payment of substitutes during absences of national teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment and payment of substitutes will be undertaken by school boards of management in accordance <Col N="491" /> with the Rules outlined in Appendix A.</P>
    <P>In the case of absence for any reason other than those outlined in paragraph (2) of Appendix, where substitution is required, the employment and payment of substitutes remains the responsibility of the teacher.</P>
    <P>The current rates of payment for substitutes are as follows: For trained substitutes, £21.10 per school day; For untrained substitutes, £18.51 per school day.</P>
    <P>Substitutes should not be paid for any period of closure due to vacation or falling within vacation days.  In the case of closures not related to vacation (public and Church Holidays, Rule 59), it will be necessary for the substitute to serve immediately before and after the closure in order to be eligible for payment.</P>
    <P>At the request of school management, the Department will pay an immediate advance in respect of the estimated cost of the employment of a substitute.  This advance will be £19.00 per day in the case of a trained substitute and £17.00 per day in the case of an untrained substitute.</P>
    <P>These advances will be subject to a maximum in any one payment of £437.00 and £391.00 in the cases of a trained and an untrained substitute respectively.</P>
    <P>Advances are renewable on a monthly basis in the case of long term absences.</P>
    <P>Application forms are enclosed.  Additional forms may be obtained from the Department of Education.  Primary Branch, Block 1, Irish Life Centre, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1.</P>
    <P>Application Forms</P>
    <P>1.  It will be noted that in addition to the name of the absent teacher and the reason for absence, the teacher's payroll number is required.  With a payroll of over 18,000 national teachers, it is regretted that the name of a teacher is no longer sufficient to enable his/her record to be traced in the Department.  For example, it is not unusual for two teachers in the same school to have the same names.  In order to avoid difficulty in procuring a payroll number during a teacher's absence, it is suggested that the Board of <Col N="492" /> Management should take steps at an early date to procure a record of each teacher's payroll number.</P>
    <P>2.  In regard to school closings, the date of closure and reason should be specified (Par. 4).  If the closure is taken under Rule 57 of the Rules for National Schools, within the allocation of 56 days vacation allowed per year, &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; should be specified as the reason.  If the closure is not due to vacation, the exact reason should be stated.</P>
    <P>3.  Application for an advance of substitute's salary should be make by completing Section A of the attached form. The application form, with the amount of the advance entered by the Department, will be returned with the advance payment to the Chairman of the Board of Management.</P>
    <P>The same form, with Section B completed, should be used to claim the balance of recoupment, i.e. the remainder of the substitute's salary for his/her actual service plus the employer's share of the P.R.S.I. contribution.</P>
    <P>In any case where a portion of an advance payment remains over after the substitute has ceased employment, the amount involved should be returned to &ldquo;The Accountant&rdquo;, Department of Education, Block 1, Irish Life Centre, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1, together with the completed reconciliation of Section B of the application form.</P>
    <P>A medical certificate covering the teacher's absence through illness or on maternity leave must be submitted either with the request for an advance or with the reconciliation statement (Section B of the application form).  If this is not done, and a substitute has been employed, the Department will be entitled to deduct from the absent teacher's salary the cost of the substitute's employment.</P>
    <P>Management will be responsible for the deduction of the appropriate PAYE income tax and employee's PRSI contribution in the case of all payments made to substitutes and for forwarding the total deducted, together with the employer's share of the PRSI contribution to the <Col N="493" /> Revenue Commissioners.  [However, see Circular 22/80 enclosed].</P>

    <P Just="Center">APPENDIX A</P>
    <P Just="Center">Absences of Teachers and Employment of Substitutes.</P>
    <P>1.  The absence of a teacher, the cause of absence and the estimated duration of the absence should be notified at once to the Chairman of the Board of Management by the teacher or by a person acting for the teacher.</P>
    <P>2.  Subject to the arrangements set out below, substitutes should be employed by Boards of Management in the following cases of approved absences of teachers:&mdash;(a) certified sick leave; (b) maternity leave; (c) jury service; (d) special absence for particular educational reasons with the prior approval of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>2.1  A substitute should be employed from the first day of absence, or as soon thereafter as possible, where it is known that the teacher's absence is likely to exceed three school days.</P>
    <P>2.2  Teachers should not generally be expected to cover for an absent teacher for more than three consecutive school days.  A substitute should be employed on the fourth and subsequent school days.</P>
    <P>2.3  The teacher should supply medical or other certification in respect of any absence which exceeds three consecutive school days.</P>
    <P>2.4  If, after three consecutive school days absence, a teacher fails to supply medical or other certification or fails to notify the Chairman (or person acting for the Chairman) of his intention to resume on the fourth or subsequent day, and a substitute has been employed, the Department shall be entitled to deduct <Col N="494" /> from the teacher's salary any payment made in respect of the substitute's salary.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Circular 22/80</P>
    <P Just="Center">Employment and Payment of Substitutes.</P>
    <P>Circular to Chairmen of National School Boards of Management and Principal Teachers&mdash;Guidelines regarding PRSI deductions for substitutes' salaries.</P>
    <P>When the revised system for the payment of substitutes during absences of national teachers comes into operation, on 1st January, 1981, it will be the responsibility of school management to make the correct tax and PRSI deductions from the salaries of substitute teachers.  Plans are in progress at present for the registration of school Boards of Management as employers and instructions will be issued by the Revenue Commissioners regarding deductions of PAYE Income Tax.  In the time available, it will not be possible for the Revenue Commissioners to arrange for the registration of all boards and for the issue of all necessary PAYE documents by 1st January, 1981.  The Revenue Commissioners, therefore, accept that the operation of the PAYE tax deduction scheme in respect of any emoluments payable to substitutes by Boards of Management before 6th April, 1981, is not feasible.  In the meantime, no action need be taken in this regard.</P>
    <P>The employment of substitute teachers is insurable under the terms of the Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) Scheme and care should be taken to make the correct PRSI deductions from salary, and to maintain an accurate record of salary, PRSI contributions and weeks of insurable employment.  A sample form for the period January-5 April, 1981 for this purpose is enclosed.  This form will be included by the Department with each advance payment of substitute's salary. The PRSI contributions should be retained by the school Board of Management for the present and notification will be issued at a later date regarding the payment of these remittances.</P>
    <P>The PRSI rates applicable to substitute teachers are as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The majority of substitutes will fall to be treated under Class A for insurance purposes.  The exceptions are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) Persons over 66 years of age- &mdash;Class J.</P>
    <P>(2) Substitutes whose employment is of &ldquo;inconsiderable extent&rdquo;, (i.e. less than 18 hours total per week inclusive of other employments) who are not mainly dependent on their earnings&mdash;Class J. (For substitutes under 66 years of age who are mainly dependent on their earnings as substitutes, Class A is applicable even where the employment is for less than 18 hours per week, in order that they may be insured for the full benefits payable under the PRSI Scheme).</P>
    <P>(3) Substitutes living as members of Religious Communities, persons in Holy Orders or Ministers of Religion are liable for deductions under Class K.</P>
    <P>There are three sub-divisions in each contribution class: (i) Standard Rate; (ii) Rate for women in receipt of Social Welfare Widows' Pension, Deserted Wife's Benefit, Social Assistance Allowance for deserted wives or unmarried mothers, or a Widows' Social Security type Pension from another EEC State; (iii) Men and Women who are holders of medical cards.</P>
    <P>Once the substitute's insurance class has been established and the appropriate sub-division determined, the percentage PRSI contributions due in respect of the substitute's gross salary can be calculated in accordance with the rates specified above.</P>
    <P>Weeks of insurable employment</P>
    <P>In order to establish entitlement to certain benefits under the PRSI system, a record of the substitute's weeks of insurable employment must be kept.  A week of insurable employment is any week, or part of a week, during which the substitute served in the school and for which payment is due.  Three weeks can be counted by placing a tick for each week of service in the appropriate box on the attached form.</P>

Site Development Costs, £300,000 approx.  As site costs vary depending on the location of the site it would not be possible to give an exact figure for the cost of a site.

    <P>The amount of the capitation grant per school approximates to the cost of the basic salaries paid to the teachers in receipt of incremental salary on the staff of the school.  There has been no increase in the amount (£400) of this basic salary since July 1968.</P>
    <P>I may add that, as from April 1980, the Department of Education has assumed responsibility for the payment of the employer's share of the pay-related social insurance and of the full recoupment, as against two-thirds previously, of the cost of employment of substitute teachers in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The amounts of the grant in lieu of tuition fees were as follows: 1976-77 &mdash; £50.00; from 1 January 1978 &mdash; £66.50; 1979-80 &mdash; £70.00; 1980-81 &mdash; £70.00. The amount for 1981-82 will be £77.00.</P>

The latter will be increased to £4 per week as from 1 April 1981.  The health board are not aware of persons in similar positions being paid £5.06 per week spending allowance.</P>
      <P>In the 1981 Budget I made provision for an increase in the weekly spending allowance for physically and mentally handicapped persons in long-term residential care.  The increase will raise the average allowance from £2.50 a week to £4 a week with effect from 1 April 1981.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 23 January 1981 and was paid all disability benefit and pay-related benefit due from 27 January 1981, fourth day of incapacity, to 14 March 1981, after which date he was certified fit to resume work.  He was entitled to disability benefit at the weekly rate of £60.30, the maximum rate appropriate to a married man with five qualified children and payment was made as follows: Period 27 January 1981 to 14 March 1981 = six weeks, five days at £60.30 per week = £412.05.</P>
      <P>The position regarding payment of pay-related benefit is that his average earnings for 1979-80 on which entitlement was based amounted to £3,669, equivalent to £73.38 per week.  As the total weekly amount of flat-rate benefit and pay-related benefit payable may not exceed the average weekly earnings in the tax year relevant to the claim, the amount of pay-related benefit payable in his case was limited to £13.08 a week, that is the difference between his average weekly earnings (£73.38) and the weekly flat rate of disability benefit (£60.30).  He was accordingly paid pay-related benefit for the period 6 February 1981 to 14 March 1981, five weeks, two days at the rate of £13.08 per week, amounting to £69.76, which was his full entitlement. Pay-related benefit is payable only from the thirteenth day of incapacity.</P>

All disability benefit due, less refund of supplementary welfare allowance advanced by the health board, has issued to 27 March 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no undue delay in the payment of disability benefit in this case. The benefit cheques are, however, issued at irregular intervals but this is due to the fact that he only submits his certificates at such intervals.  He appears to attend his certifier about every four to six weeks as he submits his certificates in batches of four to six at a time.  Some of the certificates are in fact endorsed by the certifier with the words &ldquo;signed in retrospect&rdquo;.  In <Col N="514" /> addition he is still quoting his old insurance number on the certificates despite the fact that he was requested some months ago to quote his RSI number on them.  In fact the Deputy only quoted his insurance number when putting down this question.  His entitlement to pay-related benefit will be determined when he replies to the inquiry seeking details of his earnings in the 1978-1979 tax year.</P>

      <P>As the person concerned is not yet 66 years of age and is not a registered blind person or in receipt of any allowance or pension which would entitle her to free travel, I regret that there is no way which I could authorise her continued use of the free travel pass which was issued to her when she was in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance. The free travel pass should, therefore, be returned to my Department.  The Deputy will, I am sure, appreciate that it would be unfair to other people if a person who does not fulfil the conditions of entitlement to free travel were to be given a free travel pass.</P>

Pending investigation of his claim he has been paid disability benefit as an interim measure from 5 July 1979, fourth day of incapacity.  All disability benefit due has been paid to 4 April, 1981.

However, it has been decided in future to pay him at regular weekly intervals in advance of medical evidence which is required at monthly intervals only.

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 14 December 1979.  Following examination by a medical referee, who was of the opinion that she was capable of work, her claim was disallowed from 23 May 1980.  She appealed against this decision but did not proceed with the appeal and submitted a final certificate indicating that she was fit to resume work on 9 June 1980.  She again claimed disability benefit in respect of the same incapacity from 18 August 1980 and was paid to 25 August 1980, when her claim was reviewed and further payment was refused.  She indicated that she wished to appeal against this decision but she failed to return the form sent to her for completion in connection with her appeal.  She has again been requested to return this form but in the meantime arrangements are being made to have her examined by a medical referee.  The claim will be reviewed on receipt of the referee's report.  Pending the outcome of the appeal, her claim was admitted from 19 January 1981 and payment has been made to 30 March 1981.</P>

      <P>The administration of the local improvements scheme, including the execution of works is a matter for the county councils concerned subject to the <Col N="538" /> provisions of the Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Act, 1968, and subject to general guidelines issued by my Department which are based on direct labour arrangements.  I have no proposals to alter my Department's guidelines to county councils in this respect.</P>

      <P>Proposals for the revision of speed limits were received in my Department from Westmeath County Council on 28 October 1980.  They include recommendations that a speed limit of 40 mph be introduced at Collinstown and that the existing 30 mph speed limit area at Delvin be extended.  They do not contain any proposal for the alteration of the speed limit area at Castlepollard.</P>
      <P>The necessary documentation was not submitted by the county council to enable revised speed limit regulations to be made.  My Department have been in communication with the county council on this matter and when the essential information is made available appropriate regulations will be drafted.</P>

      <P>The information sought in the question is not available in my Department as employers are not obliged to make returns of work days lost due to unscheduled absences by their employees from work.</P>
      <P>The evidence available to me suggests that absenteeism is a complex, human problem, caused by a variety of factors arising inside or outside the work situation. In so far as working conditions may be a contributory factor, managements are encouraged to monitor trends and, in consultation with trade unions, to explore ways and means of identifying the underlying causes and remedying them.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Government's commitment to the promotion, by agreement, of meaningful participation by workers in decisions affecting their working lives will make a positive contribution to removing influences affecting worker-job relationships.  This factor will be taken into account when policies are being developed arising from the Government's discussion document on worker participation.</P>
