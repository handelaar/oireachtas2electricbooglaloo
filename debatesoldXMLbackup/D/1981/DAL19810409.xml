      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 2, 3, 7, 8, 1, 11, 12, 13 (Resumed), 14 and 9.  Business will be interrupted at 5 p.m. to take item No. 9 and the order will not be resumed thereafter.</P>

      <P>Arising on No. 7, could I ask the Taoiseach if he would indicate to the House the reasons for the exceptional prolongation of the Easter adjournment to a period of almost a month when the practice has been to adjourn for two weeks, or 18 days or so, in view of the amount of business before the House in terms of Estimates which have not been tackled and for which additional time has not been provided so far?  On the presumption that the Government have some legislative programme, why is it that the Dáil is being asked to do nothing for this prolonged period?</P>

      <P>My view is that we have afforded the Opposition parties ample opportunity to deal with all the matters which they wished to raise.  We have given them opportunities to debate current issues as they arose.  Ministers are anxious to spend some time in their Departments over the recess.</P>

      <P>I do not accept for a moment the title &ldquo;economic disaster&rdquo;.

      <P>I am entitled to reply to that.  I have some democratic rights in this House and I am entitled to reply to what Deputy Cluskey said.  Any impartial observer inside or outside the House would recognise that, since this House resumed after the Christmas recess, we have given the Opposition every opportunity to debate any issues they wished to raise here.  If they have not done so, it is their own fault because they wasted their time on a whole lot of side issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that we can discuss this matter in a more orderly fashion. we are at this point entitled to more explanation than we have had about the reason for this recess.  The suggestion that it was to enable Ministers to work in their Departments was greeted with hilarity on this side of the House, because no Governments have acquired such a reputation for Ministers not being in their offices but out nursing their constituencies as this Government have during their period in office.  This is a matter of public notoriety and it is of deep concern in the public <Col N="1622" /> service that the work of government is not being carried out by the present Government because of the neglect by Ministers of their Departments.  For the Taoiseach to suggest that that was the reason does not carry much credibility, not that there is much leeway to be made up by their being in their Departments.  However they are not likely to spend this time in their Departments, having regard to past performances.</P>
      <P>During this Dáil the volume of substantial legislation introduced has been negligible.  There is no comparison between the legislative output and the performance of the last Dáil in serious legislation of a reforming character and the lightweight stuff we have had from the Government both in their previous incarnation and more particularly in the past year.  The number of outstanding problems to be dealt with, the areas of reform that need to be tackled, the areas of economic crisis that need to be tackled, the areas of economic difficulty that need to be debated give us every reason for spending more time at ourwork rather than less.  There can be no excuse for departing from the normal procedure of having the brief fornight Easter Recess and then getting back to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not yet started to discuss the Estimates.  All the Estimates contain within them flaws of one kind or another, inconsistencies, improbabilities and deficiencies which have raised doubts which we have sought to raise in this House by putting to each Minister questions about figures which are clearly improbable and indefensible.  Those questions have been ruled out by a consistent policy on the basis that these matters can be discussed on the Estimates.  Yet that discussion on the Estimates which we were offered as the occasion for exploring these inconsistencies which cast doubts on the probity of the Government's approach to the Estimates of the current year is now to be denied to us for an additional period, with the possible intention of denying it altogether should the Taoiseach decide that he cannot continue any longer the facade of Government that he had been putting up and should he decide to go to the country before the barefaced character <Col N="1623" /> of what his Government have been engaged in for the past year and a quarter is further exposed.  In these circumstances we cannot agree that the House should adjourn for this prolonged period. There is much to be discussed which we should discuss.</P>
    <P>One of the major functions of Parliament is the examination of Estimates. Our present structure for doing this is deficient and inadequate and we propose a radical reform in this system, which in Government we shall implement to involve the examination of Estimat in advance rather than after the money has been spent.  Pending that, we at least have a right under the present system to examine the Estimates in detail and to explore inconsistencies.  In all the Estimates there are remarkable divergences from the pattern of expenditure last year which are not consistent with each other and in a number of instances they are not explicable in any rational terms.  There are cutbacks in expenditure, for example, in the Revenue Commissioners which are quite inconsistent with expenditure on their part in terms of communication and which are inconsistent with the Revenue Commissioners collecting the kind of revenue that the Government intended to collect in the present year.</P>
    <P>When one goes through them Vote by Vote one finds that the butchery done to the Estimates does not even show a sign of any common plan or intelligence.  If the Government wanted to fool the people into thinking that the current deficit this year would be only £515 million, they could have at least set about the task more intelligently by going through the Estimates and pruning and cutting in a rational way which could have been explicable and defensible.  But the barefaced manner in which this action was carried out, without any attempt to harmonise the actions of different Departments and producing results which are totally incredible, shows a contempt for this House and for democracy which does not have a precedent in this from in any previous administration.  These Estimates need to be explored.  We sought to explore them by way of question and <Col N="1624" /> answer and in every instance a direction clearly went out to dodge these questions because they were too awkward to be faced.  Instead, what we got from the Government was a series of non-answers referring us to the debates on the Estimates which were to come and which are now to be postponed perhaps indefinitely, so that the lack of probity in these Estimates cannot be explored and shown up.</P>
    <P>There are also many questions which we have been seeking to have answered but have been dodged day by day.  Deputy Boland has given examples of this and the handling of these questions, the manner in which they have been ruled out of order, the twists and turns involved in this whole process and the haste with which the Dáil is being would up before the questions can be pressed to conclusion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the grounds I have given, an explanation is due to this House going beyond what the Taoiseach has given, which is palpable nonsense.  There must be some <i>rationale</i> in this decision. There is no precedent in recent years that I can recall.  I think it was in 1973 when the Government changed that the Easter recess was longer because of the need to prepare for government, just as the Taoiseach took several months for that purpose <Col N="1626" /> and is recorded as taking several months for that purpose when he became head of the Government.  Apart from that case the normal Easter recess is two weeks and we need to be told now why it is being prolonged in this instance.  I have given a variety of reasons why it should not be prolonged.  There are reasons apparently motivating the Government into prolonging the recess and this House is entitled to a fuller and further explanation from the Taoiseach and I invite him to give it to the House now with rather more clarity and in a fuller way than he has done so far.</P>

      <P>The normal procedure adopted in all the years I have been a Member of this House on the length of an Adjournment was that the Whips were consulted and agreement arrived at.  I understand that procedure was carried out last week and the end of the Adjournment was fixed for 29 April.  The House would resume on 29 April.  Yesterday afternoon at what we understood to be a normal Whips' meeting the Opposition Whips were informed &mdash; not consulted, mark you&mdash; that the Taoiseach had decided the Dáil would not resume until 5 May.  That is totally outside normal procedure.  When asked this morning as to why the Dáil was going into such a long recess at a time of severe economic difficulty the Taoiseach gave the following explanation: he said it was necessary for Ministers to spend time in their Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Since December 12 months I have consistently stated what I believed to be the Taoiseach's attitude towards this Dáil and now we have had it this morning from his own lips.  He regards the Dáil as something to be at best tolerated.  If he can avoid having to come in here and face up to the normal responsibilities of a Taoiseach of Prime Minister in a Parliamentary democracy he will take every opportunity to do so. One can well understand his distaste at having to come in here and listen to the <Col N="1627" /> Opposition point out the defects of both himself and his Government as far as looking after and running the economic and social affairs of the country are concerned.</P>
      <P>God knows, there is plenty on which to comment at a time when we have inflation running at 21 per cent, an unemployment figure in the region of 126,000 to which will be added approximately 50,000 school leavers next summer, when the Book of Estimates is a joke amongst economists and accountants, when foreign borrowing is at an unprecedented level and out national finances are in a complete mess.  In those circumstances the Taoiseach comes before the House and tells the people, through the House, that he considers it more appropriate for his Ministers to be in their Departments for three weeks.  Is the Taoiseach implying that they have been somewhere else over the last four years?  We know the reason why the 15 second division was appointed.  It was so that they could go into constituencies and concentrate solely on constituencies work and on party political propaganda.  We know that and we suspected that many of those appointed by the Taoiseach to be Cabinet Ministers were not spending too much time in their offices and we now have it clarified by the Taoiseach that that suspicion was well founded and correct. When one looks at the performance of some of the Ministers of State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, unfortunately, will find it as difficult to dispose of me as he will of parlimentary democracy.  As long as the Taoiseach wants to be Taoiseach, as long as he stays there without facing the people, he will have to face this Opposition.  He will not evade it because we will pursue him.  We will point out the mismanagement of the economy which he has presided over.  We will point out that that mismanagement has led to untold hardship and suffering in the country.  We will point out all the issues the Taoiseach has evaded and he continues to evade.  Would the Taoiseach not be better employed in the interests of the country to stay here a little longer and let us know about his attitude, unequivocally, on neutrality, let us know if he gave the commitments, which Deputy Boland stated this morning he gave, to the relatives of the Stardust tragedy and let us know if the constitutional position of Northern Ireland, clear and unequivocally, is being, can or will be discussed in these studies which are taking place?</P>

      <Col N="1630" /> Would it not be better if the Taoiseach stayed here a little longer and let us know, clearly and unequivocally, what policies he has to try to put the 126,000 people who are unemployed back to work, let us know in clear, unequivocal terms how he will make up the very significant and obvious shortfall in the Estimates? There are many other things which could be discussed.  The Taoiseach's term of office has been distinguished by one thing more than any other, his evasiveness.  Everything has come under the heading of confidentiality and secrecy.</P>
    <P>We had this with Mrs. Thatcher and we now have it with the Stardust people. Every time a legitimate question was asked in the House and it was politically difficult and embarrassing, the Taoiseach used one of two tactics.  He jumped behind procedure or he said the matter was confidential.  The confidentiality is over and the bit in the bunker is over, because whether the Taoiseach likes it or not the time is coming when he will have to face the Irish electorate.  The Taoiseach can evade us here for three weeks, he has the 20 votes to do it, but he cannot evade his responsibilities for ever.  He certainly will not evade the wrath of the Irish electorate.</P>

We have put throught a very considerable amount of legislation in the last term.  Most of it has gone through practically automatically because the Opposition have not had the capacity to debate it in any substantial way.  Very often we found ourselves short of business because legislation which we thought would be the subject of very considerable debate went through in almost rubber stamp fashion.

    <Title>International Cocoa Agreement, 1980: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms if the International Cocoa Agreement, 1980, which has been laid before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Dáil approval of the terms of this agreement is necessary in accordance with Article 29.5.2º of the Constitution which stipulates that: &ldquo;The State shall not be bound by an international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann&rdquo;. An explanatory memorandum has been prepared and circulated to Deputies.  This outlines the provision of the agreement and covers the question of the costs of Irish Participation.</P>
      <P>The International Cocoa Agreement, 1980, was concluded under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) at the United Nations Conference on Cocoa held in Geneva in November 1980.  It was open for signature at United Nations Headquarters until 31 March 1981 by parties to the International Cocoa Agreement, 1975, and Governments invited to the United Nations Conference on Cocoa.  Following a decision of the Council of the European Economic Community on 30 March 1981 to the effect that the agreement should be signed, subject to its being concluded at a later date, on the basis of joint competence by the Community and the member states, Ireland signed the agreement on 31 March, along with the nine other member states and the Commission, on behalf of the Community.  Instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval must be deposited with the Secretary General of the United Nations not later than 31 May 1981.</P>
      <P>Some 98 countries, including Ireland, representing 48 exporting countries and 50 importing countries, participated in the conference.  The International Cocoa Agreement, 1980, which replaced the (Second) International Cocoa Agreement, 1975, will remain in force for a period of three years and may be extended for a further period of two years.  This agreement will make a valuable contribution to the on-going debate on economic relationships between the developed and the developing countries. The agreement establishes the International Cocoa Organisation to administer its provisions and supervise its operations. The organisation will function though the International Cocoa Council, an executive committee, an executive director and staff.</P>
      <P>The main objectives of this Agreement are to achieve a balanced growth between supply and demand for cocoa and to stabilise conditions in the trade by avoiding excessive price fluctuations.  For the purpose of achieving these objectives an international buffer stock consisting of 250,000 tonnes will be established.  The council of the organisation will appoint a buffer stock manager and he will offer to buy and sell cocoa in a manner designed to keep its price within an agreed price range.  The buffer stock will be financed by way of a levy of one United States cent per lb on cocoa beans and proportionately on cocoa products, payable on first export by a member or on first import by a member.  In addition, the funds accumulated under the two previous agreements, of the order of U.S. £230 million, are due to be transferred to the buffer stock account established under this agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1639" /> The administrative expenses of the Cocoa Organisation in its operation of the agreement shall be met by annual contributions by members.  At this stage it is not possible to assess accurately Ireland's apportionment of these costs because of the variables involved, such as the number of countries likely to adhere to the agreement.  However, based on experience of previous agreements, Ireland's annual contribution is estimated to be of the order of £6,000. The agreement will help stabilise raw material prices for a significant Irish industry.  The Irish cocoa processing industry provides employment for 2,000 persons.  In 1979, Ireland's exports of processed cocoa products amounted to £45 million.</P>
    <P>Membership of the International Cocoa Agreement, 1980, will afford Ireland the opportunity to demonstrate its readiness to support international measures to stabilise primary commodity prices and to re-affirm the importance which it attaches to eliminating the economic imbalance between developed and developing countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the agreement but, bearing in mind the Taoiseach's comments about the heavy legislative programme that needed to be put through the House expenditiously, it is relevant to comment that immediately he followed that up with a motion seeking approval of an international cocoa agreement. That cast some doubts about the seriousness of his comments.  The agreement has to be approved by the House within two months of 31 March but now we are being asked to approve it only one week after that date.  Whether there is any relevance to the fact that the agreement is being put before the House for approval only a few days after signature, I am not sure.  I would have hoped that the Minister would have outlined the situation in relation to the agreement in a little more detail.  The first International Cocoa Agreement was reached in 1972. I do not think it is correct to say that the 1980 agreement establishes the International Cocoa Organisation.  That organisation <Col N="1640" /> was established, in fact, under the 1972 Agreement, which was put into effect after very difficult negotiations over a 16 year period.  Those negotiations took place under the auspices of the United Nations and resulted in the 1972 Agreement.  The headquarters of the organisation were established in London.</P>
      <P>I would have hoped that the Minister would have indicated to the House in more detail the need for this new agreement. There was another agreement in 1975 and the Minister should have informed the House of the difference between the former agreements and the latest one.  I accept that the agreement is an important one in the context of the international cocoa trade because, hopefully, as a result of this coming together between the producer and importing countries, more effective measures will be taken to achieve the main objectives of the agreement.  Problems and economic difficulties arise, particularly for the producer countries, because of the fluctuations in price.  Under the 1980 agreement there was an arrangement whereby a buffer stock would be orgainsed.  I should like to know how successful that has been in the past, the changes that have taken place since it was introduced and the extent that those changes will alleviate the problems in the world market.  I understand that, arising out of the 1972 agreement, a large part of it was rendered inoperative because of fluctuations in the world market.  Obviously, we do not have a major voice in the finalisation of the agreement because we only import to the tune of ½ per cent of world production. But, as the Minister rightly pointed out, the Irish cocoa processing industry is significant in the context of our relatively small economy and in the context of the number of people employed and of our exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to tell us in more detail, when he is replying, how he expects this agreement to affect our cocoa industry.  I appreciate that the stabilisation of raw material prices will have an effect, but the Minister should indicate how he envisages the agreement will be of assistance to the Irish cocoa industry in the years ahead.  My view is <Col N="1641" /> that we should be prepared and ready to support international measures where they are of importance economically to the country and where such measures can be of assistance to Third World countries. Hopefully, the agreement will achieve both objectives and from that point of view, once the terms of it have been teased out, it will have our wholehearted support.</P>
    <P>Many of the major producing countries are Third World countries and cocoa production and exports are a major part in their economy.  Obviously it is of great importance to them that they have an ordered world market and it would be of benefit for the countries involved to be able to make provision for the future. Therefore it is important that there should be order in relation to supplies and prices in the years ahead.  We support the motion generally and hope it will achieve the desired aim of helping the Third World countries involved in cocoa production and at the same time be of assistance to the cocoa processing industry here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome the promptness of the Government in bringing forward this agreement.  Perhaps it will be considered that it was brought forward for reasons of convenience, such as that we might not be back after Easter, but it could have a more benign and positive dimension to it, one that I should like to see this country adopt, that is, that we should clearly indicate that we are in favour of such measures, embodying the whole context of trade activities.  If this country is to maintain a policy of positive neutrality &mdash; it should be the policy of the Department of Foreign Affairs&mdash;then active participation in agreements like this, irrespective of the size of our economy, followed up by lobbying for their immediate or early ratification, is the type of thing we should be doing as full members of the EEC, the world's largest trading bloc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we must do this in such a way that the Group of 77 and the UNCTAD will be aware of the actions we take and will value the sort of contribution we can make in terms of a policy of positive <Col N="1642" /> neutrality as a link between the rich northern countries of the globe and the poorer southern countries.  Because of our colonial past, we have a unique position in this and my regret is that since joining the EEC under this administration and to a lesser degree under the last, we had to jettison much of the moral authority we had in the UN in return for the very dubious honour of participating in the European Political co-operation process.</P>
    <P>In his speech&mdash;I take it the Minister for the Environment was facilitating his colleague in Foreign Affairs and the House in moving this&mdash;the Minister stated that this agreement will make a valuable contribution to the on-going debate on economic relationships between the developed and the developing countries.  I am sure it will, but this is a debate in which this Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have been remarkably silent.  Whatever the value of the debate or its lack of value, since 1977 the value of our bilateral aid, if it is to be taken as a measures of how seriously this Fianna Fáil republican ex-colonialist regime regard themselves, has been a clear indication of how much they have down-graded the significance of bilateral aid and, by extension, the whole question of contributing seriously to North-South dialogue.</P>
    <P>It is rather sad to learn that the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation, set up about a year ago, have at last succeeded in getting offices in Fitzwilliam Square but have not yet properly or formally met the Minister.  The chairperson of that organisation last week said they were hoping to have their first formal meeting with the Minister a year after being established.  This is the council the Government were agonising over, after Deputy O'Kennedy's accession to Foreign Affairs in 1977, as to whether they would have a council or a semi-State body.</P>
    <P>We accept that this agreement, for which the Government can take very little credit, will make a valuable contribution to the continuing debate on economic relationships between the developed and the developing countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1643" /> However, it is to our shame that we participate so sparsely in that debate and that our contribution, in moral and effective political terms, has been so underutilised.</P>
    <P>Our contribution in this agreement will cost us money and will cost the manufacturers and the food processing people here a certain amount of money by way of levy.  The assessment is approximately £6.000.  At the moment £6,000 is neither here nor there because of the way the Book of Estimates is being drawn up or guessed, and it is certainly neither here nor there in terms of the amount of disability benefits that seem to go missing, but it is significant, and it could be more. It is a model of the type of agreement that is essential if the post-colonial exploitation of Africa and to a lesser extent Latin America, but particularly primary commodity producing countries, is to be broken, if those nations are to break the economic link with their former colonial masters.</P>
    <P>It is not much solace or consolation for independent African States that they now have their own flags flying over parliament buildings, that they now have their own armies instead of foreign ones, if their economies are still totally dominated by commodity markets in Paris, London or New York which can juggle their economic progress one way or another.  It is important that the House realises what has happened on numerous occasions in regard to African or Central American countries, artificial situations created by European or American colonialist powers.  Because of the total commitment of an African country to a single primary product for export, post-colonial powers have had the commodity market artificially manipulated to such an extent that economic chaos was brought about in the home country.  There was destabilisation, to use the neat Henry Kissinger phrase which he applied to Chile which required destabilisation by the US Government because the copper interests of ITT and Anaconda were somewhat under threat.  It is highly reminiscent of the kind of economic relationship this country once had with Britain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1644" /> I make these points because that is the political context in which these tortuous agreements eventually wind their way on to the floor of this Parliment and the other European Parliaments.  In agreeing to the technicalities and the levies and charges that will occur &mdash; even having regard to the fact that in real terms the amount is not great &mdash; they are an essential part of the historical process of breaking the exploitative link between the colonial part of the world and the colonies part.</P>
    <P>This country has got to make up its mind on what side we choose to stand in relation to that debate.  It is my regret, and the regret of my party, that this particular republican administration, more of the Reagan kind than any other, has seen fit to drift further and further away from the memory of our own colonialist past and not pursue with vigour and intent the kind of agreement that is embodied in this in other aspects of the North-South dialogue so that not only would this agreement be seen as making a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate of economic relationships between the developed and the developing countries, but Ireland's independent, positive, neutral foreign policy would also be seen as making a similar contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the welcome which has been given to the agreement by Members on the other side of the House.  I regret that Deputy O'Keeffe, in his opening snide remarks, appeared to display a total lack of concern for the developing nations in his attempts and his desire to label the introduction of this agreements within seven days of it having been signed by this Government into the House.  I appreciate the fact that Deputy Quinn took the view that there was no ulterior motive, it was for benign reasons that the Government in its concern for the development of the North-South dialogue introduced the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion is before the House because of the efficient order of business which has been a hallmark of this administration. I also regret Deputy O'Keeffe's <Col N="1645" /> snide remarks when one realises that we are talking about an agreement involving a primary product which involves 2,000 jobs here.  Processed cocoa products involve £45 million worth of exports from this country.  Deputy O'Keeffe seems to be totally unaware of the fact that the previous agreement had lapsed.  That is why the new agreement involves the setting up of an international cocoa organisation, the council, the executive committee and the executive director of staff.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked for some details of the agreement.  The main aims of the agreement are to alleviate serious economic difficulties which would persist if adjustment between the production and consumption of cocoa cannot be effected by normal market forces alone as rapidly as circumstances require, to prevent excessive fluctuations in the price of cocoa, to make agreements which will help stabilise and increase the earnings from the exports of cocoa-producing members countries, to ensure adequate supplies at reasonable prices equitable to producers and consumers and to facilitate expansion of consumption, and, if necessary, in so far as possible, an adjustment of production so as to secure an equilibrium in the long term between supply and demand.</P>
    <P>On the question of benefit to Ireland from this agreement, the aim of preventing excessive fluctuation in price is very important.  The overall achievement of steady growth in the market would be of benefit to the Irish cocoa industry which imports about £11 million worth of cocoa beans and paste annually.</P>
    <P>With regard to Ireland's role within the European Community generally, Deputy Quinn cast some doubts as to the part that this administration has played in the Community, in particular in the area of the development of the North-South dialogue. I wish to remind the Deputy that this administration, as in the previous administration, in our presidency of the Community signed on behalf of the other members the Lome agreement.  I can assure the Deputy that the Government are totally committed to seeing a proper, equitable sharing of the world's wealth between the northern and southern <Col N="1646" /> hemispheres.  We have no difficulty whatsoever in deciding, as a Government, which side we are on in the North-South dialogue.  We are there as members of the European Community influencing the policies of the European Community because we have a very special place within the Community because of our lack of an empire.  We can play a very important role in the Community.  Our country is held in very special regard as can be seen by the honour which, in our bestowed on us in the signing of the Lome 2 agreement, an agreement which, in our presidency, we brought to finality because of our independent stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting we were given that option specifically or that it came by chance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  If he does not like my speech he may leave.  I agree with Deputy Quinn it is very important that what is being achieved in the cocoa sector is also extended to other primary products.  In this way, the Community, being the largest trading bloc in the world, would be in a position to help to stabilise the economies and to improve the development chances of the less well-off nations.  I assure the House that, as far as this republican Government are concerned, we have no difficulty whatsoever in playing a very important role or identifying that important role within the Community. It is a role we have consistently played since we were elected, to direct the European Community to help the less well-off around the world.  This has been a tradition of our missionaries, of our Government and, while we are in office, it will be one of the hallmarks of our administration.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 5 to 11 and substitute:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `medical officer in charge' means an authorised medical practitioner who is&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick raised an important point on Committee Stage.  The Bill, as drafted, does not specify that the medical officer in charge of a psychiatric centre should be an authorised medical practitioner as defined.  In practice, of course, chief psychiatrists employed in health board institutions and chief medical officers of private institutions are of consultant psychiatrist standing.  It is necessary, however, to put this issue beyond any doubt.  Similarly, it is necessary to ensure that any person acting on behalf of such chief psychiatrists or chief medical officers will be of consultant psychiatrist status. <Col N="1650" /> This amendment is proposed accordingly.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> As the Minister said, on Committee Stage I was unhappy about this because I was of the opinion that the Bill, as drafted, was anything but clear, and that we could have a person in charge of an institution with fewer degrees or fewer qualifications than was intended.  For that reason I raised the point on Committee Stage.  I am satisfied that the amendment introduced by the Minister meets the point.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 22, to delete&ldquo;, 36 (3) or 45&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;or 36(3)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to section 8(4). Section 8 creates offences and provides penalties for certain offences.  Section 8(1) creates a number of indicatable offences. For example, under section 10 (1) it shall not be lawful for any person other than a health board to operate any premises for the detention of persons requiring care and treatment for mental disorder or to describe or hold out any place as such unless it is approved and registered by the Minister in accordance with regulations made by the Minister under this section.</P>
      <P>That is a very proper subsection.  It is very desirable that any breach of that subsection should be a serious offence punishable by heavy penalties.  A monetary penalty of £10,000 is provided in section 8, or two years in prison.  I do not quarrel with that at all.  As a matter of fact, I consider it is very proper.  Section 12 (1) provides that it shall not be lawful for any person other than a health board to carry on in the functional area of the health board a psychiatric home unless it is licensed to be carried on by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very proper that any breach of that should be declared unlawful and should be punishable by very severe penalties, and suitable penalties are provided in <Col N="1651" /> section 8(1).  Other offences of a similar nature are created by section 17 (1) and section 44(2).  These are all indictable offences.  If a person is prosecuted on indictment he shall be subject to the penalties I mentioned.  Section 8(2) gives jurisdiction to the District Court to deal with the offences I have been talking about in certain circumstances.  That is the usual provision and I have no fault to find with it.</P>
    <P>When we come to section 8(4) we find that a breach of the provisions of section 45 of the Act is made a criminal offence. Section 45 reads:</P>
    <P>Immediately upon the occurrence in a district, special or registered psychiatric centre of any of the following matters the medical officer in charge of the centre shall give a report thereon to the Minister and to the chief executive officer of the health board for the area where the centre is situated&mdash;</P>
    <P>The matters he is obliged to report are:</P>
    <P>(a) an injury, other than a minor injury, to a person undergoing care and treatment in the centre or the death of any such person.</P>
    <P>(b) an alleged assault upon any such person,</P>
    <P>(c) any other matter of serious importance to the welfare of such persons.</P>
    <P>That is an obligation imposed by section 45 on the medical officer in charge of the institutions mentioned.  That is really saying that it shall be a condition of the employment of the medical officer that he shall do these things.  It is spelling out in statutory form the duties of the medical officer in charge of a psychiatric institution and it is creating a situation where a breach of the conditions of employment of the medical officer is a criminal offence under section 8(4) of the Bill.  Under that section the medical officer if he fails to comply with section 45 may be prosecuted in the District Court and he may be fined £500 or at the discretion of the court he may be imprisoned for a term of six months.  This is an outrageous provision <Col N="1652" /> in any Bill.  It is quite unreasonable to make a failure to comply with section 45 a criminal offence punishable by a fine of £500 or by imprisonment.  I would direct the Minister's attention to the terms of section 45 which make it an absolute offence.</P>
    <P>Immediately upon the occurrence in a district, special or registered psychiatric centre of any of the following matters the medical officer in charge of the centre shall give a report thereon to the Minister and to the chief executive officer of the health board for the area where the centre is situated.</P>
    <P>Among other things that he is supposed to report is &ldquo;any other matter of serious importance to the welfare of such persons&rdquo;. Who is to be the judge of whether a matter is serious or not, the CEO or the Minister?  If they have no doubt will the doctor in charge simply be hauled before the courts and prosecuted and be obliged to defend himself?</P>
    <P>The terms of section 45 are desirable and it is appropriate that they should be in the Bill.  If a medical officer in charge of a State-run psychiatric institution does not comply with the terms of this section disciplinary action should be taken.  The Minister should resort to the powers already available to inquire into the performance of that officer of his duty and, if he is satisfied that there is a serious breach of duty, he should have the officer dealt with.  If that happens in a private psychiatric institution the Minister could also use his powers to withdraw the licence under which the institution was operating and to refuse to renew it.  These are very far reaching powers already available to the Minister and they would ensure that the provisions of this Bill would be carried out.</P>
    <P>During the last hearing on this Bill the Minister seemed surprised to find out how far reaching were the terms of sections 8 and 45.  The Minister had relied on a previous Act and he told me that there was nothing new about this and that this was a provision in the 1945 Act.  I asked the Minister if that provision had ever been resorted to and he said that it had not.</P>
    <P>A lot of the merit that the Minister <Col N="1653" /> claims credit for in regard to this Bill is that it is an updating of legislation, a modernising of provisions for mental treatment.  This Government talk about their approach to industrial relations and about the need for creating better industrial relations.  This is the sort of provision one would find in an Act enacted in the last century.  This makes the breach of a condition of employment of a State servant a criminal offence.  Does the Minister deny that?  How can the Minister justify prosecuting for a criminal offence somebody who puts a different interpretation on section 45 (c), who interprets something that has happened as not being serious while some Minister thinks otherwise?  The Minister may say that if he is not guilty of an offence he will be acquitted in the courts.  However in the meantime that person has to go to court and defend himself on a criminal charge. That is unreasonable.  The Minister, who can be quite nice when he it suits him, can be quite nasty when he thinks it politically profitable to be so.  I do not want section 45 removed from the Bill as it is necessary to maintain control over these instituitions whether they are private or State run.  There should be overall control from the Minister's office.</P>
    <P>My objection is to creating a criminal offence where there is no criminal offence. It is significant that the Bill as originally drafted did not include the provision of section 8(4) of section 45 or for a breach of duty being a criminal offence. Including that particular section was an afterthought by the Minister and I should like an explanation now as to why that was done.  This is really a repetition of an episode when the Minister's party prosecuted certain ESB employees, lodged them in Mountjoy, then released them, paid the fines for them and sent them home in taxis.  That section in the ESB Act of that year did not work and the Minister knows that, unless the person involved in section 45 was engaged in a criminal conspiracy, the section will not work.  Then why did he put it into the Bill?  The Minister claims credit for removing the locks and chains and doing away with the padded cells by scrapping hundreds of sections of the 1945 Act and <Col N="1654" /> the other three Acts which are being repealed.  Then why include this particular section in this Bill?  If it were attempted to invoke the provisions of section 8 (4) to enforce the provisions of section 45, in my opinion you would have a strike of huge dimensions all over the country unless, as I say, the person involved was engaged in a criminal conspiracy or committed a criminal offence, in which case he could be prosecuted independently of his terms and conditions of employment and independently of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I thought the Minister saw the logic of my argument on Committee Stage.  I believed he intended to do something about this.  He has yielded to a number of suggestions put forward by Deputy Boland and me and introduced amendments which improved the Bill.  I would not have spoken so strongly on Committee Stage and neither would I repeat my amendment on Report Stage were it not for the fact I feel so strongly about this. tee Stage and neither would I repeat my amendment on Report Stage were it not for the fact I feel so strongly about this. We should be ashamed of ourselves in the year 1981 creating this sort of offence, and that for two reasons.  This is contrary to the whole philosophy of good industrial relations.  It is completely foreign to the promotion of better relations between employers and employees.  It is writing into a Bill a provision it is never intended to enforce.  I would like the Minister to tell me &mdash; I am sure there has been a good deal of research since the last Stage&mdash;whether this section or the section it replaces in the 1945 Act has ever been invoked, in what case or circumstances and with what result.</P>
    <P>I would like to be told whether the offence under this section was an offence under the previous Act and I would also like to be told why and how it was left out of the Bill as originally drafted and introduced.  I would like to be told whether it was ever invoked and, if so, in what type of case and with what result.  I am sure the Minister has excellent advisory services in connection with a Bill like this and I would like the Minister to tell us why he will not yield to my amendment now and why he insists on this section as drafted being retained.</P>
    <P>Is there a precedent, apart from the <Col N="1655" /> mental services legislation, for this in other types of employment and in respect of other types of obligations placed on employees?  I do not make any distinction between the person involved here because he happens to be a professional man.  I would make the very same argument if he were not a professional man, if he were any other type of employee. To me there is no difference.  The criminal law should apply to everybody and it should not be necessary to write things like this into conditions of employment in respect of certain people.  That is what I am against.  This is a bad precedent and I honestly believe that, if the implications of this particular section were fully realised, there would be objections to it right across the board.</P>
    <P>To get back to section 45, one finds the words &ldquo;immediately upon the occurrence&rdquo;. What does that mean?  Does it mean the day something happens?  Does it mean the day after?  Does it mean within a week?  If the medical officer is absent and there is some one deputising for him and that someone would like to have an opportunity of consulting with the officer in charge on his return, does he simply leave the matter over for a week?  Will that be an offence under the section?  Here we are dealing with a criminal offence.  Is the report to the Minister and to the chief executive officer of the health board to be in writing or over the telephone?  We should spell this out if this is a criminal offence.  Here it says &ldquo;immediately&rdquo;, not within 24 hours or any specified time, but immediately. Then it provides that he shall give a report thereon.  That is much too loose in a section creating a criminal offence.  I should like the Minister's observations on that.</P>
    <P>In this section we are creating a criminal offence to be prosecuted under the criminal procedures of section 8(4). When we are dealing with criminal language or criminal acts we should use language that the courts will understand. What does the Minister mean by assault? It is an assault for me to go over to the Minister and shake my fist in his face or <Col N="1656" /> anybody else's face.  That is an assault within the criminal code.  Is every incident like that to be reported to the CEO and to the Minister?  Is the person to be prosecuted for it?  It is not an assault causing injury, it is simply an alleged assault.  If I throw a glass of water on somebody in a fit of bad temper that is an assault.  That is the sort of language that is put into this section.  I agree that paragraph (a)  is more intelligent.  It states &ldquo;an injury, other than a minor injury, to a person undergoing care and treatment in the centre or the death of any such person&rdquo;.  Somebody has to decide what is a minor injury.  If this is put on the Statue Book it is the courts who will have to decide this.  Paragraph (b)  refers to an alleged assault upon any such person. I have described what an assault is. Does the Minister agree with me?  If a person throws a glass of water on another person that is an assault.  If I shake my fist or shake a stick so close to a person that I could hit him with it that is also an assault.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) says &ldquo;any other matter of serious importance to the welfare of such persons&rdquo;.  What does that mean? Maybe the person was not getting the sort of food he should have been getting, maybe there were too many visitors coming to see him.  It certainly could mean a lot of things besides physical things.  This medical officer is bound to report to the Minister and to the CEO any other matter of serious importance to the welfare of such persons.  Perhaps the health board have not provided enough money to give the sort of food this person is entitled to. I implore the Minister to tell me what is meant by this section.  If he tells me that this is a repeat section of some form of Act it shows how undesirable it is to go back and lift sections and subsections out of Acts passed 50 or 100 years ago and put them into another Bill without thinking about it.  We are now making it a criminal offence if a medical officer does not report the sort of things I am talking about.  He is not even to be told if the report is to be in writing.  It should be in writing if one is to avoid a long argument about it afterwards.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes on to list the things he is <Col N="1657" /> supposed to do.  It is difficult enough to interpret an injury other than a minor injury.  It is almost impossible to interpret an assault.  It covers a lot of things which may or may not be intended to be reported.  Paragraph (c)  takes the biscuit altogether because it says the medical officer is bound to report immediately any other matter of serious importance to the welfare of such persons.</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  If all the Deputies in the House were present I would ask them what it means and they would not be able to tell me.  If the CEOs for the health boards were sitting in the House and I asked each of them what paragraph (c)  of section 45 means, they would not be able to tell me, because it is so wide it covers everything.  It is an omnibus, all-embracing subsection, which is like a clause in a will which says that the person leaves all his property of every nature and kind, real and personal and wherever situated to such and such a person.  That covers everything.  This subsection is just as wide.</P>
    <P>That would be all right if we did not make it a criminal offence.  We are making the provisions of this subsection a criminal offence.  It is nearly as bad as the other section, which says that every letter written in the institution has to be posted immediately even if the unfortunate person who is writing the letters is so mentally afflicted he does not know what he is doing.  The Minister seems to have a sudden urge to get this Bill through the House.  I was facilitated in respect of it on one occasion when I was out of the country on parliamentary business and I am grateful to the Minister for that.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I want to put it on the record that I have not held up this Bill.  It has gone through quite quickly.  I asked that the Bill would not be taken on two specified days because I was out of the country on public business.  I have shown how farcical those two sections taken together are. The Minister is rushing the Bill through the House today and he will bring it to the Seanad next week.  If he is convinced that an amendment is necessary an amendment will not be made to the Bill in the Seanad because the Bill would have to come back to the House and the Dáil will not be here.  We will not have this Dáil sitting again.  That is the reason the Minister is rushing the Bill through the House today.  There is virtually a guillotine motion on it.  Any sensible person must agree that it is wrong to create a criminal offence in section 45.  It is writing trash of the worst kind into this Bill and I intend to show how utterly absurd it is. It might project the Minister as a bigger man if he were to agree to drop section 45 from section 8(4).</P>
      <P>The provisions of section 45 would be all right if we knew what they were or if they could be interpreted as to what is to be reported.  The Minister should tell the draftsman to prepare a new section 45.  It would be reasonable to specify that the kind of things which are to be reported and how they are to be reported will be prescribed in regulations.</P>
      <P>This section needs to be dealt with very carefully and the fact that I have some legal knowledge brings home to me just how crazy it is.  It is wrong that the chief medical officer in one of these hospitals must comply with this section or else find himself in the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My position on this matter was made clear on Committee Stage when I stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measure is an effective provision and I am not prepared to remove it from the Bill because it relates to alleged assaults and injuries on defenceless people.  That is all I wish to <Col N="1659" /> say about it.  The Deputy may wander on talking <i>ad nauseam</i> about the situation but the essence in this is that we have a duty to protect the rights of people in such a situation.  The measure is effective and I am not prepared to drop it.</P>
    <P>I certainly made clear my views on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I wish to point out that no member of the medical profession has made any objection to this provision.  There are similar kinds of provisions in pharmacy law and in the Misuse of Drugs Act.  We are not creating an offence here; it already exits and we are continuing it in this Bill.  I am particularly concerned that the civil rights of the patients who have diminished responsibility would be protected against any neglect or abuse.  The Deputy makes comparisons with industrial relations and says that this kind of clause would not normally be used in an industrial relations situation.  This, of course, is not a normal industrial relations situation.  Special privileges are given in terms of control, detention and treatment of people and I am particularly concerned that this would be regarded in the most serious way.</P>
    <P>Since Committee Stage it is interesting that I have had a letter from one clinical director stating:</P>
    <P>I was impressed on reading the Dáil report <i>(The Irish Times, 2/4/81)</i> to note your amendment making it mandatory for Medical Superintendents, or Clinical Directors, to report happenings of this nature to the Department of Health and, of course, to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I congratulate you, and beg you not to be deflected in inserting this amendment. Indeed, any untoward incident affecting a patient should be reported.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that there should be no possibility of any cover-up and that this kind of thing does happen in some English institutions.  He believes that this measure is an effective one and should be continued.  I believe there is no concern about this provision.  It has operated in a practical and realistic way and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> Section 45 deals with matters which, by common agreement, are of the most serious nature in any institution.  To date commonsense has certainly prevailed in the interpretation of those sections of the 1945 Act.  This is all the more so in the setting of the psychiatric hospital where many patients suffer from diminished capacity to a varying extent, given the nature of their psychiatric disability.  I do not wish to labour this point but I would ask the Deputy to bear it in mind.</P>
    <P>There is no suggestion that any medical officer in charge would deliberately evade the requirements imposed by section 45.  Of course, where an incident is not reported due to a genuine oversight or due to the medical officer in charge not being properly informed by his staff, that is a different situation and self-evidently the medical officer in charge would not be liable to conviction in court.  The discretion of the Minister must be allowed for in these cases.</P>
    <P>I have linked section 45 with section 8 (4)  because I believe that section 45 provides an important safeguard for patients and that accordingly it needs to be afforded due force in law.  I would be most anxious that section 45 would be subject to rigorous and uniform interpretation and suitable reinforcement will, no doubt, aid the achievement of this objective. Injury as defined, alleged assault and death provide little ground for philosophical interpretation.  I do not anticipate that the wider scope of paragraph (c)  will give rise to any difficulty in practice. Section 45 is more liberal than the corresponding sections of the 1945 Act, namely, sections 268 and 272 which required that deaths be reported to the coroner and that all injuries to patients, including very minor injuries and injuries existing on admission, be reported to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that section 45 places an inordinate responsibility on the medical officer in charge.  The scope of responsibility falls wider than might at first appear, particularly given the text of section 8 (4)  which makes it clear that impeding or obstructing the medical officer in charge in the performance of any of his duties under this Act, such as the <Col N="1661" /> making of reports to the Minister and the CEO of the health board, will attract the relevant penalty.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances which exist in relation to these patients this is a valuable and useful instrument and for that reason I propose to continue it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am interested to hear that the Minister received a letter from some professional person since the last Stage congratulating him on the provisions of this section and on making it mandatory. Did the Minister think of writing to this gentleman and asking him what he thought the section meant?  I would be interested to know if he wrote to that man&mdash;I am sure the man wrote the letter in good faith, and it is good that there should be a flow of communication from well-informed people to the Minister&mdash; asking him what he thinks an assault means.  I would not be surprised if the writer would regard an assault as battery, because most people confuse assault and battery.</P>
      <P>The Minister should remember that we are not dealing with ordinary conditions of employment and with regulations governing the employment of hospital staff. We are dealing with criminal law.  Most people think an assault is a physical hammering of somebody but it is no such thing; that is battery.  I would like the Minister to ask the gentleman in question what he thinks paragraph (c) of section 45 means, because I must confess I do not know.  I am against enforcing conditions of employment by the criminal law and using loosely drafted sections like that to create criminal offences.  There is no point in the Minister telling me he is not creating a criminal offence.  He can say he is &ldquo;continuing&rdquo; it, if he likes, but he is repealing the 1945 Act and writing into this legislation a section making this a criminal offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told me in his intervention that under the old law the death of any person in a mental institution should be reported to the coroner and he seems to take credit for repealing that provision. Does he think it was wise to repeal that provision?  I do not.  I think that was <Col N="1662" /> a reasonable provision.  If a person dies in a hospital theatre I understand the coroner has to be notified.  The Minister is now claiming credit for removing a provision in a previous Act which said that if a person dies in a mental institution, whether a State or private mental institution, the coroner must be notified. Was it wise to remove that provision?  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us he was defending defenceless people.  He is right to defend them, but he is emotional about this and is putting forward an emotive argument. I said the last day, and I want to repeat, that everybody who goes to a hospital theatre for surgery is a defenceless person. He is defenceless before he leaves the ward, because he gets an injection to relax him and to ensure that he will not be afraid and when he goes to the theatre he gets another injection which knocks him out.  That is necessary, but he is a defenceless person.  Sometimes mistakes are made in theatres.  The classical example is leaving a swab in a patient and stitching him up.  Did the Minister ever think of making that a criminal offence? Does he think it would be reasonable to do so?  Of course it would not, although if one were to adopt the Minister's line of logic some serious damage could be done to a defenceless person while under an anaesthetic.  That would be a human error and none of us is infallible.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any difference between a defenceless person out for the count in a public hospital under the services of consultants provided by the State and a defenceless person in a mental institution. Both are entitled to be looked after and to have the best care possible, but none of their rights should be enforced by the criminal law if a mistake in either case is an error of judgement.</P>
    <P>It is clear that this section never was intended to create &mdash; I am using the word &ldquo;create&rdquo; because that is what the Minister is doing in this Bill &mdash; a criminal offence.  The Minister says it worked all right, that there would never be any difficulty in interpreting the wider provisions of paragraph (c), and that it has given no trouble to date.  He also said that if, due to an oversight, a report of a <Col N="1663" /> death were not made or if some member of the staff did not inform the medical superintendent, there would not be a criminal offence.  Here the Minister has created an absolute criminal offence without a safety or let-out clause.  If he intended to have a let-out clause there would be a provision that it would be a good defence to show (a), (b), (c) and (d), that due to somebody else's fault the medical officer was not informed and the Minister would have discretion.  If the Minister is to decide what is and what is not a criminal offence, he will be exercising judical functions.  That would be contrary to the Constitution.  I am against that sort of thing.  The more probing we do into this section the more unreasonable this appears to be.  The Minister said that there would be a discretion and he is the person who would be deciding. There is no guidance as to what a person should report.</P>
    <P>I admit that I did not raise the question about the coroner being omitted earlier, but I am sure the Minister will accept that quite a number of people would be alarmed to find out that such a provision has been nicely and quietly taken out of the Bill.  I am not here to defend the medical or the legal profession or any other section of the community.  I am here to ensure that reasonable legislation passes through the House.  If I were in the Minister's position I would view a provision that death in a mental institution be reported to the coroner as a reasonable one.  It should have been left in the Bill.</P>

I am opposed to the removal of the coroner from this provision.

Is that not what this is all about? Are we not making laws?  Far too often our laws are made by people who do not know anything about the law.  The Minister has not told me why the Bill, as originally drafted, did not provide that this would be a criminal offence and why he introduced an amendment in relation to this on Committee Stage.

I should like to make it clear that I am not seeking to delay this debate, because were I to go on talking unnecessarily about this provision I might give the impression that I was talking for the sake of talking.  I raised this matter on Committee Stage and tabled an amendment for today's debate because I am deadly serious about this matter.  It is an absurd proposition to enforce the conditions of employment of a public servant by the criminal law and to make it an offence for a public servant to overlook something, to forget to do something or make a wrong judgment about something. That is crazy in the extreme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also crazy in the extreme to make such matters as a failure to report any other matter of serious importance to the welfare of such persons a criminal offence. That could mean anything.  I am sure that even without being asked to do so, medical officers are sick and tired of reporting to the Minister on things of importance to the welfare of the patients, like housing them properly instead of having dozens of them in huge wards <Col N="1667" /> which should be cut down into more homely compartments.</P>

    <P>I have considered the point which was raised concerning the provision of a right of appeal to the High Court against the decision of a health board in refusing to register or in cancelling the registration of a psychiatric home.  On reflection, I agree that for the sake of consistency it would be as well to specify that appeal can be made not only to the Minister in the first instance, but failing that, to the High Court.  Of course, there is in practice access to the courts in any case where a party wishes to contest a decision of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I understand the point of the amendment but I am still disappointed that it does not contain the suggestion I made that the health boards in the areas in which psychiatric homes are operating would have to maintain a register in a prescribed form which would be available for inspection.  Under section 12 the health board may refuse to register a psychiatric home or may cancel the registration.  Subsection (3)  refers to a home not carrying on business until the day they apply for registration or until registration is refused.  Subsection (4) refers to the health board refusing to register or cancelling the registration. Subsection (5)  does not refer to registration. Subsection (6)  refers to the removal of the home from the register.  Although there is a reference right through section 12 to a register and to the onus on the health board to decide on the registration or otherwise of private psychiatric homes <Col N="1670" />&mdash; there is an implied register somewhere in existence &mdash; it does not state anywhere in section 12 that the health board is to have a register or that such register be made available for public inspection during office hours, as section 9 places an obligation on the health board to maintain such a register in respect of district psychiatric centres.  I raised this point on Committee Stage and, at that time, I was unhappy with the reply and the comprehension of the Minister in relation to the point I was making.  I am disappointed that the amendment he has now introduced on section 12 does not appear to deal with the fact that, although a register is referred to right through the subsection of section 12, the setting up of the register and, more importantly, the making available of it for public inspection during normal house, by the health board, is not set down in section 12.  That is a continuing defect in section 12 and I am disappointed that the Minister did not grasp the point I made on Committee Stage.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 25 and 26 to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;14&mdash;(1)  Where an applicant is being treated in a psychiatric centre as a voluntary patient he may, at any time, give notice of his intention to leave the psychiatric centre not earlier than seventy-two hours thereafter <Col N="1671" /> and he shall be so entitled to discharge himself at any time after the expiration of such period.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where the applicant is the person himself the medical officer in charge of the centre shall, where practicable, notify the relatives of the applicant of his intention to discharge himself immediately upon receiving notice of the person's intention to do so.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister may, by regulation, vary the period of seventy-two hours as set out in subsection (1).</P>
    <P>(4)  Where it is proposed to make a regulation under this section, a draft of the regulation shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulation shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to insert a new section which would provide that a voluntary patient in a psychiatric institution would be required to give 72 hours' notice of the patient's intention to discharge him or herself and leave the institution. Throughout the course of the debate on this Bill, the Minister emphasised that mental illness should be treated like any other illness.  A great number of patients are now voluntarily seeking attention in psychiatric institutions.  That is a very good thing.  The old days, when people were brought to these institutions by the Garda are now rare.  Some of us can remember the traumatic experience of seeing unfortunate patients being brought to institutions.  It is good that this has been done away with.  Modern treatment and drugs have made that sort of thing unnecessary.  The net result is we are now going to have great numbers of people going into these institutions as voluntary patients, some of them quite seriously ill, some of them requiring long-term treatment, some requiring to be hospitalised in their own interests and some requiring to be hospitalised for the safety of other people or other people's <Col N="1672" /> property.  All that is because these people are mentally afflicted and not capable of making balanced or reasonable decisions on certain things, because they suffer from delusions about other people.</P>
    <P>In the Bill, as introduced, these people could discharge themselves without any notice.  At any time, if they were voluntary patients, they could walk out of a mental institution.  I know there was a great volume of opinion, lay and professional, who thought that was unreasonable and dangerous.  They thought it was not in the interests of the patient or other people.  I know psychiatric consultants' organisations advised the Minister that there should be 72 hours' notice.  The Minister held fairly strong views about this and he was not prepared to agree that 72 hours' notice should be given.  He agreed that 24 hours' notice should be given.  That is he way the Bill stands at the moment.  The effect of my amendment would be to extend the period of 24 hours' notice to 72 hours' notice.  I think 72 hours' notice is necessary, so that medical men in charge of these centres can observe and carry out a thorough examination of the patient and decide whether, in the patient's interest, he is fit to be discharged, or in a fit state of health to take up his position in the outside world.  That is all I purpose.  The Minister pardoned me for referring to my experience as a lawyer.  Experiences are helpful. I know a case where a patient discharged himself by walking out or by abusing parole or freedom given and, within a very short time, a person was killed, whom the patient thought was responsible for putting him in hospital. There are other cases &mdash; it is too bad we have to talk about them but that is what we are here for &mdash; where patients are so depressed they get out and then take their own lives.  That is quite common.  I have given the example of the patient who killed someone.  Naturally, I will not say who the other person was.</P>
    <P>We are inviting trouble because a person may want to discharge himself for the wrong reasons, because he is so ill he thinks he should be discharged.  If a person goes into an ordinary, general hospital, he is told he will only be required <Col N="1673" /> to stay a week to do some tests.  At the end of the week he is told they would like to keep him for another week to do some more tests.  The person will agree because he is capable of coming to a reasoned decision and making up his mind in a reasonable manner.  But when a doctor in a mental institution tells a person he is not well enough to go out and that they want him to stay longer, to try new tablets and new medicines in his treatment, the poor patient is so mentally ill, he says he is going immediately.  According to the Bill as drafted, out would go that person.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put forward his amendment against the advice of the Institute of Consultant Psychiatrists.  He is providing for a period of notice of 24 hours and has refused to accept the suggestion of 72 hours.  When we discussed this on Committee Stage the Minister told me he had again discussed the matter with the consultants and that they were reasonably happy about the matter.  I say that in this case we should err on the side of safety and caution in the interests of the patient and of other people.</P>
    <P>If a person has to seek treatment as an in-patient in an institution because his mind is so disturbed he is unbalanced and is incapable of coming to balanced decisions or if he is suffering from delusions about people or things, it is not unreasonable to requires him to give 72 hours' notice of his intention to leave the institution. I submit this period of notice is necessary to allow the medical specialists to observe him and to decide whether he is in a fit condition to take his place in the world.  A period of 24 hours is too short to enable this observation to be carried out.  For a considerable portion of 12 hours the patient will be asleep, perhaps with the aid of sleeping tablets. It may happen that the medical person who is looking after him is off duty for a few days and the person in charge of the institution will not have an opportunity of consulting with him.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is being quite unreasonable in this matter.  He is telling the House that if the patient wishes to leave an institution after 24 hours then we should let him do so.  The Minister's thinking on this matter is somewhat <Col N="1674" /> alarming.  When the Minister introduced the Bill it provided that no matter how ill a patient might be if he admitted himself voluntarily to an institution he could discharge himself when he wished.  We know that people who are not ill change their minds about various things.  I am not an expert on mental illness but I imagine people suffering from this illness are likely to change their minds more frequently. The commonsense of my amendment is quite apparent and the Minister should reconsider the matter.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating locks and chains or high walls.  I applaud the Minister and his predecessors for the part they have played in taking locks, chains, high walls and padded cells out of the treatment of mental illness.  I am telling him that if he accepts this amendment he will be falling into line with the advice of medical consultants and he will be promoting voluntary treatment rather than discouraging it.  I am surprised the Minister does not appear to be prepared to adopt a reasonable attitude in this matter.</P>

      <P>We had a fairly lengthy discussion on this matter on Committee Stage.  At that time I pointed out the very desirable changes that have taken place in relation to the treatment of mental illness.  I think all Members want to see more changes in this area and to normalise so far as possible the treatment of patients suffering from this illness.  We know that 183,000 patients attend at out-patient clinics and this is a major and welcome development.  In our modern hospitals there are acute psychiatric centres and this is the trend we are promoting. The vast majority of people will attend in a voluntary capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick considers that the 24-hour period provided for in my amendment is insufficient but I do not agree with him.  It is a question now of what kind of notice is necessary.  In 1945 when the original Bill was introduced 72 hours' notice was considered necessary but in the light of developments in modern medicine I consider 24 hours' notice to be adequate.  Deputy Fitzpatrick seemed to be concerned about specialist staff being off duty.  I should like to assure <Col N="1675" /> him there is a requirement to provide cover if the psychiatrist or the specialist staff are away.</P>
    <P>The 24-hour period will allow ample time for examination by two registered medical practitioners leading to formal reception by the making of a reception order if that is considered necessary. Nearly all psychiatric centres are situated in cities or in the larger towns and I do not anticipate any difficulty with regard to that aspect.  When a patient's condition deteriorates to such an extent that formal detention is necessary, my amendment will cover that situation.  However, I do not accept that a voluntary patient who does not satisfy the criteria for detention can reasonably be retained in a psychiatric centre for longer than 24 hours.  A patient either satisfies the criteria for detention or does not.  Deputy Fitzpatrick was leading us into a very vague area here.  He wished to have the power to retain a voluntary patient for 72 hours merely because the patient was unsettled, unstable or not capable of coming to a rational decision.  Many out-patients who have never been in a psychiatric hospital could fall into these loose categories.</P>
    <P>My amendment provides that a voluntary patient must give 24 hours' notice of his or her intention to discharge himself or herself.  If that patient does not satisfy the criteria for detention and if at the end of the 24-hour period he or she still wishes to leave the hospital the patient will be allowed to do so.  A number of very experienced practising consultants have informed us that they have never had any problem with voluntary patients discharging themselves from hospital.  Regarding the provision of the 24 hours initially I was inclined towards the view of having no provision for a voluntary patient, but in deference to the wishes of some members of the profession and recognising that there may in certain instances be a need &mdash; although they made it quite clear that it arises only very rarely &mdash; then by providing the 24 hours I feel that this will meet the requirements. I am sure, from discussions I had with the medical profession in this area, that they are quite happy with the 24-hour <Col N="1676" /> arrangement given our modern medical developments generally.  For that reason I believe that the 24-hour period will be adequate, and I would not support the amendment to bring back the 72 hours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sympathy with the Minister in relation to this Bill because I think that in his attempts on this section he is in a difficult dilemma.  I was not aware that he intended that there should be any 24, 48 or 72 hours' restriction on people coming in as voluntary patients. I would have preferred the original provision where there could be no restriction on anybody presenting himself or herself as a voluntary patient.  The Minister is right that one of the grand, very progressive developments in psychiatric services has been the remarkable increase in the number of people who are prepared to trust our psychiatrists and psychiatric hospitals and to believe that they may get some help if they go there in a period of emotional upset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister has conceded the right of retention for even 24 hours.  As I have said, I sympathise with him because it is the old business on this special question and on psychiatry as a whole, <i>quot homines, tot sententiae.</i> There is so much difference of opinion in psychiatry about the whole profession and the whole concept of psychiatry and between the diagnostic criteria of psychiatrists in the same hospitals, in different hospitals and in different countries.  It is a misconception to equate psychiatric disorders with ordinary medical diseases in some ways.  No doctor has any doubts about what is wrong if another doctor tells him that this man has pneumonia, this patient has measles, somebody else has cancer or a broken leg.  He has no difficulty in deciding what his colleague means, but that is not true of psychiatry. It is a very inexact profession.  This is notorious, and I am not going to detain the House in an attempt to demonstrate this wide discrepancy between one physciatrist's interpretation of psychiatric illness and another's but it does exist and is demonstrable.  However, as somebody who has had to deal with this business of the doubtful patient I accept completely <Col N="1677" /> Deputy Fitzpatrick's argument.  I am quite sure that what he said is true, and it is a dilemma of a psychiatrist that he very rarely gets through professional life without at least one suicide, and the possibility of even homicide has to be considered. It is a perfectly reasonable case for Deputy Fitzpatrick to make.</P>
    <P>We may go on from that to talk about hard cases making bad laws.  The advance towards the admission of the voluntary patient has meant that you get very marginally unhappy or disturbed patients coming for help and they may be coming to the hospital simply because they have had trouble in the home, a row in the job, a row with the girl friend, or have been on a alcoholic binge and want to lie up for 24 hours or whatever it may be.  In the hospitals we had built up a general feeling of the freedom of admission and the freedom of discharge, the sense that you would not be locked up.  In folk memory is the appalling attitude one had about mental hospitals having high walls, bars, people in uniforms.  I am not sure whether it was Deputy McEntee or Deputy Ryan who introduced legislation which at that time was a very enlightened advance, the idea of voluntary admission. Doctors who felt &mdash; I was one &mdash; that the individual quite frequently was the best judge of when he should come in or go out held the idea that once a person came in we could not deny that person the right to walk out again if he or she wanted to do so.  Is it not true that we have got to the stage of the open door, the walls and bars and the prison feeling have gone from most of the advanced hospitals? Therefore, I do not know how to enforce the idea if you want to keep somebody who came in voluntarily and does not wish to say.  You either have to stupefy the person, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, by knocking him out, a very distasteful thing to do, or lock him up, tell him that he may not go out, and if he insists on going out the poor psychiatric nurse has to force him to desist.  In practical terms this proposes an assault physically upon the patient &mdash; at least it can lead to that if the person wants to go out.  Secondly, surely it is depriving him of the very fundamental right of <i>habeas corpus,</i> the <Col N="1678" /> right of each of us unless we are committed before the courts to personal freedom. Nobody can wrongfully detain a person.  An individual who wants to go from one place to another has that right under the protection of the courts.  Therefore, when you decide to take this power of restricting the individual's right for 24 or 72 hours &mdash; or 172 hours &mdash; does not that arise?  If you take either the Minister's 24 hours or Deputy Fitzpatrick's 72 hours you are faced with somebody being told: &ldquo;I considered you and you are not fit to go.&rdquo;  You then have a continuing dilemma and you end up presumably putting somebody on a temporary form and keeping him against his will for any length of time, perhaps for years.  We all know there are people who have been in psychiatric hospitals for years.</P>
    <P>By doing this we are eroding a fundamental freedom and creating fear.  I would feel fear if I had to go into one of these hospitals.  The fear is: &ldquo;In some way or other they may misunderstand me and my psychiatric condition or mental condition. They may not know that there was a relatively trivial incident which I have possibly exaggerated.  I am now faced with spending the rest of my life there.&rdquo;  I know that is an exaggeration, and not likely to happen particularly under the protection given recently.  It is something which could enter into the thinking of somebody who was told suddenly: &ldquo;I am sorry, you cannot go.&rdquo;  If people want to go in on a voluntary basis they will know that there is the 24 hours or 72 hours provision.  They know they may be told: &ldquo;I am sorry.  You cannot go at the end of the 24 hours or the 72 hours.&rdquo;  That could be a deterrent to somebody going into the hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister has seen these institutions and I am sure Deputy Fitzpatrick knows such places.  I intend no disrespect to the staffs of these institutions.  They are marvellous dedicated people considering the conditions under which the nursing and the medical staff work. Somebody who comes from a different environment would be horrified at the conditions under which they were to be treated and incarcerated.  Under the law <Col N="1679" /> this may be done for 24 hours or 72 hours and the person may not like the place.  I recall being treated for tuberculosis.  I did not like the place and I walked out.  This implies no disrespect to the people in charge.  It was just a dreadful hospital physically.</P>
    <P>We are making a judgement about somebody and making him very unhappy.  At the end of the row between the staff and the individual who goes in voluntarily we have a very disturbed person, a very angry person, a very uncooperative person.  I should not care to have the job of trying to pacify such a person. The Minister was told by most consultants that you very rarely have trouble with somebody you want to keep in, but there is difficulty in trying to encourage some people to stay in the slum-like conditions of many of our hospitals.  It is not irrational behaviour on the part of the person trying to leave.  It is perfectly reasonable behaviour.  You are then behaving irrationally as a member of the staff by asking a man or woman to get into a bed in some ward which has primitive toilet, sanitary and washing facilities.</P>
    <P>It would be much wiser for the Minister to allow the matter to rest.  I suppose he is not likely to do that.  It is a difficult decision for him.  It was unwise of the people who advised him to look for this authority, this power.  I always disapproved strongly of the power I had as a psychiatrist to detain people, to deprive individuals of their freedom for weeks, months and years.  Deputy Fitzpatrick knows the enormous difficulty there is the whole way from the District Court to the High Court and the Supreme Court and the various appeal courts in depriving an individual of his freedom for 24 hours. We remember the row we had about the Offences Against the State Acts.  This question of personal freedom should not be treated lightly.  The deprivation of individual freedom should not be treated lightly and should not be entrusted to anybody unless there are considerable protections such as we have in the courts system.  Not only have we a series of appeals to the higher courts, we also have <Col N="1680" /> the defence of the barristers and solicitors making our case.</P>
    <P>I have always been very surprised that we are chosen to make these decisions as if we were infallible in some way.  In relation to psychiatry we certainly are not infallible.  It is as if we were unlike judges and lawyers and would not or could not make mistakes.  Of course we can make mistakes.  Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned the possibility of homicide or suicide.  He is quite right.  This can happen, but it could happen to two people sitting in the Burlington.  Somebody could go out and commit homicide apart from the obvious example of a drunken person killing someone with a motor car.  Somebody could jump in a river and commit suicide. This type of thing creates a real dilemma for an individual psychiatrist.  If somebody comes to him and says he is going out to murder his wife he cannot take that lightly.  People who say they never had any real difficulty with this issue are not correct.  There are ways in which you can persuade people.</P>
    <P>It takes courage to go into a mental hospital.  There is the whole hinterland of folk horror of mental hospitals.  We all have it.  We could be accused of betraying a trust.  There are people who will not got near a psychiatric hospital because of misplaced excessive fear.  If the fear is there, it is there and you have to recognise it.  I do not think the period should be extended to 72 hours.  My difficulty is that I do not think a period of 24 hours is much better than 72 hours.</P>
    <P>A very serious and important principle is involved in the question of the detention of a person by somebody like a psychiatrist without some of the very complicated paraphernalia we have in the courts and which I am sure Deputy Fitzpatrick would defend most vehemently. There are all the protections including advocates like himself to protect you against arbitrary detention.  This is what we are doing when we give any individual the right to tell a fellow citizen &ldquo;I am going to arrest you and keep you in detention for a specified period because in my judgment you are not fit to be out among your fellow citizens&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I have listened to Deputy Browne's contribution with great interest and respect. Deputy Browne is an authority on this sort of thing and we must have regard to what he says.  The Deputy has been fair and has put it on the record that he belongs to the section of the profession who have always held that there should not be a restriction on the liberty of people and that psychiatric patients should have the minimum restrictions possible imposed on them.  A word that crept into Deputy Browne's contribution frequently was &ldquo;dilemma&rdquo;. The Deputy spoke about the dilemma in which the Minister finds himself, and in which the consultants find themselves when having to decide on matters like this.  In the early part of his contribution the Deputy said that unlike a cold or the flu where a GP can say to the consultant that the patient is suffering from a specific ailment one cannot do that in relation to a psychiatric illness where one is dealing with an uncertain condition, a condition which is hard to diagnose or to isolate. The Deputy said that all these dilemmas present themselves to people who are treating mental patients and to people like the Minister who have to come to a decision as to whether to give the right to discharge themselves without notice to a voluntary patient as Deputy Browne would wish.  Deputy Browne feels that if a person goes into a psychiatric institution as a mentally ill person he should be at liberty to walk out of that institution at any time.  The Deputy also concedes that there is the risk of either suicide or murder but says that it is rare.  However, that danger is there and there is a danger to property and to people.  At best we have doctors differing here.  I have the report from the Association of Psychiatrists which was sent to the Minister, and as a body representing psychiatrists they suggest that the advisable thing to do is to impose a 72 hours notice obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is on record as saying that the consulting psychiatrists were reasonably happy with the Bill.  That means that they felt that 24 hours were better than none.  If I were Minister for Health faced <Col N="1682" /> with two sets of advice I would come down on the side of prudence, on the side of the safety of the individual and of the public.  Nobody likes going into hospitals or nursing homes, even the most luxurious ones.  We would prefer to stay at home.  The Minister speaks about normalising the treatment of mental illness and bringing it into line with ordinary illnesses.  However, one cannot normalise anything that is abnormal.  If a person is ill enough to be encouraged to go into a psychiatric institution for treatment he should at least be required to give 72 hours notice even if on the basis of &ldquo;as far as the medical officer saw fit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The effect of this in some cases will be to have reception orders made detaining people where they would otherwise not be retained.  I assume that psychiatrists are ordinary people who act in an ordinary way, and it is reasonable to assume that if after a week with a person in hospital the psychiatrist is requested to allow his discharge instantly as Deputy Browne would have it and as the Minister originally would have it or if he is faced with a request for a discharge on 24 hours notice where the patient will be asleep for eight or nine of those hours, he has any doubt about the wisdom of the discharge he will come down on the side of safety and will refuse the request.  If the psychiatrist has a doubt he will need some time to make up his mind and he will not let the person come out and take his place in the outside world.  The psychiatrist will see somebody else and advise that the person should be detained.  If the psychiatrist could have 72 hours notice it is quite possible that he would come to another conclusion and that he would not detain the patient.  It is on the cards that the end result of this will be to have more detention orders rather than fewer.</P>
    <P>The 72 hours notices have been enforced for I do not know how long and the medical profession are now split as to whether it should be 72 hours, 24 hours or no notice at all.  Just as the medical profession are split on it so must be the medical officers in charge.  It therefore falls to the Minister as the political head of the Department to exercise his balanced judgment, and he should come <Col N="1683" /> down on the side of more caution.  The Minister could include a provision to say that notice was not necessary if the doctor were perfectly satisfied that the person was only there because he had spent the night on the beer or something like that, but that the psychiatrist could detain a person for 72 hours for further observation if he felt it necessary.  That would be a sensible thing to do.  Just as the medical profession appear to be split on it &mdash; although the Association of Consultant Psychiatrists think 72 hours is necessary &mdash; so must the medical people in charge of psychiatric institutions be split on it. Those who think casually will make a detention order.  I do not want to be misunderstood, but I do not know how long or short a time the Minister will be where he is on that side of the House, but supposing someone is let march out of an institution and then does something which has consequences similar to the Stardust tragedy we will have people marching in here demanding inquiries and ready to roast the Minister.  They will want to know why this was tolerated. They will want to know why this loose method of letting unfortunate people not responsible for their conduct, people in institutions for their own safety and protection, march out of these institutions and cause desperate tragedies.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that his amendment provides the machinery for detention.  I do not think it does.  I maintain 24 hours is totally inadequate for a number of reasons. First of all, medical men are entitled to week-ends off.  The Minister says they must get a stand-in.  The person who will stand in will not be the patient's doctor, who has been treating him for a considerable length of time.  The stand-in will see him for the first time but he must let him out on 24 hours notice.  I listened with great respect and interest to Deputy Dr. Browne, and instead of convincing me that the right approach is to have no notice or a very short notice I believe the opposite is the case.  He spelled out as I could not spell out the difficulties facing those who have to make these decisions. We know that some medical people are <Col N="1684" /> slanted towards a very liberal and free approach.  Others err on the side of caution. What is required is a happy medium.  Some of those who are loudest in their cries for no restriction would be the very first to complain about not imposing restrictions should a liberal approach lead to disaster.  I make the case as clearly as I can.  The medical profession are split on this.  The association representing a most reputable body of psychiatrists is in favour of 72 hours notice and they regard the Minister's 24 hours notice merely as a move in the right direction. The Minister should err on the side of caution and accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick, speaking on subsection <Col N="1686" /> (2) at Committee Stage expressed some concern over the position of the spouse, brother, or sister of a mentally ill person who is not ordinarily resident with him.  The Deputy felt that such non-resident relatives would be unduly restricted in seeking a recommendation for reception under the subsection.  I would point out, however, that the nonresident spouse, brother or sister can apply for a recommendation for reception under the terms of section 15(2)(g), which covers the general case of direct application to a medical practitioner &ldquo;by any other person&rdquo;. A non-resident spouse, brother or sister could also, in practice, draw the attention of an authorised officer to the case of a mentally disturbed relative.</P>
    <P>However, I accept the general thrust of the criticism which the Deputy was making.  I propose, therefore, to amend section 15(2)(d) so as to indicate clearly that any spouse, brother or sister, whether resident or non-resident with the patient, may request an authorised officer to apply for a recommendation for reception subject only to the brother or sister being over 18 years of age, as at subsection (2)(b).</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1687" /> In page 10, line 5, to delete &ldquo;arrange for&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;provide&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At Committee Stage I gave an undertaking to look at Deputy Boland's amendment which sought to clarify the terms of section 21(3) concerning the provision of escorts by members of the Garda Síochána at the request of the medical officer in charge.  I accept the principle involved in the Deputy's amendment.  I agree that it is preferable that subsection (3) should read &ldquo;The Garda Síochána shall, if so requested, provide the escort&rdquo; and I propose to amend the subsection accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The word &ldquo;provide&rdquo; is a better word than &ldquo;arrange for&rdquo;.  I also raised the point about the wording of this very short subsection, which reads:</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána shall, if so requested, arrange for the escort.</P>
      <P>The amendment will make this subsection read as follows:</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána shall, if so requested, provide the escort.</P>
      <P>That is probably an improvement.  The request must be made to somebody.  Perhaps it is another section where the request must be made to the Garda Síochána.  I pointed out that it would be much better to specify the officer of the Garda Síochána.  Sometimes it is a sergeant, an inspector or a superintendent. In this subsection we speak about the whole force, which is very indefinite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An onus should be put on somebody in the Force.  The Minister has not done that.  I have only the right to speak once on this amendment moved by the Minister. The Minister has the right to reply. Is he satisfied that this subsection is properly drafted to identify the member of the Garda Síochána who shall provide the escort?  I am sure it would be the superintendent of the district in which the patient has been resident at the time of being brought to hospital.  The term <Col N="1688" /> Garda Síochána is much too wide and indefinite.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The point concerning the provisional access to the Garda Síochána is to the general body rather than to any designated officer, such as the superintendent, in cases where the medical officer in charge of a psychiatric centre is seeking a Garda escort.  This is the point which the Deputy is raising.  There are two points to be made.  I understand that the reference to the Garda Síochána in a collective, non-specific sense is quite in order from the legal standpoint.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick is quite correct in pointing out that this format is a little unusual.  Often access to the Force in legislation is provided for by specific reference to a particular rank, for example, the superintendent of the district where the psychiatric centre is situated in the context of this Bill.  Such particularity, however, is unnecessary and in the specific context of this section is undesirable.</P>
      <P>I should point out that such particularity would not be very practical, given the circumstances which may arise in some cases of mental illness.  We are, in effect, talking about a form of crisis intervention when the Garda escort may well be required, as a matter of urgency, to convey a very disturbed patient from an outlying and remote area to a psychiatric hospital in an urban centre.  Experience has shown that contact with the Garda is established at the local level.  In such cases it is a reasonable procedure, and hence I do not see any advantage in altering the section in this respect.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I know I am not entitled to speak again, but I should like to say that the Minister may not be aware that if the local superintendent was made responsible there would be a much better chance of getting an escort than applying to a barracks that is closed up for the weekend with one or two gardaí there and a notice on the door asking people to call somewhere else.  We find that the remote Garda stations are more often unmanned than manned.  If a superintendent was <Col N="1689" /> responsible he could telephone somebody to do the job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 11, lines 7 and 8, to delete &ldquo;the person and the applicant for the recommendation for reception of the person&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the person, the applicant for the recommendation for reception and the registered medical practitioners or practitioner who signed the recommendation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland's amendment to this section on Committee sought to include the two registered medical practitioners who signed the original recommendation for reception and the nearest living relative of the patient among those who are to be informed when a reception order or an extension order is made.  I accept Deputy Boland's view in so far as the two doctors are concerned.  However, I cannot accept the inclusion of &ldquo;nearest living relative&rdquo; for a number of reasons.</P>
      <P>The section as drafted already provides that the patient and the applicant for the recommendation for reception shall be informed of the making of a reception order or an extension order.  The applicant for the recommendation for reception will, in the vast majority of cases, be a close relative of the person, drawn from the categories given at section 15(2). Indeed, the applicant will often be the nearest living relative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only real situation where a nearest living relative would not necessarily be aware of the detention of a patient arises where this relative is living abroad.  In <Col N="1690" /> such a case, however, it may well prove very difficult to trace the nearest living relative, particularly if he or she has been resident abroad for a number of years and has moved from place to place, as is often the case.</P>
    <P>The patient's rights are nevertheless fully guarded in such a situation, given the possibility of application to the review board by the patient or by others acting on his behalf, and there are also the safeguards provided by automatic review of detention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the retention of trained personnel in the Defence Forces is kept under constant review.  As the Deputy is aware, I have recently introduced significant improvements in conditions including increases in the gratuity payable and the special leave allowance granted to personnel extending their services.  The allowances payable for duties of a security nature have been substantially increased and in particular the rate of allowance for security duties performed on Sundays and on army holidays has <Col N="1691" /> been greatly enhanced.  I have also under consideration further measures aimed at retaining the services of technical personnel.</P>
      <P>Additionally I have recently provided special staffs in each Command whose functions include the study of wastage and man management problems.  These staffs will be in a position to deal with personnel problems in a more specialised and individual way than was hitherto possible.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these improvements will have the desired effect of inducing more trained personnel to extend their service in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The detailed information sought by the Deputy in regard to specific provisions in the Estimates for 1981 can more appropriatedly be dealt with when the Estimates for my Department come before the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated annual cost of servicing the national debt outstanding at 31 December 1980 is £882 million.  The national debt in currencies other than <Col N="1699" /> Irish pounds at the same date was approximately £2,200 million using current exchange rates.  Exchange rate movements from the date of borrowing account for approximately £18 million of the annual interest cost.</P>
    <P>The external debt in currencies other than the pound sterling at 31 December 1980 was approximately £2,156 million using current exchange rates.  The estimated cost in 1981 of servicing this amount is £215 million.  In addition, external debt in the form of holdings by non-residents of Government securities denominated in Irish pounds amounted to approximately £445 million at 31 December 1980 and the estimated cost of servicing this in 1981 is £46 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not admit the truth, that is, that the national debt has more than doubled in the last four years, in other words, this Government borrowed more in four years than was borrowed the previous 55 years, from 1922 to 1977?  Will he not admit he is putting the country in pawn and that our children's children will be paying for the money Fianna Fáil borrowed in the past four years?</P>

      <P>It has not been doubled but obviously Deputy L'Estrange is pursuing the same line as his leader who believes that when he goes abroad he should make damning statements about our economy.  I want to tell those gentlemen of doom and gloom what this Government's policy has been, and will continue to be.  During the last two days on the economic debate in which Deputy FitzGerald did not take part &mdash; despite the tact that he is now making so much <Col N="1700" /> noise &mdash; I explained our policy to this House.  The position is that this year alone we have borrowed for productive investment purposes to improve our infrastructure.  If mistakes were made in the past they were made during periods when such investment did not take place. We need improved infrastructure because it will give us increased activity and will give us a better chance of coming out of the world recession in a better condition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he adhered to Fianna Fáil policy.  Has he read his action for national destruction document, the Fianna Fáil manifesto, which said that the Government were to borrow 10½ per cent of the gross national product in 1979 and 8 per cent in 1980? Now the Minister says he is adhering to this policy.  Is he not prepared to admit that in 1979 he borrowed up to 14 per cent of GNP and in 1980 close to 14 per cent?  If he continues as he has done in the past, it is estimated that he will borrow at least 16 per cent of GNP&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Will there be any significant difference in the type of <Col N="1707" /> projects which will be aided to those aided by a previous similar fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Deputy is aware from newspapers reports of the employers' decision not to contribute to the current fund.  This was conveyed to the Government but, as the Deputy knows, we are still considering this.  The Government are committed to aiding vulnerable industries.  All I can say to the Deputy is that I am still hopeful there will be a contribution to the fund.</P>
      <P>With regard to the operation of the fund, I should like to tell the Deputy that the outgoing fund was operated by the tri-partite committee representative of the employers, trade unions and the Government. If the funding is merely Government I anticipate that there will be a change in how it operates.  If there is a contribution forthcoming from other sources, obviously it will affect how it is operated.  A decision has not been taken yet as to how the money will be spent but the Deputy can accept that it will be preferably devoted to productive purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is serious concern for the vulnerable industries.  In our first budget we aided for the first time those vulnerable industries.  We had some difficulties last year with Brussels and eventually we got an acceptable scheme, which terminated on 31 October. We are still anxious to introduce this scheme and are committed to doing so. We want to help those industries, and that is why I believe progress has been good.  I am hopeful we can aid such industries. That is mainly why there has been a delay in announcing a final decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requirements of State agencies was the subject of a consultancy inquiry in 1976 and was reported on by the National Prices Commission in May 1976.  The recommendations included a proposal that certain forms used by the Revenue Commissioners should be examined with a view to their being redesigned.  The Department of the Public Service, having consulted with Departments, also advised all Departments and offices that forms which are issued to the public should be as simple and straightforward as possible without sacrificing essential information requirements.</P>
      <P>The redesigning of existing tax forms and the content of new forms have been looked at the Revenue Commissioners in this context.  In pursuance of the simplification proposals a new VAT return form was introduced in March 1979 which for most traders reduced the number of items which might be required to be entered; at the same time a new simpler combined purchases and sales account book for traders was introduced to replace the former separate purchases and sales books.  A simpler return form on a single page for use by certain employees in the PAYE sector is being prepared, and should be available later this year.</P>

The prime commercial lending rate in the period from the end of April to the end of June 1980 was 18 per cent.  From the end of October to date it is 14 per cent.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 22 to 26, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1717" /> The increase in consumer prices between May 1980 and February 1981 has been largely the result, directly or indirectly, of external developments outside our control, notably increased oil prices and the appreciation of certain major trading currencies.</P>
    <P>Because the 1980 budget was later than usual, the increase in the consumer price index in the 12 month period to mid-February 1981 was artificially inflated by the effects of indirect taxation increases in that budget as well as in the 1981 budget.  This distortion will not be reflected in the year-on-year increases in subsequent quarters.  It is estimated that the 1980 and 1981 budgets added 3.8 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively to the consumer price index.  As the figures indicate, the contribution of the 1981 budget was 1.5 per cent less than that of the 1980 budget.</P>
    <P>I anticipate that the rate of inflation will lessen later in the year, despite the likely effect on food prices of the recent decision of the Agriculture Ministers in Brussels.  The decision is expected to add 1¼ percentage points to the CPI over a 12 month period.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the imposition of the increased indirect taxes was necessary to pay for the substantial improvements in direct tax allowances, social welfare benefits and other concessions introduced in both the 1980 and 1981 budgets, and which the Government felt should not be met by increased borrowing. Furthermore, I should point out that the indirect taxes bore mainly on discretionary and less essential items of consumer expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Government continue to adhere to a firm anti-inflationary policy.  Price control has been used to ensure that the impact of these developments on prices is no more than is warranted.  Government appeals for pay moderation have been designed to avoid an inflationary spiral in which earnings rise in response to unavoidable externally generated price increases leading in turn to further rises in prices here.  We have also supported the anti-inflationary stance of EEC economic policy while of course <Col N="1718" /> stressing the need to sustain output and employment.  The reduction of inflation is one of the central aims of the Government's medium-term plans now in preparation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that increases in basic foodstuffs such as butter, eggs, cheese and milk arising out of the recent decisions by Agriculture Ministers will have a very great impact on the living standards of the medium to underpaid sections of our community?  Does the Minister agree that the case should be examined in relation to subsidising a selection of foodstuffs? While one applauds the possibility of an increase in farmers' incomes does the Minister agree that the living standards of people on low incomes should be protected?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be correct in interpreting the Minister's answer as claiming that the exceptional increase in the CPI in the last year is primarily due to factors external to our economy? Could I further ask if he is aware that the two items in the CPI showing the largest increase were tobacco and alcoholic drinks, both of which bore substantial tax by the Government in the budget, whereas the increase in fuel, for instance, shows a lesser rate of increase?  Would the Minister agree that the actual breakdown in the CPI tends completely to invalidate his contention and, in turn, validate the contention that it is the Government's budgetary strategy, in particular with regard to indirect taxation which has led to the large increase in the CPI?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not agree with the Deputy that what he has said about the percentage increase is correct. I have said already that in this particular year ended mid-February there was the <Col N="1720" /> unusual situation of two budgets during that period.  Both budgets added to indirect taxation.  I explained very clearly during my budget statement and in the past two days in the economic debate that as a Government we believed that in the interests of social welfare recipients this was the area where we should get increased taxation in order to meet the needs of that important sector in our society.  Is the Deputy suggesting we should have opted for direct taxation?  As a Government we did not believe we should do that.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's answer to five questions taken together in which he laid stress on the importance of wage moderation in the context of controlling inflation, will the Minister not agree that his own Government have given a very poor example in this matter? On the one hand, they conceded increases in the public sector that were beyond even what an arbitration board had recommended while, on the other hand, they are led by a man who twisted the arms of employers into accepting a grossly extravagant national understanding and which was recognised as such by the independent commentators the Minister was talking about recently.</P>

The settlement of the pay element of the national understanding is for the Employer-Labour Conference, directly between the employers and trade unions, with the Government involved as employers only.

In reply to a parliamentary question some time ago, I was told it was estimated that in June 1977, when we left office, the figure was £3,700 million.  In view of the figure of £4,200 million given by the Minister today, will he not agree that he deliberately misled this House when he told us the figure had not doubled?  Further, will the Minister not admit that earlier he told us that the money borrowed was used for increased production but in the past five minutes he has told us that during the past three years a sum of £1,466 million was used to balance Fianna Fáil budgets?</P>

      <P>Deputy Boland's amendment to this section on Committee Stage sought to include two registered medical practitioners who signed the original recommendation for reception and the nearest living relative of the patient.  As I was saying before the adjournment, I am prepared to accept the proposal in so far as the two doctors are concerned but not in relation to the nearest living relative.</P>
      <P>There are two other aspects to this: Deputy Boland's amendment presupposes that the patient would approve of the nearest relative being informed by the authorities on the making of a reception order or an extension order.  This need not always be so.  Finally, in those cases where a self-evident nearest living relative is not ready to hand there would probably be quite some difficulty in determining exactly who the nearest living relative is and this would in some cases give rise to intra-familial disputes without achieving anything very positive as regards the situation of the patient.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 11 is a technical amendment.  The use of the word &ldquo;his&rdquo; is somewhat confusing in the context of subsection (4).  The term &ldquo;the right of review&rdquo; is more concise.</P>

The Minister's amendment goes some of the way to meet Deputy Boland's objection to the section as it stands by adding &ldquo;the registered medical practitioners or practitioner who signed the recommendation order,&rdquo; but it is not going as far as Deputy Boland would wish.  I will leave it to Deputy Boland to make his own case in respect of the shortcomings of the section, but when I was reading section 24 (4) I could not help noticing that it is not proposed, as far as I can see, to make it a criminal offence for the medical practioner not to notify the people concerned and no penalties are provided.  I suppose we should be grateful for that.  There is not a lot of difference between that and the other section.  It is very important that relatives of mentally ill people should know where they are being detained, especially if they are being changed about from one place to another, and that is the object of the section as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, the amendment is on foot of an undertaking given by the Minister during Committee Stage arising from an amendment of mine.  I felt that, after examination by an authorised medical practitioner of the person following his reception and detention in the psychiatric centre &mdash; in other words, examination by a consultant psychiatrist &mdash; then if it is felt necessary to compulsorily detain the person not only should the person and the applicant who initiated the entire process be notified, but, in fairness to both the ordinary family doctors involved, and indeed in fairness to the patient himself who is now to be detained and become an involuntary patient within the hospital, the general practitioner should be notified.  Therefore, if it is decided that a person is to be, to put in crude terms, locked up in a mental hospital for the sake of being treated, the doctors who signed the original recommendation which started the process which sent that person to the hospital for examination and decision as to whether he should be detained should be notified <Col N="1833" /> so that they would realise that this was the outcome of the process they had started, not only on their own behalf but on behalf of the patient as well.  In that way the doctors would always be aware that the patient had been detained in that psychiatric centre or hospital.</P>
      <P>We must face the fact that in very many instances still we have a small local family community with small townships and villages, the everyday life of which the general practitioner is very much a part &mdash; and long may it be so.  It is fair to say that very many of the GPs in local towns and villages throughout Ireland would have a personal as well as a professional interest in the welfare of patients in respect of whom they had &mdash; distastefully, I imagine, in most cases&mdash; to sign recommendations for reception orders to send them to centres to be involuntarily detained there.  These doctors would be anxious to keep an eye afterwards on how the patient was progressing and no how the treatment was succeeding and to know whether the person was still detained within the hospital.  That was the reason for my amendment on Committee Stage. It sought to have what the Minister now has included, but it also sought to inform the nearest living relative of the person who was being detained.</P>
      <P>The reason is that, while the applicant for the recommendation is in most cases a relation of the patient, under the terms of section 15 the applicant is not necessarily a relation of the patient.  For instance, the applicant can be a member of the Garda Síochána or, in certain cases, other people, possibly officers of the health board.  Again in the interests of and for the protection of the patient &mdash; the individual who is now to have his rights to freedom, in his own interests, removed from him &mdash; I felt it was important that his nearest relation should also be informed so that that relation could take an interest in the welfare of the patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to say that when I was drafting amendments on this Bill originally I studied the equivalent legislation in Britain, which the Minister spoke so disparagingly and incorrectly about in the course <Col N="1834" /> of earlier contributions here.  That legislation goes to some lengths to appoint people, usually relations of the patient, to take the legal responsibility of looking after the detained person's affairs and the interests of that person for so long as he is compulsorily detained in a psychiatric hospital, home or institution.  That concept enshrined in the British legislation which makes the relations in the main responsible &mdash; and responsible to the courts, to a legal system &mdash; for ensuring that the best possible treatment and care is being given to the detained person, is a good idea.  This Bill is lacking in not going as far as that in providing safeguards on behalf of a compulsorily detained patient.  That was the reason I suggested that not only should the people originally provided for in the Bill be notified but so also should the local GPs who signed the original documents and also the nearest living relative of the patient.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has seen fit to exclude the nearest living relation. The excuse he gave on Committee Stage was that it might not always be possible to notify a relation in certain cases where one had perhaps elderly people living alone in rural areas and it might not be easy to identify who their nearest relation was.  But, of course, that could have been surmounted by those all-embracing draftsmen, who, I presume, would have been able to devise a phrase that would have covered the situation where the nearest relation was not readily identifiable.</P>
    <P>But I am now taken aback at the Minister accepting the principle of what I have said in relation to notifying the doctors when a person is being detained on a permanent or on a medium or long-term basis in a psychiatric institution but he has not &mdash; it does not appear in the rest of the list of amendments &mdash; accepted the principle that these same GPs and the person who originally initiated the process, the applicant, should be notified when a person is discharged.  The Bill merely provides that when the medical officer in charge of the centre decides that a person has been adequately treated <Col N="1835" /> and is fit to be returned to the community, he may discharge him.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the sort of example Deputy Fitzpatrick gave this morning, on the basis, as he said, of his experience in the legal field, ought to have been a warning to us.  It is unfortunately true that people who have been committed for psychiatric treatment do sometimes harbour a resentment against those who initiated the process and, quite conceivably, against people they suspect of having initiated the process.  We could well have a situation where now the applicant, let us say a concerned neighbour in a small community, and the registered medical practitioner, the local doctor in a small community, and the doctor in the next adjoining village, had signed these orders and had been notified that the person was committed and was being detained involuntarily for treatment at the hospital.  All of a sudden the person having successfully, as far as the medical staff of the hospital is concerned, completed the course of treatment is discharged, and the applicant who first took the very serious step of asking the doctor to sign a recommendation to have the person referred to a psychiatric centre for assessment is not notified that the person has been discharged and is coming back into the community.  The doctor who, after careful medical consideration, decided to sign that recommendation, is not notified and neither is his colleague, the doctor whose signature will in virtually all cases be necessary in order for the process to be initiated.  None of them will realise that, all of a sudden, the person has been discharged and is back in the community.</P>
    <P>Again, in the interests of the patient, lest the doctors and the applicant react badly and perhaps panic to some extent or contact the Garda and set up unnecessary searches and a flurry if a discharged patient suddenly arrives back into the local community without notification, that procedure should have been catered for as well.  But, more important, so that a GP and an applicant would be aware that a patient who had been <Col N="1836" /> detained against his will and held in a psychiatric hospital for treatment in his own best interests because of the action of an applicant and because of the action of those two GPs in the community had been discharged and, in the interests of safety, and to deal with the sort of case I am speaking of where a patient may still have a secret resentment, those people should be notified that the patient is being discharged and allowed to return to the community.  I would have thought that that would be a reasonable provision to have included.</P>
    <P>The Minister when speaking on Committee Stage said that he accepted the principle of my amendment and I naively assumed that the Minister meant he would enshrine that principle of notifying the applicant and the GP's right through this section &mdash; that not only would they be notified when the person is to be locked up for treatment, but when the person is either boarded out in the community or discharged and regarded as being fit to play a full role within the community again.</P>
    <P>Everyone will agree with people being boarded out, but this may raise a question. There is a situation where a reception order has been made and signed, the effect of which legally means that the person is to be, and can be forcibly if needs be, detained in a psychiatric hospital. It is then decided, as part of the therapeutic process to try to bring that person back to full mental health, that he should be allowed to live out in the community, and usually what happens is that the patient takes on a part-time or light job and attends the hospital or outpatient clinic for treatment as part of the process of gradually encouraging him to take a full part again in the community.</P>
    <P>What will the situation be if the doctor in the hospital decides that it is a good idea that patient X should be boarded out and take part in this process and nobody has notified the applicant or the GPs who initiated the process which put the patient into the hospital in the first place?  There is a reception order in the hospital which, as far as they are concerned, means that he is legally detained there.  They come to Dublin from, for <Col N="1837" /> example, Cavan, are walking down O'Connell Street and meet this person for whom they signed a reception order two or three years earlier.  That is likely to cause a situation which may lead to panic, unnecessary involvement of the Garda, unnecessary embarrassment for the patient concerned who is engaged in this rehabilitation process, unnecessary anxiety for the applicant or doctor who puts this procedure into operation.  The Minister did appear to accept the principle of my amendment on Committee Stage and has sought to enshrine it in his amendment No. 10.  I am, however, more than disappointed that he appears to have left it out of the remainder of the sections. Is he now worsening the problem rather than improving it?</P>
    <P>Under the original Bill the local doctors were not going to be informed at all. After they signed this reception order, the person could be deported to Outer Mongolia without their being informed. I wanted them to be informed at all stages of what was happening to that patient during the course of his being detained, or being boarded out, or being allowed back into the community.  The Minister agrees that they be informed when he is detained but not when he is being let out. I appeal to him to consider the introduction into the other sections of Part III of similar clauses regarding the notification of GPs and applicants.  That same principle should be enshrined in section 32 regarding discharge.  These people should also be notified of the transfer of a patient.  This applies to section 29 in relation to the transferring of patients who are detained compulsorily in psychiatric centres.  If a person is being transferred from one centre to another, the doctors and the applicants &mdash; all the people out in the community who initiated the process and who should feel a moral responsibility for the patient &mdash; should be legally notified at all stages of what is happening to the patient.  That was the purpose of my amendment.  It has, to a small extent, been followed in this amendment but almost equally it is being defeated or negatived if the same principle is not enshrined in the other relevant sections of Part III of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1838" /> I realise that we are now on Fourth Stage.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick said earlier, suddenly this Bill, which has been kicking around the Department for the past three years and was unsuccessfully with the Minister's predecessor for over a year, is now being taken at a gallop through the House on the last day of the session.  I appeal to the Minister to consider carefully my suggestion in relation to enshrining that principle in the other relevant sections of this Part of the Bill and to consider introducing amendments to give effect to that in the Seanad or, indeed, if he would agree, to move them verbally. The form of wording would possibly be the same as the form of wording in his amendment No. 10.  I feel quite sure that the House would agree to accept them.</P>

      <P>On the question of informing the relatives, as I said on Committee Stage, if these relatives are interested in the patient they will know what is happening in relation to any extension order being applied for.  In effect quite possibly in a fair number of instances it would place a special burden on the administrators to find the nearest living relative.  In any event, I have opted for the two doctors who signed originally.  I have met the two points raised by the Opposition Deputies on that aspect.  We have two fairly certain people to contact in the two GPs who signed and I am including that amendment to meet the question raised by the Deputies in relation to discharge, which this section is not about.  If a person is cured, is given the all-clear by the people who are medically experienced and medically proficient in that area, he should be discharged as any other patient is discharged, without necessarily putting notices in the paper or anything else of the fact that he is coming out.  That is the type of thing which we, in fact, want to get away from.  I have gone some of the way to meet the requests of the Deputies and that is reasonable.  Trying to find the nearest living relative should not be necessary.</P>

The amendment means that section 33 (4) will now read:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Section 33 is the first section of Part IV of the Bill which deals with safeguarding the patient.  It provides for the giving of information as to persons detained.  At first sight it seems to be a very wide section because it says: &ldquo;Any person may apply to a health board for information as to whether a particular person is detained in a special or district psychiatric centre in the functional area of the health board and, if he is so detained, as to the name and address of the centre and the name of the medical officer in charge of it.&rdquo;  That seems very wide.  Subsection (2) says that any person may apply to the medical officer in charge of a district, special or registered psychiatric centre for information as to whether a particular person is detained there, a <Col N="1840" /> copy of the reception order under which a particular person is detained, the name of the applicant for a recommendation for the reception of a particular person and the name of any registered medical practitioner who made a recommendation in relation to that person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I appreciate that.  The section provides that a person may apply as to the whereabouts of a person and in subsection (2) may seek more detailed information, but subsection (3) takes away the right of any person to the information sought because it says that the application under this section shall be in writing and shall be granted if the health board or the medical officer, as the case may be, is satisfied that the application is made in good faith in the interest of the person in respect of whom it is made and that it would be in accord with that person's interest to grant it.  No person is given a right to the information.  It is a pity that some limited number of people were not given the right at least to the information set out in the first subsection which is really basic information as it is only to know if the patient is detained in a specific place and if so what is the name of the medical officer in charge.  As it stands, the section is therefore useless.  I agree that it is provided that the person may apply to the Circuit Court against a refusal to give the information.  That is what we are coming to now because in subsection (4) it says that where the application is refused the health board or medical officer shall so inform the applicant. That is as the subsection stands at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister amended subsection (3) to provide that the application should be in writing.  I pointed out on Committee Stage that if the application was to be in writing and if there was to be an appeal to the Circuit Court, then the refusal should be in writing so that there could be no doubt that the applicant had applied for the information and that it had been refused.  The Minister has met <Col N="1841" /> the single point by providing that where the application is refused the health board or medical officer shall so inform the applicant and it is provided that that decision shall be conveyed in writing. That is an improvement but I think the section as it stands is so devoid of any specific rights that it is not much use at all.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the point Deputy Fitzpatrick is making regarding the minor way in which the amendment has contributed towards meeting his case. At least the amendment now gives the applicant a decision in writing and he will know exactly the decision and the reasons for it.  That is a good principle generally and it is in the interests of democracy.  If rules are established and if a person applies under those rules and for some reason is refused, the reason for refusal should be given in writing.  The Minister appears to accept that principle.  It is important that decisions generally should be given in writing to a person who makes a <i>bona fide</i> application within an existing framework.  For instance, in this House if a Deputy applies under Standing Orders to have something take place such a Deputy should be given a decision in writing as to whether the application is granted or refused.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, the purpose of this amendment, as the Minister has explained, is to give to a person who applies for information about somebody who is detained compulsorily in a psychiatric institution the right to be notified in writing if the information is to be refused. When Deputy Fitzpatrick called for a quorum, I was saying that that right was very important and is one which should be enshrined in all aspects of our public life.  I say this because I consider it very important that if somebody who has a right under law or under the provisions of standing orders of a public body or anything else applies to exercise that right and is refused his privilege of doing so, he should be given in writing an explanation for the refusal.  It is disgraceful and intolerable that a person would not be given in writing the reasons for a refusal if he appeared to have the right and the privilege of raising certain matters in the public interest or, as in the case we are dealing with here, in the interest of a detained person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be intolerable if the person who sought that information were to be thwarted in those attempts, were to be peremptorily told by the body or person who defeated his attempt to elicit that information that they were refusing to commit to writing the reasons they were blocking the dissemination of this public information.  I was explaining that it was for these reasons I was so adamantly in favour of the Minister's amendment, that I felt the example being given by the Minister could well be emulated by many of his colleagues and by other office holders in relation to committing to writing <Col N="1846" /> decisions they take and which might be of interest to the public, or indeed decisions about which information is the entitlement of the applicant.</P>
    <P>I was making the point that in certain instances in Irish life now apparently it still applies that people can make application for information it would appear they are entitled to receive information they appear to be conferred with the entitlement to seek, and that they will be refused that information, or the opportunity to seek it, and that they will not be given the reasons they are refused, that there will be an outright refusal to commit the decision to writing.  That is wholly regrettable and constitutes an intolerable situation.  For that reason it is important that the Minister should confer on a person in this situation the opportunity to have those decisions given to him in writing. I wonder whether the Minister can in any way bring his influence to bear on his colleagues in the Cabinet, for instance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I had almost come to the end of the section.  I was on subsection (3) which provides:</P>
      <P>An application under this section shall be in writing and shall be granted if the health board or the medical officer, as the case may be, is satisfied that the application is made in good faith in the interest of the person in respect of whom it is made and that it would be in accord with that person's interest to grant it.</P>
      <P>We now come to the relevance of the Minister's amendment to subsection (4) which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1850" /> Where the application is refused the health board or medical officer shall so inform the applicant.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment would have the effect of adding on &ldquo;in writing&rdquo; and the subsection would then read:</P>
    <P>Where the application is refused the health board or medical officer shall so inform the applicant in writing.</P>
    <P>That is why I wanted to explain the provisions in the earlier subsection to section 33.  I wanted people to understand the important principle enshrined in the Minister's amendment.  Section 33 was included in this Bill on foot of a number of requests from different organisations and interests involved in the psychiatric field, and interests on behalf of the patients, and some of the medical interests involved.  They felt it was right that, if a person had a genuine interest in obtaining information as to how a patient was getting on, how his treatment was succeeding, what his general physical well-being was, and how well he was being caeered for within a psychiatric institution, if he was being detained there compulsorily, he should have the right under section 33 to apply to the health board for that information.</P>
    <P>Objections were raised by other equally interested people who made the case that it could cause extreme embarrassment to a detained patient if a person went to a health board and asked for such information for irresponsible or frivolous reasons.  They could then publish that information and broadcast it to the community. A prominent member of the community who was overindulging in the use of alcohol or drugs might get himself into such a state that it was necessary for him to receive treatment in connection with his over-drinking or misuse of drugs. If he was not prepared to accept treatment voluntarily the suggestion was that he might have to be detained as an involuntary patient.</P>
    <P>This person could be a Member of the Dáil or the head of a large firm employing a number of people.  He might be detained in a hospital and receiving treatment for being in the DTs or the horrors. <Col N="1851" /> If that information were disseminated to somebody who had malice towards the patient it could be used to the detriment of the detained patient.  Therefore, the right of the health board to refuse to give that information was also considered to be important.  That is why subsection (4) allows the health board or the medical officer in a district psychiatric centre to refuse to give information to an applicant.</P>
    <P>The thinking behind this was that they would refuse only if they felt the applicant was acting irresponsibly, or frivolously, or with malice.  If the main competitor of the head of a large firm employing a number of people applied to a health board or a psychiatric institution for information on the state of health and general wellbeing of that person, the health board should look askance at the idea of giving that information to a person who was well known and easily identifiable as the main business competitor of the unfortunate patient who was being detained.  As I understood it &mdash; and I think I am right in saying this &mdash; that was the reason why subsection (4) was included in section 33.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it was represented by people who were anxious to see information being made available to people with a genuine interest in a patient that, if the information was not made readily available to a person who wanted to get it in the interests of the patient, that would also be deplorable.  The suggestion was made that, if an applicant who looked for information about a patient was refused by a health board or a medical officer, as the case might be in the particular circumstances, the refusal should be in writing.  That case was made by genuine interests outside the House. It was made by me in the Second Stage debate and I believe it was made in the course of the Committee Stage discussion as well.</P>
    <P>This principle was put forward by people with a genuine interest in seeing that where there was a refusal to give genuinely sought information it should be put into writing.  The Minister accepted the principle that the refusal is so important <Col N="1852" /> in the case of information which should be imparted on foot of section 33 that it should be committed to writing.  I accept that that is an important acceptance on the part of the Minister.  If people are to be denied information which they genuinely believe should be made available to them, the reason for that refusal should be committed to writing and given to the person concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The example I was giving was the case where Deputy Fitzpatrick, for instance, applied to a health board or to a medical officer in charge of a psychiatric centre for information about a patient.  If the health board decided that they would not give that information, on foot of the Minister's amendment they will be obliged to notify him in writing. That is a welcome improvement.  But will they merely have to say that they are in receipt of the application for information and have decided to refuse the request? If that is the only effect of the amendment it is pretty limited.  It will give Deputy Fitzpatrick a notification in writing that he has been refused and then under subsection <Col N="1854" /> (5) he can go to a judge of the Circuit Court with documentary evidence that he has been refused the information. In the notice of refusal will the reasons for the refusal be set out?  That is why earlier I was endeavouring to develop the sort of reservations that people would have about section 33.  A person with malice, for instance a competitor in business who knew that an unfortunate person was detained in a psychiatric centre&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has repeated that example on three or four occasions already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very good idea for a person to get a notification of the refusal of the information in writing but it is not such a good idea if the health board were to outline their reasons, if the health board were to say that the reason for the refusal was because they felt that the person was in such a distressed mental state that it would not be in his best interests to give detailed information about about him to the applicant.  In that instance that notice could be the sort of thing which a malicious applicant would be glad to have and he might use it not in the best interest of the detained patient. It is important that the Minister explain to the House whether the notice will merely contain a refusal of the request or whether it will give the grounds for the refusal.</P>
      <P>The corollary of that argument is that if the notice sets out the reasons for the refusal those reasons might be used not in the best interests of the patient.  On the other hand, if the notice only says that they are refusing information without giving the reasons it may create untold fears or apprehensions in the mind of the applicant and it may drive the applicant on to the process outlined in subsection (5) whereby he can apply to the judge of the Circuit Court and ask that the judge make an order directing the health board or the medical officer to furnish the information and the documents required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the documents one of them will be the reception order and in the reception order there will be the reason <Col N="1855" /> why the person had to be detained. The psychiatrist who signed the order would have said that the person had to be detained for whatever reason.  If a malicious person got hold of that reception order and was able to produce it to show that the person had been locked up in a psychiatric centre for whatever reason, it has been represented by people who have an interest in this area that that could be used against the patient and when the patient was coming back out in to the community he could discover that the rumours and the gossip about him had become so common place that it could badly affect the course of his business or his reputation and it could do irreversible damage to the extent that it might bring about a condition which would again oblige the person to avail of treatment in a psychiatric centre.  This entire section in relation to the dissemination of information about detained people is very sensitive and I appreciate that the Minister had a genuine interest in and an acknowledgement of the importance of giving a notice in writing when he introduced this amendment.</P>
    <P>It will be vitally important for the Minister to explain whether that notice will give details to the person who is refused as to why he is refused and not just baldly state that details have been refused thereby depriving the person who applies of documentary proof.  It is vitally important that that person should have documentary proof if he so desires to have such proof.  It would be helpful if the Minister would clarify that aspect.  I appreciate that if a person is refused information he has a right under section 32 to be given documentary evidence to show he has been refused.  Will the Minister explain the extent of the refusal notice?  That would be helpful.</P>

    <P>I have taken up Deputy Fitzpatrick's suggestion that the furnishing of various documents to a person detained in any psychiatric centre should be provided for on request of the patient during the period of detention, in addition to the initial mandatory furnishing of these documents on the making of the reception order.</P>
    <P>I have, however, added the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;. I think this allows a sensible balance.  It ensures that a patient who loses the documents originally given to him on his reception in the centre may obtain replacements at a later date.  It ensures also that the medical officer in charge is not placed in an impossible situation with a difficult patient who demands copies of the statutory documentation every week or indeed every day.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This amendment provides for the furnishing of documents to detained and discharged persons.  The section as originally drafted provided for the furnishing of certain documents to the detained person on his reception when an order had been made.  It also provided he could get certain documents within 12 months of his discharge.  That was all right as far as it went.  It did not provide that the detained person could get copies of documents during the currency of his detention. That was a weakness because he had a right to get such documents when he was admitted and it occured to me that at that point the unfortunate patient might not be in a position to appreciate such documents or, having got them he might lose them or destroy them.  I drew that point to the attention of the Minister and the Minister has provided in this amendment a sort of omnibus entitlement as follows:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 9 and 10. to insert:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;notes that the EEC Council of Ministers has reached decisions in regard to agricultural prices for 1981/82 and related measures;</P>
      <P>&mdash;expresses its satisfaction that the decisions represent an average increase of over 13% in Irish support prices and include a package of special measures for Ireland, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;welcomes the significant contribution which the Council's decisions and the measures already taken by the Government will make to improving farm income in Ireland and furthering the development of Irish agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture serves all our people, not just the farmers who depend on it for a living, but everyone in the country, particularly those working in the food industry and in <Col N="1860" /> the industries supplying the farmers' needs; also the consumers who expect a constant supply of high quality food at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>It is not always easy to reconcile the interests of these various groups but it is important that we recognise the common interest we all have in realising the full potential of Irish agriculture.  The achievement of a realistic rate of expansion in agriculture is not just a matter for the Government.  It is an objective of major significance to us all.  In the development of our economy in recent years, the farming sector has been an area of particular concern to the Government. The problems which farmers have had to face have been fully recognised by the Government and we have spared no efforts to find adequate solutions.</P>
    <P>There are three sources of possible help to farmers to raise their incomes and achieve real improvements in agricultural output.  Each of them is vitally important. These three sources are the EEC, the Exchequer and the Farmers themselves. Let me say straight away that anyone who would disregard one of these three areas of responsibility is not being realistic in today's circumstances.  It is only through concerted action on all three fronts that we will see farming achieve worthwhile growth.</P>
    <P>I should like, first of all, to deal with help from the EEC.  Before dealing with last week's Brussels decisions in detail, however, it is desirable to look at the background against which the discussions in the Council of Ministers took place. For some time now a number of member states have been seriously concerned about the state of the Community's finances and, in particular, about the large share of the budget spent on the common agricultural policy, not to mention the budgetary impact of increasing that expenditure.  As is well known, the upper limit of the Community budget is fixed by the maximum contribution of 1 per cent of each country's VAT base. This is not a limitation which Ireland favours.  We consider that it operates to prevent the proper development of the Community, the achievement of economic <Col N="1861" /> and social convergence and the introduction of new policies.  However, some member states refuse absolutely to raise the limit at present and so it may be with us for some time to come.  The Community's expenditure, in which agriculture of course plays a large part, is at present within the limit.</P>
    <P>Some member states are putting forward suggestions which would seriously reduce the scope or impact of the common agricultural policy and for products of major interest to this country.  I have resisted such proposals in the past and I again resisted them on this occasion.</P>
    <P>At present, the Commission, in the context of a mandate given to it by the Council, is looking into the question of restructuring the Community budget. While this restructuring is not to question the fundamental principles of the common agricultural policy, a number of member states see the curtailment of expenditure on agriculture and a reduction in the Community budget devoted to FEOGA as a basic ingredient of this exercise.</P>
    <P>Such a restriction on Community spending on agriculture would not be in the long-term interests of the CAP.  It could eventually bring the CAP to the point where it could not fulfil the role assigned to it by the treaty.  It is very much in Ireland's interests that such a line should be opposed.</P>
    <P>Also in the background were two other major factors.  One was the strong pressure from what I might call the southern member states to increase the share of Community agricultural expenditure allocated to their particular products. While some movement in that direction may be justified on economic, social or other grounds, the overall pressure on total Community expenditure means that increased support for products such as olive oil, tobacco and wine could make it more difficult to preserve or obtain the necessary support for products of major interest to us.</P>
    <P>The other major background factor was the concept of co-responsibility.  The Commission was again putting forward a super-levy as one of the main co-responsibility <Col N="1862" /> instruments in the milk sector. This is a most objectionable proposal for this country because it would impose a penal levy on increases in milk production and so would have the effect of freezing our milk production at its present level, For cereals, the Commission proposed applying co-responsibility by means of deferring payment of part of the intervention prices, a method open to considerable objections.  Faced with the huge task of day-to-day market management in the Community and the desire of some member states to curtail spending on agriculture, the Commission can argue that co-responsibility measures are necessary, at least at times.  But the co-responsibility concept should not become a permanent principle of the common agricultural policy.  Neither should it be applied in a way that would discriminate unfairly against a country or a region.</P>
    <P>Those then were the difficult background elements when last week's final session of the price discussions began &mdash; financial pressures for savings on the CAP, pressures from some member states to spend much more on Mediterranean products, and pressures from the Commission and others to introduce further co-responsibility measures, some of which would be objectionable from our point of view.  Of course, there were other factors also in the background; for example, the policy of some countries to restrict as far as possible increases in food prices.</P>
    <P>My main aim in the negotiations was to get the highest possible price rise for Irish farmers and to get it as rapidly as possible.  At the same time I was seeking special EEC aid to deal with the difficult farm income situation here.  I achieved both of those objectives.  We secured an average increase of over 13 per cent in the Community farm support prices applied in Ireland.  This was a greater increase than in any other member state except Italy who had devalued their currency. The overall price increase for the UK is 9½ per cent while that for Germany is between 5 per cent and 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>I note that, when giving its opinion on the price proposals, the European Parliament <Col N="1863" /> would have been satisfied with an average increase of 12 per cent, weighted towards the products in deficit and against products in surplus such as milk. This would have meant less than 12 per cent for Ireland because of our heavy dependence on milk.  However, the result we actually secured is more than the European Parliament recommended. The new prices for milk and beef, by far our most important products, came into effect on 6 April, apart from an element of 2½ per cent in the beef price which comes next December.  Last year we had to wait until June for the price adjustments. The benefits of the earlier price settlement this year are very considerable. For example, the value of the increases on April and May milk and beef is about £35 million.  Thus we had every incentive to get a quick settlement.</P>
    <P>Following the change in green rates after the devaluation of the Italian lira and the adjustment of the value of the ECU, it was possible to obtain a devaluation of the Irish green pound which had the effect of increasing the Community farm prices applied here by 3.92 per cent.  This brought our green pound into full alignment with the market value of our currency.</P>
    <P>If we had not made this change, we would have again faced an MCA charge on our exports as from last Monday.  Also in the agri-monetary sector, the Council agreed to changes in the German green rate which reduced Germany's MCA charge on imports by 6.6 percentage points for milk and 5.6 points for other products.  This reduction should be of substantial benefit to Irish Agricultural exports to Germany.  In the case of the United Kingdom there was a reduction of 2.1 percentage points in the MCA, and this too will benefit our exporters.</P>
    <P>For us the price increase for milk is over 13 per cent.  The related increases in the intervention prices for butter and skim milk powder include a similar increase in respect of higher processing costs.  This is something I had been pressing for during the negotiations, especially as the allowance has not been changed for some years.  Together, these two <Col N="1864" /> adjustments should give an increase of at least 7p per gallon, and possibly up to 8p for the Irish milk producer.  This is the biggest ever increase in one single step. Furthermore, the super levy, to which I was totally opposed, has again been withdrawn. Last year Ireland alone was opposed to this levy but this year a number of other Ministers supported my line. The removal of this threat gives our industry the possibility of further expansion towards levels of development which obtain elsewhere in the Community.</P>
    <P>The general rate of the basic linear levy has of course increased from 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent.  While nobody likes having to pay a higher levy, accepting this instead of the super levy is clearly very much in our interest.  I had hoped to be able to secure a greater degree of exemption from the levy for disadvantaged areas and, indeed, I pressed that viewpoint strongly at the Council.  For the time being at least, the Council felt unable to do more than to maintain the existing differential of 0.5 per cent in favour of disadvantaged areas, but we will continue to pursue this issue in the future.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, the commitment to take further action if the cost of disposal of milk rises as a result of an increase of at least 1 per cent in community deliveries this year.  For the milk producers, this formula is a substantial improvement on the automatic linking of production increases with new restrictions as was done in the past.</P>
    <P>The idea of a heavier levy on very intensive milk producers, especially those using feed from outside the Community, has not been abandoned, although the Council were not yet prepared to adopt it last week.  The Commission are to give it further consideration. That approach is one which we favour and it has appeared in a Commission proposal for the first time this year. It would give comparatively favourable treatment to those producers who make use principally of the feed they can produce on their own land.  I think that is right, and we will be pressing for it again when the opportunity offers.</P>
    <P>Two other points from the Council decisions in the dairy sector should also <Col N="1865" /> be mentioned.  These arise from the Council's confirmation of the mini-package of measures provisionally agreed by the Council at their February meeting. The first relates to New Zealand butter. Imports are to be limited to 94,000 tonnes in 1981 and 92,000 tonnes in 1982.  These amounts are well below the 115,000 tonnes which New Zealand was authorised to deliver in 1980, arising out of the arrangements made following the Declaration agreed at the Summit here in Dublin in 1975.  They are also below the 95,000 tonnes level, to which New Zealand agreed to reduce its deliveries last year.  It is a matter for satisfaction that the trend in deliveries continues to be downward.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as a direct result of closer co-operation between the Community and New Zealand, the other main world supplier of dairy produce, there has been a very great improvement in world market prices.  This co-operation has resulted in substantial savings for the Community Budget and has been an important factor in enabling the Community to achieve a record level of diary produce exports last year.</P>
    <P>The other important milk matter from the mini-package, which was confirmed last week, relates to investment aids for milk production.  Last year, the Council decided to ban such investment aids except for farmers carrying out development plans, or farm improvement plans under common measures.  That ban was not put into effect at the time and the Council have now relaxed it so that member states may give investment aids to milk producers who have not submitted development plans provided that the investment does not bring their herds above 40 dairy cows.  That was an advantageous change for this country, especially when seen in conjunction with another step forward we made in the mini-package, namely the inclusion in the development category of farmers with only 85 per cent of the comparable income.</P>
    <P>Before moving away from the dairy sector, I should mention that the consumed subsidy on butter in the United <Col N="1866" /> Kingdom is being kept unchanged rather than being subject to a reduced Community contribution as the Commission had proposed.  This, of course, will benefit our butter exports to the UK and help to maintain consumption in that important market outlet.</P>
    <P>Overall, the agreement reached in Brussels should result in an average price for creamery milk producers of over 60p per gallon.  This compares with an average level of 30p per gallion in 1975.</P>
    <P>In the beef sector, the price increase will be over 14 per cent, of which 2.5 per cent will apply from next December.  I was able to maintain the derogation which allows this country to retain the use of intervention as long as our weekly market price for cattle remains below 85 per cent of the Community guide price. Although cattle prices are good at present, and intervention buying less necessary than in the past, it is essential for us that there should be a floor under the market for slaughter cattle.  This derogation provides one.  The Commission have stated their intention of introducing increased seasonality into intervention buying of beef forequarters and hindquarters. A somewhat similar arrangement, involving the suspension of intervention for forequarters, has operated for the past three or four months without damaging the market in this country. Also a Community grading scale for beef carcases which is to be introduced as soon as the technical details have been fully ironed out, will provide a common language for the beef trade in the Community and facilitate our exports to the other member states.</P>
    <P>All in all, the prospects for the cattle sector are very encouraging.  Prices this year are at record levels and have been running at about 20 per cent above last year's.  They are, in fact, almost three times higher than they were paid to farmers in 1974.</P>
    <P>With the increase in the intervention price and higher export refunds, further increases should follow.  Calf prices, too, are buoyant and are now averaging almost £85 per head as compared with £57 this time last year and with prices of <Col N="1867" /> as low as £10 per head and even much lower during 1974-75.</P>
    <P>The Council decided to reduce the calf premium in Italy in 1981-82.  Indeed, the Commission and some member states want to abolish it completely.  I made a determined effort to have this premium extended to Ireland, holding up the Council's final decisions for a considerable time.  When it became clear from the Council's discussions that the choice was between an immediate settlement worth £215 million in a full year to Irish farmers, and a postponement for an indefinite period with possible erosion of that settlement, I chose to make sure, there and then, of the exceptional benefits that were on the table for us.  But I did not do so without getting an undertaking that the Commission would make further proposals, in particular in favour of the Irish cattle sector, in time for Council decision by the middle of next July.  No undertaking of this kind was given to any other member state.</P>
    <P>For some years now, the meat industry in this country has experienced difficulties from time to time in competing with Northern factories for cattle supplies during periods when specially high levels of variable premium applied in Northern Ireland.  As part of last week's price-package the Commission indicated that henceforth a separate rate of variable premium will not be set for Northern Ireland.  This change will remove the discriminatory treatment about which the meat industry had been complaining for some time.</P>
    <P>In the pigmeat sector, the increase in the basic price is 15.4 per cent for Ireland, including the agri-monetary effect.  One of the difficulties about the Community pigmeat system has always been that the basic price has less direct impact on the market than the prices fixed in other sectors. This year, however, the Commission have undertaken to manage the pigmeat market in such a manner that the agreed increase in the basic price will have a corresponding effect on the market price.  The Commission have also undertaken to tighten up the administration of the Community protection system <Col N="1868" /> against pigmeat imports from Third countries.  These undertakings are most important and should help the conditions for pigmeat production.</P>
    <P>For sheepmeat, there will be an increase of 14.8 per cent in the Irish reference price, including the agri-monetary effect and a 3 per cent alignment step towards a common Community reference price.  This price increase brings the Irish reference price to over 106p per lb which compares with an average price of around 86p last year and less than 40p in 1975. This is substantial encouragement to our producers to improve both the quantity and the quality of their product.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Clawback&rdquo; charged on sheepmeat exports from the UK, which is designed to offset the effects of the slaughter premium paid there, will continue to operate in intra-Community trade and will ensure that UK sheepmeat has not an unwarranted advantage, particularly in the important French market.</P>
    <P>The intervention price for feed grains and the reference price for soft wheat are increased by about 10 per cent, including the agri-monetary element.  Target prices are being raised by about 2 per cent more, thus enlarging the extent of Community preference for grain produced in the Community over imports from Third countries.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the Commission had proposed a particular form of co-responsibility in the cereals sector. Their idea was, broadly, to reduce intervention prices if production rose.  For this purpose, 5 per cent of the intervention price was to be held back until the results of the Community harvest became known.</P>
    <P>I and a number of other Ministers saw serious objections to this from the cereal producers' point of view.  The final outcome was that the Council did not accept this proposal.  They will further review the question in the context of the 1982-83 price fixing.</P>
    <P>For sugar there will be a price increase of over 12 per cent, again including the agri-monetary element.  This will give a substantial net gain to producers even when the new production levy of 2 per cent is taken into account.  This production <Col N="1869" /> levy is part of the so-called &ldquo;mini-package&rdquo;, which was agreed in February subject to an Italian reservation which was withdrawn last week.  The 2 per cent figure is a maximum, not a fixed, charge. The levy will not be charged at all unless the cost of disposing of sugar makes it necessary.  I should point out that no financing for the disposal of Community sugar was necessary for most of last year.</P>
    <P>But the most significant part for us of the sugar arrangements confirmed in the price package is the retention of Ireland's &ldquo;A&rdquo; quota at its present level of 182,000 tonnes at a time when the movement in the Community has been towards cutting sugar quotas generally.  In practice full use of this facility will mean expanding our beet acreage to produce at least 182,000 tonnes of sugar.  I am glad that the efforts of the sugar company to secure an increased beet acreage this year are meeting with a good response, and I would urge more farmers to consider this remunerative line of production so as to ensure that our full quota will be produced. Production of this quantity, together with the price increase now agreed, will not only improve growers' incomes but will also help the Sugar Company in their difficult financial situation.</P>
    <P>Finally, the settlement last week enables Ireland to continue to import on favourable terms raw sugar from the ACP countries for refining here, thereby providing valuable employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>I come now to what was for us a vital element of the 1981-82 prices decisions, namely, the special measures for Ireland. It is well known that since last year I had been pressing the Commission to bring forward proposals specific to this country's needs.  I had pursued the matter intensively both with the last Vice&mdash;President Gundelach and, after his untimely death, with the present Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. Dalsager.</P>
    <P>I had stressed the very serious decline in farm incomes here in 1979 and 1980 and had urged that the situation should be met by special measures which would act directly on farm incomes and would also encourage farmers to resume current <Col N="1870" /> investments on which they had been forced to cut back.</P>
    <P>I had pointed out that the high degree of dependence of the Irish economy on agriculture, taken together with the fact that our national resources were severely limited compared with those of other member states, made it essential that the Community should show solidarity by assisting us.</P>
    <P>The Commission had, of course, difficulties of their own to face in complying with my request.  As I have said, we are going through a time of financial stringency and cut-backs in expenditure at Community level.  This did not make it 1 235any easier for me to have my requests any easier for me to have my requests accepted.  Also, the Council had in the recent past adopted other measures specifically for Ireland &mdash; the western drainage scheme, the cross-Border drainage scheme and the comprehensive structural measures for the west of Ireland, worth £300 million in a ten year period.  Other member states too had experienced some quite sharp declines in farm incomes although their difficulties were less serious than ours.</P>
    <P>In December last I submitted to the Commission a list of possible ways in which help could be provided for our agricultural industry and over recent months these were pursued with the Commission by myself and my Department. When agreement on the &ldquo;mini-package&rdquo; was reached last February I made it clear that for me proposals on special measures for Ireland would be an essential element of the 1981-82 price agreement.</P>
    <P>The Council approved of the proposals last week, the Agricultural Committee of the European Parliament approved of them on Tuesday last and I understand that the European Parliament itself is to discuss them today and vote on them tomorrow.  The proposals must then go through a formal adoption procedure by the Council and, following some Commission implementing regulations, they will come into effect.  In the Council discussions last week it was agreed to extend the measures to Northern Ireland.  I welcomed that course because I know that a <Col N="1871" /> difficult farm income position also prevails there.</P>
    <P>The special measures include a programme for the development of beef cattle production which contains four separate measures.  First, there is to be a lime subsidy of £2.50 per tonne.  This is designed to offset the downward trend in lime use which has been taking place recently.  It should encourage farmers to restore lime application to normal levels, thus increasing yields and incomes.  There is also to be Community aid for intensifying our performance testing and progeny testing programmes.  Thirdly, a subsidy of £3 per tonne of silage will be available to farmers making silage for the first time.  It is now widely recognised that silage is superior to hay as a winter feed and silage making is a development that must be fostered in our climatic conditions. The new grant should encourage many who are still making hay to change over to silage.</P>
    <P>The final point in the cattle development programme is a subsidy of £5 per cow for artificial insemination.  Widespread use of this subsidy will operate to raise the efficiency of our cattle herds.</P>
    <P>There are two further measures.  The first relates to our disease eradication programmes.  The elimination of bovine TB and brucellosis is, of course, essential for our livestock and dairying sectors. But the Government &mdash; and now the Community too &mdash; recognise that in the present farm income situation the financial impact on farmers of some of the eradication procedures has become harder to bear.  Aid of up to £4 per animal will now be made available to help farmers to meet the cost of pre-movement tests.</P>
    <P>The final provision relates to the suckler cow premium.  For a period of two years the Community will provide the funds to enable us to double the premium to over £26 per cow.  This is both an income and a development measure.  It should provide a significant income benefit to beef producers while at the same time helping them to build up their cow numbers and so reverse the decline in the <Col N="1872" /> beef herd that has been taking place over a considerable period of years.</P>
    <P>A feature of these special measures is that they apply to the whole country and not just to the disadvantaged areas.  Their total cost is estimated at £51 million, of which £31 million will be provided by the Community and £20 million by the Irish Exchequer.  They demonstrate in a very striking way that, just as Ireland is committed to the Community, the Community is also committed to us and has a real interest in the welfare of our agricultural economy.</P>
    <P>The prices package as a whole provides a benefit of some £215 million to the Irish agricultural sector in a full year and a gain of around £120 million to our balance of payments.  There are substantial improvements for all our major farm products.  The price increases are the highest in recent years, and the overall financial benefit is the biggest price settlement improvement that our farmers have ever obtained.</P>
    <P>The danger of a super-levy on milk has again been staved off.  Significant steps have been taken in dismantling MCA protection in some of our export markets. Our special measures have been agreed, and on top of that there is a commitment to further proposals to help us.  The Commission has undertaken to study other methods of assisting in social and other problems resulting from the fall in incomes in the agricultural sector which is of particular importance to the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Council has requested the Commission to examine the possibilities for further relieving the current serious income difficulties of Irish agriculture and, in particular, for the cattle sector and to bring forward proposals so that the Council could take decisions before 15 July next.  These commitments are most valuable and are further evidence of the willingness of the Community to help a member state which has serious temporary difficulties to overcome.</P>
    <P>Our agricultural sector has faced great difficulties over the past year or two.  The year 1980 was not a particularly good one for our farmers.  The weather certainly <Col N="1873" /> was no great help.  But the major underlying cause was the recession which had bedevilled the economies of the western countries over the last few years.</P>
    <P>The Government have been very conscious of the adverse situation in the agricultural industry and of the effect on farmers' incomes.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and I held regular meetings with the leaders of the farming organisations during the year.  Arising from these discussions with the farm leaders the Government took positive steps to alleviate those difficulties and promote renewed investment and expansion in the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The measures taken by the Government represent a formidable list.  Last autumn we introduced a new winter fodder scheme with fertiliser and silage subsidies at a cost of over £2 million.  An extra £23 million was provided for the farm modernisation scheme.  We removed last year's second moiety of rates for farmers in the £40 to £60 RV category at a cost of £6 million.  Arrangements were made through the associated banks and the ACC for a constructive and positive approach to the restructuring of existing loans where farmers were faced with serious repayment problems and we also arranged for £100 million to be loaned to farmers at reduced interest rates.</P>
    <P>The EEC beef suckler scheme, worth about £6 million, was introduced and we supplemented this with a national scheme of grants for additional cows.  The rates of grants under the cattle headage, beef cow and sheep headage schemes were substantially increased, being more or less doubled in most cases.  The subsidy under the mountain lamb extension scheme was also doubled and the cost to farmers of warble dressing was kept at the previous year's level.  We increased the annual grant to Macra na Feirme.  All these measures were introduced by the Government at a cost of £39 million.</P>
    <P>But the Government did not stop with these measures.  They were only the beginning.  In our budget last February a further £35 million for farming was provided. We abolished resource tax and introduced modifications in the income <Col N="1874" /> tax provisions applying to farmers.  Full relief from rates was granted to farmers under £50 RV and 50 per cent relief for those between £50 and £70 RV at a cost of almost £20 million in 1981.  59,000 farmers will benefit directly from this, with 49,000 getting full relief.  The position now is that only 15,000 farmers out of a total of 150,000 are paying full rates. And these 15,000 are the farmers who are benefiting from the abolition of the resource tax.  So in effect the budget measures benefited the total farming community.  In addition, we suspended the disease eradication levies, giving a direct saving to farmers of almost £10 million in 1981.  A sum of £250,000 was provided to assist the development of the seed potato industry.  All the measures I have mentioned, which were taken by the Government, were what the responsible farmers' leadership agreed in discussion were necessary and are surely clear and positive indications of the Government's concern for our agricultural industry.  These measures cannot be looked at in isolation.  They are part of an ongoing programme, and we will be shortly meeting farmers' representatives again to review the situation in the light of the Brussels' decisions.</P>
    <P>As I said at the start, improvements in the farm income situation can come from three main sources, the EEC, the Exchequer and the farmers themselves. I have outlined what we have secured from the EEC and what the Government are providing.  While I have left until last the contribution that farmers themselves can make, I do not want this to be taken as implying a lower degree of importance to it than to action by the EEC or by the Government.  There is wide recognition that we are far from reaching the full potential of Irish soils.  That potential can only be attained by farmers themselves &mdash; the EEC cannot do it, nor can the Government.  It is the 150,000 Irish farm families who determine just what is produced, and not just the quantity but the quality as well.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a very substantial level of capital investment in agriculture.  Since 1975 well over £1,000 million has been invested in land <Col N="1875" /> improvement, buildings, machinery and so on.  We have not yet seen an adequate return on that investment.  The opportunities for improved output and efficiency are there in all sectors of the industry. Our average milk yields are nowhere near what they should be, despite our natural advantages in dairying.  The potential improvement in most dairy farmers' incomes from improved yields and higher stocking rates far outweighs anything that is likely to be obtained from higher prices.</P>
    <P>The same philosophy holds for other farm enterprises.  There are huge areas in this country devoted to cattle production where output is far below what it could be.  We should aim at a target of 500 kilos live weight by two years old; many farms are not achieving even 400 kilos today. That extra 100 kilos can be achieved by adequate winter feed, good grassland management in the grazing season, and a high standard of animal husbandry.  At today's prices for cattle it would give the farmer a worth-while boost in income to reach these standards.  In the case of sheep we need to aim at a standard of 150 per cent lambing for lowland flocks and 100 per cent for hill flocks if full profitability of the enterprise is to be realised.</P>
    <P>There is also considerable scope for improvement in our tillage enterprises. According to the Sugar Company an improvement of two tons an acre in beet yield or 2 per cent in sugar content is readily achievable.  Similarly there is room for improvement in cereals.  At present a significant divergence exists between the yields obtained by the top producers and the least efficient ones, and an average increase of up to 25 per cent is easily attainable.</P>
    <P>The extra farm revenue which these improvements would represent would not involve great increases in costs but would require improved husbandry &mdash; early ploughing, cultivating at the right time and early sowing.  The cumulative effect of the price increases and other measures agreed in Brussels last week, the steps already taken by the Government and the opportunities for increased output and efficiency available to the <Col N="1876" /> farmer provide a strong impetus to the further development of the agricultural sector.  I am confident that we shall see the restoration of strong growth in the farming sector provided that everyone involved plays his full part.</P>
    <P>The Government will not hesitate to take whatever further steps are necessary, but there must be an equal determination throughout the industry to match this with all possible efforts to increase output and efficiency.  If this is done, not only will we leave behind the difficulties of the past two years but we shall see the industry entering into a new era of success and prosperity.  The achievement of that position will be helped by the EEC and the Government measures which I have outlined.  They will do much to reverse the downturn in incomes and put the industry back on the road to expansion and recovery.  Despite the decline in dairy cows it looks as if milk production this year will be up to the 1980 level, and possibly slightly above it.  The Brussels agreement should mean an increase of at least 7p per gallon and possibly more.  Indeed, when account is taken of the high calf prices, the dairy farmer will be benefiting to the tune of several pence more on top of that.</P>
    <P>Cattle prices in recent times have been at record levels.  The high prices for calves contrast sharply with the situation in 1974-75, when under the previous Government things were nearly at the stage where calves could not be given away for nothing.  The present situation is very far from that.</P>

I note that an Opposition spokesman alleged that we negotiated like children.  That same spokesman, the then Minister for Agriculture, said here in the Dáil in 1975, and I quote:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately there are people still here who think I have only to go to <Col N="1877" /> Brussels and bang the table and get what I want.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in Brussels has not altered and, as he well knows, getting something in negotiations there is a long hard struggle.  Of course, I could have rejected last week's settlement but I had to weigh up the consequences.  The price increases, worth about £20 million a month, would have been postponed, an MCA charge on our exports would have been introduced last Monday, and the special measures for Ireland, which I had secured, would have been put back again into the negotiations.  Also, there was no guarantee that at an adjourned meeting at some future date we would get a calf subsidy.  Indeed, the opposition of other member states was such that it became quite clear that they would not agree.</P>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that we obtained everything that it was possible to get at this stage, while laying the groundwork for further progress in July next.  The impact of the 1981-82 price decisions on our agricultural sector will play a major part in restoring confidence in farming and food processing by improving incomes, facilitating investment and productivity and leading to increased output. The decisions can be expected to increase the cost of living index by about 1¼ per cent and retail food prices by about 4 per cent in a full year.  But we must remember that, not only here but in the Community as a whole, food price increases arising from the farmer's element in retail prices have fallen far behind the rise in other prices in recent years.</P>
      <P>We must not forget either that in a country where agriculture has such a high relative importance the increased prosperity which the better prices and conditons of last week's price package will bring to the farm sector, will have favourable spill-over effects throughout the entire economy and will benefit everyone in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be a number of speakers to the debate and I look forward to a constructive approach by them.  It is in the interests of Irish agriculture and the farming <Col N="1878" /> community that we should have a constructive rather than a political approach to this debate, that Deputies would concentrate on the reality of the situation in which we live, bearing in mind the economic constraints at home and in Brussels.  Since I became Minister for Agriculture I have been waiting to hear such constructive comments from Opposition Deputies but I have yet to hear them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to hear the Minister say that since he became Minister for Agriculture he has not heard constructive proposals from Fine Gael. Down through the years members of this party have fought to secure a reasonable standard of living for farmers.  Since I was first elected to the House four years ago Fine Gael Deputies consistently have put forward constructive proposals on agriculture. The Minister said he welcomed the debate, but I propose to be as political in my contribution as the Minister has been.  I see little hope in his speech for the agricultural community, because in the first place he failed to make a reasonable assessment of the farmers' overall position.</P>
      <P>I realise that the Minister has been in office for only one and a half years, but in that period he has negotiated two price fixing agreements and I am sorry to say that neither was of benefit to the agricultural community.  Never was there such a golden opportunity presented to the Government to get a realistic package for Irish farmers, but Fianna Fáil have been consistent in their failures in the field of agriculture.  This year they had a golden opportunity but they failed again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish farmers suffered a reduction in incomes in 1979-80 of 45 per cent.  That is an established fact.  An election in France is imminent and because of world prices moneys are being made available from EEC funds to other nations who have received certain concessions.  However, Ireland was unable to secure a deal that would guarantee that our farmers would not take a further reduction in incomes for the third year running.  The possibility is that there will be a 4 per cent reduction in 1981 to add to the 25 <Col N="1879" /> per cent reduction in 1980 and 20 per cent in 1979.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's administration has seriously damaged the agricultural industry in the past three years.  Worst of all was the promise, the expectations built around these negotiations.  Farmers were hoping for a worthwhile result and this has created further uncertainty among them.  This is far too little and it has come far too late.</P>
    <P>The motion covers three matters. The first is price-fixing, and the deal represents about 13 per cent.  The other two mentioned by the Minister are the special package and Government measures during the year.  This overall increase of 13 per cent looked good but there is a completely different picture when it is analysed.</P>
    <P>It must be asked how much of the 13 per cent will reach the farmers' pockets. The Minister gave a figure of £215 million. How far will this go to meet the farmers' needs?  In 1980 farmers' inputs cost about £1,200 million.  A 16½ per cent increase in farmers' input costs in 1981 reckoned in the same way as 1980 would be approximately £1,400 million.  That figure must be compared with an inflation rate of 20 per cent and this leaves a mere figure of £15 million to cover farmers' living expenses.  It would just buy two packets of cigarettes for each of the 180,000 farmers and they would have to borrow the price of the matches.  We hope things will not end up so badly.  The mild winter has meant some savings for farmers, but this package means that farmers will have to cut back even further in 1981 inputs in order to retain some semblance of decent living standards. Farmers simply cannot take another 15 per cent drop in real incomes on top of the 45 per cent they took in the past two years.</P>
    <P>Because of cutbacks in inputs and investment, farmers may arrive at a 4 per cent reduction in incomes this year.  I am only talking about their 1981 position by comparison with 1980, and in this respect I will quote the President of the IFA, Mr. Donal Cashman, who last month spelled out the position.  He said that to compensate <Col N="1880" /> for inflation since 1978 Irish farmers require £300 million on top of an EEC price rise of 15 per cent.  He went on to say that the measures proposed by the Commission would do nothing to offset the excessive increases in major costs to Irish farmers, such as fertilisers, feedstuffs and energy.  The IFA and the ICMSA have expressed total dissatisfaction at the results of this year's farm price negotiations in Brussels which, they say, will be disastrous for Irish farmers.  They have demanded that the Government introduce supplementary measures.  This is in line with independent estimates whose accuracy I have no reason to doubt.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael never argued that the Irish Government should make up all of this shortfall.  We have argued that the Government should go part of the way and make a substantial effort to alleviate the position of developing farmers who are now in serious financial difficulties.  More and more farmers are coming into this category every month.  The Minister said we never put forward a constructive suggestion. For his information, Fine Gael are committed to farmers through a package of short-term proposals.  We are happy to say we forced the Government to adopt a portion of this package in the budget.  I am now prepared to say that the present position of farmers warrants additional support.  Fine Gael, in Government, are willing to give that aid.</P>
    <P>Three factors relating to Irish agriculture were indisputable going into these negotiations.  Irish farmers' incomes are among the lowest in the Community. They have deteriorated far more seriously over the past two years than in any other member state.  Irish farmers are heading into 1981 with a sure prospect of the biggest rate of inflation, apart from Italy and Greece, in the Common Market. One could not conceive a more impressive array of statistics in support of Irish demands for exceptional treatment in these negotiations.  As a poker player would describe it, the Minister has a full house.  How then did he come out with such a bad result?  Our case seemed to have been established in the European Parliament.  In reply to a question from <Col N="1881" /> Deputy Noel Davern, the Commission recognised, that in real terms, the 1980 farm incomes in Ireland could be as much as 4 per cent lower than in 1972.  It would take account of the situation in drawing up its proposals in the 1981-1982 price package.  What happened?  The outcome has been drastic for Ireland.  Neither the Commission proposals nor the price fixing took any worth-while recognition of the exceptionally high rate of inflation facing Irish farmers.  Let us take a closer look at what was agreed.</P>
    <P>The average price increase from the EEC as a whole is around 11.3 per cent and is sufficient to cover inflation at 1981 levels.  However, the results vary sharply when we look at the outcome for individual countries.  We find that countries which have a low rate of inflation such as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and France, are getting price increases in excess of their inflation rates. The high inflation countries are Italy, the UK and Ireland.  Italy received a 16 per cent increase, plus a concession which the Minister did not even mention to cover its 21 per cent rate of inflation.  The UK received 9.6 per cent against an inflation rate of around 13 per cent for 1980. It is expected that the inflation rate in the UK will drop in 1981.  What may we expect in Ireland?  We already have a 21 per cent rate of inflation.  It is not known what it will be in three months time.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the UK had got a reduction as far as the importation of butter is concerned from New Zealand. I understand &mdash; I am subject to correction &mdash; that they have got agreement up to 1983 of 94,000 tonnes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing is established as far as the UK are concerned.  They are determined to hold on to 90,000 tonnes of butter imports per annum.  This is a <Col N="1882" /> very large concession and it hits at the root of the Irish economy.  We achieved a 13.9 per cent increase against an inflation rate of 18.2 per cent for 1980.  Our latest inflation figures are 21 per cent. These results clearly demonstrate that Ireland fared disastrously in these negotiations. Irish farmers are being asked to make do with a 13 per cent price increase in a year when inflation could be well in excess of 20 per cent.  This is not a new experience for farmers under Fianna Fail.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Irish Times</i> of Thursday, 2 April summed up our influence in Brussels and the results of our negotiations:</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, had been pressing for this calf breeding bonus, which he considered an essential part of this year's agreement.  This diplomatic move failed...</P>
      <P>In spite of the domestic importance to Ireland of the calf subsidy, the Government decided that on balance it was better not to offence the bigger Powers...</P>
      <P>A face-saving form of words was being drafted last night, saying that by mid-July the Commission would bring forward fresh proposals for Irish farmers. The application of any such proposals was regarded as unlikely to be effective in the current marketing year. Almost certainly, it will not include a calf subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been the trend for the past two years as far as the Government are concerned. It is always &ldquo;live horse, and you will get grass&rdquo;.  There is something around the next corner.  We are just about to get it but we cannot.  This is of very little benefit to farmers facing a difficult situation at present.  These have been the proposals which the Minister has been putting forward all the time.  I have told the farming organisations to call the Minister's bluff on this occasion. How far more can the Minister go?  How far more can the Minister drag the farmers behind him on a rope?  They are the questions the Minister must answer and which should have been answered in his speech this evening.  That is why we asked <Col N="1883" /> for the debate.  With all due respects, the Minister's speech was only a lecture of what took place in Brussels&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>We thought Fine Gael did not know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>We did know it.  In 1980, the Minister brought home a five per cent increase which turned out to be a drop of 2½ per cent for a year in which inflation reached 18.3 per cent.  That was when we had celebrations at the airport because the Minister had brought back such a marvellous package.  This type of exercise has worn itself out and, for God's sake, stop it.  Be honest with the farmers and tell them where they stand.  In 1979 the Minister brought home a package giving a 1.2 per cent rise for a year in which inflation amounted to 13.2 per cent.  In other words, price agreements from Brussels have not matched the Irish inflation rate.  I am sorry, it was Deputy Gibbons who brought back the 1.2 per cent. That was worse.  At least the present Minister improved on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The alarming thing is there are no indications that this trend will not continue under a Fianna Fáil Government if they are in power for the next three years. It is a deadly serious matter, not just for the Irish farmer but for the whole country. In three years Fianna Fáil have not woken up to this reality.  They appear to have no strategy to combat it.  Fine Gael have a strategy, portion of which I will deal with later.  Of the 13.9 per cent, about which the Minister speaks so loudly, he allows 3.9 per cent for green £ devaluation.  1½ per cent of this rise is a special franchise mechanism.  One effect of this will be to lift intervention prices by this amount.  It will not apply to MCAs or export refunds.  The remainder of the 3.9 per cent will apply.  In view of the fact that intervention prices for milk, beef and cereals are not operating at present, it is doubtful, therefore, to what extent, if any, this 1½ per cent will apply.  It may have some bearing on beef in the fall of the year.  If the Minister were to tell the whole truth and analyse it properly, the package from Brussels is nearer to about <Col N="1884" /> 12 per cent than to 13.9 per cent.  That is as far as the farmer's pocket is concerned which is what I am interested in.  There are other hidden deductions, first the increase in the co-responsibility levy on milk from 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent.  The Minister must be severely criticised for allowing this to be increased in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister accepted an increase in the co-responsibility levy that he should have resisted to the end, particularly with regard to the first 12,800 gallons which was won as a concession in last year's agreement.  There was also the matter of a co-responsibility levy on beet. This principle is unacceptable to this country and is a new departure.  It appeared it was conceded during the negotiations in return for some later concessions.  However, not one iota of a concession was won by the Minister in the final stages.  What it meant was a loss of approximately £1 million to our beet growers.  When the Minister was questioned about the matter at the time he gave the impression he was getting further concessions provided he gave way on the 2 per cent.  I am a beet grower and I know the facts of the situation.  We took a loss on the crop last year but the Minister did not help us this year.  The farmers were asked to extend the acreage.  It is a labour-intensive crop and I agree with the Minister on this point.  However, he must be condemned for giving away £1 million in respect of beet.</P>

      <P>The question is, what is the increased cost of the crop?  That is the question the farmers are asking.  It is no use talking about a 5 per cent increase when the cost of the crop will go up by 15 per cent.  The Minister saw fit to give away £1 million of the farmers' money but he did not get any other concessions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  The Minister allowed 2 per cent to be taken as a <Col N="1885" /> co-responsibility levy on the A quota that is consumed within the country.  The important point is the Minister has allowed a co-responsibility levy to be put on produce consumed within the EEC. So far as Ireland is concerned, there has been a very serious development in this area.</P>
      <P>There will be a further deduction from the 13.9 per cent, in that in respect of beef 2:5 per cent is being held until December 1981.  For some unexplainable reason the 8 per cent increase initially proposed for suckler cow subsidy was lost in the final negotiations.  The Minister did not explain that matter.</P>
      <P>A further indictment of the Minister's negotiations are the concessions won by other countries such as Italy.  They won a substantial improvement in their sugar quota.  From the farmers' point of view it was unfortunate and disappointing that the Minister failed to get the calf subsidy. The Minister gave the impression that he would obtain the subsidy and this encouraged people to buy calves.  They were encouraged to believe that they would get a subsidy of £22.  The Minister should not make announcements before agreements are reached.</P>

      <P>Those are the facts and I have pointed them out to the Minister. He cannot deny that Italy won its case. In the programme &ldquo;Landmark&rdquo; the Minister stated that it was intended to phase out the subsidy so far as Italy was concerned. I have looked at the minutes of the meeting but it is not entered in those minutes.  The Minister is just making excuses for his own failure.</P>

It would be the difference between failure and success.  I see no reason why the Minister should have had to telephone the Taoiseach about the matter.  He is our man in Europe and should be able to do his job.  The Minister should have stayed at the negotiating table until he got the same concession as was given to Italy.  It was weakness on the part of the Minister to phone the Taoiseach and ask him for his advice on such a vital issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister got very little when he gave away £1 million with regard to beet.  One of the more serious aspects of the present situation is the continuing run-down of the inputs into agriculture.  I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister the fact that tractor sales are down by 60 per cent, farm machinery sales down by 50 per cent, sale of farm building materials down by 60 per cent, compound feedstuffs down by 15 per cent, cattle feeds down by 22 per cent, fertilisers down by from 15 per cent to 25 per cent and the sale of lime down by 50 per cent.  This is a very serious matter so far as increased production is concerned.  Lime is a basic essential to our Irish soil.  Without the proper level of lime maximum performance cannot be obtained.  I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister the 1980 report with regard to ground limestone. In 1977 some 1.9 million tons were used; 2 million tons of lime were used in 1978; in 1979 in the famous budget introduced <Col N="1887" /> by Deputy Colley the rot started and there was a reduction in the amount of lime used: in that year 1.5 million tons were used.  In 1980 there was a further reduction to 900,000 tons.  In all, there has been a reduction of approximately 50 per cent.  This is a very serious trend.  The concession of £2.50 per tonne will do nothing to improve the situation.  I understand the quarries are looking for an increase of 40 per cent and this will not help the situation.  From the figures available at the moment it is obvious that there will be a further reduction in 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister contacts the quarries he will get the figures.  Job losses in this area are quite considerable and the situation will deteriorate.  The servicing side of agriculture is crumbling by the hour.  Machinery that is not in good condition is being used on our farms.  In the budgets of 1979 and 1980 Fianna Fáil members said farms were over-mechanised.  If one talks to farmers about this matter their reply will be that they are using more welding rods than new machinery.  When farmers are engaged on silage work it is essential that modern, efficient machinery is used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If agriculture is to develop, we must ensure there will be profits.  If the profit is not there there will be no confidence in the industry.  The real cancer that has plagued our farmers is inflation and the Government stand discredited in allowing our inflation to get completely out of control, thereby damaging not alone the agricultural industry but the entire economy. The agricultural industry is exposed to inflation and unless and until that is brought under control no real progress or expansion can be expected.  How the Government could be so blatantly careless about so important an issue as Fianna Fáil have been for the past three years in particular, I do not know.  We have seen high inflation do permanent damage to even the strongest of foreign economies, and I wish to use this debate deliberately <Col N="1888" /> to highlight the cancer which is eating away at our economy to the detriment of every citizen in the nation.</P>
    <P>We should not expect the EEC to make up the losses to farming due to high inflation. Here we must blame our national Government for taking the lid off as far back as 1978 and allowing the economy of this nation to run amok.  They were the good boys to everybody, giving everything to everybody, but in the final analysis they gave nothing to anybody.  Inflation over this three year period is having disastrous effects on the entire economy and particularly on agriculture.  For a while back we have heard the Minister and his Ministers of State talking about the greater level of efficiency and saying that to increase their incomes farmers should become more efficient.  The level of efficiency will be based on the margins of profits available and while present conditions last agriculture will become less efficient.</P>
    <P>If you want farmers to become more efficient in milk production, better grassland management, re-seeding, progeny testing, culling cows and better houses, the way is through profit margins.  Will the Minister tell the farmers how to carry out these improvements without incurring further capital expenditure?  If you talk to any farmer at the moment would he tell you that he is going to borrow another £10,000 or £12,000 to become more efficient?  Ask him if it will pay him to do so and you will get your answer very quickly, and the same will apply to all lines of farming, beef, cereals or sheep.  It appears that the Minister believes that the level of efficiency can be brought about without further expenditure while he supplies all the advice from the advisory service.  The reality is that efficiency requires modernisation and modernisation requires expenditure.  The Minister's call about efficiency is now regarded as armchair farming or behind-desk farming far removed from reality.  Calling for efficiency at this stage, when people find it extremely difficult to meet their commitments to the banks and ACC, does not make sense.</P>
    <P>We need to convince Brussels of the vulnerable position of our Irish economy <Col N="1889" /> to inflation pressures through imports from Britain which has one of the highest inflation rates in the EEC at over 13 per cent last year.  This, coupled with the rise in sterling, related to the IR£, has driven up Irish import prices enormously.  The important point for Ireland is that 50 per cent of our imports come from the UK while no more than 10 per cent of the imports of other EEC countries come from Britain.  This is the unique position of Ireland and the Minister has failed to impress this point on Mr. Dalsager.  Following this, I find it ludicrous that a common level of price increases was proposed for countries like Ireland with an inflation rate of 21 per cent and Holland, for example, with an inflation rate of 6 per cent.  If there were proper recognition of our position the proposal should be 15 to 20 per cent for Ireland and 5 per cent for the low inflation countries.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister has the inflation rates of the EEC countries but I will bring them to his notice.  The document I have here is <i>Agra-Europe</i> of 3 April 1981, page 5 and it states: Belgium, farm price increases 10.4 per cent, current inflation 7 per cent; Denmark, price increase 12.4, current inflation 10.7 per cent; West Germany, price increase 4.8 per cent, current inflation 5.7 per cent; France, price increase 12.4 per cent, current inflation 12.9 per cent; Ireland, price increase 13.9 per cent, current inflation 18.2 per cent; Italy, price increase 16.2 per cent, inflation 21 per cent; Luxembourg, price increase 10.4 per cent, inflation 7.3 per cent; Netherlands, price increase 10.4 per cent, current inflation 7.1 per cent; UK, price increase 9.6 per cent, current inflation 13 per cent.  That is the position we find ourselves in as a nation.  We cannot blame the EEC for our inflation rates but in this price-fixing negotiation these things should have been taken into consideration. The present set-up will put the farmers across Europe in a very sound position while the income of farmers in Ireland is reducing further.  The Minister has failed to impress this point in his negotiations.  If it had been pressed he should have been in a position to get a far better deal.  Could I ask how much time I have left?</P>

      <P>An important point I wish to make is the question of the Minister getting these concessions from Europe and refusing or failing to pay them out. I write to him and his Ministers of State time and time again about silage grants, suckler grants, hogget grants and lamb grants.  I am getting a reasonable response from him, but why in God's name are these grants not paid out at the proper time?  The Minister's record has been and still is to hold on to these grants, or a certain number of them.  I cannot understand why, because the objective of these grants in certain cases, particularly the silage, suckler, hogget and ewe grants, is that they would be collected by the farmers before the winter begins.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to hear me out.  Particularly in a year like this, knowing that the situation is very difficult, it is the duty of the Minister and his Ministers of State to ensure that these grants are paid out at the right time to allow farmers to buy extra feed.  Even this week I have a few letters in to the Minister about grants not being paid out. I do not know how many and the Minister has the figures.  It is scandalous if he is going to allow this to continue.  He knew the difficult feed situation for 1981.  If he had had the farmers' interest at heart he would have paid these grants on time to guarantee that the farmers would have the money in their hand to buy the extra feed they required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position with the farming community at the moment, with all the good farmers borrowing heavily, with bank interest rates due in March, the <Col N="1891" /> ACC bills being prepared for 1 May, inflation running at 20 per cent and no protection from the Minister?  Yet there is no protection from the Minister and no commitment on the part of the Government. It would seem to the ordinary farmer that the Government are not even aware that a crisis actually exists.  The Minister knows the level of borrowing by the farming community at the moment &mdash; it is about £1,300 million.  How many times did the Minister meet the banks and the Agricultural Credit Corporation? The Minister made great play of the fact that the Government saw to it that £100 million was brought in at low interest rates.  The fact is that that loan had a very short repayment period as far as principal was concerned so that it was of very little benefit to the agricultural community because the repayments were far too high.  I asked the Minister on a number of occasions how often he met the banks and the Agricultural Credit Corporation to put the farmers' case and to ask them not to resort ot sharp tactics.  The Minister made one statement that anybody who was being harrassed by the banks should contact him immediately.  As far as I know, the Minister has not met the people concerned with operation agricultual finance.  It is important to say that I saw fit to state our case to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and to tell them of the difficulties and the policies they should adopt to alleviate some of the hardships that farmers will have to face in 1980-81.  What did the Minister do in regard to that issue?</P>

      <P>I was hoping to have time to go into the Minister's speech but I have not got the time.  However, there is one thing that I cannot let the Minister away with.  That is the question of the great work he did in the budget by giving £35 <Col N="1892" /> million to the farmers.  But the Minister did mention that he imposed a disease levy of £10 million in the 1979 Budget. So it was not such a big deal when he took it on in 1981.</P>

      <P>The Minister did the same with the rate subsidy.  He made great play of the fact that he took off the rates in 1981.  This type of thing is not fooling anybody.  These are the areas where the Government started the rot.  The Government extracted tax from the farmers that was not related to income.  The Minister has done a great deal of damage but he seems to think that he is doing a great deal in 1981 by removing something he imposed two years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

      <P>The Government are responsible for doing damage on the one hand and, on the other hand claim to do a great deal by taking it off.  That is not going to do the farmers any good at the moment.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that full relief of rates was granted to farmers with valuations under £50 and 50 per cent relief was granted to farmers with valuations between £50 and £70.  Does the Minister realise that people sold cattle at very bad prices to pay the rates that were due in 1980?  The Government came along and gave back the rates at a later stage, but the damage had already been done.  The same has happened in relation to the disease levies and other things imposed in the 1979 budget.  This is where the Government have fallen down and that is where they have done the damage. Now we hear speeches daily about the good they have done with these great concessions given to agriculture in the 1981 budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that, because of lack of time, I am unable to go into the issues in the Minister's speech.  This is the fourth year of price negotiations by Fianna Fáil and what a low score they secured during that time.  Let me compare the achievements <Col N="1893" /> of this administration with the achievements of the previous administration under Deputy Mark Clinton.  In the four years of Fianna Fáil's administration they managed to get plus 30 per cent for milk; Deputy Clinton got 104 per cent in his four years.  For beef, Fianna Fáil got plus 30 per cent; Deputy Clinton got 128 per cent.  Fianna Fáil achieved plus 22 per cent in their four years for grain; Deputy Clinton achieved 105 per cent in his four years.  These figures exclude transitional and other adjustments to the common prices but they include the green £ devaluation. These figures clearly show who brought back the benefits from Brussels and it certainly was not Fianna Fáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to give my own view and the view of my party on the general agricultural scene as defined in the Minister's statement.  It is generally accepted that over the past year there has been a very serious crisis in agriculture, which of course is our principal industry and indeed our principal natural resource.  There has been a serious cutback in the incomes of people directly engaged in agriculture over that period. As in every other walk of life the lower paid, the small farmers, suffer most in such circumstances.  When one finds that one's income, which is only providing a very limited livelihood, is cut by as much as 40 per cent, then one is in serious trouble.  The vast bulk of farmers are in this category.  In the seven counties in the eastern region of ACOT the average size of holdings is less than 50 statute acres. That will surprise a lot of people who think of large ranches in Meath and Kildare. But these people with small holdings <Col N="1894" /> are in serious financial difficulties and the Minister agrees that that is so. That is basically what we are talking about when the Minister refers to all the things he has done to help those people.</P>
      <P>As well as that, these people have been encouraged by the Minister and his Department and advisers that they were in for a bonanza and that all they had to do was invest money and develop their potential.  They were encouraged to borrow money.  They were encouraged by the banks, who fired money around so that some of these people could buy land. But everybody knew that the acre of land which the banks were firing money around to buy could in no way be made viable or made to produce enough to pay the interest rate on the money.</P>
      <P>When the interest rate jumped from an average 10 per cent up as high as 17 to 18 per cent, these people were in dire trouble. This is the basis of the whole problem in agriculture over the last two years.  The situation became aggravated when the farmers found that they were not able to repay this money for land which they had to buy, improvements which they had been encouraged to carry out on buildings and in regard to land reclamation. The banks gave out money easily and the progressive farmers, the average size farmers, were encouraged to do these things and almost guaranteed, you might say, that they were doing the right thing. They found then that the money which they had invested was, in most cases. producing nothing.  The interest had to be paid on it and they started selling off valuable stock to pay interest on their loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of some small farmers who were in such a state that they applied to the health board for subsistence.  I have said this before in the House and can produce those people.  They owe money to our financial institutions some of which are proposing to demand extra interest if farmers want to extend their loans.  Some farmers are concerned at the restrictive measures being introduced on loans which they cannot repay.  In that situation we talk about price increases.  Everyone likes to think that he has made a great bargain and I am not blaming the Minister <Col N="1895" /> personally &mdash; he may have done his best but it was not good enough.  When you are dealing with an 18 per cent inflation rate and the people are getting an increase of only 13 per cent &mdash; even if they get the entire 13 per cent, which we all know that they will not &mdash; how can anyone say that this increase is something to be proud of?</P>
    <P>I appreciate that it is not easy for anyone from our country to negotiate with the other nine Ministers, but we in this House have a duty to make it possible for these people to survive and they will not survive on the 13 per cent increase.  The Minister has acknowledged that these people are in dire trouble but that is not enough.  If a man was hungry at the existing rate of inflation two or three years ago and another 18 to 20 per cent goes on to that inflation rate, he will die of hunger.  The farmer is in a comparable position.</P>
    <P>The Minister boasted in the budget about what he did but the basic question is, has he brought the small farmer any help?  That is the man I am interested in, not the man whose income has dropped from £30,000 to £20,000.  I am talking about the man who is the backbone of the farming industry and is on a subsistence allowance.  The increase of 13 per cent is more than eaten up by the inflation rate.  It is the Government's duty, through the Central Bank or in some other way, to forbid the imposition of crippling penalties on people who are unable to repay their loans or who want loans extended for a term, as is happening at present.  It is the duty of the Government to take control, if necessary, of those financial institutions so that that policy will not be implemented.  If the Government have not control of investment and of the method of investing advantageously in certain necessary areas, they will not be able to carry out a programme or a policy.  Down through the years we have been unable to do this.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in anyone's mind &mdash; and the Minister, if he is honest, will admit as much &mdash; that the small farmer who was very near the breadline last year is worse off now with the increases coming <Col N="1896" /> from Brussels.  He has not solved the problem of his debts.  These people are trying to advance the output of the nation and carry out improvements in the agricultural sector.  A very good case can be made to force the financial institutions to take a lower interest rate.  If we have not legal authority to do that, we must negotiate a fairly substantial subsidy to free these people from their crippling financial burden.</P>
    <P>The effects of these crippling interest rates flow over into the agricultural service industry.  Only last week I spoke to a man who has 30 people employed mostly in the agricultural service industry, but also in the motor sector.  That man has in stock 12 Fordson tractors, each worth £12,000 to £16,000, and he is surviving for the last year on the sale of spare parts. He just cannot sell the tractors to the farmers and the 30 jobs are in danger.  No farmer will borrow without a clear understanding of what his interest rate will be over the period of the loan and he fears that the same thing will happen again, that the interest rates will jump from 10 per cent to 16 per cent during the term of his loan.  If we cannot control interest rates we cannot control anything.  There is no use in people saying they can produce an economic plan or a plan for agriculture if they cannot control the interest rates of our financial institutions and if they cannot control investment and give preferential treatment to productive investment in agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is very seldom that anyone on this side of the House can say so, but I agree totally with one thing in the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  &ldquo;Manifesto&rdquo; is a dirty word with Fianna Fáil now, but their manifesto stated that agriculture should form the main thrust of the recovery of the economy. That was said at the time when the Minister's party were going to get the country moving.  They got it moving backwards.</P>

      <P>Be that as it may, that was the sentiment expressed in the manifesto.  I agree thoroughly with it.  I also agree with the next part of it, which <Col N="1897" /> says that the volume of output must be raised.  It has not been raised.  In fact there was a reduction in milk production last year of about 3 per cent.</P>
      <P>What appeared on paper in the manifesto was right and I subscribe to it.  It goes on to say &mdash; and this is the real laugh: &ldquo;and everything we produce must be processed and packaged through to consumption stage&rdquo;.  But it is too serious for laughing.  We know what happened in the processing industry and we know why.  I can quote an article by Aengus Fanning, agricultural correspondent, in yesterday's <i>Independent</i> reporting on a press conference held by the meat processors. I need only read this article to condemn the price package that the Minister brought home.  I shall only quote a short extract which says that more than 25,000 jobs have been created abroad in factories which process Irish feed and cattle exports, while at home 2,500 meat plant workers have been laid off.  This is in an economy where we have 126,000 registered unemployed.  This was the alarming picture, the correspondent says, presented by the country's meat export industry at a Dublin news conference two days ago at which the grim warning was issued that more factory closures were inevitable unless there was urgent remedial action from the Government and the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no remedial action; nothing is being done.  There is no marketing of our product.  In talking of the service industries I have mentioned and the small farmers we include over 45 per cent of our population, and this is the greatest potential area for job creation that exists in our present circumstances.  The Government have failed to exploit this potential in any way.  The agricultural correspondent I have quoted, I think the Minister will agree, is a fair commentator and has often praised the Minister when he thought he deserved it, but this is the report that he gives on this situation.  I believe the meat processors were not interested in political considerations but in saving the industry which is giving much-needed employment that is now dwindling.  It seems nothing is being done to improve the situation.  I know that the <Col N="1898" /> Minister has brought in a Bill to set up a marketing board, but nothing is being done to market our produce properly or to encourage people to add value to our produce at the factories.  These factories are in unfair competition with live exports to places outside the EEC where they will obtain a bigger subsidy.  This is what the processors are complaining about, if I were to quote the whole article. The Department and the Minister, it appears, are allowing this great industry to dwindle and fall by the wayside.  If that happens it will be a sad day for beef producers, those who produce store cattle or anything else and it will be particularly sad for those employed on the processing side.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to put this before the Government and ask what will be done to rectify the situation.  As the Minister knows, our live cattle exports, some of which are going to Libya, have gone up and up while the number available for processing in the factories has dwindled. I agree with the Minister that the price at present is good.  But is it true that there is a greater subsidy for exporting live cattle outside the EEC than there is for exporting fresh meat?  If that is true it is something we cannot accept; it is something the Minister should thump the table about.  I believe there is some little concession in the British situation where we are driving cattle over the Border. The Minister is not far from that area and he knows where it is worth £100.  There is some relief in that, but we still have not reached an equitable situation.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous to suggest that because Britain is a food exporting country, factories in Northern Ireland should be in a more advantageous position than factories across the Border.  We cannot continue to accept that.  It is the Minister's duty to see that the meat processors have a marketing agency properly geared to assess the market, to know what is required and ensure that our factories are producing it and getting the highest possible price available on all markets.  We have a duty to see that the processors have an equal opportunity with the live exporters no matter where the exports go.  We should accept no agreement <Col N="1899" /> which would debar us from achieving that situation, because it is vital that we should use the potential of our meat industry to give employment and help our balance of payments.  It is economic madness to sell the beef without the processing and the employment involved in processing.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest nor do I think anybody suggests &mdash; and I have discussed this with people in the trade union movement &mdash; that live exports should be stopped altogether. I think that is not practicable at this point.  But I say that no Minister should accept the situation in which there would be an advantage in exporting live to Libya or some other place over exporting fresh meat.  That seems to be the case, according to the meeting to which I referred held only two days ago.  They are calling for action.  In addition, during the past few years there has been a reduction of more than 450,000 in our cattle numbers.  That should not have been allowed happen.  It is something that will not be capable of being put right overnight.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister and his predecessor are aware that the main reason for this drop in numbers was that we allowed our calves to be exported in large numbers to Italy.  Naturally, the dairy man selling calves will be anxious to get the best price possible but we should have introduced, as I advocated here two-and-a-half years ago, a calf levy equal to that which was available to those in Italy and elsewhere who were buying our calves.  Our failure in this area led to our calves being exported at a time when they should have been kept at home in order to keep up our herd numbers.  We will now have to spend from two to three years building up our herd again.  It is of vital importance that we begin immediately so far as that task is concerned, not only in terms of the welfare of our farmers but in terms of the welfare of our economy generally. What has happened in this respect can be compared with the situation in the famine years when the people were so hungry that they ate the seed potatoes with the result that there were none for planting in the following years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1900" /> The Government should be at liberty to introduce a calf subsidy at the same rate as those subsidies which apply in other EEC countries in this respect. While we are awaiting the necessary action being taken, the herd numbers continue to decline and people in other countries have an advantage over us in terms of buying calves.  It is likely that irreparable harm has been done by the export of so many of our calves, especially heifer calves, to date.  We should be encouraging calf-to-beef development. I understand that there are new methods whereby this procedure can be effected in two years.  If we are not able to get from the EEC the necessary moneys to subsidise over calf producers, we must tackle the task ourselves.  I do not have much confidence in the Minister's promise in this regard for July next. Action is needed immediately! it is already long overdue.</P>
    <P>Another area of failure so far as the Minister is concerned is that of the vegetable processing industry.  In the Carlow area local farmers who contracted during the past few years for the supply of 1,000 acres of vegetables per year to the Erin Food plant there are being told that this plant is to close at the end of June.  In a letter to me the Minister's secretary informed me that the Minister was looking to the IDA for a replacement for this industry.  That was some time ago.  I was informed that the board of the Sugar Company had decided to close this plant at Carlow.  This, in itself, is a reflection of the policy being pursued by the Government so far as agriculture is concerned. What the IDA would have in mind would be a replacement industry but where would this leave the vegetable growers concerned?  It appears that no attempt was made by anyone to assess what was needed in the market with the result that we continued with the dehydrating food processing procedure long after that was out-dated and when we should have been proceeding to frozen food processing.</P>
    <P>It has been said that our imports of food are to the extent of £450 million.  In fairness it should be said that not all of these foodstuffs would have been agricultural <Col N="1901" /> products.  Presumably, the figures included also imports of fruit, tea and so on but we are aware that there were imported directly competing goods to the value of £150 million.  It is disgraceful that the Minister and the Government should have allowed this to happen.  It is a national disgrace that a country in which is to be found perhaps the best land in the world so far as the production of vegetables is concerned, should have imported foodstuffs 8 to 10 per cent of which was in direct competition with foodstuffs grown at home.</P>
    <P>In their manifesto, Fianna Fáil declared that agriculture should form the main thrust of the recovery of our economy, that the volume of our output should be increased and that everything we produced should be processed.  The failures of the Government that I have highlighted here this evening put that manifesto into perspective.  The Government have reneged totally on what was promised in that document.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the people who are employed in the food processing industry just as I am concerned about the farmers.  These people are just about earning a living.  Can the Minister tell us of anything that he has done to resolve the problems?  Has any effort been made to implement the undertakings in the manifesto in terms of agriculture?  The Minister should admit that no such effort has been made.  We hear of nothing but closures in the vegetable processing industry.  In the meat processing industry 2,500 people have lost their jobs and the predictions are that the situation will become worse unless positive action is taken by the Government or by the EEC, or by both, to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister's intention is but I should like to hear from him in this regard.  There is no use giving us the same kind of crap that is in that manifesto unless there is some positive action taken immediately to carry it out because absolutely nothing has been done in that area except to effect redundancies, closures and so on.</P>
    <P>Smaller farmers throughout the country <Col N="1902" /> over the years have hired people who set themselves up as agricultural contractors.  At one time a farmer could reclaim the VAT but the VAT on these people's work now constitutes a crippling imposition on small farmers.  People have been getting out of this activity completely, people who undertook work for small farmers, people who set themselves up with machinery to undertake work on a hired basis for farmers.  These people find now that they must collect VAT, which has increased.  This increases the cost of that man's administration and also that of the farmer.  At one time a farmer was exempt from VAT and could reclaim it if he had to pay it, and apparently in most cases he did not pay it at all.  This is an impossible situation for small farmers, those who cannot afford to purchase the necessary machinery themselves. Because of this VAT imposition they are unable to get anyone to undertake the necessary work on their land.  It constitutes a crippling burden and has put most of these people out of business.  Most of them have given up the business completely on account of this surcharge.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the small farmers in particular, those who have borrowed and owe money over the past two years. I have been told by people in this position that the banks, and even the ACC, a Government agency, have called them in and warned that if they are unable to meet their commitments there will be a surcharge on their loans.  I want to know from the Minister if that is correct and, if so, what he intends doing about it.  We in the Labour Party believe that the Government should have control of the financial institutions.  We are not saying this just for sport.  Indeed, listening to people talking about that statement of the Labour Party sometimes one would think we were going to take a gun, go in and take over the banks.  Indeed, while on that subject, some people are doing that already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not the Labour Party, but there are plenty at that.  That <Col N="1903" /> is another day's work.  But we are saying that a Government that cannot control investment, cannot ensure that subsidised investment is available in the areas most in need of it, particularly agriculture because of its job creation potential and because of the balance of payments position, is completely ineffective.  Money borrowed with a view to increased productivity should be made available at a subsidised rate so that these people can make some attempt at paying.  This high interest rate has discouraged farmers and meant that it will be impossible to get a farmer who may have borrowed over the last three or four years to do so again.  He has been crippled by these rising interest rates while his income has fallen.  He will not go into that situation again unless he is given an undertaking that money will be available to him at a reasonable rate of interest, that the Government either have power, or will take power, to ensure that money is made available to these people at a favourable rate.</P>
      <P>There is no use saying that these farmers should go and talk to the banks.  There is no experience like that of the practical, down to earth type of the unfortunate man who owes this money in the bank.  I know from these people that they are being told that if they cannot meet their commitments now &mdash; and that is obvious &mdash; there will be a surcharge on their interest over a period of years.  It is about time action was taken in this direction.  I believe this is happening in the Government-sponsored money lending agency, the ACC.  If it is not, let the Minister say so.  Certainly, it is happening in commercial banks and I have evidence of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps 13 per cent was as much as the Minister could achieve, but that is not sufficient.  I think we have proved beyond doubt here that it is not sufficient in the case of the farmer who found himself in that situation two to three years ago. Certainly, it is not sufficient with an inflation rate of up to 20 per cent and which has every sign of being 21 per cent next year, according to current predictions. The Minister knows quite well that a lot of the 13 per cent he mentioned will not <Col N="1904" /> go into the farmer's pockets.  I know that and so does anybody else connected with the business in any way.  It is a rate of 13 per cent on people who were already working from a very low base, people who were almost on the poverty line at the time the Minister started to talk about the 13 per cent.  Therefore 13 per cent, when considered against an inflation rate of 21 per cent before year end, will not be sufficient to maintain a farmer even at last year's level.  It was acknowledged here by everybody, including the Minister, that farmer's incomes had dropped drastically last year.</P>
    <P>The Minister set up the CBF last year. Would he tell us what, if anything, they are doing to ensure that our beef is properly processed?  As was said in the manifesto, we must produce, we must process and package through to the consumption stage.  Has any progress been made on that?  Is anything being done to market our beef, vegetables and agricultural produce generally?  We had people here who went to tremendous trouble to purchase the necessary equipment to grade their potatoes in accordance with an EEC directive.  Now we have potatoes being imported from outside the EEC, not graded at all, which are being thrown onto the Irish market, coming in, I understand, through illegal routes, in competition with the home-grown potato.  Yet they are not of a quality fit for human consumption.  We are not doing anything to protect these people who have invested heavily.  Have our Government, our processors and packers done anything to protect the native producer of potatoes?  At present there are on sale throughout the country packaged oven chips from outside the EEC &mdash; one brings them home and pops them in the oven &mdash; while our potatoes remain marketed at a ridiculously low price.  In the election manifesto on which the Minister's party was elected there was an undertaking given that we would process all our food. Has the Minister carried out any investigation of this situation?  Have they made any advance in that area?  If they have not they stand condemned and they should have the decency to admit that and resign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent agreement on agricultural prices has to be viewed against a background of budgetary problems within the EEC and the known opposition of certain member states to a high price increase.  At the same time, it is a fact that farmers' incomes have declined seriously over the past two years not alone here but in the EEC generally.  The Government recognise the special difficulties of our own farmers and do not need to be convinced of the need to restore growth and prosperity in the agricultural sector as quickly as possible.  The agreement negotiated last week by the Minister for Agriculture is a tremendous step forward towards the attainment of the objective that our agriculture sector is in a position to work at full capacity.  Indeed, it is fair to say that never before has the annual EEC price fixing been of such importance for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons for the decline in agricultural incomes are well known and analysed. The industry has been caught in a price cost squeeze.  Following a period of exceptional growth in prices after our entry to EEC, our farmers found themselves in a situation where price increases no longer compensated them for rising costs.  The main thrust of the Government's policy on agriculture has been directed towards reversing this situation. Considerable time and attention has been devoted the problem because it is essential for our economic well-being that our agriculture is at full strength.  The Government have shown their commitment to agriculture and their determination to solve the problems through the various measures they have taken to help the farming community during the past year. For example, last autumn swift and effective action was taken to solve the problems that existed then as regards supplies of fodder.  The result was that many thousands of farmers were helped to avert what could have been a serious fodder shortage.  Later on in the year, action was taken to help farmers with credit difficulties by means of Euro-loans through the ACC and the associated banks and the remission of the second moiety of the rates.  These were areas of particular concern <Col N="1906" /> to farmers at that time and the Government showed they were willing to act.</P>
    <P>An area crucial to the immediate financial position of farmers is the system of agricultural rates.  Arising from the budget, farmers under £50 rateable valuation have full relief, and those between £50 and £70 RV get 50 per cent relief. These measures benefit 49,000 farmers and mean a reduction of £19.6 million in the farmers' rates bill for 1981.  The situation now is that of the 150,000 farmers in this country 125,000 no longer pay any rates.  In Wexford, in which Deputy D'Arcy will be interest, 3,500 farmers from a total of 5,000 will not have to pay rates this year.  These concessions are of real benefit to farmers and, like the other measures I have mentioned, concentrate on areas suggested in negotiations by the farm organisations.  The measures taken in the autumn and more recently in the budget were worth almost £75 million to the farming community.  They are worthwhile and cannot be dismissed as being of no benefit.</P>
    <P>The recent prices package has been the most significant boost Irish agriculture has received for many years and complements the other measures taken by the Government.  The outcome from these negotiations has been most satisfactory and those who claim otherwise are ignoring the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>When Deputy D'Arcy talks about his colleague, Deputy Clinton, it reminds me that he is a member of the European Parliament that voted for a 12 per cent increase for farmers this year.  I did not hear him speaking too loudly about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Plus the devaluation which will be 16 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of decisions taken by the Agricultural Council, Irish farm prices will be increased in 1981 by almost 14 per cent.  When account is taken of the budgetary situation and the attitude of some other member states, the outcome represents an excellent negotiating achievement.  In these circumstances it is easy to see that the best possible outcome was secured for Irish farmers and that there was nothing further <Col N="1907" /> to be gained.  To have protracted the negotiating by holding out for some further benefit which might or might not have been achieved would have meant the loss of about £20 million per month in immediate gain to our farmers.</P>
      <P>The deal means an injection of £215 million into Irish agriculture with an additional £26 million for the second year of the Irish package.  By any standards that is significant money and would have been unthinkable a few months ago.</P>
      <P>When Deputy D'Arcy spoke earlier I was not here but I was listening to him. Some few months ago they were going to solve all the evils of Irish agriculture with a six point plan which, so far as I could see, they must have got from the daily papers.  If I remember rightly it amounted to £70 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, because the negotiations were concluded early, farmers know where they stand as regards prices and for the first time in many years the marketing year can commence on schedule.  It is strange to hear certain people condemning the attainment of an early agreement.  The milk aspect of the agreement is particularly satisfactory with an increase of almost 9p per gallon of which 1p is to provide for increased processing costs.  A major benefit has been the removal of the threat of the super levy.  From the outset the Minister for Agriculture has been vehement in his opposition to this proposal.  Our dairy farmers can face the future with confidence and with the guarantee of a satisfactory price and the removal of the threat of penalties on increased production. This is important for the development of our dairy industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards beef, the producer support <Col N="1908" /> price will be raised immediately by 9p per lb and this will be increased to over 10p per lb by the end of the year.  When we consider the importance of beef production in this country the value of this increase is apparent.  In addition, the Minister for Agriculture secured two important concessions in the beef sector. We have been allowed to maintain our special derogation which enables us to intervene in the market as long as our prices remain under 85 per cent of the guide price.  The rate of variable premium has been equalised between the UK and Northern Ireland.  These are important matters for the beef industry.  I have mentioned beef and dairying because they comprise such a large part of our agriculture. Major increases have also been secured in other sectors.  In the case of cereals the agreement means a price increase of 10.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>The new intervention prices for Ireland for barley and feed wheat on 1 August will be over £113 per tonne, while the reference price for milling wheat will be almost £127 per tonne.  These are significant increases which, combined with the anticipated increase in the acreage of cereals, improvements in yields, and general technological progress, will have a substantial contribution to increasing farm incomes.  The overall level of support price increases and the slightly lower increase in target prices, on which minimum import prices are based, are designed to encourage the usage of Community cereals in animal feed and to make cereal substitutes less attractive to compounders.  In the Irish context, the direct effect of the prices package will be increases in the prices paid by millers and merchants to growers.</P>
    <P>The cereals price increase compares with 13.3 per cent for milk, 14.3 per cent for beef and 15.4 per cent for pigs.  While the cereals increase may result in higher feed costs, any such increases will be more than offset by increases secured in the other sectors and the overall package will improve the relationship of livestock prices with feed prices.</P>
    <P>There is scope for a continuing expansion in grain production.  While our overall production has been increasing in <Col N="1909" /> recent years the increases secured have only been marginal.  Winter wheat sowings are well up on previous years and preliminary soundings suggest that an increased acreage of barley will be sown in 1981.  Unfortunately the same cannot be said for spring wheat which, mainly because of the disastrous harvesting conditions encountered in 1979 and in 1980 and the consequent scarcity of seed wheat, will be well down in 1981.  Even at this late stage I would hope to see a spurt in spring wheat sowings, and the recent spell of fine weather encourages me to hope that our acreage forecasts will not turn out to be as low as was feared.</P>
    <P>Increased production of spring wheat, essential for bread-making, can have a number of beneficial effects.  It would lessen our dependence on imported wheat, thereby improving our balance of payments and safeguarding vital food supplies.  Wheat is a valuable cash crop and, given reasonable weather conditions, can provide an excellent return for those who sow it.</P>
    <P>The EEC price negotiations which I referred to earlier on should help in providing our farmers with the necessary degree of confidence to press ahead with grain production.  The percentage increases in cereal prices, together with the new green rates adopted, represent one of the best results ever achieved in these negotiations.</P>
    <P>For 1981 at least, the threat posed by the introduction of co-responsibility measures has been removed.  The broad principles of this proposal have been accepted, but it is clear that the Commision will have to come up with a much more realistic mechanism than that proposed for 1981 if they hope to secure general agreement.</P>
    <P>We have long been in the business of exporting agricultural products.  It is unfortunate that in the case of some sectors at least our trading pattern has changed to the extent that we have become large-scale importers.  Wheat is a case in point.  In 1980 we sowed less than half of what we sowed ten years earlier.  Let us reverse this trend and aim to produce the bulk of our milling wheat <Col N="1910" /> requirements while continuing to produce not alone enough barley for domestic use but also maintain and, if possible expand, the valuable export trade we have built up in barley and malt.</P>
    <P>The most significant feature of the recent prices package from our viewpoint in so far as sugar is concerned is the retention of our A quota of 182,000 tonnes.  A year ago we were very worried that the sugar regime being proposed by the EEC Commission would result in a substantial reduction in our basic A quota with adverse consequences for the industry. In practice, of course, the maintenance of the quota will not be of benefit unless the area under beet is expanded to produce at least 182,000 tonnes of sugar.  Production of this quantity of sugar, when coupled with the agreed price increases, will help to redress the difficult financial situation which the Irish Sugar Company find themselves in at present.  This year the company are making a new drive to expand the acreage of beet.  They are anxious to have at least 90,000 acres grown and they are not limiting offers of contracts to existing growers.  I would like to urge all concerned to co-operate fully with the company in their drive to ensure the security of the sugar industry and its thousands of jobs for the future.  All this means that producers will get a higher price for their produce and indeed I might mention that the results secured in the agreement would have been outside the most optimistic predictions a few weeks ago.</P>
    <P>From an Irish point of view there is the added gain of a special package of aid over two years for Irish farmers.  For some months past the Minister for Agriculture has been pressing the European Commission, and the Council of Ministers of the EEC in Brussels to grant special Community aid to improve the farm income situation here.  This was a long and strenuous effort, but it has now paid off.  The Council gave its agreement to a series of special measures to operate in this country over a two-year period.  The Community will provide about £31 million for those measures.  Our Exchequer <Col N="1911" /> will supply some £20 million, giving the very substantial total of £51 million.</P>

      <P>The special measures for Ireland focus on the livestock sector.  Their aim and their justification is to improve incomes, but I expect them to do much more than that.  They are designed also to encourage quality cattle production and to increase the amount of high-quality feed available in the winter months.  These are areas where progress is needed if our cattle and beef production is to remain competitive with those of other countries.  The special Community measures will enable us to undertake improvements which our Exchequer resources would not otherwise have allowed.  We will, in the first place, be intensifying progeny testing and performance testing of beef bulls to ensure a continued increase in the genetic merit of bulls used at AI stations.</P>

    <P>Secondly, the new measures will enable us to offer a grant of £5 per cow for artificial insemination.  By encouraging farmers to use AI &mdash; which is of course in their own interest &mdash; we will be raising the yield and efficiency of our herds.  As I have said, cattle feed is also an element needing improvement and the next two special measures are geared to that aspect.  One of them is a subsidy on the use of lime.  It is unfortunate, but understandable, that many farmers have tended to reduce lime applications because of income difficulties.  The new measure should help to bring applications back to normal levels and should promote improvement of grass production. There will also be a subsidy of £3 per tonne to farmers making silage for the first time.  In spite of the advantages of silage, hay-making is still widespread in <Col N="1912" /> many parts of the country.  The new subsidy should encourage many farmers to go over to silage.</P>
    <P>The next item in the special measures package is to help farmers in meeting the cost of pre-movement tests on cattle.  Aid of up to £4 per animal for a two year period will be provided partly by the Exchequer and partly by the Community. Finally, the premium on suckler cows is to be doubled thanks to an additional Community contribution.</P>
    <P>All this amounts to a very significant encouragement to the livestock sector which is the fundamental area in our agricultural economy.  When supplemented by farmers' own efforts to increase their productivity I am confident that the special measures, together with the unprecedentedly high financial benefits from the rest of the Brussels' decision, will put our agriculture again on the path of expansion.</P>
    <P>The position is that decisions taken over the past nine months will inject over £300 million into Irish agriculture from various sources.  The significance of this money is all the more apparent when one considers the limits on Exchequer resources and indeed the limits on EEC funds.  I am confident that our farming industry has now received the kind of money necessary to arrest the decline and to give it the necessary foothold to get back on the road to growth and progress. We are now in a situation where the difficulties of the past two years can be left behind and I think that is a very worthwhile achievement.  Individual farmers will readily appreciate the value of this package when they see the benefits in the form of higher prices for their produce.  They will see that the results cannot be glibly dismissed.  The other main determinant of progress in the future is of course the response at farm level and the degree to which output and productivity is expanded.  We all know that there is scope for real and worthwhile gains in this area.  Any progress we can make in improving productivity and output will make the benefits of the prices package all the more worthwhile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The sheep and pig industry are very important areas and the sheep industry is in sharp contrast with the pig industry because sheep production is now a very large export oriented business. The export market for lamb has become very large and it will grow further.  Sheep have done well in the past year and sheep producers and processors will agree with me there.  The new common market system which came into force in October last has done a lot of good.  Prices increased more than expected from October onwards.  They increased so much that the ewe premium was much smaller than was expected.  However, producers in general were at no loss.</P>
      <P>The ewe premium is intended to make up for losses in market prices so the better the price in the market the less the ewe premium will be.  However, we know that in western areas especially, some producers sold off their lambs before the new Common Market system began in October and so did not have the benefit of the higher prices.  The Minister, however, announced some weeks ago that he would increase by £2 per ewe the sheep headage which would be paid in the disadvantaged areas later this year.  This £2, along with the 92 pence ewe premium, comes fairly close to the £3.50 which was the figure forecast for the ewe premiums for the six months October 1980 to March 1981.  The reason why this ewe premium has been so low in the past year was because sheep prices increased by anything up to 40 per cent during that period. This is a far cry from what my colleague was talking about at the recent Fine Gael Ard-Fheis.  He should at least get his facts correct.  He was talking about a ewe premium of £7 for this year when in actual fact it was only £3.50 for the last six months.  Just to highlight the situation I am stating now that the ewe premium will be £2.92 for the six months of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the disadvantaged area scheme, I would like to say that up to now in the mountain areas the headage has been paid on the hogget ewes and mountain lambs.  Some people have been under the impression that the system of <Col N="1914" /> payment would be changed this year so as to pay &ldquo;all on the ewe&rdquo;.  I would like to say that the Minister has not yet decided what system of payment will be used but whatever he decides needs to have the approval of the EEC Commission. I am conscious that producers are anxious to know as soon as possible what system he will be operating and he will be making an announcement in the very near future.</P>

      <P>I would like to remind him of the time when the farmers were giving the calves away or selling them for less than £1 apiece.  In fact you could get a calf for nothing if you were prepared to take it.  Again, there was the disastrous situation with regard to the eradication of brucellosis and TB.  When we came back to power there had been no testing for 18 months.  That has cost the Exchequer and the farmers millions of pounds over and above what it should have cost and that cost can be laid at the feet of Deputy Mark Clinton, former Minister for Agriculture.  It was due solely to his lack of initiative and it resulted in Deputy Jim Gibbons as Minister for Agriculture having to introduce a 30-day test in an effort to remedy the situation.  Deputy D'Arcy did not tell us anything about that this evening.  I was not in the House but I heard him.  He complained about the delay in the payment of grants and he accused the Minister &mdash; he could not have <Col N="1915" /> been referring to me because he has never written to me &mdash; of delaying the payment of grants.  Now, if Deputy D'Arcy writes to me I will ensure the grants are paid promptly in Wexford or any other county.  I am putting that on the record now.  If Deputy D'Arcy has any problems I will be only too pleased to help him.  I am sure Deputy L'Estrange remembers when you could cut the calves throats in 1974 and 1975.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words about the pigmeat industry.  It has been going through a not very good time in the past year.  The industry depends very much on the home market but exports are important too and in the past year export markets, especially the British bacon market, have been very weak. Within the Common Market system there are very strict limits on what member states are allowed to do to assist industries.  This is only right because if such aids were permited then the member states with weaker resources would come off very badly indeed.  I am glad to say that some time ago the pig producers and bacon curers in this country made quite a distinct step forward.  To do this they were very much encouraged by the action of the Minister for Agriculture within the scope allowed him by the Common Market system.  I refer to the remission of veterinary fees which gives the pigmeat industry relief of £500,000 per year in each of the years 1981 and 1982.  In addition to this, the Minister decided to provide a sum of £200,000 in each of the years 1981 and 1982 to the Pigs and Bacon Commission to enable them to increase their promotion work for pigmeat.</P>
      <P>Apart from the more unified approach to marketing the outlook for the pigmeat market is now more favourable.  The new producer/bacon curer arrangements of which I have spoken is very good, but unfortunately there are a few bacon curers who still believe they can do better on their own.  I can only appeal to these people to reflect and reconsider.  Their unwillingness to co-operate may seem to them to benefit themselves but this is a very short-term outlook.</P>

The Opposition who will vote against the motion will once again try to nail the farming community back to where they were some years ago.  I want to clarify one thing for Deputy Bermingham concerning Cyprus potatoes. He should be aware, because it has widely published in the papers, that the Minister has made an order prohibiting the importation of Cyprus potatoes except under licence.  Licences will not be granted as long as we have a sufficient supply of home grown potatoes.</P>

      <P>I was very struck by the similarity between the two speeches produced here this evening by the Minister for Agriculture and his Minister of State. I expected something new from the Minister of State.  It is disappointing to see that both scripts are very similar in almost every respect down to the smallest details.  Whoever wrote the script of the Minister of State did not allow for the speed at which he reads.  He showed his experience in the House by going on for ten minutes, causing a few noisy interruptions and thereby passing the necessary amount of time.  He said in the closing part of his main script that we are now in a situation where the difficulties of the past two years can be left behind and he thought this was a very worthwhile achievement.  Anybody who believes that the difficulties of the past two years can be left behind as a result of what has happened is living in a fools' paradise because that is very far removed from the truth.  When the Minister for Agriculture spoke in Galway on 13 March he said that his aim as Minister for Agriculture was to provide the best possible support <Col N="1918" /> and incentives to Irish farmers from the Exchequer and from EEC services.  He went on to say that he would do everything possible to ensure that the industry could maximise output and reach the highest levels of efficiency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister went on to say that he would do everything possible to ensure that the industry could maximise output and reach the highest levels of efficiency.  That is a very worthwhile sentiment and I am quite sure the Minister for Agriculture was serious in his intention about doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went to Brussels the tollowing week to negotiate on behalf of the Irish farmers.  The results are evident in the remarks made by the experienced people in the different farming bodies who are intensely involved in the different farming areas in the country.  Not one of them accepted with any great enthusiasm that the result of the conclusion to these negotiations was a small step in the right direction, but in major respects there are many faults in the powers of negotiation of the Minister abroad.  It might have been better if he said before he went out what was the minimum amount he would take and not have to rely on the telephone system to consult with the Taoiseach whether he should go the whole hog and veto the arrangements <Col N="1919" /> in the light of pressure from the French people in the context of their presidential election.</P>
    <P>The result, although a brave face has been put on it by the Minister and by his Minister of State, has not been welcomed by Irish farmers.  They feel they have been let down.  I believe that, as time goes on, the results will prove that they have been let down.  It appears to me that the rules in Brussels can be bent to suit the powers that be.  I feel an essential bargaining point is the negotiating power of our Ministers abroad.  The results of the Minister's negotiations in Brussels do not bear any comparison with those of the Minister for Agriculture in the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about western farming and to address those remarks to the small farmers who have never appeared at the table in Brussels to any great extent.  It is a well known fact that the preamble to the Treaty of Rome states quite clearly that one of the objectives of the EEC was to equalise the differences which exist within the different regions of the Community and the policies to be pursued should transfer imbalances from one area to another by provision of the means to correct those imbalances and allow the different areas to compete on a more equal but more competitive footing.</P>
    <P>The western seaboard is not a uniform area and it is very difficult to implement a single policy, which would be a tailor-made model to deal with the whole of that area.  One cannot disregard history or geography.  Both of those have had a marked effect on the social and the economic development of the area.  There are many differences in the type of terrain and the areas involved that do not allow for the implementation of a single policy in agriculture or in any other sphere. There are differences of mainland and islands, coastal and hinterland, urban and rural, and developed and undeveloped areas.  They do not exhaust all the possibilities because there is also the Gaeltacht and the Galltacht.</P>
    <P>Another point emerging from the so-called experts in Europe is that if development <Col N="1920" /> is to be carried out it must be done through an overall plan and on well-defined lines.  This does not apply in the case of the measures introduced for agriculture brought back from Brussels by the Minister.  The quotations from the Minister for Agriculture are similar to the quotations from his Minister of State. Both speeches set out the historical aspect of the matter and state quite clearly that the Minister's intentions were to do the best possible for Irish farmers. However, most farming organisations have rejected the measures brought back by the Minister from Brussels.</P>
    <P>The non-allowance of the calf premium will have a major bearing on something which is crucial to the west of Ireland. We do not have the numbers of cattle required and the decline in cattle numbers has had a very serious effect on the agricultural industry.  The price of cattle has increased to a certain extent but it is quite clear that we have not sufficient cattle to enable farmers to bring their incomes up.  This will have a very serious effect on agriculture in the west during the next two or three years.</P>
    <P>The special package of measures for the development of agriculture in the west as announced recently in a press release by the Government Information Services will have an enormous bearing. This scheme has been bandied around for the past two or three years and many people are under the illusion that it will solve all problems.  This is not true because it is forgotten that the scheme is to be extended over a period of ten years and will cover 12 counties.  We are not dealing with £300 million as a single unit. According to the statement, the programme consists of a range of measures designed to improve living conditions for farmers in the west of Ireland, particularly by improving farm incomes.  It will be found, however, on looking through the list of allocations that many of them do not relate directly to farm incomes and it is untrue to say that they will have a major bearing on improving farm incomes.  The measures outlined will have only a minimal effect on incomes.</P>
    <P>The programme provides for the following aids: rural water supplies, £38 million; <Col N="1921" /> rural and farm roads, £44 million; electrification, a total of £13 million; 70 per cent grants for land improvement, £78 million; 40 per cent grants for on-farm investment, £58 million.  New developments in forestry are to be brought into operation costing £18 million and a further £8 million is to be given for the development of agricultural training at 22 centres.  Another £32 million is to be spent on marketing and research.  Of those measures, the only ones that would improve farm incomes are land improvement and on-farm investment and the amounts provided are £78 million and £58 million, a total of £136 million.</P>
    <P>If one takes the £300 million as a single unit and spreads it over ten years the provision amounts to £30 million per year.  Assuming an average rate of inflation of 10 per cent, less than half the current rate, there would be a reduction in real terms of £3 million in the second year and at the end of the tenth year the £300 million, deflated over that period, would amount to only £165 million.  Taking an average rate of inflation of 15 per cent the £300 million would be reduced to about £97 million.  Taking an inflation rate of 20 per cent, the sum would be very insignificant in today's terms assuming that inflation and other costs within the bureaucracy have to be taken from it.</P>
    <P>We are told that the various Ministers for the Environment, Energy and Fisheries and Forestry will be making announcements within the next few weeks.  However, I should like the Minister to tell us what co-ordination body will receive this money.  Will it be the Department of Finance, who will allocate it to the other Departments for expenditure on the various projects?  Will the Department of Agriculture be the co-ordinating body or does the Minister intend to set up a special co-ordinating committee or agency to oversee the expenditure of this money?</P>
    <P>The sum of £38 million is to be spent on rural water supplies and this is a very worthwhile project.  Such schemes have made a significant improvement during the past few years.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify who will be charged with the <Col N="1922" /> responsibility for expending this money in the best possible way.  The improvement of rural and farm roads is very necessary in the west where many isolated farms are served only by tracks and cannot be approached by most vehicles. Many roads are in a desperate condition and the proposed expenditure is most welcome.  However, when it is spread over ten years it amounts to only £4.4 million per year and when various administrative costs are taken into account the provision amounts to very little indeed.</P>
    <P>The same applies in respect of the electrification schemes.  Is the money to be spent on subsidies for new applicants for electricity supply who are being forced at present to build houses close to existing ESB lines to reduce costs?  Are there to be measures to help special category applicants who are not already receiving electricity supplies?  If so, is there to be a continuation of the scheme introduced under the 1976 Act?</P>
    <P>Regarding the £78 million for land improvement.  I would ask whether this is to replace existing land improvement grants or whether it will be used to top up those grants.  Is the £58 million for farm investment an addition to the farm modernisation scheme in relation to buildings?  The new measures propose 40 per cent grants in aid and, while that is welcome, there is no clarification as to how the money will be spent or whether it is in addition to existing measures.</P>
    <P>The interest subsidy proposed over a two-year period for a calf to beef system is not relevant to small farmers in the west.  Anyone involved in agriculture knows that there will be very few applicants for this subsidy because they cannot operate this scheme on their small holdings. The quality of the land leaves much to be desired and improvement works involve access facilities, drainage, soil treatment and so on.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify whether a special co-ordinating body is to be set up to oversee the expenditure of these moneys or whether the funds are to be given to the Department of Finance or the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State criticised the speech made by Deputy D'Arcy at the <Col N="1923" /> recent Fine Gael Ard-Fheis, but he did not refer to a statement made by the Minister himself on television that if there was a shortfall in the amount available from Brussels the Exchequer would top it up.  There has not been any reference to that, nor has there been reference to the amount needed to top it up.  The Minister might clarify that point.</P>
    <P>The western drainage scheme needs to be looked at and the Minister is acutely aware of this problem. Grant applications made at the end of 1979 are only now being dealt with.  This is very unfair to young farmers who want to carry out drainage work on their land.  Their applications cannot be accepted because of the very serious delays in assessments and in drawing up plans.</P>
    <P>The grants are not inflation linked.  The Minister should introduce a scheme similar to that operated by the Department of the Environment which is an index-linked scheme for house building.  If a farmer is eligible for a 40 per cent grant in respect of farm buildings by the time the work has been completed the grant will amount to only 15 per cent to 18 per cent.  That is a very serious fall-back from what he was promised.  The introduction of an index-linked scheme would provide farmers with a level of grant equivalent to what they are promised.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the lime subsidy although welcome is not sufficient.  Lime usage in the country as a whole decreased at a staggering rate in the past three years.  In 1978, 2 million tons of ground limestone was spread; this declined to 1.5 million tons in 1979, and it declined further to 900,000 tons in 1980.  That is a stunning decrease of 55 per cent in three years.  This should be looked at again because lime is a basic essential for soil development.</P>
    <P>The hill sheep farmers of the west are in dire straits.  There is very little integration between them and the lowland sheep men.  The costs involved are very great for the hill sheep farmer.  The mortality rate would be about 14 per cent of lambs born in the first year and about 18 per cent of second year wethers.  This indicates <Col N="1924" /> that a hill sheep farmer would be rearing about .6 of a lamb per ewe, and often they cannot even sell the produce off the hill.  This must be looked at very seriously because these people have to contend with difficult physical barriers, poor drainage, a vast expanse of mountainside and so on.  A scheme to provide feeding without too much cost must be introduced.  It is difficult to get people to invest a lot of money when they know it will not pay them to do so.</P>
    <P>So far nobody has mentioned that Údarás na Gaeltachta in Kerry appear to be topping up agricultural grants by giving £200 to farmers who buy bulk milk tankers.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point.  If those grants can be extended to the west there are three Gaeltacht areas in my constituency and the grants would be more than welcome.</P>
    <P>The rabbit population has not been mentioned.  They are damaging small farms, especially those in sandy areas of the west.  There has been a tremendous increase in the rabbit population.  I am led to believe that two rabbits have an enormous potential for generating their own species.  I am told they could have over 10 million offspring in three years. It is no wonder the rabbit is always smiling.</P>

      <P>I had a question down to the Minister for Agriculture about this and his reply does not tell what needs to be done.  I do not know if all our farmers are expected to run around with snares trying to catch these animals, or if they are to shoot them, but the reply does not indicate that myxomatosis is a notifiable disease.  Something must be done about this situation.  It is not fair to refer these problems to the advisory services because all they can suggest is that farmers shoot or snare the rabbits.  The Minister is aware of this situation because the farmers of the west are writing to his Department looking for this elusive myxomatosis rabbit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Increased farm output will inevitably require a higher level of farm investment.  The Government have set out their Investment Plan for 1981 in a detailed White Paper published earlier this year.  This plan is designed to bring the Irish economy in good shape through the present difficult period brought on by the recession in the world economy, and will create a basis on which faster national growth can be secured when the expected upturn in world trade and output develops later this year.</P>
      <P>This investment plan allocates £141 million for agriculture in 1981, which together with capital funds of over £12 million provided directly by the EEC, will be invested, firstly through the farm modernisation scheme, and capital expenditure by ACOT on agricultural colleges, farm training centres and the Western Resource Development Centre and secondly, in arterial drainage, and finally through the ACC.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the investment programme reinforces other substantial and wide-ranging measures recently introduced by the Government to aid agriculture. These special measures, which are additional to the many aids for agriculture already in operation, included not only increased allocations and grants for the farm modernisation scheme, the disadvantaged areas scheme, the new beef cow suckler scheme and other schemes, but also reduced interest loans for farmers from the ACC and the associated banks and arrangements for restructuring existing borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These arrangements for restructuring by the lending institutions were undertaken following discussions with the Government on the credit problems of farmers. These problems have been the subject of intensive study by the Department of Agriculture under my direction. I have met the representatives of the lending institutions and the farming organisations on a number of occasions and the Government are now giving the most careful consideration to what effective steps can be taken to help farmers who are in difficulty.  Any steps which we <Col N="1926" /> take will necessarily have to involve the lending institutions themselves.  At the same time, we must have regard for EEC involvement, particularly for the possibility of some help coming from FEOGA or other Community funds for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The criticism so far today has been directly along the lines that the Minister in the negotiations in Brussels, where he successfully secured £215 million, should have been able to get more.  I joined the Minister in those negotiations and had a first hand opportunity to evaluate the effort he made on behalf of the Irish farmers and of our economy.  I am fully satisfied that he could not have negotiated a more successful package.  Independent observers and people who had an opportunity to assess the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the budgetary problems in Brussels and the individual problems affecting many of the economies of the Community have only to think of the strongest economy, Germany, which has a budgetary deficit of £8 million this year, to realise the difficulties that faced the Minister in these negotiations.</P>
    <P>Those negotiations were hard fought. The fact that the Minister succeeded and that the negotiations were concluded so that the tax proposals could be brought into effect on last Monday is a tribute to him and his colleagues in the Council of Ministers.  It was necessary for Ministers to reach agreement so that the price rises would be effective at an early date.  The many obstacles in the way of reaching agreement had to be overcome.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy in his contribution sought to ignore the external problems. He endeavoured to place all the economic problems that face the country at the door of the Government.  He must admit that the level of inflation that exists now is similar to that which existed under the National Coalition and that there are external difficulties over which a small open economy such as ours does not have much control.  The option in relation to inflation because of those external pressures is to close the door, to let people join the dole queues and adopt policies similar to those a Government not far from here decided to adopt.  The Government <Col N="1927" /> are satisfied that, with our young, well-educated population and so many people about to seek employment, that is not the answer.  Therefore, we must sometimes suffer price increases which, in some instances, are quite high.  We must do so to ensure that companies and enterprises are secure so that jobs are secure.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy suggested that the Minister should have succeeded in getting a calf subsidy and indicated that, because he did not, calf prices dropped by £20 per head last week.  He sought to prove that by telling the House he had been selling calves since last January and had been at markets weekly.  He told us he was fully abreast with what was happening. However, it appears that he did not take his calves to Enniscorthy, his own home town&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or he was offering inferior quality calves on the market because the price rise since the Ministers returned from Brussels ten days ago has been on average of the order of £3 per head at five representative marts throughout the country.  A report of those marts is sent to Brussels weekly as a guide for calf prices.  Over recent months the price of calves in general has been up by 48 per cent.  In average terms, beef steers, forward stores, light stores and calf prices were higher last year than at any time since our accession to the EEC.  The percentage increase in price for beef steers compared with the same period last year is 15.3 per cent.  Forward stores increased by 20 per cent, light stores by 21 per cent and calves by 38 per cent.</P>

      <P>The supply of cows going to our factory for slaughter over the first two months of this year was down by 40 per cent.  I contend that those figures are the first real signs of recovery in agriculture. Farmers are keeping their cows. The buoyancy in calf prices and the confidence to keep cows on the land and put <Col N="1928" /> them in calf is an indication that we are on the road back to recovery after what has been a very difficult time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>However, there is one significant difference.  I do not take any delight in announcing the figures for 1975 or the figures for last year because they both show signs of a lack of confidence. I hope there is not a repeat of the disastrous period farmers experienced under the National Coalition when more than 100,000 extra cows were slaughtered. The significant difference between the two figures is that we did not shy away from the need to accelerate the disease eradication programme.  Deputy D'Arcy is aware that last year's figures included the greatest number of cows taken out of the national herd because of disease eradication, particularly because of brucellosis. The percentage of the cow herd slaughtered last year because of disease was 16.1 per cent.  Hopefully, with the process being made in the eradication of brucellosis and TB, it will not be necessary again to remove from the national herd such a significant number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk in terms of restoring our national herd to what it was I should like to tell the House that if we did not concentrate on disease eradication many more calves would be lost because of brucellosis.  An Foras Talúntais recently estimated that the figure was in excess of 200,000.  Admittedly, that figure includes still births, infertility in cows and calves up to one year old, which were lost for many reasons with which we are all <Col N="1929" /> familiar.  Deputy D'Arcy, a farmer, this afternoon told Irish farmers that there was no room for any further efficiency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  The Minister should quote me correctly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>With our level of milk production and our capacity for improvement in that area, not to ask for greater efficiency is to ignore very fundamental questions.  Many people have commented on such matters.  The farmers will admit that we require to improve our education and training facilities and opportunities before people can enter this professional business which requires great skills and techniques not considered necessary before.  To make a success of farming those involved in it must avail of all the ACOT facilities and the up-to-date information on the business so that they can use this &ldquo;green oil&rdquo; of the Irish economy to the fullest possible extent.</P>
      <P>I will now deal with the farm development services.  We have been told in this debate that farm development has been brought to a standstill.  My reply is that, on the basis of existing weekly payments, I hope to have paid out to farmers by the end of the year, a figure close to the record payment of £59.5 million which was paid out last year.  I do not want to be told that this is in respect of work completed some years ago.  We have carried out a study of the period in respect of which farm improvement schemes were in existence for buildings and land and I am heartened by the speed with which works are being completed.  I realise that early completion of work is a good business exercise for farmers because of the level of interest rates, but taking that into account, the speed with which schemes are being completed is significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to give figures in relation to the acceleration that has occurred in this programme since 1975.  In that year the Government paid out £6 million in grants for farm modernisation.  The following year the figure was £12 million. By 1977 it had grown to £24 million.  In 1978 it was £28 million and in 1977 it was increased to £32 million.  Last year a <Col N="1930" /> record was achieved when £59.5 million was paid out.</P>
    <P>As I came into the House this evening Deputy Kenny was complaining about the number of farmers waiting for the processing of their farms under the Western Drainage Scheme.  That scheme is less than three years old and the aim was to develop 100,000 hectares of land.  At the moment the applications have exceeded the quota for the scheme.  The applications are flowing in for benefits under that scheme and under the western package.  There is not any sign of abatement in the number of applications.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy was in the House when his colleagues asked me about delays of one kind or another in dealing with applications under the various schemes.  I can tell him that, because of the sheer demand, the personnel in my Department are utilised to the utmost dealing with these applications.  It is a sure sign of farmers' confidence in development. Of course we all appreciate that development is necessary.  We want to see more of it, particularly in relation to the provision of buildings in which to winter stock.  A lot of progress has been made in the past four years.  Half a million acres have been improved.  However, we must get cattle into unelaborate flexible housing during winter in order to enable farmers to end the poaching of land by cattle during the winter months.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that there will be early growth of grass and early output so that not only will we have more fodder in winter but that we will have top quality silage.  In 1979, when conditions were atrocious during the winter, the Government moved quickly, and our innovations encouraged more than 17,000 farmers to participate in a new silage and fertiliser subsidy scheme.  That scheme is part of this year's programme as well.  I hope it will encourage farmers to cut silage as early as possible, preferably by the end of May, so that the quality of the feed next winter will be the best possible and that the best possible output will follow. At the moment cattle being carried over the winter lose weight and there is not much future for farmers or for the entire economy in that sort of husbandry.  The <Col N="1931" /> production of top class winter fodder and the in-wintering of cattle must be our aim and it is the aim of the Department who are giving every possible encouragement to it.  All our efforts must be concentrated on seeing that this will be achieved.</P>
    <P>There is the question of food imports. We have the climatic conditions and an ever-renewing resource in our land to give to the country increased prosperity. We must ensure that not only will we produce top quality goods but that we will process and reprocess and export them to the best markets we can find. Every means to revamp production methods, processing and marketing will be pursued by this Government.  This week we opened a factory in Donegal for the production of frozen chips.  This is a very welcome development which will enable us to cut down on imports of this type of food.  We have restricted imports of Cypriot potatoes and we are alert in other areas so that not only will we export top quality produce but that we will take effective measures to ensure unnecessary food imports will not compete with our good native produce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the three Fianna Fáil speakers one would think there is not a crisis at all.  It is time they woke up to the fact that there is a very serious crisis and that it is vital to do something to restore prosperity.  But how are we to believe anything Fianna Fáil tell us when we remember the famous promises in the infamous manifesto? They have not been honoured.  How can we expect that the promises made tonight and in the last week or two will be honoured? In their manifesto Fianna Fáil said they believed that agriculture could and should provide the main thrust for the recovery of the national economy. What have they done since about that? They have allowed agriculture to slump into the position in which it is in today. Fianna Fáil said they could introduce a national livestock development programme to increase cattle numbers.  They have done nothing about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil said they would provide a 3 per cent subsidy in interest rates for <Col N="1932" /> farmers.  What has happened to that promise?  It helped to get 20 extra Deputies elected.  There was a strong Government in office.  The Minister could have put any programme through the House. The Government have done nothing since.  Fianna Fáil also promised to maintain the notional system of farmer taxation. What has happened to that?  Fianna Fáil pilloried us in 1977 when farmers were paying income tax on £75 poor law valuation.  We were supposed to have ruined the farmers.  The present Government reduced that to £40 poor law valuation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said our problems were due to external difficulties.  We have never claimed that all the difficulties and crises which confront agriculture today are all due to internal causes.  We have a 21 per cent inflation rate today which is helping to ruin agriculture and doing more harm than anything else to our economy.  This is due to the mishandling of the economy and heavy borrowing by the present Government.  The Minister went on to speak about people on the dole: his Government were not like other Governments not far away.  What exactly does the Minister mean by that?  The famous manifesto promised to reduce unemployment in the first four years of office by 80,000.  There were 107,000 people unemployed in 1977.  If the Government had honoured their promise, there would be only 27,000 people unemployed today.  At present there are 126,000 people unemployed, so the Minister is only 100,000 people out in that promise.  If those people had worked and had good wages they would be in a better position to buy our agriculture produce.  We would have the home markets as well as external markets.</P>
    <P>The Minister also spoke about cattle prices, that they were 15 per cent higher this spring than last spring.  They are, but we have an inflation rate of 21 per cent. The farmer is still 6 per cent worse off. The Minister knows as well as I do that cattle prices increase every spring.  I remember in 1979 paying £50 a cwt. for cattle.  The Minister remembers it, too. Unfortunately, I sold them afterwards at £37 per cwt.</P>

      <P>There is a shortage of cattle at present and farmers are bidding against one another for the number of cattle available.  The Minister knows that less than half the usual number of cattle are going to factories.  The Minister spoke about the supply of cows going to factories, which has dropped by 40 per cent since last year.  I am glad it has, because last year 500,000 cows went to factories. I met a worker in a factory and he told me that a man had sent cows to the factory which were in-calf.  Some of them were within a fortnight or three weeks of the calves being born.  He stopped killing the first one or two.  He telephoned the owner and appealed to him to take the cows away, that it was a sin to kill them. Unfortunatley, the owner said he could not, that he had to meet his commitments and feed his wife and children.  That happened this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons for fewer cows being killed is that there are not enough of them.  We have a reduction of over 500 cows at present.  When the Minister, Deputy MacSharry, was speaking he ended by stating he wished to hear something constructive.  We have been a constructive Opposition since the foundation of the State.  We are proud of our past Ministers for Agriculture.  Paddy Hogan stood for one more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough.  In 1948, James Dillon put the farmers on their feet and negotiated the cattle agreement with Britain at that time.  The Land Reclamation Scheme was introduced for the west of Ireland which people in the west are so proud of today.  The Minister is proud to administer it today and to claim credit for it.  More power to the Minister if he can get away with it.  We are proud of Deputy Mark Clinton, an able negotiator.  There is no doubt that Deputy MacSharry is a good looking young chap, but there is very little use in sending a gasún on a man's errand, which is what happened when he went to Brussels to negotiate on our behalf.  Deputy Clinton increased the farmers' income <Col N="1935" /> from £250 million to £950 million in four years.</P>

      <P>All right, she is Prime Minister of Great Britain.  We were proud of our Ministers of Agriculture. They were nation builders.  None of them was a nation wrecker.  The Minister said he hoped there would not be any politics in the debate.  I suppose when I speak there is bound to be a certain amount of politics.  There was politics in what the <Col N="1936" /> Minister has to say.  I am not objecting to that because, after all, this House is a political house.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach was elected many people regarded him as the saviour of mankind.  It was said he would get everything moving fast.  While the farmers were going through a crisis last year the Taoiseach was engaging in a public relations exercise, going down to the south to open a cow byre.  That was not doing very much for the Irish people.  Shortly afterwards he took himself and 26 Ministers to Castlebar to unevil a plaque to himself.  At that time he and his Ministers should have been tackling the problems that were affecting the Irish farmers. There was a slump in prices and farmers' incomes were dropping dramatically.  In fact, in the past three years they have dropped by 60 per cent.</P>
      <P>At the end of July Deputy Bruton called a press conference and there was a certain amount of publicity given to that conference.  The Deputy made certain proposals there.  A week or fortnight after that the Minister introduced a silage plan and one or two other small concessions for farmers.  Nothing was done after that until we introduced our six-point policy for agriculture.  It was a rescue package but it was voted down in this House by Fianna Fáil.  However, in the budget afterwards they included some of the proposals we had made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be admitted by all that in the past two or three years agriculture has been in the doldrums.  Not since the days of the economic war has there been such poverty among small farmers.  Some Fianna Fáil men may smile at that but I am stating the position as has been told to me by my constituents.  The package the Minister got in Brussels was totally inadequate.  It would take nearly £400 million to put the Irish farmers on their feet again.  In the past few years the farming community has been the only section not to get an increase.  When the Minister for Agriculture returned from Brussels this year there was no bevy of Ministers or State cars to meet him.  Why?  They realised that the package was inadequate so far as the farmers were concerned. Perhaps in France or Germany, where <Col N="1937" /> the inflation rate ranges from 5 per cent to 8 per cent, an increase of 13 per cent might be all right.  However, our inflation rate is 21 per cent and farmers have had three very bad years.  Many economists say it would need at least a 35 per cent increase to restore to farmers the prosperity they enjoyed for a few short years.</P>
    <P>Our inflation rate is 21 per cent and the signs are that it will increase during the year to 23 per cent or 24 per cent.  It is no harm to remind people that when we left office in 1977 the inflation rate was 11 per cent and in less than three months it was down to 9.8 per cent.  At that time interest rates were 10 per cent, but last year they were 18 per cent to 20 per cent and farmers were unable to meet their commitments. In 1977 we had a 5½ per cent growth rate, but last year it was down to 1 per cent or less.  When we had a high growth rate it affected all sectors of the community and they were able to buy agricultural products.  We know now that many of the unemployed are lucky if they eat meat or eggs once a week.</P>
    <P>The Minister today said that the price package will bring prosperity to the farming section and that it will have a favourable overspill throughout the economy to the benefit of all.  I hope the Minister is right.  We know the farmers are the backbone of the country.  If they are wealthy the whole nation is wealthy, but if they are poor the nation is poor.  In the past there have been many wars in this country&mdash;national, social and economic.  The farmers are entitled to a fair return for their work.  They and their families work 365 days a year and many never get a holiday.  All they are asking for is a fair deal.</P>
    <P>When our Government were in office the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Clinton, got one instruction when he went abroad, namely, to get the best price for our agricultural produce.  If in getting that price hardship was imposed on any section our Government were prepared to pay subsidies.  When Deputy Clinton got some of the huge increases for agricultural produce hardship was imposed on some sections of the community but the Government introduced <Col N="1938" /> certain subsidies.  They subsidised butter to the tune of 30p per pound, milk 4p per pint, 5½ per loaf of bread, flour 4½ per kilo and cheese 7p per pound.  When Fianna Fáil were elected to office they immediately abolished the 7p subsidy on cheese.</P>

Not alone did Fianna Fáil abolish those subsidies but they also abolished the subsidy on lime and fertilisers. This has meant a loss in production, but it appears Fianna Fáil are not interested in the farmers.  It might be no harm to point out that in 1973 cattle prices went up from £15 per cwt. to more than £38.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil gave increases of 50 or 60 per cent to other sections of the community but have allowed the farmers' incomes to be reduced in the last three years by 60 per cent.  They cannot deny that because it is a fact.  Milk went up from 15p to 58p; barley went up from £25 per ton in 1973 to £90 per ton in 1977.  There have been very few increases since then and that is no coincidence.  Farmers' confidence must be restored but I doubt if it will be restored.  I would love if it was restored by this package but there is not one farm leader here who has said that it will restore confidence and they are not satisfied with it.</P>

      <P>It certainly does not. They twisted the arms of the employers during the by-election last September to give them a 15 per cent increase.  There was nothing said about efficiency then; there was no call to those people to work harder.  The farmers understand and know hard work and they would be prepared to work hard to get an adequate recompense.  But at the same time that they are talking about farmers working harder and producing more, the Government agree with ESB workers getting £600 disturbance money because they had to move 100 yards down the road to a better building.  Where are we going when things like that happen?</P>

If the same <Col N="1941" /> appeal were made to all other sections of the community there would be some sense in it.  Where is the example to work harder?  That is the question we would all like to ask, especially when those entrusted with Government neglect to do the work that is expected of them&mdash;and there is no denying that.</P>
      <P>The Minister also talked about the rates position today and what they have done for the ratepayers.  The Government abolished the subsidy on rates this year.

      <P>Today the Minister spoke about mountain lamb extension schemes and so on.  He did not tell us anything about the ewe scheme.  Those of us who were down in Donegal heard the Fianna Fáil Ministers on every platform in Donegal promising the small <Col N="1942" /> farmers that if they voted for Fianna Fáil they would get £7 per head for every ewe they kept.  The little man on the mountain was saying, &ldquo;Oh my God, I have 50 little ewes at home; that is £350 if I vote Fianna Fáil.  Why would I not vote for Fianna Fáil?  &rdquo; Another little man might have 100 ewes and that meant £700.  What has happened to that?  We were not told anything about it here today.  The Minister knew at that time, but he did not tell the farmers what was in the small print, that they would be getting only 70p to 90p.  They misled the farmers then as they have misled them since.</P>

      <P>Despite the fact that the Government promised in 1977 to remove all the taxes we had imposed, they imposed three or four new taxes. They imposed the 2 per cent levy which was an unfair and unjust tax because it <Col N="1943" /> did not take into consideration the ability of people to pay.  They imposed a resource tax which is an unfair and unjust tax because, again, it did not take into consideration the ability of people to pay. They are now looking for credit for removing taxes that they imposed on the farmers a few years ago and which helped to ruin the farmers of this country.

Unfortunately we have not.  When Deputy Clinton was Minister for Agriculture he encouraged the farmers to invest. They invested at that time because they had confidence in the Government and they continued to invest.  Many of those people who borrowed money when it was at 9 or 10 per cent are being crucified in the last few years by the action of the present Government who have increased interest rates to 19, 20 and 21 per cent.</P>

      <P>The unfortunate thing about it is that it was the good, progressive farmers who borrowed and are in trouble today, the farmers who went to the agricultural schools, who attended the 100 hours agricultural courses.  Bank managers and agricultural instructors went to the CEO's and asked them for a list of those people and they went and offered them money, and many of those people who borrowed at 8 per cent are up to their eyes in debt.  Some of them have to sell part of their farms.  Others have applied to the Land Commission for permission to sell part of their land and have been refused permission.  Others have had to sell their farms altogether. <Col N="1944" /> What have the Government done for them?  There is not a single thing in this package for those unfortunate people in whom they were supposed to be interested when they were in Opposition. Those people are the salt of the earth. Deputy Keegan knows some of them in my county.  At the present time they cannot sleep and some of them and their wives are attending mental hospitals because their nerves are gone.  The farmer has always been a proud man.  He has always tried to pay his way and repay his debts.  Unfortunately, he has not been able to do this over the last few years because farmers have been neglected.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated this evening, and I quote:</P>
      <P>In the development of our economy in recent years, the farming sector has been an area of particular concern to the Government.  The problems which farmers have had to face have been fully recognised by the Government and we have spared no efforts to find adequate solutions.</P>
      <P>What solutions did we get until the Minister came back from Brussels with this package?  We got nothing worth talking about.  I remember many Fianna Fáil speakers, and one in particular, stating that when we entered the EEC our standards of living would be aligned with the standards of the other states.  Unfortunately, the gap between the standards of living of our farmers and those of people in the other countries of Western Europe is getting larger and larger every day.  If you read the statistics which were published recently, the gap has widened to such an extent that people living in Hamburg and Bonn are six times better off than the average person living in the west of Ireland.</P>

Therefore, the average income of other sections was £32 per week higher than the average income of the farmers, who were supposed to be the principal producers and whom Fianna Fáil tell us that they are interested in.</P>

      <P>I am quite well able to count &mdash; 55 from 87 is 32.  I do not know what school Deputy Keegan went to, but that is the figure I arrived at.  If the Deputy wants further figures, I asked a question in the Dáil on Tuesday, 3 March 1981.  According to the reply I got the farmers represent 20 per cent of our population.  When we were in office in 1977 they were receiving 18.2 per cent of the national income.  In 1980 under Fianna Fáil they received less than 12 per cent of the national income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to quote some other figures.  We talk about farmers and the land and we are all interested in agriculture.  We would like to see more <Col N="1947" /> people on the land.  In 1977 there were 193,600 people on the land, in 1979 the figure was down to 182,300 a drop of 11,300 in two years.  The number of agricultural labourers in 1977 was 29,500 and in 1979 it had dropped to 26,400.  It is reckoned that it dropped by a further 4,000 since then which means that we have over 8,000 fewer agricultural labourers today than when Fianna Fáil took office.  Is that bringing back prosperity to rural Ireland?  Does the Minister think so?</P>
      <P>We must also remember that one of the greatest crises now facing agriculture is the fact that factories that are giving employment are having to lay off workers. For example, in the meat factories 3,000 workers have been laid off in the past few months.  It is reckoned that another 3,000 may have to go in the near future because due to the poverty of the farmers they had to sell cattle last year that they should have kept and fattened this year; they had to sell 500,000 milk cows many of them in calf and which they should have kept to produce more cattle. Tractor sales last year were down by 60 per cent; farm machinery sales were down 50 per cent, farm building materials down 60 per cent, compound feeds down 22 per cent, cattle feeds down 20 per cent, fertiliser sales down 20 per cent, and veteninary medicine sales down 15 per cent.  This is a most serious matter for the whole economy.</P>
      <P>During all that time the Government stood idly by while there was a complete loss of confidence among Irish farmers. I suppose they were agreeing with Lord Melbourne's dictum: &ldquo;Ponder, pause, prepare, postpone and end by leaving things alone; in fact earn the people's pay by doing nothing every day&rdquo;.  That is how the Government fooled the farmers of the country for the past few years.</P>

      <P>The present crisis in agriculture underlines the urgent need for a long-term and realistic programme and policy for agriculture.  Its problems need commonsense and practical solutions, not gimmicks, such as I mentioned earlier, like opening cow byres in the west of Ireland or unveiling plaques.</P>
      <P>The present Government are muddling along from crisis to crisis.  The ship of State seems to be heading for the rocks and the captain seems to be lost in the mist.  Proper action is needed immediately. If we do not have it now it may be too late.  Unfortunately, it is too late for many farmers.  As I said earlier, it would take at least £400 million to restore prosperity. People may ask where the money is to come from.  But if the Government could find £90 million for Nítrigin Éireann, if they were able to find an extra £70 million for the teachers, if they could find £72 million for CIE and all the other millions for the various other sections, is it not only right to ask why they cannot find money for the farming community? We have heard a good deal during the past few months about the package that the Minister brought back from Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>We are entitled to ask why the details of that package were kept secret.  Surely they should have been made known to the farmers' organisations and to the people generally.  Not even the farmers' representatives who were travelling to and from Brussels were let in on the secret, whereas if they had been made aware of what the Minister was looking for, they would have been in a position to help him.  Indeed, if the package had not been kept secret we might have got much more from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State has told us that he expects to be meeting again with the farmers' representatives for the purpose <Col N="1949" /> of reviewing the situation in the light of the Brussels decision.  We are delighted to hear this because it represents a change compared with the past.  I am thinking particularly of when the present Taoiseach as Minister for Agriculture had the farmers sent to jail because they had been walking up and down outside the gates of Leinster House to protest against conditions and to demand a fair living for themselves in their own country.  Since then I have seen members of illegal organisations camp outside the gates of this House without any attempt being made to arrest them.  Neither was there any attempt to interfere with them when they climbed the gates of Leinster House and burned a flag.  This was quite a contrast to the situation in which law abiding farmers were arrested and lodged in Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm to put on record what was said by a great friend of the Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Joe Rea. He said that pretence and promises are not sufficient, that neither the Government's sympathy nor the Minister, Deputy Ray MacSharry's always open door nor the understanding of the Taoiseach would pay farmers' bills and keep bank managers happy.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to know that the Taoiseach and the Government recognise the farmers' organisations now.  I recall 1976 when every day for three long weeks the farmers sat on the steps of Agriculture House and were ignored by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come now to the content of the debate, to the Opposition and what they have been saying <Col N="1952" /> in relation to their attitude, and the way they see things as affording little hope of improvement for agriculture, when they claimed that there would be a further reduction in farm incomes in 1981.  I am not as pessimistic as they are. The EEC agreement on prices and related measures, coupled with the aid provided by the Government is providing the foundation for a turn-around in agriculture.  I am confident that the bottom of the agricultural recession has been passed and that recovery has begun.  This is not my view alone, but that of my Party, the Government and of many independent commentators, some of whom, when they made statements in the recent past, found there were various organisations and Opposition spokesmen prepared to publicise those statements when it suited them.  I should like them now to take note of what is being said by those independent commentators who are saying that there will be a significant increase in farm incomes this year.  That, in itself, is tremendous progress considering the very serious drop there has been in the last two years.  It was also contended by those independent commentators that the maximum financial benefit and incentive available in the Brussels negotiations were achieved by the Irish Government.</P>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to something that has been like a game of draughts or snakes and ladders over the last number of months.  In the months of September, October and November various figures were mentioned as to what was required to restore farm incomes.  In September last commentators were mentioning a figure of £155 million.  The Government took action in September in relation to expenditure of £34 million or £35 million on the items mentioned at that time.  Lo and behold, as soon as we did, the £155 million became £250 million by 29 November.  The Government continued to have discussions with the farm organisations and to examine ways and means of assisting them.  We took measures in the budget.  As soon as we did, lo and behold, the £250 million became £300 million and within a month it was £550 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1953" /> The point I have been making&mdash;and it is generally accepted, although some people still refer to hundreds of millions of pounds which they know are not available here or in Brussels&mdash;is that when these discussions began with the farm organisations on the very serious problems which existed in Irish agriculture the figures being talked about were £100 million to £200 million.  Since then with the measures the Government have taken in September, in the budget, and in the price negotiations in Brussels, the total amount of money earmarked in that short period to help the income situation and the general recession in agriculture is upwards of £300 million.  That is a tremendous achievement having regard to our present very difficult financial constraints.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy said the agreement is of little benefit to the farming community. Surely £215 million cannot be ignored and swept aside.  I suggest the Deputy should ask some individual farmers what they think of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and how it will affect them.  He asked me how much of the £215 million will reach the farmer's pockets.  Largely this will depend on the farmers themselves and what they produce. The price conditions are there. They are well above last year's level and the way is open to getting even more than the £215 million.  There are guranteed prices, guaranteed markets and great scope and potential for an increase in output.</P>
      <P>This is very important for all of us who are interested in contributing to agriculture. We in political life are well aware of the opportunities which present themselves for people to make what might be described as political capital.  My attitude is &mdash; and I hope those who are interested in agriculture will adopt the same attitude&mdash;to try to improve the situation because of the importance of agriculture to this economy.</P>

    <P>I am glad Deputy L'Estrange has come back into the House because I did not <Col N="1954" /> want to refer to him in his absence.  He referred to the ewe premium.

      <P>I am glad the Deputy reminded me of that because I know that Deputy FitzGerald was in favour of it.  I want to come to a point which the Deputy has reminded me of, which was raised by a number of speakers during this debate, the so-called tremendous price increases that were obtained from 1973 to 1977. The price increases that were obtained between 1973 and 1977, which Deputy D'Arcy referred to, were as a result of <Col N="1960" /> green currency devaluations plus price increases of 4 per cent and 5 per cent, not 9½ per cent or 13½ per cent.  I want to say quite clearly so that Fine Gael will understand it, that most of those price increases were obtained because of what was negotiated by Fianna Fáil in our entry to the EEC and, because of the inactivity of the Government in 1974, 1975 and 1976 and the drastic situation which developed, there have been tremendous difficulties ever since.  It is only now that we are getting to the situation of turning that around.  It is ludicrous for Deputies to come into the House and start talking about the price of cattle, the price of calves and the absence of a calf subsidy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham talked at length about exports of live cattle and about the <Col N="1961" /> effects on the meat industry.  At a meeting of the beef management committee on Friday last it was decided to increase the level of refunds on exports of fresh and chilled beef to third countries as well as on live cattle.  These increases were a direct result of the price decisions.  The increases in the export refunds are approximately 15 per cent for live cattle, 17 per cent for beef and 25 per cent for boneless beef.  The latter increase was as a result of representations from my Department to the Commission.  While I accept that the disadvantage on exports of boneless beef to third countries is not entirely removed, this must be seen as a step in the right direction.  My officials will continue to press the Commission to eliminate completely this disadvantage. The new refunds should enable exporters to sell more of the middle range cuts in third country markets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year approximately 2,000 tons of fresh boneless beef were exported to third countries and I hope in the future that amount will be much higher as a result of the new increased export refunds.</P>
      <P>I wish to stress that I am speaking only about trade with countries outside the Community.  In the case of trade with other member states, who provide a market for some seven million tons of beef per annum, boneless beef is not suffering a disadvantage under EEC arrangements. If anything, it has an MCA advantage over carcase beef and live cattle. Canned beef imports to countries such as Germany and the UK have a very definite advantage over live cattle and carcase beef and there can be no question of so-called anomalies hindering the processing of meat here.</P>
      <P>Regarding live exports to North Africa, which is the market for the bulk of our live exports, I am satisfied that the export refund system does not favour live exports by comparison with carcase beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1962" /> I am happy to see that some Irish companies are beginning to exploit market opportunities in this area and I hope that the new refunds will give impetus to this development.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Berminghan's suggestion that we should impose a calf levy, I must remind him that we are part of a Community in which free trade in agricultural products is a major benefit to us. If we imposed levies on imports or exports, so could the other member states.  He also said that we should halt calf exports.  Since last November there has been little or no exporting of calves because of the tremendous prices available here for calf producers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham mentioned cross-Border exports of cattle.  One of the benefits of last week's settlement is that the discriminatory elements in the UK variable premium has been eliminated. This means there is no special variable premium incentive to send cattle over the Border instead of slaughtering them here.  That is a very important point in relation to the negotiations, but the Opposition are anxious to ensure that these very important points are disregarded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that. Live exports in 1980 were little different from the average level of recent years. What has occurred is that the destination of much of our live exports has changed from Britain and the continent to North Africa, with little change in total numbers.</P>
      <P>On the question of the calf subsidy, Deputy D'Arcy referred to phasing it out for Italy.  As I said in my opening statement, the Commission and some member states want to abolish it completely.  The Commission put forward a formal proposal to phase it out over the next few years.  What has happened is that the rate of subsidy has been cut by about one-quarter and we can be certain that a further reduction will be sought next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When at the end of the negotiations we <Col N="1963" /> withdrew our request for a calf subsidy we got a very definite and positive commitment from the Commission not only to do something new about cattle production before 15 July, but we also got a positive commitment from the Commission to look at the social and regional areas arising from the very serious drop in farming incomes.</P>

      <P>We have had a series of meetings with the banks and the ACC. Out of these meetings came various measures of assistance.  We arranged for loans at a reduced rate of interest with the benefit of Exchequer cover for residential exchange risks.  We arranged with the banks that they would restructure loans for farmers in serious financial difficulties. Liaison committees, representative of the banks, the ACC and the farm organisations and with official representation, were set up to monitor the situation. Discussions with the financial institutions are part of an ongoing process and, as I said earlier, we will be shortly meeting farmer representatives again. The great progress that has been made by the banks and the ACC in restructuring <Col N="1965" /> many thousands of loans has been a very positive advantage to many farmers.</P>

It is the duty of every representative interested in the agricultural industry to be open, frank and honest in regard to what is available in the new price proposals.

      <P>As I said at the beginning, every day since this Dáil assembled we had their hypocrisy on the Order of Business calling for debates on certain measures, but as the Taoiseach said this morning, when they got the opportunity they wasted it.  The proof was there tonight.  We had five hours for this motion.  The people who kicked up most about allocation of time for debate were the Labour Party but tonight they did not attempt to use the time available to them. Fine Gael had to go out, because there was not a Deputy in the House but Deputies D'Arcy and Kenny, to try to get a speaker to fill up the time.  It was then arranged between the Whips that Deputy L'Estrange would conclude the debate for Fine Gael.  I am glad a spare was here because it saved Fine Gael to some extent.  However, the concern of the combined Opposition for the agricultural community, exemplified tonight, amounts only to trying to throw water on the positive, constructive steps taken by the Government on behalf of the agricultural community.  The farmers know that their future lies solidly and squarely with this party and with this Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>No particular rate of VAT is charged on Irish produced craft goods as such.  The rate of VAT applying to craft goods, wherever produced, is determined by the rate applying to the broad categories into which they fall.  Thus items coming under the personal clothing heading, however produced, are zero-rated, while items such as jewellery and glassware are chargeable at the 25 per cent standard rate.</P>
      <P>It would not be possible or appropriate to apply a special low rate of VAT to Irish craft goods, since traders would often be unable to distinguish between goods for VAT purposes on the basis of the method of manufacturing employed; the same rate of VAT must apply to similar goods whether produced at home or abroad; expenditure on craft goods is normally more discretionary than on many items chargeable at the 25 per cent rate such as furniture and furnishings; the direct revenue loss would not be warranted; and, EEC law precludes the extension of zero-rating to new categories of goods.  Where exported by the seller, however, the zero-rate of VAT applies to goods generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>All goods are chargeable to VAT at the rate of 25 per cent except where there is provision for a lower charge.  Thus, for example, the zero rate applies to most personal clothing, and the 10 per cent rate to goods normally chargeable to excise duty.  Consequently, clothing used in connection with fire-fighting is zero-rated and fire engines and hoses are liable at the 10 per cent rate.  Other fire-fighting equipment, like most equipment in use in the home or in commercial premises, attracts the standard 25 per cent rate, which, of course, may be reclaimed in the case of VAT registered businesses.</P>

      <P>Any forecast for the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments can only be tentative at this early stage in the year.  The deficit is the net result of considerably larger gross flows, especially on external trade.  The prospects for these items are subject to some uncertainties, notably the timing and extent of the expected recovery in world economic activity and its effects on world trade.  Nonetheless, I would not dispute the possibility that the balance of payments deficit this year could be of the order of magnitude forecast by the Central Bank.  The deficit will be financed through capital flows which will include foreign borrowing and EEC capital transfers.</P>

      <P>In the review carried out in 1978 of the boundaries of the disadvantaged areas and of the more severely handicapped parts of those areas, the position in the Knockmealdown and Comeragh mountain areas was most carefully considered. The boundary adjustments that were recently announced were made only after protracted negotiations at Brussels, both at Council and Commission level.  It was not found possible for this region, which is already designated as part of the disadvantaged areas, to be classified as more severely handicapped.  The position is being kept under continuous review, however, and should circumstances so <Col N="1754" /> permit, the classification of the area will be further considered.  In view of the difficulties at Community level the Government decided to extend to this region, at a cost to the national Exchequer, assistance for land drainage at the same rates as apply under the western drainage scheme.</P>

The demand for this form of treatment has increased substantially in recent years and has resulted in increased waiting lists throughout the country as a whole because of the shortage of orthodontists and the length of time taken to complete treatments.  To alleviate the overall situation I have agreed to the appointment of five whole-time orthodontists by health boards, as I have already indicated in my reply on 4 February last to Deputy Fitzpatrick.</P>

      <P>I have had a number of discussions with the chairmen and the chief executive officers of health boards in regard to the funding of non-capital health services in 1981.  Taking account of certain economies achievable by the boards and additional income which will accrue to the boards in 1981, the allocations which I have approved should be sufficient to enable present health services levels to be maintained.  I am not aware that the group of chief executive officers claimed that their budgets were reduced by 11 per cent this year and I can assure the Deputy that there has been no such reduction.</P>

      <P>Pay-related benefit is payable as a supplement with unemployment benefit, disability benefit or maternity allowance. An insured person must first be in receipt of one of those flat rate benefits to be eligible for pay-related benefit.</P>
      <P>The amount of pay-related benefit payable is calculated on a person's reckonable weekly earnings in the relevant income tax year which is the last complete income tax year before the pay-related benefit year in which the claim to the appropriate flat rate benefit commenced.</P>
      <P>Reckonable earnings, equal to the weekly average earnings applicable in this country, are credited for the relevant income tax year in the case of insured persons who were in employment insured under the legislation of another member state of the EEC during that year.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance based on the notional value of his land holding and he applied for a factual assessment of his means.  The resultant inquiries revealed that his wife was employed and the benefit of her earnings fell to be included in the assessment of means.  Means were assessed at £29 weekly which reduced the rate of unemployment assistance payable in his case from £31.40 weekly to £6.85 weekly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned appealed against the assessment and an appeals officer reduced the assessment of means to £19 weekly effective from 18 June 1980.  His rate of unemployment assistance has accordingly been increased to £16.85 weekly and all arrears due to him <Col N="1768" /> have been paid.  His weekly rate was increased under the 1981 budget provisions to £22.85 payable from 1 April 1981.</P>

To assist with this examination I have set up a small review group which in addition to studying the report and other documentation is also meeting members of local teams and other groups which either had association with projects or worked in the same field, as well as representatives of various statutory bodies.  I am hopeful that the review group will have completed their work within six months and that I will then be in a position to consider what further action should be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The replacement of Oldcastle exchange was planned on the basis that it would be connected to the crossbar exchange at Cavan.  A crossbar exchange was therefore ordered for Oldcastle. That exchange is in course of manufacture. The extra cost of providing a digital exchange at Oldcastle suitable for connection to Kells exchange would be of the order of £150,000.  There are no adequate grounds for incurring this extra cost as the crossbar exchange is capable of giving a high quality of service comparable to that of a digital exchange.  A change would also involve delay in the provision of automatic service at Oldcastle.</P>
      <P>The special services to be provided to subscribers connected to digital exchanges have not been finally determined but there will be additional charges for whatever such services are provided.</P>

    <P>In response to requests from Aer Lingus and the travel trade, special arrangements have been made to allow a number of night charter flights to take place during May to October 1981 at the airport.

The extra charges which have been introduced by <Col N="1779" /> Aer Rianta are designed to enable the company to recover the costs which it will incur as a result of the extended opening hours.  The extra charges involved are £125 per hour for a minimum of two hours and £1,000 where an all-night opening is required.

      <P>The IDA will continue to do everything possible, in co-operation with the liquidator, to secure a take-over of the enterprise that would enable some, at least, of the workers to be re-employed on a sound basis.</P>

      <P>Meals are supplied at State expense to persons in Garda custody but a person may, if he wishes and if it is practicable, have meals of his own choice supplied at his own expense.  In the case of the Bridewell station in Dublin there are standing arrangements with a caterer for the supply of meals.  In the case of other stations in the Dublin Metropolitan area arrangements are made as and when required for the supply of meals by local caterers.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the practice is to supply a meal if the period of custody extends over normal meal times but that the Garda also supply meals outside normal meal times in special circumstances even though the person may be in custody for only a short period &mdash; for example, it might be obvious from the person's condition that he was in need of a meal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. G. Fitzgerlad)</NameTxt>
      <P>The distinction between current and capital, in so far as the supply services and the Public Capital Programme are concerned, is based generally on the principle that expenditure which provides physical assets for the continuing use or benefit of the public is treated as capital and expenditure which does not create physical assets is treated as current. Expenditure for the provision of factories, roads, houses, schools, hospitals etc., is therefore classified as capital while expenditure on salaries and pensions, welfare benefits, subsidies etc., is classified as current.</P>
      <P>Certain expenditures which do not create physical assets are however treated as part of the Capital Budget.  These are mainly refinancing by State bodies and local authorities of borrowings of previous years and certain capital contributions to international organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it may not be general practice to have a separate capital budget as in Ireland, I understand that the broad principles which I have outlined for the distinction between capital and current <Col N="1792" /> expenditure are generally accepted in OECD countries.</P>

      <P>As the estimated income for 1981-82 of the person referred to by the Deputy is expected to be in excess of that limit, he will not be entitled to exemption from income tax.  The provisional certificate of tax-free allowances issued to him for 1981-82 on 2 March 1981 needs to be amended in view of further information recently supplied by the taxpayer.  A revised certificate for £2,995 will be issued to him shortly and he will be invited to call to see the inspector of taxes so that his tax position for 1981-82 may be made clear to him.</P>

All disability benefit and pay-related benefit due from 8 January 1981, fourth day of incapacity, to 14 February 1981 after which date he resumed employment, has been paid.  The delay in the payment of benefit was due to the fact that he quoted an insurance number only on medical certificates submitted in connection with his claim.  The certificates concerned were returned to him but the RSI number furnished did not refer to him and consequently it was not possible at that stage to obtain details of his employment record for 1979-80.  The correct number was eventually traced and payment of the benefit was made on 7 April 1981.</P>

Payment of all injury benefit and disability benefit due, less the amount reimbursed to the health board of supplementary welfare allowance advanced, has been made to 6 April 1981.  He is not entitled to pay-related benefit.  The delay in payment was due to the fact that it was necessary to ascertain from the health board the amount of supplementary welfare allowance due for refund before payment of the balance of the benefit could be made.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if observations made by his Department reveal the average annual growth of or yield from conifers in forests; if so, the annual increment in (a) bulk and (b) weight from year one to year ten; and if he will relate the average annual growth figures to the fastest growing conifers in forests.</P>

      <P>The information sought is not readily available in the precise format <Col N="1805" /> requested but I trust the following information will meet the Deputy's requirements.</P>
      <P>The average yield class of conifers in State forests is around 14; exceptionally, in suitable soil and local climatic conditions, yield class may reach 30.  In this context yield class represents cumulative production in cubic metres divided by age at the age of maximum production for a crop.</P>
      <P>In conventional forestry since volume up to ten years is insignificant and not a reliable indicator of future production, it is not the practice in my Department to measure trees up to that age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest the Deputy's primary concern may be with short rotation forestry for biomass purposes I may say that current experimental work is not sufficiently long <Col N="1806" /> in progress to permit firm conclusions to be drawn from it.</P>

    <P>On the basis of the above figures the average annual landings per boat would work out at about 47 tonnes and the average value of fish landed per vessel per annum would amount to £11,500 approximately.  These average figures give no indication of the quantity and value of landings by the full-time trawlers because of the large numbers of small and part-time boats in the fleet.</P>
    <P>The information on the apportionment of the value of landings as between the vessel and the crew is not available.  The apportionment of the value of the catch is a matter of agreement on each individual boat between the skipper and crew and can very considerably from vessel to vessel.</P>

    <P>Contract documents for the proposed Castlepollard regional water scheme were received on 12 March 1981 and are under consideration in my Department. The scheme will consist of headworks at Castlepollard and a trunk watermain to Delvin.  I presume the third part of the question relates to this trunk main.  The contract documents for the scheme must be considered in the context of the overall <Col N="1820" /> capital resources available for the sanitary services programme and the number of fully approved schemes in progress or getting to construction, including the following schemes in County Westmeath recently approved by me: &mdash; Gaybrook reservoir, Mullingar; Taughmon water supply scheme.</P>
