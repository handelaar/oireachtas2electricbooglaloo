      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of factories manufacturing blankets in this country and their location; the total number of employees engaged in the industry; and the value of blankets imported in 1980.</P>

      <P>Four of the establishments covered by the Central Statistics Office production inquiries manufacture numbers of blankets on a regular or intermittent basis.  They are located in Counties Dublin, Cork, Kerry and Mayo.</P>
      <P>Employment data available relate to total employment in these establishments which manufacture substantial quantities of other textile products besides blankets. Total employment covering all products was 302 persons for a week in December 1980.</P>
      <P>Import data on blankets are available from the trade statistics for &ldquo;Travelling rugs and blankets (not knitted)&rdquo;.  The total value of such imports in the year 1980 was £1,744,000.  There were in addition imports of &ldquo;Electric blankets&rdquo; to the value of £1,409,000 in 1980.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware of the serious recession this industry is going through and that the 302 people mentioned as the overall number in the industry will be severely reduced unless action is taken by the Government in relation to VAT on this commodity? Is the Minister considering any change to relieve the problem in relation to VAT?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>VAT would not be a matter for this Department.  The Deputy should put down a question to the Minister for Finance on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment whether it is the Government's intention to call for the establishment of a public inquiry into the Bundoran fire disaster, County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Garda reports have gone to the Director of Public Prosecutions who, I understand, is in correspondence with the Garda in the matter.  Consideration of further appropriate action has been deferred pending issue of the Director of Public Prosecution's direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the reason for the delay in the publication of this report? Has any other inquiry been carried out other than the Garda inquiry, which I understand was completed as far back as last September?  What is the delay in its publication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda did not finish their inquiry as far back as last September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>They finished their inquiry in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions is still in correspondence with the Garda on it in relation to additional information.  However, it is a question for the Director of Public Prosecutions as to when he makes a decision on it.  As far as other reports are concerned, the fire adviser to my Department and the local acting chief fire officer in the Donegal area also prepared reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a danger of confining this to an internal inquiry when we have accepted the principle both in relation to the Stardust and Whiddy disasters that there should be a public sworn <Col N="2016" /> inquiry?  A number of people died in this fire and it had many features common to the Stardust disaster.  If this tribunal had been held and a report been published it might have obviated the dreadful disaster of the Stardust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we leave the matter until the Director of Public Prosecutions has acted and at that stage further action will be taken?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister telling the House that he does not know the findings of the Director of Public Prosecutions' office seven months after this serious fire in Bundoran?  Is there something wrong? There is a big question mark over this. Why this delay?  It is now seven months since ten people were burned to death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>A Garda report was forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions who requested further information from the Garda.  That involved further inquiries.  The information has now gone to the Director of Public Prosecutions who is still in contact with the Garda and it is up to the Director of Public Prosecutions as to when he makes his decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree to making public the findings of his departmental inquiry into this matter? This would be beneficial not only to the people in Bundoran but presumably to the tribunal sitting at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration of further appropriate action in relation to the Bundoran fire disaster would include the report to which the Deputy refers.  Any other action is being deferred pending <Col N="2017" /> the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

      <P>A final supplementary from Deputy Browne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a special urgency now in so far as that one of the problems here was that this is a small town with a population of about 1,700 people which in summertime is inflated to about 25,000 people?  This is a common feature in the summer period.  In those circumstances is it not particularly urgent that the Minister should do something about it in order to contact the ESB in relation to electrical faults, the fire services in regard to their gross inadequacy and Bord Fáilte so that they will do something about protecting people who go to these hotels, some of whom suffered so terribly because they accepted in good faith that Bord Fáilte had carried out their responsibility, that the Department had carried out their responsibility in respect of fire inspection, fire protection and fire services?  The Department, through successive Governments, have grievously failed in this responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions is totally independent of me or any other member of the Government and his decision and his timing of it is totally independent.  It would be inappropriate for me to contact him on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain the logic of the procedure by which in this instance he refuses a public inquiry until after a decision about prosecutions has been taken, whereas in relation to the Stardust a public inquiry takes place before any question of prosecutions? Why are two different procedures attached to these two cases?  Will the Minister explain it because nobody understands it?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment whether it is the Government's intention to introduce a Supplementary Estimate of approximately £200,000 to help defray the immediate expenses of the victims of the Stardust fire disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Assistance to help defray immediate expenses of victims of the disaster is being provided through the existing schemes administered by the Department of Social Welfare and the Eastern Health Board.  The Minister for Health has indicated that victims will not be liable for any hospital treatment costs where they are not covered by any existing scheme.  There are at present no proposals for any assistance additional to that already available or announced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that there are special cases where hardship has resulted because of this disaster and that in the special circumstances of the case we should make some sort of contribution in anticipation of the final <Col N="2020" /> decision of the tribunal which will take up to 18 months or two years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Lord Mayor's Artane Disaster Fund has already made a contribution.  I understand that approximately £65,000 has been paid out, all funeral expenses have been attended to and as far as hardship cases are concerned they are being looked after.  The families of those who died have received £200 per person and £150 per person injured has been given from the fund.  The fund stands at £150,000.  As well as that, the Government have, through the Department of Social Welfare, three officials of the Department operating on a full-time basis in the area informing people of their entitlements; the Department of Health through the EHB have nurses working in the area with the families and the Government have provided independent solicitors and counsel to act for the next of kin of the victims and for any injured person before the tribunal.  The scheme of civil legal aid and advice is also available to people seeking information regarding claims and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is found that between now and the findings of the tribunal there are any serious cases of hardship and the Lord Mayor's fund is not able to meet them will the Minister then reconsider his decision not to make a grant in the terms suggested by me?  In view of the serious failure of successive Ministers over the years, which led to the Stardust, Bundoran and various other disasters, does the Minister not feel that he has a moral responsibility to make some contribution in the dreadful circumstances of the Stardust disaster?</P>

In reply to a question the Minister said that some staff from the Department of Social Welfare were permanently assigned for the time being to help the victims and relatives of the Stardust tragedy as were some nurses from the EHB. Do I take it that these people have been transferred from other duties or have they been taken on specially to do the job?</P>

      <P>The dates on which five of the six posts of chief fire officer concerned became vacant were as follows:- Donegal &mdash; 28 July 1978; North Tipperary &mdash; 30 July 1978; Sligo-Leitrim &mdash; 20 May 1979; Limerick &mdash; 16 June 1979; Roscommon &mdash; 1 December 1979.  Sanction issued to the creation of a post of chief fire officer in Monaghan on 19 April 1978 but the post there has not yet been filled.  The vacancies in that post and the other posts which have been vacant since 1978 were advertised on a number of occasions by the Local Appointments Commissioners without success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of an agreement reached at conciliation on 18 April 1979 between management and the staff side on the restructuring of engineering and cognate professional grades, including the grade of chief fire officer, in the local authority <Col N="2024" /> service, it was agreed at the request of the staff side that recruitment of professional staff at the relevant levels would be suspended pending the assessment through local negotiations of each local authority's requirements under the new structure and its implementation.  Since then negotiations have been continuing with the staff side on the question of the application of the agreement to the office of chief fire officer and the restructuring of that office, but agreement has not yet been reached on this issue with the staff side, differences existing between the different interests on the staff side.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, however, in my statement in the House on 18 February last, I have decided that pending agreement with staff side interests on the restructuring of the office of chief fire officer, arrangements be put in train for the filling of the chief fire officer vacancies on the basis of the old conditions with an addendum that these conditions are at present being reviewed.  The vacant posts have since been advertised by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  While the posts have been vacant, arrangements for the discharge of the duties have been made by the local authorities.</P>

Were they filled by people who were entitled to fill those posts?  Was a junior official appointed to do the job?

In Donegal and Monaghan chief assistant county engineers were appointed as acting chief fire officers.  An assistant county engineer was appointed acting chief fire officer in Limerick.  Executive engineers are acting for the chief fire officers in Roscommon and North Tipperary.  In Sligo a second fire officer has been assigned to operational matters where the chief assistant county engineer has been given responsibility for fire prevention matters. Finally, in Leitrim, the county engineer has overall responsibility for fire services with a second fire officer reporting to him on operational matters, and a temporary assistant county engineer also provides assistance.</P>

It seems that much of the difficulty arises from the lack of clarity in the sequence of procedures to be followed.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Numbers 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the enforcement of planning control under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 and 1976, is a matter for the planning authority concerned.  Various powers are available to planning authorities to take action to secure the satisfactory completion of housing estates.  I am satisfied that these powers, which were considerably strengthened by the 1976 Planning Act, are adequate to enable them to take action to secure the satisfactory completion of housing estates.  I have advised planning authorities to make full use of these powers to ensure that developers comply fully with the terms and conditions of planning permissions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us whatever happened to the famous £3 million the Government were supposed to be spending to help complete estates where developers had welshed on their obligations?  Could he also tell us whether he is aware that, certainly in the South <Col N="2031" /> Dublin area, private developers are playing fast and loose both with the council and with the residents and have created estates surrounded not by roads but by tank-traps?  Can he tell us whether any of that £3 million will ever be spent and whether any of it will be spent in Dublin South?</P>

      <P>As far as the non-compliance with conditions of planning permissions is concerned I would hope that Dublin County Council, together with all other local authorities, would insist that the developers to which the Deputy referred will meet their obligations under the specified conditions.  Serious problems have arisen in respect of some estates where debt, bankruptcy or long-standing disputes over ambiguous conditions have held up their completion. We have a scheme in mind with regard to the type of estate to which the Deputy referred.  As a first step this year there has been an allocation of £150,000 provided in the Estimates for my Department. This would be the first phase.  I would expect that most of the work on these unfinished estates would be completed next year.  It will take some time to prepare reports because the type of estate about which we are talking has been a long outstanding case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to a report (details supplied) that building society profits are too high; and if he agrees with the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report referred to by the Deputy, but I do not accept its validity.</P>
      <P>In general, building societies do not aim to make profits in the accepted commercial sense.  Surpluses accruing to building societies, after payment of interest to investors, taxation, management and other expenses, are put to reserve to meet any unforeseen losses that may arise&mdash;for example, through losses on mortgages or depreciation of investments. The societies do not endeavour to maximise their surpluses but endeavour to maintain them at a reasonable level in relation to their growth.  Also the grant in recent years of trustee status to certain building societies was subject to the maintenance of adequate reserves.</P>
      <P>It is the function of the Registrar of Building Societies to exercise a continuing review of the manner in which societies are operated and the Building Societies Act, 1976, gives him wide statutory powers to take any action he considers necessary in relation to their operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the level of reserves maintained by the building societies is substantially <Col N="2034" /> in excess of that necessary for them to retain trustee status?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question of the regulation and control of the societies or their surveillance and reserve level are matters for the Registrar of Building Societies.  The situation is that the Building Societies Act 1976 empowers the Minister for the Environment, on the recommendation of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, to make regulations governing the management of societies. The Act also provides for the submission by building societies of annual returns to the Registrar.  Also any irregularity in a society's operations, for example, in regard to liquidity, can be identified and action can be taken to rectify it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that as the reserves are so large the most appropriate thing for the building societies to do in the situation would be to calculate their interest on the monthly reducer, as the trustee savings banks do, instead of on the annual reducer so that the benefit of these large reserves could be passed on to the people who are paying for mortgages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

      <P>I wish to refer the Deputies to my reply to Question No. 18 of 11 February 1981.  The provision of £114 million includes a sum of £5.5 million for the acquisition of private houses under the low-rise mortgage scheme and the allocation of this amount forms part of a combined allocation which provides also for requirements arising in respect of house purchase and improvement loans and supplementary grants.  Particulars of these allocations were given in the reply referred to and it was stated also that the allocations for local authority housing in 1981 had not yet been made.  This is still the position. Until the applications from local authorities for allocations to finance on-going commitments in 1981 have been dealt with I shall not be in a position to say the proportion of the total provision that will be available for new projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the steps that are being taken by his Department to ensure that all possible precautions are taken to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease to this country in view of our close proximity to the outbreak in the south of England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, let me point out that the protection of our livestock against the introduction of disease from abroad, including in particular diseases such as foot and mouth disease, is an around the clock operation carried out by my Department every day of the year with no let up be it Christmas Day or any other day.</P>
      <P>There are long-standing procedures laid down at both the international and domestic levels for protective and for counteractive measures in the event of the threat or actual introduction of disease into our territory.  At international level, through our membership of the International Office of Epizootics, we receive up to date information on the disease situation throughout the world and there is a process of immediate notification of disease outbreak between countries in western Europe.  We have especially close links with the veterinary authorities in Britain and Northern Ireland and in emergency situations, such as the present outbreak of foot and mouth disease in northern France, Jersey and the Isle of Wight, we are in constant contact on developments.  Officers of my Department are keeping in close touch by telephone with the UK veterinary authorities and there is also close liaison with the French authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2047" /> On the domestic front protective measures at ports and airports are an everpresent process.  Mechanical disinfectant spray equipment is installed at the major portal entry points including Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Cork and Rosslare.  Mats saturated with disinfectant confront incoming travellers at ports and airports. Passengers coming in by sea or air are alerted by public address and notices, as well as leaflets in some cases, as to the necessity to report to my Department's portal officers if they have been on farms, livestock or meat premises, and so on while abroad.  They are also warned against bringing in any meat or dairy products on their person or in their baggage.</P>
    <P>I would stress again that these are on-going continuous measures at our ports and airports whether disease is close at hand or on the other side of the world. When disease is close at hand, as it is now in the English Channel area, our vigilance is stepped up but the protective measures are already there.  In the last analysis we depend very much on the co-operation of the travelling public and in present circumstances I make a strong appeal to these people to co-operate fully with the officials of my Department at entry points.</P>
    <P>What happens if despite our best endeavours a disease like foot and mouth succeeds in penetrating our protective barriers?  In this context I might mention that the possibility of wind borne transmission of infection is not ruled out in the present spread of foot and mouth from northern France to the Isle of Wight.  This gives some idea of the virulence of the disease and the sort of problems we are up against.  Let us take the case of a suspected outbreak of foot and mouth disease occurring here.</P>
    <P>A senior veterinary officer of my Department is on call 24 hours a day, every day of the week, and he is alerted immediately a report of a suspected case is received.  This sets in train a series of events and procedures involving examination of suspect animals by veterinary officers of my Department, taking of samples, transportation to and analysis <Col N="2048" /> of these samples at the world reference centre for foot and mouth at Pirbright in Surrey and restriction of animal movement and general farming activity in the immediate area of the suspect case.  If the Pirbright tests confirm the presence of disease, and this can be done within a few hours, an immediate and automatic set of procedures is put in train.  These include wider extensions of restrictions on movement and activity, destruction of diseased animals, fodder, and so on, disinfection of premises, monitoring of adjoining livestock, and so on.</P>
    <P>In the implementation of these measures we are fortunate in having a network of district veterinary offices strategically located throughout the country.  We are fortunate too in having a corps of experienced veterinary officers who have first hand knowledge of foot and mouth disease through their participation in combating the last outbreak of the disease in Britain in 1967-68.  We had a foot and mouth scare in the Tullamore area last August and all the procedures I have described were immediately put into operation.  Happily it proved to be a false alarm.</P>
    <P>This leads me to another point.  We would prefer to have 1,000 false alarms than to let one suspect case go unreported for too long.  Time is of the essence in tackling this virulent and highly infectious disease and no farmer should hesitate on the slightest suspicion to report any disquieting signs of disease by telephone direct to my Department or to the local veterinary officials.  The classical symptoms of foot and mouth disease are high fever and the development of blisters on the animals mouth, tongue and hooves.  There may also be salivation at the mouth.  It can affect all cloven-hoofed animals including cattle, pigs, sheep and goats.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of the measures I have described is borne out by the fact that we have not had an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in this country since 1941.  It was close at hand in the English midlands in 1967-68 but we managed to keep it out.  It was also in the Cherbourg area in 1979 and again we avoided infection. Indeed, without in any way underestimating <Col N="2049" /> the risks from the outbreak in the Isle of Wight, I should like to stress that because of the ferry links outbreaks in northern France can constitute an even greater danger.  While our experience over the years, and particularly during previous outbreaks in Britain and in northern France, gives us some confidence in our ability to prevent the disease coming here, it certainly does not leave any room for complacency in any quarter.  Constant vigilance must be our watchword at all times and particularly in present circumstances.  Livestock and livestock products are so vital to our overall economic wellbeing that a serious outbreak of foot and mouth disease could be a major disaster for us.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that I and my officials are watching the present situation very carefully indeed and, if developments so warrant, I will not hesitate to take any additional steps that are considered necessary to safeguard our livestock from this dreaded disease.  This may cause serious hardship and inconvenience to the farming community and the public at large, particularly to persons arriving from Britain and the Continent and the importers of goods from those areas.</P>
    <P>I am confident that public awareness of what is at stake will bring full co-operation from all concerned and I sincerely hope that containment of the current outbreaks in northern France and the Isle of Wight will obviate the need for more drastic action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following regulations in draft&mdash;</P>
      <P>Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1981&mdash;</P>
      <P>a copy of which regulations in draft was laid before the House on 18th March, 1981.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) of section 9 of the Health Contributions Act, 1979, provides that the Minister for Health may by regulations vary the health contribution rate and the ceiling level on which the maximum level of contributions payable in respect of an individual in any particular contribution year is assessed.  Subsection (5) of section 9 requires that a draft of the proposed regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
      <P>The original ceiling level specified in the Health Contributions Act, 1970, was £5,000.  This was varied to £5,500 before income related health contributions came into operation in respect of the contribution year commencing 6 April 1979. That sum was varied to £7,000 under regulations approved by the Oireachtas in March 1980, and applied to the contribution year commencing 6 April 1980.</P>
      <P>The proposed new ceiling figure is £8,500 and it is intended that this will apply for the contribution year commencing 6 April 1981.</P>
      <P>The present rate of health contribution is one per cent, the same level as was fixed for the contribution year 1979-80. It is not being proposed that any change in the contribution rate will be made in respect of the contribution year 1981-82.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed ceiling of £8,500 is the same as that specified in the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 1981, which has been passed by the Dáil and is to be debated tomorrow in the Seanad.  It is <Col N="2097" /> proposed that the new ceiling for social insurance purposes will also operate from 6 April 1981.  The same considerations apply in the case of the proposed health contributions ceiling, as the basis for determination of variations in the ceiling levels in both codes is identical.  When determining the income ceiling for any given year I am statutorily obliged to take account of any movement in the Transportable Goods (Earnings) Index.  In the year ending March 1980, the latest available date, earnings increased by approximately 20 per cent.  Accordingly the ceiling of £7,000 when increased by 20 per cent becomes approximately £8,500.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of collection of health contributions income is divided into three streams:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I&mdash;Income which is liable for income 1 158tax under the PAYE system and which is tax under the PAYE system and which is derived from insurable employment.</P>
    <P>II&mdash;Income which is liable for income tax under the PAYE system but which is not derived from insurable employment.</P>
    <P>III&mdash;Income which does not fall within the previous categories such as income from farming, the income of self-employed persons and investment income.</P>
    <P>As I explained last year, the collection of health contributions from employees is integrated with the administrative machinery for the collection of pay-related social insurance contributions and redundancy contributions through the PAYE system.  It is necessary that the ceiling levels for social insurance, redundancy and health contributions should be identical, otherwise the administration of the collection system would be more costly and far more cumbersome.  The co-ordinated arrangements also facilitate employers in the administrative processes involved at their end.</P>
    <P>The collection of health contributions from individuals with income which is liable for income tax, but which is not derived from insurable employment, is arranged through the tax collection system. The collection of health contributions <Col N="2098" /> in respect of income derived from farming is administered by health boards.</P>
    <P>The revised ceiling level as it affects employees will be the same in the case of the self-employed, farmers and other individuals who are not insured under the Social Welfare Acts and the draft regulations provide accordingly.  The purpose of the ceiling level is to fix an upper limit on the amount of the health contributions payable in respect of any one individual in a particular contribution year.</P>
    <P>The total amount received in health contributions in the calendar year 1980 was £44.7 million.  It is estimated that the total amount which will be received in the calendar year 1981 will be £48.6 million. Part of the estimated increase in 1981, about £700,000, is attributable to the raising of the ceiling level from £5,500 to £7,000 in 1980.</P>
    <P>The balance is attributable to the additional receipts deriving from increases in incomes generally.  The amount which it is estimated will accrue in the contribution year 1981-82 from the raising of the income ceiling is £800,000.</P>
    <P>The proposed ceiling level of £8,500 is the same as that which it is proposed will also apply to health eligibility.  In accordance with the terms of paragraph 32 of the Second National Understanding for Economic and Social Development it is intended that the statutory health eligibility limit will be increased from £7,000 to £8,500 with effect from 1 June 1981; the relevant income being that earned in the year ended 5 April 1981.  The income ceiling for health contributions applies to the year ending 5 April 1982 and the relevant income is that earned in the year ended 5 April 1982.</P>
    <P>The reasons for the difference between the operational dates mentioned are, firstly, that it is necessary in the case of health contributions to comply with the statutory provisions that the ceiling level change operates from the beginning of the contribution year, that is 6 April 1981.  Secondly, it is necessary to have provision for a June commencement date in the case of health eligibility so that in appropriate instances individuals can have available their forms P.60 as evidence <Col N="2099" /> of their income in the tax year ended 5 April 1981.</P>
    <P>The position as regards eligibility for health services is that persons with income below the limit are entitled to the full range of hospital services in a public ward and to specialist diagnostic and treatment services on an out-patient basis without charge.  Persons over the income limit are entitled to the same range of services but are liable to pay fees to consultants. The community as a whole is also entitled to avail of the drugs refund scheme and free drugs for specified long-term illnesses.  Preventive services and infectious diseases services are also available free of charge.</P>
    <P>In my remarks I have, by way of giving general information to Deputies referred to certain matters which do not affect the draft regulations now before the House. As I have explained, the purpose of the draft regulations is to fix the upper limit on the amount of the health contributions payable in respect of any one individual in the contribution year commencing 6 April 1981.  I now ask the House to approve of the Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1981 in draft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for having made a more expanded statement than last year.  When a proposal of this kind is made there is always a tendency on the part of bureaucracy to give the shortest possible statement.</P>
      <P>The information the Minister has given regarding the income that will be derived from the increases in contributions gives us a broad idea of the consequences of the changes being made by the regulations. I say deliberately that it gives us a broad idea because I am still very confused about the matter after listening to the Minister and reading the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has informed us that the total amount received in health contributions during the calendar year 1980 was £44.7 million.  I understand that health contributions were increased from 6 April 1980 &mdash; I hope I am correct in that assumption.  Therefore, the figure of £44.7 million for 1980 would not represent <Col N="2100" /> the figure for health contributions for a full 12 months.  In his speech the Minister said that the total amount to be received in the calendar year 1981 will be £48.6 million.  Taking one year with another, it appears to me the increase should be much greater than the £3.9 million which the Minister has mentioned.</P>
    <P>By way of explanation the Minister said that about £700,000 is attributable to the raising in 1980 of the ceiling from £5,500 to £7,000.  If one were to make a broad calculation on the basis of 12 months, the increase should be of the order of £8.5 million &mdash; say £9 million &mdash; instead of the £3.9 million mentioned by the Minister.  There may be some statistical or administrative explanation for the variation but it does not appear to me that any administrative problem can explain away such a vast difference between what one could reasonably expect to be the result of a 20 per cent increase in health contributions.  Broadly speaking, taking one year with another a 20 per cent increase in health contributions would be of the order of £9 million but the Minister has given us an estimate of £3.9 million.</P>
    <P>Perhaps for once the Government are conscientiously calculating the serious depths of the recession and are assuming there will be a very considerable fall-off in the number of people at work, as a consequence of which the revenue to be obtained as a result of a 20 per cent increase in health contributions will mean an increase of only 10 per cent in the revenue earned by the State.  That appears to be an appalling situation.  I accept that the Minister and his advisers have been objective in their assessment of increased income, but if a 20 per cent increase will yield only a 10 per cent revenue increase this indicates an alarming degree of pessimism on the part of the Government that the employment situation will get much worse in the coming year.</P>
    <P>When the ceiling of £5,500 was set in 1979 the trade union movement then suggested that the ceiling for eligibility, and therefore for contribution, should be in the region of £7,000 to £8,000.  The fact <Col N="2101" /> that the Government fixed a very much lower figure indicates the degree to which the present or proposed ceiling falls far short of what many families know is the real level of need in relation to health expenses.  The Minister cannot claim today he is doing any more than maintaining a bad situation, where there is not adequate provision for the health and medical needs of many families.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that because of the very sharp increase in inflation in the past three years, a rate that in 1981 will be at least as bad, incomes have escalated at a rate which means that the real net contributions by many families towards health services far exceeds any increase in benefits they can obtain.  As a result of the economic and social policies of the present administration since 1977, we have come to the point where the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer.  Percentagewise the rich enjoy a much higher increase in their income than the ceiling the Minister is fixing under the legislation dealing with health contributions.</P>
    <P>In his reply I should like the Minister to deal with another problem which is a serious cause of scandal, inefficiency and drop in productivity.  I refer to a situation where quite a number of workers are tempted to avail of their rights under the law as it exists and applies to offer evidence in the closing months of the financial year that they are disabled and unable to continue work.  It is common knowledge &mdash; the dogs in the street know it &mdash; that a number of workers opt to be declared ill in the closing months and weeks of every financial year because by so doing they can keep their annual income at a level that enables them to benefit from the health and social welfare codes.  If they continue at work and receive a net income each week which puts them above the level of eligibility they find themselves and their families at a serious disadvantage.  This is the poverty gap which exists because we have not yet succeeded in refining our social, pay and industrial codes in such a way as to stop people being tempted to manipulate the jungle of social, health and industrial laws in order to keep themselves <Col N="2102" /> within the range of certain benefits of which they would be deprived if they continued at work.  I realise it is not an easy matter to tackle this problem.  I hope the Minister and his colleagues in Government are making an effort to refine the laws to prevent such situations arising. People are applying more energy towards taking advantage of the law which is intended for those seriously ill or seriously disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>At one time it was thought that the only people who engaged in intricacies of this kind were among those who were heavily taxed and who therefore engaged in tax avoidance or even tax evasion in order to get for themselves the best possible net package, legitimately or otherwise.  This does not apply to this country alone; it is happening all over the western world.  Governments have attempted to make the law more humane and to deal with intricate cases and with the problems of individuals and families. But we have now arrived at a stage when our social code has within it serious disincentives to work and when, naturally, some people are attempting to avail of these disincentives.  When those who have a greater aptitude for work see others getting away with it, they in turn are attempted to avail of the various loopholes which exist in the law in order to give themselves what some people would regard as an easier if a more boring living.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a strong need to be more realistic in our welfare code so as to avoid situations of complexity which a few people of ingenuity can manipulate to their advantage and which in the end causes other people to follow their example and provokes a considerable amount of resentment among the general body of taxpayers, most of whom are only too willing to work but, understandly, less willing to pay considerable amounts of tax.  No matter how willing people are to pay tax, that willingness can be considerably reduced when they see others abusing the system, as it is called.  It is up to us as legislators, and to the Government, to bring forward proposals to prevent people abusing the system in a way in which it was never intended.  Apart <Col N="2103" /> from these remarks, we support the proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a necessary proposal which must come before us from time to time.  One of the difficulties about it is that such measures are dry as dust and it is very difficult to make them readable. I sympathise with the Minister and his officials in their attempt to make this type of thing appear interesting and at the same time to cover the necessary points. When this sort of thing is being introduced, Governments from time to time attempt to put their stamp on it.  In this instance it is the 1 per cent.</P>
      <P>To say that there is not an increase in the amount because the 1 per cent has been left is not true.  One per cent of what was being earned when this was introduced for the first time and 1 per cent of what is being earned now are two different things.  Everybody appreciates that, and therefore there is no point in saying there has not been an increase.  It means a substantial increase this year.  Like Deputy Ryan, I am surprised at the small amount of additional money it is estimated this will bring in.  Without discussing the matter with Deputy Ryan, I came to the same conclusion as his&mdash;it seems the Government appreciate that unemployment will get very much worse because otherwise they would have given a much more realistic figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few aspects of this which I will refer to briefly, one of them being the services that will accrue from payment of this money.  The Minister is on record on three occasions recently as suggesting that too many people are going to hospital.  He may correct me if he wants to, but I read in the newspapers recently that he had suggested people would be better off if they could be treated at home rather than going to hospital and that some doctors were inclined to send people to hospital rather than treat them at home.  I do not know whether that is true, but I should hate to think we are reaching a stage when a Minister or anybody else would publicly state that people should stay at home rather than go to hospital when they are ill.  When a person is ill <Col N="2104" /> and it is recommended he or she should go to hospital that is where he or she should go.</P>
    <P>The trouble is that we are not keeping pace with the demand for the type of hospital treatment needed.  Like most public representatives, from time to time I find it necessary to visit people in hospitals and I am alarmed at the lack of standards in some hospitals.  This in the main has been caused by the lack of finance.  It is something the Minister must give great attention to.  We have a situation where many of our hospitals are unable to cater for those seeking admission, and this makes the Minister's comment to which I have referred all the more serious.  If the Minister feels there is not sufficient accommodation or, if there is, but there is not sufficient money to pay the staff to look after the patients, saying that people should not go to hospital is not the answer.</P>
    <P>Another angle is the system of collection of this fund.  It happens often in the country that a person with a small piece of land goes to work outside the farm. Such people must have deductions made from wages or salaries.  Such people must also pay on their land valuation.  That is anything but a perfect scheme.  There should be some other system.  Many such people who have paid in and who do not know what the score is do not get the advantage to which they are entitled and many of them pay more than they should.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty arises in cases where people are alleged to be letting land.  I came across a case of this the other day. A person on whom a substantial demand was made had been letting land up to three years ago when he was working for hire.  Then this person began to work the farm as a full-time occupation.  However, a demand was sent to him not once but twice, with a threat of action if the amount was not paid.  It was alleged that the Revenue Commissioners or somebody else had stated that the person was still letting land, although it was three years since the land was let.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of thing that does not endear the Department of Health to the ordinary rural taxpayer.  More attention should be paid to this.  Even people who <Col N="2105" /> have paid&mdash;I refer particularly to farmers&mdash;get a further demand for the previous year and in 12 months' time they may get a demand for three years.  It is no use blaming the computer.  Practically all civil servants fall back on the computer now: if anything is wrong do not blame them, blame the computer.  It might be a good idea if they would go back to the good old days when people who could count did the counting and did not depend on a computer.  We all know the computer can only issue what is fed into it.</P>
    <P>We should be careful about this suggestion that there has not been an increase because this has been left at 1 per cent.  One per cent now itself produces a substantial increase.  Does the Minister feel or do the Government feel that this is like the turnover tax long ago, something that can be manipulated and if the necessity arises later the 1 per cent can become 2 per cent or 3 per cent?  This is something which has got to be watched very carefully.  I do not quarrel with the figure of £8,500.  I suppose we are reaching a stage where medicines have become so terribly expensive that it is right that healthy people should pay for those who are not so healthy.  That system cannot be condemned, provided the amount demanded from them is not too great.</P>
    <P>Like the system in the voluntary health insurance, perhaps the Minister and his Department should look at the whole system operating under this to see if there is not some way in which a wider cover could be given to ordinary people.  It is true that we have now reached a stage where, as one man said to me recently, he was not well but he could not afford to be sick.  It is too bad that someone seriously ill is unable to go to a doctor; or, if they do go to the doctor and get a prescription, they are afraid to go to a chemist because of the costs involved. Perhaps the Department might consider the whole question of health services in general and see if there is some way in which they could be made more attractive. If someone living at home who is carrying on a full-time job, even if he is self-employed, does not go to hospital, it <Col N="2106" /> is often far more expensive than if he did so.</P>
    <P>The question of professional fees charged to people who go to hospital and who get, as the old saying goes, bed and board, is an aspect of health which has to be looked at by the Department of Health.  Somebody must attack the system which can, literally, put a person out on the road if they have a long stay in hospital and have to pay fees which, normally, they should not have to face. There are still people who like to say they will pay their way.  It is too bad if some independently-minded man in hospital is paying his way at the expense of his wife and family.  I know of at least one case where this happened, where so much money had to be paid out that, eventually, the family were left in very poor circumstances.</P>
    <P>We have no objection to the making of the new order but we feel that perhaps the Department of Health could be a little bit more imaginative about the whole question of health.  We have reached a stage now where another big step forward is needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies for their contributions.  I know this is a very technical measure and quite complicated in its operation and administration.  Consequently, it is not so easy to see exactly how the contributions operate.  I should like to thank Deputy Ryan for his remarks in relation to the statement.  We tried to be helpful in relation to this measure. I am sorry he still felt somewhat confused.  I can understand why, because the problem is that your percentage increase only applies to the ceiling.  It does not apply to the 1 per cent.  If it applied to the 1 per cent, you would get the effect Deputy Ryan was postulating. But since it does not apply to the 1 per cent, it has a minimal effect on the total income, together with the fact that you have a sliding-back all the time.  This is for three-quarters of a year; it can work out at less than that in the first year, in effect.  That is the fundamental difference. It is only for those people between <Col N="2107" /> £7,000 and £8,500 that you are getting that sliding back effect.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably not quite that either.  I think the Deputy will recognise that the 1 per cent not increasing has an effect on the total income.  It only applies to that portion between £7,000 and £8,500.  In addition, those people who increase at a lower level will not have the increase of the order of £7,000 to £8,500.  There are far more people at the lower level, so the actual amount of money is considerably smaller than would be anticipated.  That is one of the interesting points in relation to this discussion that should be recognised.  Health services currently cost us slightly in excess of £800 million and the total contribution from the employees is estimated to be in the order of £48.6 million.  It is reasonable to say therefore that the State is not leaning unduly on the employee in relation to charges for health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Tully said, the health services have become very expensive, and the State carries the vast bulk of the cost of these services.  If you put the cost at £800 million, the State is carrying at least £750 million of that amount.  Therefore the service in relation to the direct contribution cost is particularly good.  This is an agreement which came under the national understanding and it is honouring a further part of the national understanding. Anyone who comes under the £8,500 in the year ended 6 April this year &mdash; you are talking about the last year's income &mdash; will be entitled to the full range of hospital services in a public ward and to the specialist, diagnostic and treatment services on an out-patient basis without charge.  If for that previous tax year your income exceeds £8,500, the only thing you will not have will be consultants' fees. That is very easy to cover separately. Everything else is covered: the stay in hospital in a public ward, the cost in the hospital and even the treatment services on an out-patient basis are covered.  Consultants' fees can be covered for a very <Col N="2108" /> small cost through the VHI and that is what most people do.  A husband and wife with three children can insure themselves for that cover with the VHI for approximately £37 per annum.  That is tax allowable, which would reduce it to £24 per annum.  You are now talking about people over £8,500 in last year's earnings, not in this year's earnings.  They are probably going to be considerably over that amount in this year's earnings. To ask that couple to provide £24 per annum to cover consultants' fees is not asking too much.  It enables us to operate a system which has a balance of voluntary and statutory, something which is being increasingly recognised as a very valuable mix of service and which is in many ways more effective than a totally State-controlled system which is in England where there is a trend towards this VHI kind of cover for at least some of the areas.</P>
    <P>I think that I have covered the question about consultants fairly well.  Deputy Tully mentioned that the unemployment must be rising.  In fact we are not expecting that.  I thought that the Deputy was happy to get that point in, but in effect we take in the same estimates as we are given in the finance arrangements in the budget early in the year and there is no arrangement in that respect here in this provision.  Deputy Tully made the most of the 1 per cent by saying that it increases each year, but he will recognise that on the cost of the £850 million it has slipped a long way behind the cost of the services now, and one of the big problems on the income to the Department of Health is that provision of new services other than through the budget and taxation generally is restricted by 1 per cent.  Therefore in effect I accept what the Deputy says, that it does increase.  The trouble is that it does not increase in any way in relation to the increased costs of the health services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also raised the question about some quotation somewhere about me suggesting that people should be debarred from hospital to save hospital expenses.  I have not seen that quotation, but I do not want to debar anyone from hospital.</P>

That could arise, certainly in relation to the elderly in particular, where as the Deputy knows, there has been a practice in the past which arose very much in the mental and psychiatric services where people tended to be put into beds and left aside from the community generally.  The emphasis which I will be making here is that we want more of the elderly people to be sustained and helped to stay at home and to have the facilities to do this.  For instance, this can arise in conjunction with the opening of the new day hospital where people can come in on one day a week and get physiotherapy and various other kinds of assistance and therapy and this in effect means that they do not have to take up hospital beds and they can stay in the community.  It is in that context that I would be encouraging that kind of development.  Apart from it being better for the individual, in any event, it is also better from the point of view of the use and administration of the services.</P>

      <P>I would love to, and as soon as that becomes possible the Deputy can be certain that if I am involved I will be very anxious to do that.  Taking the question of hospitals, the same problem arises that you have people going into regional hospitals or general hospitals who could quite readily be treated locally.  We have had some excellent examples of this where the local doctors have given treatment in a hospital which was preserved locally for that purpose and people go on to or come back from the general hospital and thus we get a more efficient service overall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully mentioned one or two things about the farming side which I know to be quite close to his heart.  To clarify that point, if a farmer has another job he should tell the health board who will wait until the end of the year to take <Col N="2110" /> their contribution from the farming profits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We will follow that point and see.  In regard to the other side of the contributions, I am not making any change in the farming multiplier for the contribution year 1981-82.  It will remain at the current level of 117.  This is in recognition of the fact that the incomes have not grown in that area as they have in the other areas generally and this is the fairest thing to do in the circumstances of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of standards and needs generally we are doing a great deal to keep up with the needs.  If we look at the employment of nurses, consultants and various other people within the last three or four years we will find a very considerable increase, and I can bring those figures to the House at any time.  At the same time we have also a very major reorganisation of our hospital services under way currently and this is beginning to pay off in a fairly substantial way at this stage.  We have tremendously improved services now available in different parts of the country.  We note that we have the Cork Regional Hospital, very modern with very high standards and top class facilities.  Towards the end of next year we will have Beaumont Hospital which is again a major development and gets away from two very old facilities in the central city, Jervis Street and St. Laurence's.  I would like to pay tribute to the medical staff and the nursing staff who have worked in these hospitals with fairly outdated facilities and have provided a very high level and standard of service.  We have the new developments in St. James' Hospital which began towards the end of last year.  The building <Col N="2111" /> and construction development there is under way and that will deal with a large part of the south side centre city.  The new Tallaght Hospital board were appointed just recently and they are undertaking the planning of major facilities in Tallaght.  We will have shortly the finishing of the new major extension in Letterkenny Hospital and major upgrading of facilities and services there.  Tralee General Hospital is also almost complete and we are pushing on all the time with some other developments.</P>
    <P>We have problems of overcrowding in some areas and, I am happy to say, a major growth in population.  I am trying to deal within the resources available to me with the key pressure points in this area.  I have had extended discussions with the health boards in relation to that and I will continue to pursue that need. While I accept that we have some facilities which are not of a standard that we would like to see, we are doing a great deal to update and upgrade these.  We are envied to some extent by people outside who see the operation of these facilities and the standards to which they are developing and who comment on them from time to time.  We intend to pursue as vigorously as possible within the resources we have available the improvement of those services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully mentioned the healthy paying for the not so healthy.  I would not like that idea to go around too much. With 550,000 admissions to hospital in the year not very many people can regard themselves as above hospital.  Most people start off in hospital in the first instance, and that means nearly everybody nowadays.  Fewer than 1 per cent now do not start off that way, although earlier on in our time it was somewhat different.  Everybody is involved and everybody is sharing and I would not like people to go away thinking that there are those who are not.  We often do not think sufficiently about the extent to which we utilise in our families the services which are there and the extent to which we depend on them and need them.  It is amazing what the Deputy got into in such a short time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to confirm the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1981 which was made by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism on 4 March under section 8 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This order implements the recommendations of the Restrictive Practices Commission in the report of their inquiry into the retail sale of grocery goods below cost.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism requested the commission to hold this inquiry because the <Col N="2113" /> unease at the time in relationships between suppliers, wholesalers and manufacturers centred on the question of below cost selling and it was considered that this practice should be subjected to detailed examination.</P>
    <P>The commission in their report of their inquiry do not recommend a ban on below cost selling.  They consider that such a ban would only be justified if grave danger to the common good would result from the practice.  Such a ban would be a radical interference with freedom to trade and would constitute a form of official resale price maintenance representing a reversal of State policy which had brought progress to the trade and great benefits to the consumer.  On the evidence at the inquiry, the commission concluded that the adverse effects which below cost selling can have on manufacturers, distributors and consumers was not at present so great as to be a grave danger to the common good.  Their conclusion that a prohibition on below cost selling would not be justified is strongly reinforced by the numerous points of difficulty which prohibition would entail.</P>
    <P>In arriving at the conclusion that a prohibition on below cost selling could not be justified, the commission considered the incidence of below cost selling and its impact on Irish manufacturers, the distributive trade and the consumers.</P>
    <P>As regards the manufacturers, the commission accept the evidence of manufacturers that the practice of below cost selling has created difficulties which have absorbed considerable management time and energy and sometimes led to bad relations with their customers.  Concern was expressed on behalf of the manufacturers that below cost selling was an encouragement to imports and that loss of sales to imported goods could lead to significant job losses.  However, no evidence was produced that the practice has led, in the past, to any significant loss of market to imports and while reasons were given why it might do so in the future, equally persuasive reasons were given for the contrary view that imports would be encouraged by a ban on below cost selling. The commission concluded that the present and foreseeable circumstances of <Col N="2114" /> the food industry did not justify the prohibition of the practice.</P>
    <P>In relation to the distributive sector, the commission concluded that below cost selling has been a very powerful weapon in the hands of the multiples in competing with independent competitors and that it has undoubtedly been, on occasion, an important and maybe decisive factor in causing the close down of individual shops.  However, it cannot be regarded as being largely responsible by itself for the decline in the number of grocery outlets over the years.  This decline has followed a similar pattern in other EEC countries and is the result of developments in the trade and society generally.  It would have happened in any event, had there been no such thing as below cost selling.</P>
    <P>The commission's conclusion in relation to consumers is that it would not be in their interests to recommend an abatement of present competition.  There was no call on behalf of the consumer for a ban on below cost selling.  The one body representing consumers at the inquiry considered that below cost prices were a worthwhile help in keeping prices down in a time of inflation.  They rejected the idea that below cost prices are misleading, saying that shoppers, in general, have a very good idea of prices and would not be misled as to the overall level of prices in the store.  Another body representative of consumer interests said in a letter to the commission that they support the general principle of competition in trade and would object to any restriction which would interfere with this.  The commission note the point that, since items sold below cost are usually staple goods, or at least goods in very wide demand, reductions in their price should often particularly benefit poorer customers.</P>
    <P>The adverse effects for manufacturers and distributors, while they would not justify the prohibition of below cost selling, were considered by the commission to justify the retention of the constraints on the practice in existing legislation, namely the power to withhold supplies from retailers who sell below cost and the prohibition of advertising below cost. These constraints can be very effective in <Col N="2115" /> practice and must have an important effect in limiting the extent to which below cost selling is practised.  The commission have made recommendations for the amendment of these two provisions which would have the effect of extending and strengthening the present regime. The order which the Minister made on 4 March is to implement the commission's recommendations in this regard and also their recommendations for the consolidation of the existing orders and that coverage of all provisions should apply to the same range of goods, that is, foodstuffs with certain exceptions and nonfood groceries.</P>
    <P>Before deciding to accept the commission's recommendations, very careful consideration was given to the conclusions and recommendations in the commission's report.  As regards the various sectors involved, I consider that there is as much evidence to support the argument that a ban on below cost selling would actually lead to increased imports as there is in support of the case that it would improve the position of Irish manufacturers. The commission's conclusion that the present and foreseeable circumstances of the Irish food manufacturing industry do not justify the prohibition was one to which particular importance was attached.</P>
    <P>In so far as the distributive trades are concerned, the commission's view that while below cost selling has, on occasion, been an important and perhaps decisive factor in causing the closedown of individual shops, it could not be regarded as being largely responsible, by itself, for the decline in the number of independent grocery outlets is accepted.  There is no doubt but that the advances made in this country over the past number of decades have had great implications for the distribution trade.  These advances have manifested themselves in the manner of preparation and presentation and sale of foodstuffs, in the social fabric of our society, entailing certain changes in the pattern of distribution of population, higher standards of living and altered consumer attitudes and expectations. These are normal forces of change, <Col N="2116" /> whose effects would have been felt even if there were no below cost selling.</P>
    <P>Below cost selling has, indeed, an element of unfairness in it which affects mostly the independent sector.  However, the commission make the point that, even if the practice were to be prohibited, alternative and equally damaging forms of competition would still be open to the larger traders.  Furthermore, below cost selling is not a weapon against which the individual trader has no defence.  It is clear that, even at its fullest development, the multiple sector needs to be supplemented by independent outlets. The attractions offered by the independents, such as extended hours of business and personal service and their ability to develop and to exploit local opportunities as they occur, should ensure their continued existence.  While some further diminution of numbers may occur, due to the operation of the forces mentioned, I do not believe that there is any danger that independent grocers will disappear from the scene.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that the prohibition of below cost selling would be justified in any way by the consumer interest.  The commission's view that such a ban would be a radical interference with the freedom of trade and would constitute a form of official resale price maintenance which would represent, up to a point, a reversal of a State policy which had brought rapid progress to the trade and benefits to the consumer is fully accepted.  Following the enactment of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, the area of the supply and distribution of grocery goods was one of the first sectors to benefit and individual or collective resale price maintenance was the first practice prohibited by order under the Act.</P>
    <P>It is of interest to recall here the words of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Seán Lemass, on the introduction of the proposed restrictive practices legislation in 1952, which were that &ldquo;the aim of policy must be to foster competition wherever possible and to introduce that element of risk into every trade which will force those engaged in it to strive towards maximum efficiency at all times&rdquo;.  This policy has <Col N="2117" /> underlain all restrictive practices legislation in the intervening years and we have seen the fruits of it in the elimination of such practices as widespread resale price maintenance and the strengthening of competition to the benefit of all those involved in the sector, including the consumer. The outlawing of below cost selling would be a backward step in this policy which could only be justified if there was the clearest evidence to support the backward step.  No such evidence has been produced.</P>
    <P>The general conclusion of the commission is that &ldquo;the fact that the commission has not recommended the prohibition of below cost selling is due, not to any belief that there are not quite serious problems in the grocery tade, but to a belief that the problems have comparatively little to do with below cost selling&rdquo; and it suggests that the real cause must be looked for in such areas as unequal power relationships and discriminatory application of terms and conditions of supply.  Having regard to this and to various proposals which have been made regarding problems in the sector, it has been decided to request the Restrictive Practices Commission to hold such an inquiry into the supply and distribution of grocery goods as would allow of treating all issues which are considered relevant to the overall problems of the sector.</P>
    <P>I would like now to refer briefly to the provisions of the order which serve to strengthen existing controls, which are the power of suppliers to withhold supplies from retailers who sell below cost and the prohibition on advertising below cost.  In the existing provisions relating to both of these controls the cost price is determined by net invoice price, including VAT, at which the goods were purchased. For the purposes of the new order &lsquo;net invoice price&rsquo; is to be calculated from the latest invoice relating to the delivery of like goods.  This amendment will get over the problem previously experienced of associating a particular invoice with particular goods and is expected to increase the effectiveness of both controls.  It will also be of particular benefit in enforcing the prohibition on advertising below cost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2118" /> There has also been incorporated into the order a provision for the application of a &lsquo;four week rule&rsquo; in respect of stocks, which will also apply to both the power to withhold goods and the prohibition on advertising.  Under this rule, in the case of stocks sold by a retailer more than four weeks after the date on which a supplier's price list for like goods has been altered, the cost price of the goods is to be calculated by reference to the supplier's current best list price and not the net invoice price.  This rule is intended to deal with a situation where traders who had stocks laid in would be free to sell more cheaply and would be likely to make the most of their publicity in regard to these items. There would then be increased temptation to other traders to break the law and match the cheaper prices.  The rule should also help to lessen the disparity in prices between different retailers.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions in the order for the strengthening of the existing constraints on below cost selling.  The order also extends the power to withhold goods to own label goods and the prohibition on advertising below cost to special offers that is, offers which have the effect of reducing the average price of goods below net invoice price including VAT, even though the prices of individual items might not be below that level.  Advertising on behalf of as well as by retailers will be prohibited under the new legislation.</P>
    <P>It will be seen accordingly that the order has the effect of strengthening the existing constraints on below cost selling, making them more effective, and will facilitate enforcement.  The order, being in consolidated form, will lead to greater ease of interpretation.  In accordance with section 8 (3) of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, it must be confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas, and I have no hesitation in recommending the confirming Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this Bill has come to the House after a long time.  The report of the Restrictive Practices Commission was placed before the Minister on 14 November last and it has taken four months to get the Bill to the floor of the House.  The contents of <Col N="2119" /> the order are extremely disappointing, because the Minister has failed to grasp the real issue of below cost selling and has accepted the recommendations of the Restrictive Practices Commission.  I do not find fault with the commission's report.  While it has anomalies and while one reading through it is led to the logical conclusion that the commission must recommend the prohibition of below cost selling, nevertheless in the next paragraph there is a complete change.  As far as I can see, logic goes out the window. One of my colleagues was reported yesterday as saying it would take some kind of a dodgy theologian to figure out the logic of all this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot say the same about the Minister as I said about the findings of the commission.  During the time the inquiry was taking place we had not experienced the kind of price war with which the grocery trade are now confronted.  We had sporadic outbreaks of below cost selling and, as is rightly mentioned in the commission's report, it was not a great problem.  As the Minister of State mentioned and as the accompanying GIS statement with the commission's report mentioned, the evidence given by two groups on behalf of the consumer agreed that below cost selling should be retained.  At that stage they had not experienced the kind of price war which is now going on.  The multiples also felt, in their own interests, that there was no way in which a prohibition on below cost selling should be entertained.  The Minister for obvious reasons failed to state the up-to-date position in relation to consumer groups who gave evidence at the inquiries held by the Commission.  A representative of the Irish Housewives Association recently said on television that in the light of this latter experience she now felt that the damage caused by below cost selling as evidenced in the current price war was sufficient to warrant a ban on below cost selling.  The Consumer Association of Ireland who had supported the continuation of below cost selling at the inquiry, stated on RTE in the last six weeks that in the light of this new experience there ought to be a change of heart <Col N="2120" /> in relation to below cost selling.  Even stranger, one multiple who backed the pretension of the right to sell at below cost at the inquiry hearings, pleaded with the Minister five weeks ago to intervene in this on behalf of his company because he felt that it would ruin him.  A second multiple in this city, while they have not gone on their knees pleading with the Minister, are known to be screaming for mercy at this stage because the kitchen has become too hot and they cannot stand the heat.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if the commission were faced with the experience which the trade faced in the last couple of months they would have come out in favour of a prohibition on below cost selling.  The kind of headlines carried in the national newspapers five or six weeks ago where one multiple which happens to be a multi-national company entered the race shortly after the start of the price war saying that they were entering the war to eliminate the opposition, frightened the daylights out of people who were directly affected by the price war.  Hence one multiple decided to scream for mercy.  In the light of that evidence which was not at the disposal of the Commission when they heard evidence, the Minister who has had the report of the commission since last November and has experienced what is happening now should take the experience that the trade are going through into consideration and come out on the side of a ban on below cost selling.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his introductory statement in relation to below cost advertising and the other measures under existing legislation, that they will help to tighten up the problems created by below cost selling which, he admits, has an element of unfairness.  If there is a tightening up on the advertising of below cost selling, surely it must have something inherently bad, unfair and unsavoury about it. Yet, we have the withdrawal from the brink by the Minister, in not imposing what he must know to be the correct course of action.  Trying to turn the scrum around so as to be seen to be pro-consumer and to portray me and any other Opposition as being anti-consumer will not cod anybody.  The facts speak for <Col N="2121" /> themselves.  The consumers have come out publicly and expressed their view in relation to the damage caused by below cost selling.  On the question of advertising I quote one amazing sentence from the commission's report at paragraph 4.9:</P>
    <P>We believe these reasons still hold good, and that furthermore the prohibition on advertising is useful in discouraging the unbridled spread of below cost selling since the power of below cost prices to attract is obviously limited by their not being allowed to be brought to the attention of many possible customers.</P>
    <P>The kind of logic applied in that sentence is that below cost selling is a good thing, that it keeps down prices and helps the poorer sections to buy staple foods at a cheap price.  But there is a ban on the advertising of this same facility to those same people because they should not know about it.  I cannot see the logic in saying that one cannot advertise because there is something unsavoury about it but that one can sell at below cost prices to one's heart's content provided one does not tell people about it.  The whole thing is crazy, illogical and nonsensical.  The mind boggles at the Minister's approach especially in the light of his experience of the current price war.  The only advantage in this order is that it gives a clear definition of below cost selling and of grocery goods, a legal definition that can be used for the future.  I will have a further opportunity to go into the effects of below cost selling and the effects of the unbridled expansion of multiples and so on at a later stage in this House.</P>
    <P>The acceptance by the Minister of the recommendations of the commission will mean that my party and many thousands of people, not grocers, not distributors, not manufacturers, not multiples alone, but ordinary consumers in the long run will be victims of the spurious kind of approach now in train.</P>
    <P>Most amazing of all is the statement by the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, which was reiterated today by his Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, that a further inquiry is being initiated to deal with <Col N="2122" /> terms.  I fully agree that the trading terms which are applied in relation to the purchasing of grocery goods are the kernel of the problem.  In 1972 the Restrictive Practices Commission made available to the Minister all the relevant information he needs about trading terms.  I see no reason for a further inquiry for the same purpose.</P>
    <P>The information obtained in the 1972 inquiry is available to the Minister.  He failed to take action on the recommendations and information available to him from that inquiry.  The only reason I see for promising a further inquiry is as a sop to the consumers and to the trade in general.  He knows he should be implementing the legislation under the Monopolies and Mergers Acts and the Restrictive Practices Acts.  He should be taking a much closer look at the recommendations in the report and banning below cost selling.  He has not done that.  He has said that we will have an inquiry into terms.  The fool is being sent further.  That is the conclusion I draw from what the Minister said.</P>
    <P>There is also a statement in the commission's report bolstering up their argument in favour of the retention of below cost selling that they see no justification in introducing a prohibition at this time. This begs the question: at what time and in what circumstances should below cost selling be prohibited?  No indication is given as to when in the view of the commission this type of attitude should be adopted.  There is much information in the commission's report.  At the time and in the circumstances in which they held the hearing they were probably justified in the long run in recommending that, but since the report was presented to the Minister many things have happened in the grocery trade.  The experience in the past few months in the current price war has been beyond all expectations of what might happen in the grocery trade.  The intensity and the vindictiveness were never envisaged by the commission.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of all these facts and yet, for some unknown reason, he has accepted a recommendation on below cost selling which is now completely out of date.  The Minister knows <Col N="2123" /> that, and he is trying to retrieve the position by promising a further inquiry into terms.  He is trying to hang his hat on the consumer peg, despite the fact that the two major consumer organisations have taken their hats off their pegs in the past few months because of what they see happening around them.  The Minister's reaction is very disappointing to me.  I reject the argument made by the Minister in accepting this recommendation even though it may have had some validity at the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody disputes the fact that what we are dealing with here is a price war.  Can the Minister or anybody explain to me how you can have a war in which there are no casualties?  If there are to be casualties, where are they to fall?  What is happening in this price war, to which this Bill inadequately, to put it mildly, addresses itself, is not just savage and cut-throat commercial competition. There is nothing unusual about that.  It is also a classic example of a new kind of economic colonialism which, if not masterminded, is certainly heavily influenced from abroad by large multinational stores and chains.</P>
      <P>Even when we use the terminology of war and battles, there is some kind of assumption that there is a proportionality between the forces engaged but, when we look at the fact that the turnovers of the two chains engaged in this price war, and which are controlled from outside Ireland, approximate to almost twice the total turnover of the grocery trade in Ireland, we have to ask ourselves are the terms of this competition fair.  If they are not, as they cannot be with that kind of discrepancy, are the Government doing enough to make them fair?  In this party we believe strongly that the terms are not fair, and that the Government are only tinkering with the problem, only fiddling with the minor nuts and bolts of a machine which is in danger of going very seriously wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the Minister with interest which turned into incomprehension and almost a sense of ridicule.  Throughout his speech, time after time the Minister <Col N="2124" /> admitted that the effects of this price war, substantially if not entirely controlled from abroad, are serious for individual retail outlets.  The Minister went on to justify his minimal policy of intervention &mdash; one might almost call it a policy of non-intervention &mdash; by setting up straw men and by proving clearly that these straw men can be knocked down.  The Minister recognised that below cost selling &ldquo;has undoubtedly been on occasion an important and maybe decisive factor in causing the close down of individual shops&rdquo;.  This is precisely what the people who are complaining about below cost selling are saying, and the Minister is agreeing with them.  What does he go on to say?</P>
    <P>However, it cannot be regarded as being largely responsible by itself for the decline in the number of grocery outlets over the years.</P>
    <P>There is an understandable tendency on the part of spokesmen for the independent retail grocers to maximise the effect that they believe below cost selling has had on their operations.  But none of them with any sense will claim that below cost selling alone has been largely responsible for the decline in the number of independent retail grocery outlets.  Of course it has not been, but the case that the Minister is rejecting is not the case that is being made.  The case that is being made is that the virtually unfettered allowance of below cost selling has had a serious effect on the trade as a whole and will have a more serious effect on the trade as a whole.</P>
    <P>Later on in the Minister's speech he admits that below cost selling has an element of unfairness in it.  He admits that that element of unfairness affects mostly the independent sector.  Having admitted these charges he then goes on to say:</P>
    <P>... I do not believe that there is any danger that independent grocers will disappear from the scene.</P>
    <P>Who seriously believes for a moment that independent grocers will disappear from the scene?  As long as there is one huckster shop in Bailieborough the Minister will be able to stand over that sentence. <Col N="2125" /> The grocers, no matter how threatened they feel, would not go to the wall in defence of the statement that the price war will lead to the total elimination of independent grocers; of course it will not. But they will go to the wall, and are going to the wall at present, to defend the statement that below cost selling is not only affecting them very deleteriously but poses many long term problems for the trade for the consumer, the food industry in this country, for jobs in manufacturing and in retail and ultimately &mdash; and indeed perhaps not so ultimately after all &mdash; for the consumers themselves.</P>
    <P>In effect, therefore, the Minister is confirming most of the fears which have been expressed, but his predictions are not related to what people say will actually happen.  In fact the things he is predicting will not of course happen, but what he has not addressed himself to are to the predictions of what will happen. These predictions are that the price war and the unfair competition it involves will entail a steady erosion of the position of the independent Irish-based retailer, especially in the grocery trade and that the advantage will go to the multiples and, more especially, to multiples controlled from outside this country.</P>
    <P>It was sad in a sense to hear the Minister justifying his inertia by referring to Seán Lemass and the idea of competition. We are all in favour of competition as long as it produces the goods, as long as it results in reduced prices to the consumers and an improvement in services. And there is a stage in the development of economic systems in which competition has precisely that effect.  I would be the first to admit it.  But, just as in wars there have to be casualties, in competitions there have to be winners; and, if there are going to be winners, there are going to be losers also.  Again I would ask the Minister, in this competition, which he seems to think is so vital and could be allowed to go on virtually unchecked into the indefinite future, who will be the winners and who will be the losers.</P>
    <P>It is almost undeniable that at a certain stage of development competition gives way to increasing monopolisation and monopolies, and that large food chains <Col N="2126" /> with financial fire power at their back can quite simply sink the opposition.  Once the opposition has disappeared from the scene they can raise their prices again to a more profitable level.  To do this, and to achieve a stranglehold, they do not have to put every independent retail grocer out of business &mdash; it would not be worth their while &mdash; as long as they put enough of them out of business.  The way things are going at present it is the chains and multiples and not the Government who will decide how many independent retail grocers are put out of business.</P>
    <P>There is a touching faith on the part of people who believe in the efficiency of the market, that the market always finds its own level, that competition will always exist and that competition will always be to the benefit of the consumer, the producer, the middle man and so on.  But this tendency towards monopoly in the market, which I have outlined and which is evident already in many other areas of economic activity, is now becoming dramatically clear in the area of food retail distribution.  There is a real problem here because, unless it is checked, we will find ourselves in the ironic situation of being a country which can produce food, at least potentially, perhaps more efficiently than any other country in Europe, importing more and more food that we could grow, market and sell ourselves.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough that so much of our renewable natural resources, natural resources which are at least as precious as the depletable mineral ones, are exported without sufficient value being added to them by way of processing and processing industries.  But if we are to become a major food importing nation, if our consumers' purchasing power is going to be devoted to increasing employment in the countries which are exporting their food to us, then we will have nobody to blame but ourselves and the Governments that let it happen.  Or, in the final analysis, if we are to become a pauper economy, a beggar economy, the social welfare recipient of the EEC, globally passive and indolent, having given up the fight, it is because we did not wage the battle when it was important to wage it.</P>
    <P>In relation to consumers it is undeniable <Col N="2127" /> that in the short term below cost selling is of advantage.  But there is below cost selling and below cost selling.  This party are not opposed to below cost selling in principle; we supported a Government which introduced subsidies on basic foods.  That is a form of below cost selling but it is a form of below cost selling which is directed and controlled by Government in the interests of particular sections of the community and, indeed, in the interests of fairness and equity across the community as a whole.  We are not in favour of below cost selling which is controlled and directed by private, increasingly monopolistic enterprises whose main function is not to serve the customer or the consumer but to make profits for their shareholders.  It is not perhaps even widely recognised that one of the effects of the price war has almost certainly been artificially to depress the consumer price index, because the sampling that goes on for the consumer price index must inevitably include outlets where below cost selling takes place.</P>
    <P>The CPI which is an important determinant of certain wages and other forms of remuneration can be quite deleteriously affected and distorted by the existence of the price war at a particular point in time.  That is an area in which the consumer is being asked to give back with one hand what he has taken with the other.</P>
    <P>Despite all the rhetoric about competition it is obvious that the Government have no opposition in principle to intervening in the price war.  The Bill before us improves marginally a number of forms of intervention.  Therefore, we must take all the rhetoric about free and unfettered competition in that context at least.  We are not talking about whether the Government should interfere.  We are talking about the scope of their intervention and about the efficacy of their intervention. It is obvious that this form of intervention will only postpone the day on which that proportion of the Irish retail grocery trade is further whittled away and further eroded by unfair competition.</P>
    <P>There are a number of ways in which <Col N="2128" /> Government intervention could be more effective.  The RGDATA have suggested one such way and that is the use of the placet-planning mechanism to restrict the size of supermarkets in terms of construction and operation, regardless of who may be involved.  So far as I know this is a mechanism which has been adopted with some success in the Federal Republic of Germany.  It is not a particularly socialist or radical innovation.  Yet, through its fairly simple mechanism it would help to combat the unfair advantgages which are enjoyed by the big combines and particularly by the multinationals.</P>
    <P>Another area in which effective action might be taken, if the Government do not intend banning below cost selling, would be to examine the restriction that the outlets involved in below cost selling impose regarding the number of items that may be purchased.  The supreme cynicism of these outlets is shown by the fact that they are only prepared to allow each customer to purchase a modest number of below cost items.  Their rhetoric will indicate that the reason for this is to allow all consumers a fair chance but in reality the situation is that these outlets do not want a situation in which some of their competitors would arrive in the stores early in the morning and buy all the below cost items on the shelves.  If there were such bulk buying other traders could sell the items bought at below cost at a reasonable price and still make a profit.  In other words, the outlets we are talking of are not in the wholesale business and in particular they are not in the wholesale business to operate to the advantage of their competitors.  I suspect that if the practice of restricting customers to a very limited number of items below cost were to be made illegal the rhetoric of the chains concerned, particularly those with foreign connections, would be exposed for what it is because no chain could afford to continue to fill their shelves with below cost items as quickly as they would be depleted in the event of the restriction being lifted.</P>
    <P>What is interesting so far as I am concerned is that there is more suspicion than gratitude on the part of any consumer <Col N="2129" /> to whom I have spoken about this below cost selling.  Naturally, consumers take advantage of the situation but they are not under any illusion that the bonanza will last and that the below cost goods will be available indefinitely.  They know very well that there will be a price to be paid at the end and they suspect that they will be the ones who will have to pay that price in terms of higher prices with increasing monopolistic food outlets. All they can do is to take advantage of the goose that lays the golden eggs while it is still alive.</P>
    <P>This is no way in which to run an economy, to run a consumer service or to control trade in the interest of Irish producers of food and of the jobs of those who are involved in food processing and, ultimately, of those who are buying the groceries at the end of that chain.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister even at this late stage to abandon this other report that he is commissioning and to take firm and decisive action on the basis of the information available to him.  He must have enough information now to make three times the intervention and the restriction on below cost selling as is the case in respect of this Bill.  If he fails to do this and in particular if he fails because he is afraid that to do so would be to his party's disadvantage electorally during the next few months both he and the Government will stand indicted yet again for putting party before country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should stop now and consider seriously what he is doing by way of this legislation as it affects the Irish grocery trade.  The Government should be giving leadership in this fundamental and important area. The Minister must be concerned with the ever-escalating import figures so far as food is concerned.  Last year, for instance, we imported foodstuffs to the extent of more than £500 million.  I am convinced that between 90 and 95 per cent of these imports consisted of goods that could have been produced, processed and marketed at home.  The Government must face up to the situation. The people have become aware of the <Col N="2130" /> failure of the Government to take action in this whole area.</P>
      <P>The matter before us is one of the most fundamental to be debated here for a long time.  Many of the jobs that were lost last year could have been saved if the Government had realised what was happening. This country should be almost self-sufficient in terms of food production. If the seriousness of the present trend is not recognised by the Government we can only hope that it will be recognised by some officials of the Department.  If the present trend in food imports continues, the figure in that regard will equal, if not exceed, the figure for our exports of foodstuffs.  If that happens a very serious situation will have been created for all of us.  Somebody must face up to the facts sooner or later but if much more time elapses before action is taken, it will be too late to do anything effective.</P>
      <P>We have allowed a situation to arise in which a very sizeable portion of the grocery trade, over 30 per cent of it, is now really controlled by two main supermarket groups, Quinnsworth and Tesco, and they are engaging in a price war.  As far as I can see, their aim is to take over an even greater share of the Irish food market. In some of the larger supermarkets in the bigger towns I have been invited to see the imports of food and to see not only a lorry load but a lorry with a trailer behind arriving from Britain with foodstuffs, items we are well capable of producing in Ireland at a competitive price.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is by accident that we have outside the gates of this House this afternoon members of the Irish Association of Distributive Trades and the members of RGDATA.  These people are there, I believe, largely because of this Bill and this order.  That is mainly why they are picketing this House.  They are not here for pleasure but in an effort to bring home to the Government the error of its ways.  Obviously, the Government are not listening to or heeding the message from rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is grave concern throughout the country about what is happening in the food trade.  It is time the Minister shouted stop and took action.  The Bill and the <Col N="2131" /> order are being used as smokescreens by the Government because of their failure to take action.  We have seen mini-budgets day after day.  If the Government wanted to do anything in regard to controlling escalating prices and to reverse that trend, the way to do it is to restore the full food subsidies that were in existence from mid-1975.  The power lies with the Government to take action.  Fine Gael and Labour Party Members have asked the Minister to have a complete reappraisal of food imports.  The Minister and his Department should consider the items being imported that were formerly produced here.  A number of the bigger firms have moved the production of some of the goods to Britain.  We should think of all the jobs that have been lost in this way.  We should take serious stock of ourselves, a nation that should be almost self-sufficient in regard to food.  We are allowing the situation to deteriorate and get out of hand by permitting ever-increasing food imports.</P>
    <P>I am seriously concerned.  I assure the House and the country that if we are in the next Government the orders the Minister has brought in this afternoon will be reversed.  If we have the opportunity we will try to re-establish the food industry as an area for growth and also re-establish associated industries in that sector.  There is a tremendous range of job opportunities in this field.  The tragedy of bringing in these orders that we have here today is that they will lead only to further food imports by multinational supermarket groups.  The expansion of these groups is obvious to everybody.  They are slowly but surely wiping out the middle and small business men, the medium size grocery and the family supermarket or grocery shop.  They are being eliminated in rural Ireland and in our larger towns and cities.  Minister, you must be aware of this matter in your own constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received numerous representations in this matter and so I am certain have many Deputies opposite. <Col N="2132" /> The time for action has arrived; but, unfortunately, the Government have decided on the wrong action.  The Restrictive Practices (Confirmation of Order) Bill and the attitude of the Minister in accepting the report presented to him represent a blunder of the highest order and I am dismayed by the action of the Government.  Surely the Minister is aware that nobody can sell an item below cost.  There may be many different devices to bring in business to the supermarket chains, and they succeed, but when people go to buy the special items they are caught on other items in these supermarkets.  With massive publicity and expenditure on advertising the supermarket groups are succeeding in attracting business.  I believe that by the manner in which they have done it they have seriously damaged the whole food industry, which is in a state of total disarray. Does the Minister intend to let the situation drift further?</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>On the evidence of the inquiry the commission concluded that the adverse effects which below cost selling can have on manufacturers, distributors and consumers was not at present so great as to be a grave danger to the common good.</P>
      <P>What does &ldquo;at present&rdquo; mean?  How many more grocery shops will have to close before action is taken?  Will 500, 1,000 1,500 or 2,000 grocery firms have to close?  If 2,000 more shops are closed, who will get their business?  It is obvious that a major portion of that business will be taken up by multinational supermarkets who have little loyalty to this country as can be seen from the amount of food they import.  We will have to consider where we are going with regard to the food industry.  We have seen many factories getting into difficulties because so many food items are being imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must take action quickly and try to reduce the growth of supermarket chains.  If he fails to take action this Government will be condemned, and rightly so, by the people.  This Bill has met with widespread opposition.  The <Col N="2133" /> people know increased food imports are damaging our economy.  The loss of the home market can mean the difference between survival and closure for many food manufacturing firms.  If these firms have a good solid home market they can survive, but if they lose the home market their chance of survival becomes slimmer.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for this matter rests on the Minister's shoulders.  He has a duty to the smaller shopkeepers, to the family supermarkets and to the workers but, above all, he has a duty to this country, to take proper action.  I have stated the present position as clearly as I can. The continued growth of the supermarket chains must be curtailed.  Their unfettered growth calls into question the Government's attitude not just in this matter but in their whole approach to employment. This challenge must be faced and positive action must be taken.</P>
    <P>We will face a very difficult time if the control of food distribution leaves Irish hands.  Everybody on this side of the House is very concerned about this matter. I believe that when the next election comes round the Government's approach will be that they allowed below cost selling to help the consumer.  The majority of consumers realise that this is only a short-term gain, which in the long-term will mean dearer food for all.</P>
    <P>When many firms were given monopolies in particular areas they increased their prices because there was no competition. If the Government use this type of argument with the electorate during the next election campaign, it will not go down very well with the majority of consumers. This is a smokescreen to try to distract people's attention from the real issue of ever-escalating price increases. Every housewife I meet is highly critical of the Government's failure to take action to control prices.  When in Opposition, Fianna Fáil promised to control prices but they have failed to do so.  The greatest blunder the Government made was to do away with food subsidies.  If they want to help the consumer they should restore food subsidies and this would help reduce inflation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2134" /> This Bill is a very grave mistake and as a party we are opposed to it.</P>

      <P>Most Deputies have not addressed themselves to what we are trying to do here.  We have heard about all sorts of things, &mdash; including a reference to an election although I do not know what election the Deputy is talking about, and he might have to wait much longer for an election &mdash; which are not concerned with the purpose of this Bill. It is designed to confirm an order which has already been made by the Minister. That is the only matter we are discussing.</P>
      <P>It amazes me that there is such opposition to a measure which has been welcomed, particularly by consumers.  Following publication of the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission, a spokesman for the Irish Housewives' Association was reported in the press as saying they believed below cost selling to be of benefit to housewives and that they were in favour of it.</P>
      <P>Price wars are not something new.  In fact, they have taken place from time to time over a long period.  The only difference this time is that under-cost selling has been given greater publicity than in the past and Deputies are over-reacting to reports on this matter.  Action was taken on the 1972 report by way of orders made in 1973.  We are watching the situation closely and will do whatever we believe to be in the best interests of the community at large.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan referred to competitiveness. We believe that competitiveness is a good thing.  We do not want unfair competition but it must be recognised that competition is basic to our way of life.  I stated in my speech that there is no evidence to show that what is happening has had any bearing on imports.  Contrary to what Deputies have suggested, we have not had positive proof that the situation has changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This section relates to the proposal to grant jurisdiction under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, to the District Court.  At present this court does not have jurisdiction in this area and, in our view, should not be given jurisdiction in relation to matters such as the guardianship of infants or wards of custody.  The points made last week in relation to earlier sections that proposed the granting of family law jurisdiction to <Col N="2137" /> courts that do not at present have such jurisdiction apply equally in this case.</P>
      <P>In our judgment questions relating to such important matters as the future of children and the legal response appropriate for their protection and welfare are not matters best dealt with by the District Courts as they are operated presently. Secondly, the court process and procedure generally which is based on the mutual adversary system is liable to do severe damage in some cases to the interests of children and those whose futures would be the subject of discussion and mutual hostility in that forum.</P>
      <P>There is a fundamental and rooted difference of opinion between the Minister and ourselves with regard to this matter. I am convinced that the proposal in the Bill is extremely misguided and will do untold damage.  I have already made a plea, which I reiterate, that subjects such as the guardianship of infants, wards of court and family law in general will best be dealt with by a different court process, what might be called a family tribunal or forum.</P>
      <P>It is a strongly held view not just of some politicians or professional associations who are concerned about the welfare of families and young people but of members of the Judiciary and of organisations representing legal interests that as the courts are presently managed it would be very wrong to grant the jurisdiction now proposed.  District Courts do good work in some cases, but in other cases perhaps they do not handle matters with as high a standard of excellence as one might like.  I do not believe they are the best forum for dealing with matters now about to be put on their agenda.</P>
      <P>I should like to read from a submission from the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland in relation to the matter we are discussing now.  The submission states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ideally, the Society would wish that all family matters be dealt with by new and simplified procedures that would remove the necessity for duplicating proceedings on marital breakdown, maintenance of spouse and children, custody of children, property rights, etc.  The Society notes that the Minister <Col N="2138" /> has referred this aspect to the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure. It hopes that a report will be available at an early date and that legislative action thereon will not be delayed.</P>
    <P>The Incorporated Law Society comment favourably on the question of extending the barring order from three months to 12 months, which we support.  The society go on to say:</P>
    <P>The Society consider that family law cases should be dealt with only in situations which have adequate facilities for the private hearing of such cases, together with facilities for waiting in consultation rooms designed to preserve the confidentiality of the clients in such delicate matters.  A number of court houses are seriously lacking in this regard.</P>
    <P>The above professional association is not normally known for over-committing itself in matters that might cause embarrassment in any quarter.  We must listen to what people in that association say about this matter.  As recently as two weeks ago some eminent members of the Judiciary condemned outright the conditions under which they have to administer standards of justice.  All of the comments made compel us to look askance at this proposal.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows there are courtrooms throughout the country that are little better than hovels.  The walls are covered with graffiti and there are no private rooms where consultations may be held.  The seating in these buildings is ancient, chipped and broken, there is no heating and neither the staff, clients or judges can be comfortable working in such surroundings.  I am not asking that there should be any new major resource commitment to build new courthouses but I ask that urgent consideration be given to the creation of court fora.  By this I mean that existing buildings &mdash; public buildings, community buildings, school halls and so on &mdash; could be used for this purpose.  The day when the court was thought of as a vast hall full of columns, <Col N="2139" /> before which people were dragged, screaming and shouting, to be dealt with before being sent away for long periods, has long gone.</P>
    <P>It is misguided to send to the District Court matters dealing with the future of children.  In many cases there has not been adequate representation on behalf of the children &mdash; one of the reasons they are in their present difficulty.  These children could be children of broken homes or no homes.  They could be waifs, urchins or children in care.  It can truly be said that society owes them the best because they have not had the benefit of the best up to that point.  We are giving them a system that is much speedier than a process in the High Court because it was the intention that it would be a more speedy and cheap process.  We are giving them structures and facilities that have been condemned outright by judges, professional associations and anybody who has taken the trouble to visit the courts.  We are giving them quick, rough legal treatment and damn little justice.</P>
    <P>If this section is put through &mdash; obviously it will be if the Minister does not change his mind &mdash; if and when we get a chance the first thing we must do is to repeal it.  I say that in the belief that this will become a priority with us because it deals with the welfare of children and peripheral matters.  Children must get a special type of treatment not now available in the courts system and certainly not in the District Court.  When you look at statistics dealing with cases in the Children's Court or the District Court generally, you are speaking about minutes on average.  Is it expected that a tier of courts to whom the Minister does not propose to give even one extra secretary will now be able to take on the burden of family law and Guardianship of Infants Act cases and that they can deal with them justly and fairly?</P>
    <P>We are talking about half terrified youngsters about whom nobody has given a damn so far.  That is not good enough and the Minister knows it.  Without going into further detail on this matter, I will say that we vehemently oppose this section.  If it becomes law our intention <Col N="2140" /> is to ensure that it will be law only for the shortest possible length of time.</P>
    <P>We should be saddened that a situation will arise under this section, in small country courts as well as in some city courtrooms, where we will witness husbands, wives and families being torn apart by well-meaning legal interests, judicial representatives who mean well but who are being asked to do a job in respect of which they have not had the training, the insight, the responsibility or the experience until now.  I do not see how we can honestly expect, on average, anything other than miscarriages of justice in such situations.  The fate of children is much too important an issue to be dealt with or decided by any one individual, and this is part of the fundamental change now being proposed.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this should be in the hands of a type of tribunal with people who have expertise and an interest in the welfare of children.  They could be given judicial functions and responsibilities if the Minister and the Government wish. What is needed is an instrument of justice that will be sensitive and compassionate, not an arrangement designed initially to deal with local matters quickly and cheaply.  That type of court was never intended to deal with family law cases. To propose to squeeze such cases into District Court jurisdiction is wrong and it cries out to heaven to be corrected.</P>
    <P>If this goes ahead I hope it will be corrected before long: I honestly believe that this cannot become operative anyway because the courts are already fully engaged and do not have the skills or the resources necessary to deal with these new cases.  Therefore, I ask the Minister seriously to reconsider the misguided proposals in front of us in this section which uniquely in this part of the world sets out to grant the District Court power to decide cases in this most sensitive area of child welfare.  The person who will be deciding these cases has not had, in his training or background, any reason to take cognisance of developments in this area.  Perhaps I will be misinterpreted and accused of having a go at district justices.  I do not wish to do so, but there is no point in trying to pretend that somebody <Col N="2141" /> whose job is X should be responsible for Y.  They are two separate jobs.</P>
    <P>This section should be re-thought.  I have proposed its deletion from the Bill in the hope that the Minister will listen to what we have said and at least reconsider it for Report Stage.  In the meantime he can get some guidance from people who, like many of us, are concerned about the implications of the section and who fear what may happen.  I am not suggesting there will be a major outcry and that people will take to the streets, but the children who are in a mess are in it most likely because they have not had a lobby to represent them.  Part of the mark of our civilisation is the way we deal with those who are weakest in our society. As I said, I do not suggest there will be a revolution if this section goes through, but those outsiders, boys and girls who languish in care because of archaic legislation, need special attention. They have not had the equal opportunity which the Constitution commends. I am not making this plea for political advantage or disadvantage but because, above any section in the Bill, this section will strike at the heart of the interests of young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>This section gives the District Court new jurisdiction under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, and extends the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court under the same Act.  At present the District Court has no jurisdiction under the Act and the Circuit Court has jurisdiction only in relation to Part II of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 of the 1964 Act gives jurisdiction under Part II of that Act, dealing with guardianship matters and awards of custody, to the High Court and the Circuit Court.  The courts committee recommended in their 20th Report that the courts referred to in that part should be the Circuit and District Courts rather than the High and Circuit Courts. Accordingly, subsection (1)(a) of the section now proposed replaces the existing section 5 of the 1964 Act with a new section which makes no reference to the High Court and confers full jurisdiction <Col N="2142" /> under Part II on the Circuit Court and limited jurisdiction on the District Court.</P>
    <P>As Part II of the Act gives a court power to make maintenance orders &mdash; sections 7 and 11 &mdash; the District Court's jurisdiction to make such orders is being limited by the new section to a maximum of £30 per week per child, in order to maintain consistency with the revised jurisdictions in affiliation cases and under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, as set out in sections 12 and 14 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The replacement of section 5 effectively removes a somewhat anomalous reference in that section to the Fourth Schedule to the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, deals with the enforcement of the right to custody, and section 13 defines the court for the purpose of Part III as the High Court.  The Courts Committee recommended in their 20th Report that jurisdiction under Part III be transferred to the District Court.  It is considered, however, that there should be no distinction between Part II and Part III jurisdiction and, accordingly, the new section 15(1)(b) which makes no reference to the High Court redefines the court for the purpose of Part III as the Circuit Court or the District Court.</P>
    <P>Section 18(1) of the 1964 Act provides that in any case where a decree for divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> is pronounced, the court &mdash; as the Act at present stands, the High Court &mdash; may thereby rule that the parent whose misconduct gave rise to the proceedings is not fit to have custody of the children of the marriage and that parent will therefore not be entitled as of right to custody when the other parent dies.  As jurisdiction in divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> is being vested in the Circuit Court by section 5 of the Bill, the new section 15(1)(c) amends section 18(1) of the 1964 Act by changing the word &ldquo;court&rdquo;, which would as a result of the preceding paragraph of the new section otherwise mean the Circuit or District Court, to &ldquo;Circuit Court&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of the new section now proposed prevents the District Court and the Circuit Court from making an order <Col N="2143" /> in any matter where a higher court has ruled, but with the exception that where the High Court has made an order before the commencement of this provision, the lower courts may vary or revoke the order if the circumstances under which it was made have changed and, in the case of the District Court, if the order is one which now falls within the new jurisdiction conferred by this section on the District Court.</P>
    <P>That is a very necessary and desirable provision where the lower courts, after the commencement of this particular section, have power to revoke an order made by the High Court in a situation where circumstances have changed.  That could mean that the circumstances of either parent maintaining a child could change because of ill health or a change in fortunes.  We could then have a situation, as it stands at present, where a guardian or parent would have to go back to the High Court to seek revocation of that order.  This is a typical example of the value of providing access to the District Court and the Circuit Court in this regard.  It is appropriate and proper that this type of facility should be afforded to the aggrieved party in so far as they can go to these courts now rather than having to go back to the High Court in a situation where their circumstances have changed.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this section are based on the recommendation of an eminently qualified committee chaired by a Supreme Court judge and have been very carefully considered, both by the Minister for Justice and by the Government, before being placed before this House. They are important provisions because they deal with matters of a very significant nature in the family context.  It is in the context of family matters generally that the courts should be empowered to deal with questions of a child's welfare. It is unsatisfactory in many cases that a court should be able to make a maintenance award against a parent or to bar that parent from the family home, while it lacks the power to decide at the same time what rights and duties in relation to the child, other than the purely financial one, should or should not be <Col N="2144" /> exercised by that parent.  It can be unsatisfactory because the court has power to deal with what may be only part of the family problem, and separate litigation, with all the concomitant expense, inconvenience and perhaps ill-feeling for the parties, must be undertaken in order to determine the important questions of guardianship and custody.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has stated before, and it is worth repeating here, that the aim of the family law jurisdiction proposals in this Bill is to provide a set of forums where families in difficulties can obtain the remedies provided by law in a convenient, inexpensive and prompt manner.  We are providing for people who have family law difficulties acess to a court where the full package of family law matters can be dealt with.  The Circuit Court will be able to provide a comprehensive package, including divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>, and the ancillary remedies recommended not only by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure but also by Shatter in his work <i>Family Law in the Republic of Ireland</i>.  The District Court will be able to provide all the remedies, with the exception of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro.</i></P>
    <P>The Circuit Court already has jurisdiction in the guardianship and custody of children by virtue of the 1964 Act.  Deletion of this section will not alter that.  It is important &mdash; even assuming that no other changes in family law jurisdiction were contemplated &mdash; that the District Court be given this jurisdiction, in order to make the exercise of its jurisdiction under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, more effective.</P>
    <P>In many cases where a barring order is sought or an application is made for maintenance of the spouse and children, or both, it is desirable that questions relating to the guardianship and custody of children be determined at the same time.  The District Court cannot decide at present, for instance, what access to the children or measure of custody, if any, should be allowed to a parent who is barred from the home, though such matters may well be crucial to the effectiveness of the main remedy sought.  This <Col N="2145" /> section gives the District Court the necessary jurisdiction to determine such questions, so that a broader view can be taken of the family difficulties coming before it and a more appropriate remedy or set of remedies can be ordered.  I am surprised at Deputy Keating who I know has a definite interest in ensuring that the greatest possible protection and access be afforded to the families on these very traumatic occasions, in the type of environment and court situation which is envisaged in this Bill.  We must, as far as possible, be in a position to ensure where the substantial remedy is being pursued that there may be related matters which arise and will also have to be dealt with. They can be dealt with in conjunction with the main remedy being sought.</P>
    <P>As regards jurisdiction under Part III of the 1964 Act, relating to the enforcement of the right to custody which this section confers on the Circuit and District Courts for the first time, I see no reason for a distinction between these matters and the general question of guardianship and custody of children dealt with in Part II of the Act.  Questions covered by Part III are equally likely to arise in relation to applications for divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> and under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 as are those dealt with in Part II, and the same reasoning applies to the extension of jurisdiction under both parts.</P>
    <P>I am aware that legal questions of extreme complexity can arise from time to time in cases under the 1964 Act, particularly where marriage took place or was dissolved outside this jurisdiction. Such knotty legal problems are not by any means confined to guardianship and custody issues and there is general provision for reference of such questions by way of case stated from the lower to the higher courts.  I am satisfied, however, that the vast majority of cases which may arise in the lower courts as a result of this provision will be relatively straightforward and that these courts are competent to determine them.</P>
    <P>I recall the Deputy making the point that much of what is proposed in section 15 was not accepted by the Judiciary on <Col N="2146" /> the basis &mdash; I presume I am right &mdash; of the inadequacy of the lower courts to deal with matters relating to children particularly.</P>
    <P>I will read an extract from the Twentieth Interim Report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, <i>Increase of Jurisdiction of the District Court and the Circuit Court</i>.  They are a very eminent committee of very eminent persons.  This extract relates to jurisdictions of the Circuit Court and the District Court in family law matters and is on page 9;</P>
    <P>15.  Among the important legal and social developments since the date of the Fifth Interim Report has been the considerable growth in the area of family law and the enactment of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976.  The latter Act largely followed the recommendations of the Nineteenth Report of this Committee. Another feature has been the considerable increase in the number of applications brought under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  These cases are almost invariably initiated in the High Court although jurisdiction conferred on a court by Part II of that Act may be exercised by the High Court or by the Circuit Court.  Part II of the Act deals with guardianship and contains section 11 which provides for applications to the court for its directions on any question affecting the welfare of an infant.  The court may make such order as it thinks proper having regard to the provisions of the Act. Part III of the Act relates to the enforcement of right to custody and the original jurisdiction under that Part of the Act is confined to the High Court.</P>
    <P>16.  Experience has shown that the vast bulk of applications in relation to the custody of children tend to be interlocutory in character and many of the cases keep recurring in the High Court as the children grow older or the family circumstances change.  These proceedings frequently last quite a long time in the High Court and prove extremely costly.  Appeals then may be carried to <Col N="2147" /> the Supreme Court which has on occasions been compelled to enter into the hearing of evidence because of allegations made and changes which have occurred between the date of the High Court hearing and the date of the Supreme Court hearing.  This has entailed considerable expense and takes up a lot of time.</P>
    <P>17.  The Committee have come to the conclusion that the courts referred to in Part II of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 should now be the Circuit Court and the District Court respectively rather than as currently the High Court and the Circuit Court. They are also of opinion that the exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court conferred by Part III of the Act should be conferred on the District Court in lieu of the High Court.  This Part of the Act deals particularly with such matters as allegations that a parent has abandoned or deserted the infant and these are matters which the District Court already deals with much more frequently than any other court by virtue of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976.  An additional advantage in transferring these jurisdictions to the Circuit Court and the District Court respectively as recommended is that these courts are better...</P>
    <P>I note what the Deputy said in so far as he was not suggesting, as he put it, having a go at district justices, and I accept that.  He did refer to the District Court's capacity to deal with family law matters and called that into question.  I take it that on one level he is being critical of the accommodation.  That appeared to be one direction he was taking.  We agreed on the last day that we would deal with the matter of accommodation under sections 30 and 31 rather than be repeating ourselves.  I reminded Deputy Keating that the court already deals with barring orders.  He suggested that many family law matters are not dealt with in the District Court at the moment.  That <Col N="2148" /> was the other point he made apart from the accommodation aspect.  He realises that this Bill proposes to give extended jurisdiction to the District Court in relation to barring orders with which that court deals already.  It deals also with the maintenance of spouses and children and affiliation matters and it is to complement its jurisdiction in these matters that it is proposed to give it a jurisdiction that it has not had before.</P>
    <P>It all boils down to providing a comprehensive facility in the District Court and the Circuit Court to deal with matters in a non-fragmented manner, as I have mentioned.  I am satisfied that the Deputy's opposition to the section on the basis that there is an incompetence in the court, based on its inability or lack of experience in the past to deal with family law matters, is not justifiable on the grounds that it has dealt and frequently does deal with family law matters.  I am really ensuring that there is the facility to deal with all family law matters in the District Court except the one provision that was formerly in the High Court and is now being provided for in the Circuit Court, that is divorce <i>a mensa et thoro.</i></P>
    <P>In conclusion, I suggest that the likelihood of a miscarriage of justice because these law courts would now have responsibility, based on what Deputy Keating has said, is something I cannot accept. He said &ldquo;miscarriage of justice&rdquo;.  He might like to have put it in different terms, but it would appear that there would be some specific reason or given motive for not being prepared to hear these cases or handle them properly.  I do not accept that.  Both the Circuit Court and the District Court will be adequate to deal with these matters.  There is an experience there, as I have stated, and the fact that there has not been a total or extended jurisdiction in these areas in the past is not a justifiable argument that we should not have them in the future.  We have reached the point where if we are to meet the wishes of the vast majority of people who unfortunately are finding themselves in this position &mdash; and there is a growing demand for seeking out remedies in family law matters in court &mdash; we should be ensuring that people who find <Col N="2149" /> they have to go to court should be in a position to get the maximum remedial opportunity in court and get it as conveniently and inexpensively as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister refuses to accept that there are a number of ways in which the ideals he put forward, worthy in themselves, can be met.  I agree with him that access is important.  That could be met in at least two other ways to which the Minister has not referred.  First of all, a proper civil legal aid scheme would have facilitated such actions.  Leaving that aside, does the Minister accept that access to the courts of justice in relation to cases which are now being proposed to be handled by the District Court could also be granted by the institution of what we might loosely call family courts or family tribunals which would ensure easy access, easy availability and inexpensiveness?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of the matter we are dealing with, it must be accepted that it is a family court, because it is dealing with family law matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Now the Minister tells me that the District Court is a family law court when it is dealing with family law case.  I do not accept the co-medial nature of the court.  That is the point I am getting at.  If the Minister accepts that a family law court is what it should be when dealing with family law cases it is asking too much of public credibility or of the people involved to somehow turn themselves on and off different types of cases.  If access is our concern, it can be given; but it should be given not on the cheap or by a short cut, hoping to God that the District Court will take up the slack and it will be all right on the day.  It will not be all right on the day.  I will quote from a letter from a person whom I will describe as an eminent legal representative.  He is referring to this section and the thoughts of many of us in relation to it.  He says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It depresses me to think of any form of justice being administered in many of these courts, but it depresses me even more to think that highly delicate <Col N="2150" /> family problems and civil actions for amounts up to £2,500 could be debated in such primitive environments.  For example, in Rathfarnham you step off the footpath and into the courthouse. It is quite impossible to consult except either in the motor-car or at the pub across the way.  Can anybody seriously suggest that in a civilised country those are proper facilities in which to conduct these cases?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>That is accommodation the Deputy is talking about there and he has agreed to leave that until&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter goes on: &ldquo;I remember doing a case in&rdquo;&mdash; he names a town &mdash;&ldquo;where the court clerk had to come in and put cardboard on the floor before the court so that the cardboard could soak up some of the rain water which was pouring through the roof.  I have dealt with cases in dancehalls, rugby club pavilions and in a place outside&rdquo;&mdash; he names a town &mdash;&ldquo;which is rather like a cowshed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am not dealing in detail with the question of accommodation but it is inseparable from other concerns in relation to cases being handled in District Courts. The other concerns are cases which I quite deliberately said would be open to miscarriage of justice by virtue of the fact that the personnel involved in handling such cases, from the top down, were never intended to be so involved.  They do not have the expertise or the knowledge of the background.  It is enough in some cases for them to do what they are supposed to be doing without asking them to take on cases dealing with the guardianship of infants.  If the Minister is truly concerned about access, there are other options.  I admit that these cause more trouble and cost more money and there is the rub.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as anyone that the District Courts, as they are at present, or are likely to be for the foreseeable future, are not suitable environments for the transaction of these particular cases which it is now proposed to give them.  To refer to barring orders being dealt with within that jurisdiction <Col N="2151" /> is neither here nor there.  The Minister on two occasions said that he did not wish the thing to be fragmented.  I do not know what that has to do with the case.  There are levels of courts, there are courthouses, there is fragmentation in the system at the present time.  What is more important than that is whether or not it is likely that a just decision will be arrived at.  How does the Minister expect that to happen in the circumstances?  I do not wish to be personal in relation to any of the members involved in the courts but one could be and the Minister knows what I am talking about as well as anyone. Have the district justices been consulted in relation to this proposed transfer of jurisdiction?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, they have been.</P>

      <P>What has been their response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The decisions that have been made by the Minister for Justice have taken into consideration the committee's views, the views of the Garda Síochána and of members of the Judiciary. The preparation of this legislation and of this section was not done in isolation of all the valuable views that might be contributed.  The weight of the Deputy's argument seems to be directed, on the one hand, towards court accommodation and, on the other, the Deputy said this afternoon that he was not having a go at the district justices, but apparently, now he is calling their competence or ability to deal with these matters into question, just because they have not been dealing with them heretofore.  That is not a solid or a justifiable argument against our ensuring that there is a more enlightened step taken in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be good enough to tell us the observations, particularly in relation to the proposal to increase the jurisdiction of the District Courts to include these cases, in respect of district justices and the legal professional interests?</P>

    <Col N="2152" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy realises that the Minister's consultations with members of the Judiciary and with members of the Garda Síochána in this connection are confidential.  It would not be fair to expect me to reveal confidential discussions. What has emerged is a Bill containing exceptions to certain proposals and the merits and demerits which the Deputy mentions.  The views of all these people were taken into consideration in preparing this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In the presence of a very much less than satisfactory response from the Minister, I am quite willing to conclude &mdash; as I know to be the case &mdash; that there has been widespread dissatisfaction and unease at these proposals amongst the interests previously referred to.  I am stating that the people who are promoting this extension of jurisdiction primarily are the Government.  They see this as being a way of handling family law cases on the cheap.  The people who, day in day out, deal with the administration of law in the courts have, in general, and overwhelmingly, expressed grave dissatisfaction and unease about the proposal herein.  That is undeniable.  Certainly, it would be wrong for the Minister to divulge, or to be asked to divulge information about confidential discussions.  I am asking for the burden of comment in that respect.  I know it to be one of extreme unease about this proposal.  It is not unreasonable to ask for an observation in that respect.  After all, if those professionals who are active in that area, daily witnessing activities in the courts, are unhappy about it, why should we ignore those comments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the capacity of district justices to deal with these cases.  I do not wish to become embroiled in any controversy. There is no point in blaming a hammer for not being a nail.  If you ask a judge to do a job which there was no expectation that he would be asked to do when he embarked on his career, undertook his training and practised throughout the courts, it is, in my view, only to be expected that the standards which would apply in that regard would not be <Col N="2153" /> those which would perhaps be appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to say that the District Courts deal with matters with less gravity, less preparation, less analysis, less consideration, less consultation and in a much shorter time than is appropriate to family cases and than has been granted to those cases up to now.  The type of adjudication involved is less suitable to the difficult questions which arise, for example, in relation to the custody of children.  That is a statement of fact.  District Courts were never meant to handle such cases and, leaving accommodation aside, the nature of the judicial process which operates in the District Courts is fundamentally unsuitable for cases concerning guardianship of infants.  It is not an answer to pretend that one is giving greater access to people with lesser means.  If access is the problem, there are a number of other options and ways of dealing with that.  When the civil legal aid proposals, which never came before this House, were introduced, that was the time for the Minister to be concerned about access, or access could be guaranteed by an appropriate, sensitive, low level, largely confidential, non-adversary type of family tribunal which would genuinely try to bring a healing effect to the problems involved here.</P>
    <P>The Minister takes refuge in referring to access and in underscoring our collective appreciation of the fine work of members of the Judiciary.  That is all to the good and should not go unmentioned. At the same time we here have responsibility. It is not adequate to refer to the recommendations of committees at great length or to pass the buck in terms of responsibility to such committees.  The responsibility is the Minister's.  It is at his desk that the buck stops.</P>
    <P>I contend that there is, at the very least, in view of the evidence of professional interested parties who have expressed concern about this proposal, a very good case for reviewing this section. I contend, from the available evidence of our eyes and our ears and the daily reading of the media in relation to the present operation of the courts at this level, some cause for concern about how this extra <Col N="2154" /> jurisdiction could be managed and handled. I contend very strongly that facilities are not available.  Accordingly, for these reasons which have to do, not just with dealing with cases in relation to the guardianship of infants in the way they have always been dealt with, but dealing with them in a better way than in the past, more sensitively, more compassionately, ensuring that there is a better standard of justice for young people, this section is fundamentally misguided. Nothing the Minister has said has even dealt with the kernel of that case.  He has spoken about access and about confidence in the system.  Access is not at issue.  We all agree that access should be greater than it is and there are ways of doing it.  Let us leave that out of it. Nobody wishes either to imply criticism of many aspects of the way that a District Court person does his job.  Let us leave that out of it also.  The central question is whether it is the best place in which to transact, justly and fairly, matters relating to the future of children who are largely unrepresented and unprotected. The answer in that case, which screams at us from all the groups involved, the professional associations, members of the Judiciary and our own common sense, is unequivocably no.  As far as I am concerned anybody who says to the contrary is not facing up to the facts.  It will be the wrong forum.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister expect the future of a child to be properly dealt with?  What kind of effect will it have on the child to be the subject, like an inanimate object, of a fight across a courtroom, dismissed in a matter of minutes, as has been the traditional practice in the Children's Court or the District Court?  That is not the way I want the children of the country to be dealt with when it comes to legal matters.  I am surprised it should be presented to us as the right way to go about it.  I would be ashamed to be a party to any system which would in 1981, instead of bringing children's legislation and family law legislation into the eighties, propose such a dismissive, fundamentally inefficient and profoundly wrong system of handling children's law and the guardianship of infants matters.  Unless the <Col N="2155" /> Minister has some new evidence to throw on the case, which is pertinent to the essential capacity of those courts to deal with those cases and the essential propriety to deal with those cases at this level, I am not at all convinced.  The Minister has not answered the question.  His case has rested on evasions &mdash; I do not mean this in a hurtful way &mdash; or dealing with issues that are peripheral to the central case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave a number of justifiable reasons why the provisions within this section should stand.  I have heard Deputy Keating state that there were a number of objections from the Judiciary and the professional sector.  He asked me to reveal the contents of discussions which took place in the preparation of this Bill.  My information is that some judges and justices received this suggestion very enthusiastically.  If there have been any feelings to the contrary about what is proposed in the section they have emanated from sections of professional interests.  I accept that some of the professional interests have views to the contrary and I am not surprised that that should be the case.  I am sure it does not surprise Deputy Keating either that certain sections of the professional interests would be opposed to the section.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to civil legal aid. I am very satisfied, as stated by the Minister when introducing the civil legal aid scheme, that the constant reviewing and monitoring of that scheme is ongoing and will cater now and in the future for any situation which develops and requires to be covered by it.  The Deputy said that what is proposed in this section is fundamentally misguided.  The use of those words clearly reflects total rejection by him of the recommendations of the committee which, as I already stated, is comprised of very eminently qualified people and is chaired by a very eminently qualified member of the Judiciary.  Deputy Keating has cast doubt on that committee who have representatives of both branches of the legal profession and of the Judiciary at all levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quoted from the twentieth interim <Col N="2156" /> report this afternoon and I am satisfied that the grounds the Deputy has enumerated for rejection of what is in the section are not justifiable and do not show concern for what the Bill and the section we are debating attempts to do. I know the Deputy is not a callous man but I would describe his remarks as being tantamount to callousness in this respect. It appears that, for political opportunity, the Deputy is prepared to put at risk a very significant number&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I said the Deputy appeared to put at risk many of the opportunities which the Bill and this section will provide.  I also accept that at many court venues the court accommodation is less than satisfactory but, as I indicated before, there is in preparation a set of proposals relating to court accommodation which will be put to the Government in the near future and which should pave the way for the upgrading of accommodation to an acceptable level.  I also accept that many court venues lack facilities, such as separate waiting rooms and consultation areas which are considered desirable for dealing with family law business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend waiting until those provisions are before him before he enacts this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy that whatever requirements, accommodation or financial, or the provision of additional members of the Judiciary, are necessary to deal with aspects of what is proposed in this legislation, will be provided.  I am stating that again now.  I am not satisfied that the volume of family law business will ever be such as to justify the cost of providing those facilities at all court venues. A statistical analysis of the 1,744 family law cases in 1979 in the 257 out of 259 venues outside of the Dublin area, for which figures are available shows that in 116 venues no such case was heard, 34 had one case each, 85 had less than one case on an average per sitting and another <Col N="2157" /> 12 had an average of less than two cases per sitting.  This leaves only ten venues throughout the country with two or more cases per sitting.  One of the solutions to this problem might be to direct all family law cases to one or two venues in each district where the required facilities exist or can be provided without too much difficulty.  This possibility is being looked at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann aware of the continuance of the repression practised by the racist South African regime and of the evil nature of the apartheid system, which extends into the world of sport, deplores the decision of the Irish Rugby Football Union to send an Irish national touring team to the Republic of South Africa; calls upon the IRFU to reverse that decision in the interests of justice and of Ireland's international reputation, and calls upon the Government to take steps to introduce an immediate and effective boycott on all commercial and trading links with South Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that this motion has been on the Order Paper since we resumed after Christmas.  We deliberately did not move it hoping that the IRFU would take heed of it and would respond to the wishes not just of the Oireachtas but of the Irish people.  The motion has been moved as close as possible to 21 March, which is renowned as Sharpeville Day, the 21st anniversity of the massacre of South African workers by the white police in Sharpeville on 21 March 1960.  In the past this House debated resolutions condemning apartheid but the argument that will ensue in relation to the tour and the question of sanctions requires us to put again on the record the definition of apartheid and our condemnation of it.  I will quote from a <Col N="2158" /> document published by <i>Trocaire</i>, the Catholic agency for world development, which describes apartheid.</P>
    <P>The apartheid system of government decrees that the different racial groups should, as far as possible, be kept apart from each other.  In practice this means one set of laws for the whites who rule the country and another set for the Africans and other coloured communities. The laws governing White South Africans have been passed by an all-white parliament and are designed to safeguard and promote white wealth and privilege.  The per capita income of whites in 1975, according to a UN report, was $4,200: that of Africans in the same year was $245.  Laws governing Africans and others have been passed by the same parliament without consulting those affected and designed to ensure that non-Whites will never have an effective voice in the political, economic and social life of the country.</P>
    <P>No country other than South Africa effects such a comprehensive and systematic policy of legal repression and denial of human rights.  Many countries infringe upon human rights to a greater or lesser extent, but no other country discriminates exclusively against individuals only upon their race and colour.  In the start of the last 20 years of the twentieth century no other internal domestic policy constitutes such a moral outrage to the international community and no other country's internal policy constitutes such a unique danger to world peace.</P>
    <P>This argument is not about the enjoyment of games of rugby in a sunny far away country.  It is about giving support in whatever shape or form the people of white South Africa wish to obtain; it is about giving support to a regime which is fundamentally unjust and which by the continued perpetration of that injustice constitutes a major danger to world peace and security.  We have seen how great powers became involved over the question of Afghanistan or El Salvador, countries with very limited strategic importance and with very little mineral or effective wealth.  If the struggle for liberation <Col N="2159" /> in South Africa escalates much further and if the major powers are drawn into it, as they have been drawn into other such struggles for liberation, surely this House will realise that the danger to world peace centred around super power involvement in South Africa would be enormous.</P>
    <P>This is fundamentally a moral issue, because South Africa is unique among all the countries in the UN.  It is also an issue about peace because the failure of the world in general, and particularly the failure of the western world, who have the greater responsibility for what is happening in South Africa, can only put at risk what is now increasingly a tenuous system of world peace.  It may sound harsh to put that sort of responsibility onto the executive of the IRFU and it may appear to the 26 players and officials who will travel with them to play the seven football matches a distortion beyond all bounds of credibility.  The Labour Party had hoped that it would not be necessary to move this motion here and that the decision of the IRFU over the weekend would have made it redundant.  We had hoped that the executive would listen to the considerable representations made by the Government.  In replies to questions from me and other Deputies on 28 January last the House warmly congratulated the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his consistent opposition to this tour and on his representations to the IRFU. We have brought this motion to the floor of the House because of the failure of the Minister to convince the IRFU of the danger of this tour.  We hope at the end of our two day debate, when we have reached an unanimous decision, that the House will urge the Taoiseach to intervene and to make a last perhaps desperate but, we hope, successful appeal to the executive of the IRFU, and to point out the dangers that the tour will have for our international reputation abroad because it will further extend and support the system of apartheid in South Africa. Nobody in this House would disagree with the first section of our resolution in relation to the tour.</P>
    <P>In this country we have three national <Col N="2160" /> football games and the commitment, energy and enthusiasm of support tends to be spread across all three.  That is not the situation in white South Africa.  Support and enthusiasm for rugby verges on a religion among some of the white South Africans.  Whether the IRFU like it or not, it is also the single most important link that we have with the Republic of South Africa.  Our trading links are so miniscule in terms of volume that they are not listed in the United Nations statistics. Later I will return to the breakdown in detail of those links.</P>
    <P>Very few of the nations of the world play rugby with South Africa.  We happen to be one of those nations.  The white racist minority in South Africa values highly the game of rugby and values extremely highly the continued links between this country and South Africa. Whether the IRFU wish it to be so or not, it is an effective lever.  It is not a lever of their creation, but it remains an effective lever.  They can choose to use that lever in support of the continuation of an apartheid regime, or as a non-violent means of dismantling and undermining it and bringing it into line with the other nations of the world in terms of racial equality at least.</P>
    <P>That is the choice facing the IRFU. They have refused to accept that choice. In their long and detailed statement, published in the newspapers after 3 January when they made their decision, they attempted to say that politics had nothing to do with sport and, at the same time, that the South African Rugby Board had made great strides in relation to the integration of blacks and coloureds into the white dominated system and that, therefore, continuing to play rugby with the SARB would further benefit the social emancipation of blacks and coloureds in South Africa.</P>
    <P>They cannot have it both ways.  Either rugby and politics are totally separate or they are not.  If the IRFU wish to argue, as they appear to wish to argue in their statement, that their continued link with the SARB has brought about some liberalisation in the interpretation by that organisation and that government of the system of apartheid, they are accepting <Col N="2161" /> a political role for rugby tours.  That is what they have published.  Having accepted that political role for the rugby tour &mdash; and it is in their own printed statement &mdash; and since they have entered into the realm of politics and social justice, they must listen to the overwhelming condemnation of virtually every conceivable organisation in Ireland who are opposed to the Irish tour in southern Africa.</P>
    <P>With the indulgence of the House I should like to read onto the record the range of organisations who have formally and officially come out against that tour. I am quoting from the &ldquo;Sharpeville Day Commemorative Declaration on the '81 Rugby Tour&rdquo; issued by the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement.  On page 2 they list the organisations and there are over 100 of them.  The range is as follows: The Irish Government and the following political parties: Fianna Fáil, the SDLP, Fine Gael, Labour, the Socialist Labour Party, the IRSP, the People's Democracy, the NILP, the Communist Party of Ireland, Sinn Féin the Worker's Party and Sinn Féin.  It goes on to the churches and lists the board of the Presbyterian Church, the Southern Region of the Methodist Church, the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace, which as we know is the Catholic Church, Trocaire, the Irish Missionary Union, the Dublin Quaker Peace Committee, the Dublin and Munster Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church and the Major Conference of Irish Religious Superiors.</P>
    <P>It goes on to the trade unions and lists the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and virtually every major union in the country, the Union of Students in Ireland and many individual student unions and college societies from universities and colleges all over Ireland.  Then there is the Confederation of Non-Governmental Organisations for Overseas Development made up of 19 development and aid bodies, the Belfast Humanist Group, the Ulster Community Action Group, the Northern Ireland Women's Rights Group, the Northern Ireland Association for Peace and Detente, the Labour Women's National Council, Conradh na Gaeilge.  It then goes on to sports associations. <Col N="2162" /> The Irish Racquetball Association, a number of rugby clubs including St. Mary's, Skerries, Birr, Maynooth and Dublin University, and the Leinster and Connacht schools branches of the IRFU.</P>
    <P>Literally the list goes on and on, some people outraged by the possibility that a team of rugby players bearing the Irish emblem and carrying the name of being an Irish representative side should represent in a most extended way any Irish citizen in a country which perpetrates injustice in a comprehensive fashion which makes it unique among the nations of the world.</P>
    <P>There are others such as the Irish Missionary Union who have detailed knowledge of the extent of the repression and denial of human rights on the ground in the Republic of South Africa or in some of the neighbouring States and have first-hand experience of how important this tour is to the white racist regime and how repressive the regime is which they operate.  There are others such as the Department with their own expertise, knowledge and understanding through their diplomatic contacts of the damage that will be done to this country around the world in countries where they think that a national team cannot be other than officially and formally representative of the wishes and will of the Government.</P>
    <P>If for that reason only, it is important that this House should support this resolution unanimously to enable our diplomats overseas to attempt to undo some of the damage which will be undoubtedly done if the IRFU persist in ignoring the plea of an elected Parliament and all its Members and all the parties represented here.  To conclude this section on the effectiveness of the tour, there is no doubt that it has become a political lever. Whether or not they wish to accept it, on any logical interpretation of their statement there is no doubt that the IRFU recognise the political leverage of rugby tours.</P>
    <P>While a certain shift has been made in southern Africa in relation to the relaxation of the interpretation of the separationist and apartheid laws, in the main they have been cosmetic and they have been rejected by all the organisations <Col N="2163" /> who have a detailed knowledge of southern Africa.  The participation by Irish sporting people in this tour, officials or sportsmen, will have damaging effects upon other sports and will do damage to the international sporting reputation of this country.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that this House should publicly recognise the stand taken by the four players who have refused on moral grounds to participate in this tour.  It is a great honour to be picked to play for one's country irrespective of the sport. By general concensus a rugby tour in South Africa, or in Australia, or in New Zealand, is an exciting, enjoyable and fascinating experience.  In human terms one can understand the attraction for any young player who is offered the opportunity to go on such a tour.  To turn it down on moral grounds is an act of considerable self-denial and this House should publicly recognise that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>So far so good.  We are all against the tour.  The IRFU have spoken consistently to those of us who have opposed their participation in a tour in southern Africa.  We have heard the plaintive cry: &ldquo;We simply want to play rugby.  We are not the only people to have contact with southern Africa.  Why pick on us?  Why not start with trade and commerce, the golfers and the motor car racers and all the others who have contacts with southern Africa?  Why pick exclusively on the Irish rugby tour and the IRFU?&rdquo;  It is a valid argument.  Unless this House addresses itself to it, our right to condemn exclusively the IRFU's tour of southern Africa is seriously undermined and invalidated.  To that extent the Labour Party saw fit to include in this resolution the following final clause:</P>
      <P>and calls upon the Government to take steps to introduce an immediate and effective boycott on all commercial and trading links with South Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That will immediately raise fears in some people's minds, leave us open to certain charges, that we are being too extreme or <Col N="2164" /> too drastic, that it may have repercussions on the people in South Africa itself, that it may hurt the workers, that it may damage us more than it will South Africa. Therefore, is it the most effective way of achieving an objective in which all parties in this House share?</P>
    <P>First of all, let us look at the extent of trade between this State and the Republic of South Africa.  In reply to a parliamentary question posed by myself and Deputy O'Keeffe on 27 January last the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach gave the volume of imports from South Africa and Namibia in 1979 &mdash; the year in respect of which there were the most up-to-date figures available &mdash; which amounted to £12.136 million, while the value of exports from this State to South Africa and Namibia amounted to £8.359 million.  They are not substantial volumes of trade by any international statistics.  As I said earlier, they are not even listed in the United Nations' assessment of the extent of South African trade with other countries.  However, for the people directly involved in this economy, who derive a livelihood from trading with any country &mdash; particularly at a time when there are 130,000 unemployed &mdash; any kind of trade which provides employment must be viewed in a beneficial way. Therefore let us grasp the nettle and say that our motion calls on the Government to take steps to introduce an immediate and effective boycott on all commercial and trading links.  What we want is the Government to assess how quickly we can inflict economic damage, social damage, cultural damage on the white racist regime of South Africa in order to bring it into compliance with United Nations resolutions.</P>
    <P>The effect of the boycott is not to put Irish workers out of work.  The effect of the boycott is not to deny cultural and sporting links to Irish personnel <i>per se.</i> The effect of the boycott should be designed, and we believe can be designed, further to isolate in a variety of ways the white racist South African regime so that hopefully it will begin to comply with all the United Nations' resolutions regarding the abolition of apartheid.  I can hear already the counter <Col N="2165" /> argument to that which no doubt will be: well, since our trade is so insignificant that it is not even listed in United Nations' statistics, since our exports to South Africa can be replaced very readily, surely this will not have much effect; that really what we should be doing is looking for agreed international measures which collectively can bring real pressure on South Africa; and, until such time as we have got the international measures, we can go on gaily continuing to trade with South Africa &mdash; a bit like having one's cake and eating it.</P>
    <P>In November 1962 the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution calling upon all member states to impose separate and collective sanctions against South Africa.  That resolution said that the international community had come to appreciate that apartheid and racism in South Africa cannot be considered a local affair.  However, that resolution and indeed numerous others has not had the desired effect.  From 1959 to 1977 the amount of foreign investment in the white South African economy rose from 3 billion rands, approximately one and a half billion pounds, to a staggering 21 billion rands by 1977.  This is where this country begins to get into the hot seat both in the United Nations Security Council and in the EEC.  The bulk of that investment comes from our EEC partners. Two-thirds of the direct investment comes from EEC countries with nearly 50 per cent coming from the United Kingdom and one quarter from the USA.  I note that those figures do not add up.  I am quoting from a statement issued by the Anti-Apartheid Association.  There are numerous multinational corporations which have direct investments in South Africa and which have increased those investments during the time that successive Governments have passed resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly and which, it would appear, blithely continue to increase their investment in South Africa and to trade very profitably because of the absolute abolition or repression of workers' rights there.</P>
    <P>Until very recently the Irish Government &mdash; and certainly since 1973 when <Col N="2166" /> we joined the EEC &mdash; tended to adopt what can be described only as an attitude which resulted in our being in favour, in principle, of sanctions but finding arguments or reasons why we could not vote for them because of certain clauses or attachments to specific resolutions.  Frequently we found ourselves abstaining on resolutions which in the main we felt compelled to support because of their inclusion of perhaps comment or support for arms struggle, or some other unacceptable aspect.  Therefore we felt obliged to abstain on the entire resolution. I do not think we can adopt that sort of attitude any longer, for two reasons: first of all, the arms struggle it would appear, unfortunately, is becoming an inevitable fact, just as it did in Zimbabwe.  Our abstention on such resolutions will not prevent it and, in all probability will precipitate its escalation.</P>
    <P>Reverting to my earlier point about the pivotal and critical nature of the southern African Continent to world peace, western democracies, in particular a small, neutral State like ours, have a fundamental interest in ensuring that there is a rapid movement towards peace and racial justice in that State.  It is for that reason that we have added the final clause to our resolution, a clause which we think the Government can now support fully. Indeed, in that context, we welcome the vote taken by the Government on 6 March at the United Nations General Assembly in relation to sanctions against the Republic of South Africa over their failure to implement various resolutions, in particular resolutions Nos. 435 and 385 on Namibia, when they voted for Draft Resolution L59 which effectively called for mandatory sanctions to be implemented by the Security Council, mandatory economic sanctions, including an oil embargo against South Africa.</P>
    <P>As the House is probably aware, there is a mandatory arms sanction against South Africa, not that that affects this State.  We welcome the fact that the Irish Government voted in favour of this resolution. Their vote is an indication of the strengthening of the attitude and the resolve of all parties in this House on the matter.  It is significant that two other <Col N="2167" /> countries in the Ten, Greece and Denmark, voted with us and it is significant also that parallel to that, the Dutch, independently and singularly, are attempting to raise the campaign for an international oil embargo on South Africa.  As we know, South Africa has no oil resources of her own.  She is trying frantically to develop an alternative technology based on the conversion into oil of her substantial stocks of coal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>And she is succeeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Ryan has pointed out, South Africa is succeeding in that development and is succeeding very quickly.  Consequently, the time left for the international community to exercise this non-violent lever of sanction against white South Africa is rapidly running out.  The conference I attended in Brussels on 31 December last and the follow-up conference in Amsterdam on 13 March indicated clearly that the time frame we are dealing with would indicate that within three to four years South Africa would have achieved a level of independence from external oil sources that will remove this lever from the western world and from the international community.  Therefore, it is important that the Government are seen to act with a degree of alacrity and decision, positively taking the initiative, to spur on the larger international states, such as Germany and France, within the Community and particularly Britain who have such vested interests, financial and otherwise, in South Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes this State &mdash; I am including this Government as well as the previous one &mdash; have been far too <i>communitaire vis-à-vis</i> the EEC.  The EEC's record in relation to South Africa is not good.  The Community's continued investment in and support of the economic base of South Africa, whether that involves access to uranium from Namibia or simply straightforward trade and commerce with the full State of South Africa, are enormous.  We can no longer attempt to be good Europeans in the classic <i>communantaire</i> sense in the hope that the <Col N="2168" /> French, the British or the Germans will see things our way.  We know that they will not see things our way.  It is time that Ireland exercised her neutrality seriously, positively and constructively in relation to her role as one of the ten Member States of the Community, acting in concert with other small states such as Greece, Denmark and, obviously Holland, in trying to bring pressure to bear, by way of the powers of the EEC, by way of our position on the Security Council, to bring about an effective boycott of trade with South Africa.  This is the one option that is clearly now on the table so far as the western world is concerned, and the western world has a very clear moral responsibility to South Africa.  As the member of the Dutch Labour Party who has led the campaign for the oil embargo has said, all of the people of Holland consider themselves to have a particular moral responsibility for the African population living in Southern Africa.  Because of that the Dutch political parties have attempted to lead a campaign in the Netherlands aimed at bringing about an oil embargo on South Africa, even if the other countries do not do likewise.  There is one major multinational oil company based in Holland who have very substantial links with South Africa.  I refer to Shell.  With the exception of Greece, which is now a Member of the Ten, and if one includes also Denmark, we are the only country in the EEC who do not have a colonist record in Africa.  We have a major potential influence in South Africa, an influence that could be used positively and constructively between the ACP countries on the one hand and the EEC, which is the largest single trading bloc in the world.</P>
    <P>If Ireland has a role to play in the next ten years in what this party believe is the emerging international issue &mdash; and that issue will be the north-south divide between rich and poor on this globe as is so eloquently and clearly documented in the Brandt Report &mdash; our role in that secenario must be based on our history as a colony who won freedom, finally by way of arms struggle after reason, persuasion and pleas for help had ended.  We <Col N="2169" /> know what economic development from a base of a colonial society is about.  We are a country whose people are scattered around the world and we have dealt with the problems of living beside a large power.  We have a large rural tradition and in our own living history we have the capacity to transfer the technology and the resources of trying to create an independent State coming out of colonialism. I use the word &ldquo;colonialism&rdquo; in its fullest sense, not just in terms of economic exploitation but of cultural and psychological exploitation which in many ways is as debilitating as the economic exploitation.</P>
    <P>That unique position that we hold within the EEC gives us the potential for a unique, independent and neutral foreign policy that can be exercised constructively in the last 20 years of this century, but that unique position may be seriously endangered, if not totally undermined, if we do not exercise consciously now the moral choice of totally opposing this tour, of totally opposing the South African regime and of doing everything that can conceivably be done by a small State like ours to bring about that regime's early demise.  It is not sufficient for us to proclaim our support for the abolition of apartheid.  It is not sufficient for us to say that we are in favour of sanctions in principle.  Twenty-one years after the massacre at Sharpeville it is essential that we are seen clearly by the African people in South Africa, in Zimbabwe, in Mosambique, in Botswana and in all the other frontline States, to put ourselves on the line even at some cost to ourselves, even if it results in heavy pressure being brought to bear on us from the US or British Government or from the Germans expressing their disapproval and their disappointment at the independent line we have taken.</P>
    <P>By acting in this way we would be not only fighting against oppression and injustice in South Africa but we would be doing so at the specific request of the African National Congress, because Oliver Campbell came to this country and on meeting the then Foreign Minister, Mr. O'Kennedy, was given a clear assurance of support, a genuine assurance <Col N="2170" /> I believe.  Has this country not been in that position in the past?  Have our people not lived in New York and in Philadelphia?  Are our history books not littered with details of journeys of Irish people to other countries in the search for international support when we were seeking our freedom?  Did not Wolfe Tone go to Paris to plead on behalf of this country?  Or is our memory so short that we cannot return to the barrel of history that which we so willingly took out during many years?  Is this not a clear start for what is a unique moral choice? South Africa is the last racialist apartheid state in the world and if she is dismantled, hopefully by non-violent means, and with the help and leadership of a small state like ours, will we not have contributed to a wonderful conclusion of a chapter of human history &mdash; the abolition of racism on this globe?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I suspect because the Government have tabled an amendment to our resolution, that the last clause causes them some difficulty.  I earnestly request them to consider the real importance that this resolution will have (a) in regard to the tour itself and (b) in regard to our relationship with the rest of the international community and particularly the Third World countries.  I formally and hopefully call for unanimous support from the House for this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment in the name of the Minister for Foreign Affairs:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;international reputation,&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and supports the Government in their efforts, including the pursuit of internationally agreed measures, to influence South Africa to abandon its apartheid policies.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will speak in the debate tomorrow night and develop the case for this amendment.  I have a few words to say myself on it and I should like to begin by emphasising that I think there is a very wide measure of agreement inside and outside the House that the proposed tour should not take place and that even at <Col N="2171" /> this late stage the Irish Rugby Football Union should reconsider their decision and decide to call off the tour.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to the debate because I am one of the patrons of the anti-apartheid movement and I have had a number of people questioning me as to why we adopt this attitude and raising points that I think have been raised here and elsewhere such as: Why rugby?  Why not other sports? Why not trade links, and also, Why South Africa?  Why not other countries?  And so on.  I am quite happy for my own part to spell out some of the reasons underlying my attitude which I think is typical of the attitude of all parties in the House.</P>
    <P>The first basic point is that South Africa is the state which quite clearly operates a racist policy, which deliberately sets out to organise its affairs on the basis of discriminating against some of its people, indeed the majority of its people because of their colour.  While there are references to having policies for the separate development of the homelands, the lands for the black people, we all know that in practice these so-called separate development policies add up to arrangements which condemn the black population to poverty, which deny them access to the bulk of the rich, natural resources South Africa possesses and which therefore concentrate the bulk of the wealth and all the effective political power into the hands of a white minority which have clearly set their face so far against anything that could even remotely be termed fair, impartial, democratic, representative government.  If one is confronted with this type of political system and one is given an opportunity to express one's view on it, of course it has to be anathema to anyone who claims to be a supporter of, or believer in republican principles. Certainly, as a very firm believer in the concept of republican, democratic government based on the expressed wishes of people I have no difficulty in finding myself totally opposed to these racist, apartheid policies.</P>
    <P>If one is opposed then what does one do?  Is it simply a question of recording your disagreement and dissent and doing <Col N="2172" /> no more about it, expressing perhaps very nobly in fine language one's abhorrence but not doing anything difficult or uncomfortable?  This is where one has to consider the choice of means for promoting one's principles and beliefs.  The basic choice is whether to press and work for change through peaceful means or whether to support some sort of violent struggle for liberation.  We know too well from our own history, quite apart from the history of other people, that when reason and peaceful methods fail one may be driven to use violence but in the first instance it is surely the duty of all democratic people to want to avail of every opportunity to bring about change by peaceful means.  That is why I think there should be a full, positive, wholehearted commitment to programmes such as the anti-apartheid programme to try to bring about the end of apartheid, bring about change and adequate recognition of the rights of the majority in South Africa and to achieve these results by peaceful means.  That is why I support all non-violent methods for promoting change.</P>
    <P>The question has already come up here &mdash; the point has certainly been made to me a number of times by rugby supporters: &mdash;&ldquo;Why pick Rugby?  Why not pick on other sports?&rdquo;  My answer is: &ldquo;I will pick on other sports, any other sport in which this apartheid, racist principle is enshrined.&rdquo;  I recall that other sporting events have been frowned upon and discouraged by Government action.  But I would not want to go as far as some people have suggested in withdrawing passports or in other ways restricting the freedom of the individual to decide how he or she will act.  Even though I oppose apartheid and want to see it ended as soon as possible if you believe in a fully democratic-functioning system you must try to give adequate rights to minorities to express dissent.  The distinction I make is that a Government should do everything in its power to ensure that there is no official support, no financial aid, no facilities afforded to anybody participating in these activities, sporting or otherwise. I do not think one should restrict or in fact introduce in effect forms of <Col N="2173" /> repression on the behaviour of the individual, because once that road is embarked on there is always the danger that a democratic government, albeit with the best of intentions initially, will go along the road towards the kinds of repression and restriction of freedom which were the very evils they set out to oppose in the first instance.</P>
    <P>We have to recognise that in a democracy we are not going to have unanimity, but what we should have is people who believe in a cause, who are willing to work for it, and who will try to persuade those who do not share their views initially to come round to recognising the force, correctness or merit of the arguments &mdash; in this case the argument for not remaining neutral, indifferent or passive towards actions such as the proposed rugby tour.  That is one point I wish to emphasise.</P>
    <P>It is worth developing this point even more.  Many younger people are that much further removed from the period when we had only newly received our political freedom and could appreciate its value.  With the passage of time there is a tendency to take these freedoms for granted.  We have to bring home to people that democracy and freedom are very precious gifts which historically are not enjoyed by the majority of people and call for conscious, deliberate, continuous commitment to ensure that they are preserved and protected where they already exist and that they are extended to people who do not yet enjoy the privilege of living in a free democracy.</P>
    <P>When rugby supporters ask me why I am dragging politics into sport I reply that I am not dragging politics into sport because, whether they like it or not, in the modern world sport, cultural and other so-called non-political activities are regularly, widely and freely used to promote, win support for and achieve identification with various political and social policies of different countries.  We saw that approach developed and used very effectively in Europe in the twenties and thirties.  We saw some of the evil consequences that could be associated with it, where young people were lured into accepting political doctrines because they <Col N="2174" /> had been attractively packaged and gift wrapped with apparently non-political sporting and cultural activities which could be noble, uplifting and improving in themselves.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants that kind of debate I will gladly have it another time.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that this topic is one in which we ought to try to keep to the all-party agreement to the maximum extent possible.  I would like to feel he too shares the sentiments I am expressing.</P>
      <P>We cannot allow people to think it is unimportant or not political how they engage in their sporting activities or with whom they associate because, while they may genuinely believe that there is not such association, other people will make those associations for them.  There is no point in imagining that these things are not happening in the modern world.  We have to bring our people to a recognition of and acceptance that all activities, sporting, cultural and so on, can have political and social connotations and we have to eschew any naive hope of being able to remain indifferent or in some sense apart from the consequences of our behaviour in these areas.  Because sport is, has been, and almost certainly will continue to be enmeshed in political activities, we should face up to this and recognise its implications.</P>
      <P>Another point made is that we are selective in that we apply it to South Africa but not to other countries where there can be similar forms of discrimination and equal injustices or violations of human freedoms and human rights.  My answer to that is that I am quite happy to oppose such violations wherever they occur and whatever the political flag under which they sail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us in this House have been consistent in our opposition to the actions of other countries when they infringed on the rights of people.  In so far as they involved sporting activities, many of us recall the debates which centred around non-participation in the Moscow Olympics. <Col N="2175" /> I was opposed to the participation of our athletes in those games for precisely the same reasons I am enunciating now as to why I am opposed to the rugby tour to South Africa.  Other people have been consistent in wanting to engage in sporting links, whether of the Moscow or South African tour varieties.  But there are the inconsistent groups who appear to be somewhat selective in the kind of infringement of political freedoms with which they disagree and then express their disagreement through opposition to sporting, cultural or other peaceful links.</P>
    <P>That to my mind is a perfectly valid reason why anyone who believes in a republican democratic form of government should want to oppose a team which will carry the name of an Irish team taking part in a tour of this nature, which will certainly be represented as implying some sort of friendship, if not outright support, for the policies of apartheid.</P>
    <P>I want to take up the point, which is the substance of the amendment in the Minister's name and offer one or two views of my own on it.  Deputy Quinn, in moving the Labour Party motion, argued that we should be willing to take up the question of trade and other links and to go as far as a complete boycott of activities with South Africa.  Our amendment would not go that far.  Deputy Quinn said that he could almost hear the counter-argument that the amount of trade between South Africa and Ireland was not of such a scale that it would make very much difference.</P>
    <P>I do not want to use that part of the argument but I certainly want to make the case that a more valid way for us to press our case is to try to get some agreed international action against South Africa. Only if we can get a substantial number of South Africa's trading partners to participate in a programme can we envisage any meaningful results and a change in behaviour.  Quite apart from looking for action of a negative kind in the sense of boycotting existing trade, another way in which to achieve results might be to switch the direction of some of the foreign <Col N="2176" /> investment which goes into South Africa.  They should be told that if there is any substance to the claim that they genuinely wish to see separate development in the homelands then it must be ensured that these separate areas have adequate amounts of land and natural resources available to them.  The free world could direct its investment to the black republics rather than the white republic.  We would then see how far the policy of separate but allegedly equal development would proceed.</P>
    <P>There is some scope for Ireland to act as a promoter of that type of action because we do not carry the burden of a colonial record and the accompanying suspicion regarding possible motivation. We are legitimately entitled to express clearly our history as a people who suffered the same forms of oppression and exclusion from access to our own natural resources.  Clearly we have an affinity and can very readily understand the nature of the obstacles which the black people of South Africa must overcome if they are to achieve an adequate level of development.</P>
    <P>I would not be happy to see Ireland attempt a unilateral embargo on trade with South Africa.  The consequences of such action would be very unevenly distributed. While we can achieve fairly readily measures of agreement and expressions of general principle, it is very difficult to carry people in the detailed support of any programme when it comes to the practical consequences of paying the cost.  If we were to cut off exports worth £8 million or more we would not easily find alternative markets for those exports.  We do not have a shortage of goods for export; on the contrary, our problem is in finding sufficient markets abroad.  We must accept that a consequence of cutting those exports to South Africa would be to cut off at least some jobs and to inflict unemployment and hardship on a selected minority of our people.  I would be unhappy at that prospect in the short-term.  There is a way in which at some later date we could overcome that problem.</P>
    <P>We should look at the framework laid out when the national understanding was <Col N="2177" /> being promoted two years ago.  Although it got off to a rather slow and difficult start I believe the ideas and the basis on which the national understanding was formulated have a continued relevance to coping with any of these awkward questions of sharing out either the beneficial consequences of growth and development or the painful consequences of costs and hardship.  That framework provides for arriving at agreement with the parties involved, trade unions, employers and Government.  I should like at an early date to see farmers added on, as well as any other relevant group.  The mechanism exists to cater for agreed programmes in terms of employment or income and the consequential changes in taxation or whatever.  It has been recognised that results could not be achieved overnight but only when we had a more effectively functioning framework of that nature.  In our present situation we could not reasonably say that we would impose an embargo or boycott and allow the consequences to fall on a minority of our people without distributing the burden of cost on the entire population.  If we are to think in terms of using the boycott weapon as an instrument of non-violent diplomacy in the future, we must be able to develop some programme for giving more effective expression to the wishes of the Irish people, expressed democratically when a particular cause arises.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I feel that we could not agree with the motion as formulated by the Labour Party, even though I would not dissent from the spirit which underlies it.  One has to strike a balance that is fair to Irish people, as well as seeking to have a programme of action giving adequate international expression to the views and values which have been put forward by all parties in this House.  I hope such views will continue to be expressed and will achieve their culmination in the recognition by the rugby community of the fact that their proposed tour is not simply an innocent sporting activity but is, whether they like it or not, caught up in an expression of political and social policy of a kind which is reprehensible to the Irish people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject of this debate is a difficult one because, on the one hand, it is quite understandable that young people would wish to be involved in sport at an important international level and we as a people believe in the free movement of the people of the world without hindrance from governments for political reasons.  Indeed we like to encourage our people to participate in sport domestically and at international level because by engaging in sport at that level it encourages them to strive for the highest attainments.</P>
      <P>I ask those who contemplate going to South Africa to be concerned about the interests of sportsmen, to be concerned about fellow Irishmen and women who want to take part in sport at an international level and to appreciate that by their insisting on going to South Africa they are probably impairing the prospects of other Irishmen and women from engaging in other sports at international level. Therefore, I appeal to them to reflect, even at this late stage, on the consequences to Irish boys and girls who, because of the insistence of the IRFU in getting involved in this rugby tour in South Africa, may find themselves excluded from international contests as a result of the behaviour of the IRFU.</P>
      <P>As we discuss the problem of apartheid, I suggest that possibly on the part of some of the people who are condemning this proposed tour &mdash; I exclude Deputy Quinn and his Labour Party colleagues &mdash; there is a certain amount of hypocrisy. Last year when efforts were made to discourage people from participation in the Olympic Games in Moscow because the USSR has a long history of denial of human rigths, many people who are now condemning the proposed tour to South Africa remained silent on that occasion. This shilly-shallying by some people on the matter of human rights and sports boycotts does not help when we come to consider whether teams from this and other countries should participate in sports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never taken part in a debate in this House, in the European Parliament or elsewhere without calling on all people involved to consider the fundamental <Col N="2179" /> principle that human rights know no political boundary, that human rights are so fundamental it is a matter of indifference whether they are being denied by a right-wing or a left-wing administration. It is somewhat sickening and hypocritical that so often condemnation comes from only one side of the political divide.  It is that vacillation, that blinkered view on the part of politicians which leads people outside the immediate political arena to question the sincerity of politicians, which leads them to say politicians have a divided view on matters of human rights and that they are only playing the human rights tune when they think it may serve their own political objectives.  The question of the dignity of man, of recognising that people of every colour and race are equal, is superior to any question of political ideology.  That should be our fundamental approach not merely in relation to the matter of apartheid but in regard to other political systems.  That should be our approach when we consider whether Irish people should engage in sport.</P>
    <P>Sport is a voluntary activity in this country and in the western world and I hope it will remain that way.  There is a significant difference between a voluntary activity such as sport and matters of trade and commerce.  Trade and commerce are not only concerned with the profit to be derived from such activities. They are also concerned with jobs.  I mention that because I will be dealing with the last part of the motion of the Labour Party with which Fine Gael will not be associated.  As we see it, there is not much point in little Ireland, with a tiny fraction of South African trade, endeavouring to enforce a boycott against South Africa or even attempting to propose such a boycott.  We could not ensure that such a boycott or ban would be respected.  To allow the racist South African administration to boast that they had defeated an Irish boycott would be the wrong thing to do in our view.  However, if there is an international agreement that can be effectively enforced in regard to trade, commerce and investment <Col N="2180" /> activities in South Africa, Ireland should be associated with such a movement. We will not be disposed to support a protest which we regard at best as futile and possibly counter-productive, because it could not succeed.</P>
    <P>If there is a will on the part of our people to discourage trade with South Africa &mdash; and I hope there is &mdash; it is easy enough for our people to enforce it. Nearly half of our imports from South Africa and Namibia consist of fruit, mainly oranges and grapefruit.  If people are not disposed to support apartheid, all they need do is to go to some other shop or to another part of the counter and buy goods that come from other countries. Our imports from South Africa and Namibia, nearly half of which consists of fruit, are worth about £12 million and we export to South Africa goods valued at approximately £11,500,000.  One-quarter of our exports are chemicals, about one-tenth are pharmaceutical and medicinal goods, about one-tenth comprise machinery and equipment and the remainder covers a broad range of goods. Our exports to that country give useful employment here.  If we do not export to South Africa our share of the market will be very quickly made up by other countries including many African countries. While I understand and sympathise entirely with the objectives of the proposed boycott, there is little point in our initiating it unless more powerful economic forces in the world row in behind us in this idea.  I am not saying it is wrong to put forward the proposal but it should be proposed in a forum that has much more political clout than we have in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Apartheid is an abominable system of government which treats people as inferior merely because the colour of their skin is different from that of those who have occupied political power for many decades.  It is so repugnant to the dignity of man that one cannot countenance giving any support or recognition to such a system of government.</P>
    <P>It has been argued by the IRFU that their participation in the proposed rugby tour does not constitute a recognition of or respect or support for the system of <Col N="2181" /> apartheid.  That is a very naive view.  Most nations in the world quite rightly have resolved not to participate in voluntary activities with South Africa because if they were to do so they would be supporting a system of segregation of people on the basis of the colour of their skin, they would be supporting a system which euphemistically is based on separate development of peoples but which conceals the fact that that separate development leads to unequal development.</P>
    <P>The reality of the South African system of government is that it penetrates sports, education, religion, innumerable human activities which are beyond our comprehension. That system penetrates all these human activities so as to ensure the segregation of people on the basis of race, and in electing to go to South Africa the IRFU are supporting a system which regards it as appropriate that people should have separate but unequal development.</P>
    <P>Many of those who are to participate in the proposed tour have been educated in Ireland by religious orders whose primary objective has been to engage in missionary activities in Africa, and I find it incomprehensible that students of religious orders in Ireland who have devoted so much of their time to missionary work in Africa should now propose to participate in this rugby tour.</P>
    <P>I have had the privilege and the opportunity on behalf of Ireland to participate in a number of international conferences in which the African influence was strong.  I am aware, as indeed is any Irishman or woman who has participated in these conferences, that the Irish contribution to the development of the peoples of Africa is one which is greatly respected by our African brothers and sisters. Those people find it very difficult to accept that a country which produced thousands of missionaries &mdash; there are about six and a half thousand of them today &mdash; who have given up their lives to the education, the health care and the development of impoverished peoples throughout the world, should now be so insensitive to the problem of racial discrimination in Africa that they would send an Irish sports team to compete <Col N="2182" /> against racist teams in South Africa.  In the last three weeks I was in Sierra Leone at a meeting of the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries with European Parliament representatives.  There I was challenged, as was Mr. Seán Flanagan of Fianna Fáil, by representatives of African countries to justify the proposed IRFU tour of South Africa.  Needless to say I did not attempt to do so because it could not be justified.</P>
    <P>I accept that the decision makers in the IRFU, when they made their decision to participate in the South African tour, might not have been aware of the consequences of their decision.  The decision is not purely a sports decision as has been suggested; if it were it would be a simple matter and we in the House would not be discussing it.  It is essentially a political decision and the reason we are considering it tonight is that we of all parties are aware that it is a political decision of very considerable consequences.</P>
    <P>The first and primary consideration must be the insult which the IRFU tour offers to our African brothers and sisters. The second consideration, and a valid one, is the consequences to Ireland's standing in the world.  It is not simply in the diplomatic world, though that is important because our standing in that world is extremely high partly because we are a non-colonial State with nothing to live down, but to a large extent it is due to the fact that Ireland's influence on Africa and the entire Third World in the past has been a benign one, a helpful one, and the reason why the Irish are so acceptable throughout the world is that we do not have any feeling of superiority: we were reared in the cradle to regard ourselves as the equals of others, but never their superiors.</P>
    <P>The apartheid system of government is one which asserts the superiority of one group of people because of the colour of their skin, and for us to send &mdash; I must amend that because I am satisfied that the overwhelming majority of the Irish people are not sending the IRFU team on tour &mdash; for a group of people to go from Ireland to play in South Africa leads to a situation in which all Africans will <Col N="2183" /> interpret that as an indication that the people of Ireland are not committed, as our missionaries have been and as all Irish people have been in the past, to the equality of man, without discrimination of colour, class or creed.</P>
    <P>The system of apartheid denies basic human rights.  It is often said by proponents of apartheid that they are not doing anything more than protecting the investment which the white man made in Africa.  They will argue that such investment was made and that any development which occurred since they arrived in Africa was almost exclusively by virtue of their efforts.  They will claim, understandably, that the white man in southern Africa is as African as the coloured man. <Col N="2184" /> But look at their posters, their notices, which segregate people in public parks and on the trains, in the restaurants and in the schools.  They say: &ldquo;Reserved for Europeans&rdquo; and &ldquo;Reserved for natives&rdquo;. Even in their own jargon in their public notices, they defeat their own arguments when they say they are as much African as the others, because they tend to emphasise that the whole regime, the whole system of government, is one of segregation of people because of the colour of their skin.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the form in which the accounts are presented as distinct from changes in accounting policy.  I have been informed by Bord na Móna that up to 1976 there were no changes in the form of their published accounts.  In 1976 the form was changed to bring it into line with modern accounting practices.  This entailed the deletion of the administration account and revision of the revenue and profit and loss accounts to show profit and loss on an overall basis rather than broken down by product.  The administration account referred to expenses incurred by the board at their head office and their central stores in Newbridge.  These expenses are now included in various items in the accounts relating to the board's expenses. If the Deputy has any other aspect of the accounts in mind and lets me know, I will make further inquiries.</P>

    <P>(b)  The making of a compulsory order is the final stage of the acquisition process. Therefore, any lands which are under compulsory purchase order are deemed to have been acquired by the board.  The Deputy may, however, be referring to land for which the board have indicated that they are considering the making of an acquisition order but which has not yet been acquired.  The approximate total area of such lands is 9,820 acres.  It is not possible in the time available to give a figure for these lands for the 13 locations referred to in the question.  If the Deputy wishes to put a question on this in two weeks time I will be happy to make further inquiries.</P>
    <P>(c)  A total of 300 acres of biomass have been planted by Bord na Móna to date, about half at Clonsast and the remainder at Oweninny.  Their five year biomass programme, which commenced in April 1979 entails the planting in each of the five years of 200 acres of the board's cutaway with hardwood species for harvesting on a four year rotation.</P>
    <P>In addition to this the Department of Fisheries and Forestry have planted a total of 150 acres of virgin blanket bog at Bellacorrick with single stem conifers. That Department's five year biomass programme, which also commenced in 1979, involves the planting of 100 acres a year with single stem conifers for harvesting on a seven year basis.</P>
    <P>(d)  The ESB are conducting tests at present aimed at finding the most suitable type of biomass incinerator for the board's purposes.  Bord na Móna have awarded a contract to Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teo. for the design and construction of a biomass harvester.  The first prototype is expected to be ready for testing later this year.  These two projects <Col N="2059" /> are basically at the research and development stage and the existing manpower resources of the ESB and CSET are employed in this work.</P>

      <P>I assume that the question refers to insurance to cover damages for professional negligence.  I have not received any evidence that there is a case for a law that will make it obligatory on members of the legal profession in particular to take out such insurance.</P>
      <P>The law already contains special provisions to protect solicitors' clients from losses arising from dishonesty and the introduction of an additional legal provision relating to negligence would raise questions as to why it should apply only to members of the legal profession and not to members of other professions or occupations whose work if negligent could adversely affect others, as to the limits, if any, on such insurance, as to how the provision would be enforced and as to the effects on legal fees.</P>
      <P>The question of the liability of barristers and solicitors for professional negligence was considered in the Fourteenth Interim Report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure which was published in 1971.  While the committee only touched incidentally on the question of insurance, it may be mentioned that they made no recommendation for any legislative changes in the area.</P>

      <P>At one time all confidential waste paper was collected from Government Departments and offices by the Stationery Office and taken to a paper mill for pulping.  After the closure of that paper mill the Stationery Office were unable to make suitable arrangements with any other local firm for the pulping of the waste.  In 1979, detailed instructions were issued by the Department of the Public Service to all Departments and offices about the custody of official documents and the need to ensure that there was no unauthorised disclosure of information. The instructions stressed that Departments and offices should consider the additional steps which might be required to meet their particular circumstances. All the more confidential material is disposed of by Departments and offices under their own arrangements.  The Stationery Office have disposed of the less confidential waste by shredding, burning and deep burial but due to the quantity and nature of the material these methods have presented problems and there has been a build-up of such material.</P>
      <P>A trial arrangement was made in January 1981 by the Stationery Office with a private firm whereby they would arrange to have certain waste paper disposed of by pulping.  Despite assurances of utmost security, it appears that this trial arrangement was not satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The trial arrangement with the private firm has been terminated and all documents remaining in their premises have been recovered.  I am taking steps to ensure that, in future, confidential material will be disposed of in such a way as to eliminate the possibility of improper disclosure.</P>

      <P>A pension order book at maximum rate, payable from 11 April 1980, was issued in March 1980 to the designated post office for collection by her.</P>
      <P>It has been confirmed that the pension order book was collected at the designated post office by her.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was refused a deserted wife's allowance on the ground that she could not be regarded as a deserted wife under the regulations governing this scheme.  The deciding officer held that she had not, as required by the regulations, made reasonable efforts within the means available to her to prevail on her husband to contribute to her support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2069" /> If documentary evidence is produced to prove that she has taken reasonable steps to locate her husband and to obtain support from him, it will be open to her to re-apply for the allowance.</P>
    <P>The question of registration with the National Manpower Service is a matter for the Minister for Labour.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has no entitlement to disability benefit as according to the records of my Department he has no contributions paid or credited in the contribution years governing his claim.  He has, in fact, no contributions paid or credited since 1976.</P>
      <P>He has been asked to state whether he was insurably employed at any time since 1977 and, if so, to forward details of periods employed and the names and addresses of his employers.  Arrangements will then be made to have the non-payment of contributions in respect of any such employments investigated.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 2 February 1981 and was paid from 5 February, fourth day of incapacity at the maximum appropriate rate.  All disability benefit, and pay-related benefit, due, less the amount of supplementary welfare allowance advanced by the health board, has been paid to 21 March 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delay in payment was due mainly to the fact that he quoted his insurance number instead of his RSI number on some of the certificates submitted by him. In addition notification was received from the health board that he had been <Col N="2070" /> paid supplementary welfare allowance during the period of his claim.  When details of the amount advanced were received payment of disability benefit was made.</P>

      <P>As, according to the records of my Department, he had not the necessary minimum of 26 paid contributions since date of entry into insurance, he was asked, on the 7 October 1980 and 3 November 1980, to submit a statement from his employer giving details of his insurable employment prior to the commencement of his illness.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending inquiries as to the nature and origin of the incapacity he was paid disability <Col N="2072" /> benefit on an interim basis for the full duration of both claims.</P>
    <P>On completion of the inquiries it was accepted that the incapacity was in fact due to his employment.  Payment of injury benefit was allowed from 18 March 1980 to 12 April 1980 and from 28 August 1980 to 15 September 1980.</P>
    <P>Under the Social Welfare Acts payment of injury benefit is limited to a maximum period of six months from the date of commencement of the incapacity. Injury benefit accordingly was only payable up to 15 September 1980 and an adjusting payment covering the periods up to that date has been issued.</P>
    <P>The delay in deciding the claim was due to the need to make inquiries which were necessarily prolonged in this case.</P>

Payment has been made for the period of incapacity from 16 February 1981 to 28 February 1981, after which date he was certified fit to resume employment, less the amount refunded to the Mid-Western Health Board in respect of supplementary welfare allowance paid in the period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that all reasonable precautions are taken by the Forest and Wildlife Service of my Department to prevent and control forest fires. Fire breaks&mdash;external and internal&mdash;are a standard feature of forest development.</P>
      <P>Additional facilities include stocks of fire beaters, heather burners, smoke masks and portable water pumps.  The Service is increasingly providing water supplies from natural and specially constructed artificial sources.  In addition trained forestry staff are available and the service has liaison arrangements with local fire fighting units as well as the Defence Forces and Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The situation in relation to forest fire control is kept under regular review.  It is important, however, to bear in mind that the cost of providing forest fire fighting facilities must be weighed against the element of risk involved.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry the steps that he has taken to promote the development of mariculture on the West Coast; and the proposals he has to increase its further development in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Power) Patrick Power">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>The potential for the development of mariculture particularly along the western coastline is a matter which has been and is the subject of considerable attention by my Department in conjunction with other State bodies, notably An Bord lascaigh Mhara and the National Board for Science and Technology. Scientists and marine biologists from the Fisheries Research Centre of my Department, from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the National Board for Science and Technology have carried out numerous surveys and tests in many areas of the west coast and a considerable amount of data and advice is available on all aspects of mariculture to persons or bodies interested in starting or developing fish farming projects.  The National Board for Science and Technology in consultation with the Department will shortly be presenting the first draft of a national Mariculture Development Programme. Other State bodies involved in Mariculture Research are the Electricity Supply Board, the Salmon Research Trust and University College, Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the availability of advice on all aspects of mariculture development&mdash;scientific, technical, marketing, planning etc. &mdash; financial assistance is also available in certain approved cases. An Bord Iascaigh Mhara provides grants for approved pilot projects and commercial scale projects.  Also, in the case of the latter a scheme of grants of up to 50 per cent of the capital costs of approved projects has been in operation under the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (FEOGA).  I am confident that the scheme will be continued for 1981 or alternatively that a more permanent scheme including provision for financing aquaculture projects will be adopted in the context of agreement on <Col N="2085" /> an overall Common Fisheries Policy.  In areas within its jurisdiction Udaras na Gaeltachta also operates a grant scheme and advisory service in support of suitable projects.</P>
    <P>I expect to be in a position in the near future to bring into effect section 54 of the Fisheries Act, 1980.  This section is designed to make it mandatory for anyone engaging in mariculture to be properly licensed.  It also provides that all future mariculture licences will be granted on the basis of the areas in question having first been designated as suitable for the type of fish-farming specified in the licence.  This system should greatly improve the orderly development of mariculture in all areas.  It will also help to identify the full potential of hitherto under-developed areas of the west coast and thus provide a much needed new <Col N="2086" /> source of employment and income in remote coastal areas.</P>
    <P>I should of course point out that the initiative with regard to mariculture projects lies in the first instance with private individuals and bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware that employees engaged in sea fishing, including share fishermen, are denied the benefits of paid holidays under section 2 (1) (c) of the Holidays Act, 1973, that some do not appear to be entitled to redundancy benefits because of section (4) (1) of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967 and that they do not appear to be protected at work by the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936 or by section 3 of the Factories Act, 1955, unless fish taken <Col N="2094" /> from the sea are processed or adapted for sale at sea; and if it is proposed to introduce legislation to remove these anomalies.</P>

      <P>Section 2(1)(c) of the Holidays (Employees) Act 1973 excludes seafarers from the scope of the Act because these workers have regular long spells on and off duty and compliance in their case would be impracticable.</P>
      <P>Section 2(1)(e) excludes fishermen from the scope of the Act for the reason that these workers are mainly paid on a share basis and their employment is usually intermittent and seasonal.</P>
      <P>The position under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 1979 is that the Acts apply to employees in employment which is insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy has addressed a question directly to the Minister for Social Welfare regarding the insurability of fishermen.</P>
      <P>Fishing is excluded from the Conditions of Employment Acts 1936 and 1944. The Acts cover industrial employment.</P>
      <P>Proposals to amend the respective sections of the Holiday and Conditions of Employment Acts in the immediate future are not being considered.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have established a Commission on Safety and Health at Work.  One of the tasks of that commission will be to examine the position of workers who are not afforded protection under existing legislation relating to safety and health.  I would expect that the position of employees engaged in sea fishing would form part of that examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the approximate number of man-days lost in the turf production industry as a result of (a) official stoppages in the following instances: (i) stoppages due to disputes affecting promotion to higher paid positions in the non-craft sector; (ii) other stoppages in the non-craft area; and (iii) stoppages in the <Col N="2095" /> craft sector having regard to clause 12 of the National Understanding.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office is the official source of statistics in relation to industrial disputes but figures are not yet available from that office in regard to industrial disputes occurring since the coming into operation of the 1980 National Understanding. The Department of Labour understands, however, that there have been two strikes in Bord na Móna in the period in question.  Both strikes involved non-craft workers and arose from the same dispute in relation to promotion to the post of supervisor.  The first strike was unofficial and resulted in the loss of approximately 150 days.  The second strike which is official is still continuing and has resulted to date in the loss of approximately 500 days.</P>
