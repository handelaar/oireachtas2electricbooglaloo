      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport the measures he proposes to take to deal with the CIE deficit for 1981.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Measures for dealing with the CIE deficit for 1981 are currently under consideration but I am not yet in a position to say what these measures may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the understandable absence of the Minister last week the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry was unable to give precise replies to any of the questions put to him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate when he proposes to have the debate in this House on the Mckinsey Report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if the proposal to close the Limerick to Rosslare Harbour train service is one of <Col N="574" /> those items under consideration in relation to the CIE deficit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>No.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alderman Dublin Bay-Rockall Loftus</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider asking the management of CIE to undertake an assessment of what I would refer to as their derelicit sites throughout the country &mdash; their underutilised and uneconomical railway stations &mdash; by way of helping them in their deficit problems?  I have been asking for the past 12 years that such an assessment be undertaken.  The company could go into partnership with the planning authorities in the area of the comprehensive development of these railway stations.  This is what happens in other places &mdash; in America, on the Continent and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>By coincidence, a schedule of properties is being prepared by CIE for my consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding my question, are there proposals either before the board of CIE or in the Minister's office in relation to the closure of the Limerick to Rosslare Harbour railway service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals in my Department to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any such proposal before the board of CIE?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not informed me that there is any such proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept from me that there are?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has the information, why is he asking the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the question because of the contradictory reply I got last week from the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.  He told me that there are no such proposals but my information is that there are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the estimated deficit for CIE for the current year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the expected outturn will be in the region of £94 million.  I might add for the information of the House that this expected outturn was known to the Government of which the Deputy was a junior Minister when the figure of £65 million was provided in the Estimate for the £94 milion outturn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It might also be of great significance to the general public.  How and when does the Minister propose dealing with this expected outturn especially since it is part of the Government programme to take immediate action to deal with this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, the position was compounded for me by the failure of the previous Government to budget properly for this situation.  It was compounded further by their failure to provide for proper fare increases at the time they were predicted.  In that connection I might mention that when answering questions in May last, the Deputy, as he was entitled to do, concealed from the House the amount that those fares increases would have produced.  If the proper measures had been taken then I might not now have a problem of this magnitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that during the period in which he has been in office he has not taken any action to cut this budget deficit?</P>

    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport the current position in relation to the Dublin-Derry air link; and his proposals to extend internal air services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin-Derry air service continues to be operated twice daily in each direction, Mondays to Fridays inclusive, by an Irish company with the assistance of a subvention from my Department.</P>
      <P>With regard to internal air services, an inter-departmental committee was set up earlier this year to review arrangements for establishing, equipping and financing regional or local airports and air services and to make recommendations for future policy.  Pending the findings of this committee I am prepared to examine on their merits any applications for authorisations to provide internal air services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate whether a clawback position has been reached in the contract with the Irish operator of this service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that information but if the Deputy puts down a separate question I shall let him have a reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that he is taking a positive stand so far as the development of internal air services is concerned but is he in a position to say when he proposes issuing the necessary licences to those who wish to become involved in this service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Deputy was not listening to my reply.  I said:</P>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear to me from the reply what is the exact position about the Derry-Dublin air service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is not clear to me either.  On what precise aspect of that service does he require information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the service to be continued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is a scheduled service and there are no plans to discontinue it.  The passenger complement has exceeded target and the service is very satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister admit that this service is the result of a successful and beneficial initiative taken by the previous Government and that it flatly contradicts the statement by his colleague, the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism that our Government took no positive steps to promote good relations between the two parts of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that the decision in this instance was a good decision, unlike many of the other decisions that we could talk of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that this matter would be reviewed?  Can the Minister indicate whether a State subsidy will be required in the coming year for the service?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that.  I understand <Col N="578" /> that an element of subsidy will be required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Judging by the question it was almost inevitably set up during the Deputy's term in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I thought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ascertain the date and give it to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pretty well aware of it.  I thought the Minister had renewed it again.  Would the Minister confirm to the House that a licence has already been given to a private air company to operate a service from Waterford to Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>A licence will be issued for a Waterford&mdash;Dublin service when Waterford airport is fully licensed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport when he intends to introduce legislation to transfer responsibility for the canal system to the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Consultation is still continuing between my Department, the Office of Public Works and CIE in regard to details of the legislation which will be required to effect the transfer.  While certain progress has been made, many of the matters involved are of a complex nature and a timescale for the finalisation of the legislation cannot yet be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to one particular aspect of this matter might I ask the Minister to keep in mind that it was our intention in Government to transfer responsibility for the canals to the new proposed heritage council.  In consideration of that matter will the Minister keep that longer-term aspect in mind?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us any idea when action will be taken in this matter because I am sure he will agree that there has been a dragging of feet for a long time and that it transpires what is everybody's business is nobody's business in this case?  Would he not further agree that the word &ldquo;grand&rdquo; for the canal is very much a misnomer at the present stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with the Deputy's description of the canal, that it has not been grand, because I consider the Grand Canal to be a very attractive waterway.  This has been going on for some time and I cannot give a definite time scale for it.  As the Deputy will know there are a lot of complications behind this seemingly simple proposal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, the delineation of the property to be transferred, definition of the boundaries between the canal and railway property, clarification of the position in relation to water and other rights and determination of the arrangements in relation to the transfer of staff.  The preliminary draft heads of a Bill have been submitted and are under consideration but the Deputy will know from his experience in the Department of Transport that that seemingly short list contains within it a lot of administrative implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>State grants for improvement works at publicly-owned commercial harbours can be provided from the Vote for my Department and there is no need for any new legislation in the matter.</P>
      <P>I should point out, however, that State grants for harbours are provided only in special circumstances, such as where the establishment or expansion of a particular major industry or new trade requires improved harbour facilities and the cost of providing those facilities cannot be met by the harbour authority.  Each application from a harbour authority for a grant is considered on its merits and it is usually a condition of any such grant that the harbour authority make a contribution to the cost.</P>
      <P>State assistance towards harbour development may also be provided by way of loans from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was under the impression that a harbour had to be registered under the 1946 Act to qualify for grants.  Is the <Col N="581" /> Minister saying that in actual fact it does not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I am saying that grants may be given to harbours governed by that Act and may also be given to other publicly owned commercial harbours but State grants are not given to private harbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there any grants available for harbours which are not private harbours but which are not included in the 1946 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there are grants available for harbours that are publicly owned commercial harbours but which may be outside the 1946 Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>Aer Rianta are actively pursuing the possibility of attracting Federal Express to use Shannon Airport as a base for their European operations.  A number of other airports are also in contention and I understand that Federal Express are unlikely to take a decision until early in 1982.  I can assure the Deputies that every effort is being made to attract Federal Express to Shannon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The operation of scheduled air services to and from Ireland is governed by Inter-Governmental Bilateral Air Services Agreements.  Subject to the terms of the relevant agreement, I am prepared to consider any proposals for additional scheduled services between Shannon and points in Continental Europe.</P>
      <P>Designation of an additional carrier to provide scheduled Shannon-London services would fall to be processed within the terms of the UK-Ireland Bilateral Air Services Agreement.  As is the case for the Dublin-London route, the agreement provides that the Shannon-London route may be operated by one carrier from each country.  At present Aer Lingus and British Airways provide scheduled services on the route.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the ability or lack of ability of the existing carriers.  With regard to Dan Air, as I said in reply to the question, the position is covered by the UK-Ireland Bilateral Air Services Agreement.  I understand that this agreement provides that this <Col N="583" /> route may be operated by only one carrier from each country.  As there already is a carrier from each country on the route my advice is that a second carrier from the other side or from our side would be precluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport the reason Aer Lingus were not allowed to complete the sale of a Boeing 707 to Libya in view of the heavy cost incurred in preparing this aricraft for this particular sale; and the action he proposes to take to complete the sale or recoup the loss incurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year, Aer Lingus made arrangements for the sale of a Boeing 707.  The aircraft was to be delivered in the colours of United African Airlines, Libya.</P>
      <P>Before the sale was completed, the US authorities brought to Aer Lingus' attention a US Department of Commerce Regulation made in 1978 which stipulates that the prior approval of that Department must be obtained to the re-export of particular categories of equipment to certain desiganted countries, including Libya.  In addition, the US Department of Commerce made a specific order on 1 September 1981 prohibiting any person from exporting or re-exporting items which originated in the US to the named purchaser with whom Aer Lingus were dealing or to United African Airlines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having reviewed the position in the <Col N="585" /> light of these developments and after consultation with my Department and the other Departments concerned, Aer Lingus decided in all the circumstances not to proceed with the sale and refunded the deposit paid by the purchaser.</P>
    <P>The company are, of course, actively pursuing other means of disposing of the aircraft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state if his Department agreed to the sale of this plane to Libya in the first instance and at a later stage withdrew permission to export the plane to Libya?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Offhand I cannot say if my Department would have to be consulted with regard to the sale.  However, without checking on the matter, I can only say that I would imagine it would be a commercial decision for Aer Lingus to sell surplus aircraft without getting approval from the Department.  We were probably informed.  It was not a question of withdrawing consent.  It was that Aer Lingus were informed by the US authorities of their prohibition and decided to observe it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the sale is not going through at this time.  Is the Minister taking any action to recover the $1.2 million spent on preparing the aircraft for sale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure the Deputy has given of what was spent on the aircraft is substantially incorrect.  I do not know from whom Aer Lingus could recover the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that the intervention of the US authorities resulted in what was tantamount to a breach of contract between Aer Lingus and Libya in relation to the sale of this aircraft and that somebody should be responsible for recouping Aer Lingus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the view of the Deputy.  He can be assured that the strongest representations were made with regard to this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a Boeing 707 was sold recently to replace the Aer Lingus plane by the Belgian authorities who ignored the information the Minister is putting forward here in relation to the US authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Belgian authorities.  Without knowing the full facts I do not know why they decided to do that, whether they were given an exemption or whether the aircraft had equipment in it that was not caught by the regulation.  So far as Aer Lingus were concerned, having considered the matter fully they decided not to proceed with the sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has serious implications for our trade with Libya. The Libyan people view us as a neutral country.  We refused to complete the sale to the Libyan authorities but the Belgian authorities have now completed a sale for a Boeing 707.  The same conditions should have applied in that case also but obviously the Belgian Government took a totally different view.  Libya is our eighth best customer and I ask the Minister to review the situation.  There are many other ways of getting round the regulation with regard to the sale of the aircraft if the Minister is interested.  I would remind the Minister that there is a 707 on lease in Libya since last April and it will be there until next October.  I believe the lease could be renewed.  In view of the action taken in this matter, our exports to Libya and our future trade with that country could be in jeopardy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said already, both Aer Lingus and I regret that the embargo was imposed on this sale.  However, having considered all the implications &mdash; and obviously there are many implications in a matter such as this &mdash; it <Col N="587" /> was decided not to proceed with the sale. I am aware that the lease to which the Deputy referred is still extant.  The embargo was not applied by the American authorities when that lease was entered into and consequently, it is a different transaction.  Further, I am aware that the Libyan authorities are appreciative of the position in which Aer Lingus found themselves and I do not think our trading relations with that country will be prejudiced.  I would add that Aer Rianta have been successful in securing a contract to train Libyan citizens over a two-year period as aircraft mechanics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the Aer Rianta contract.  It was entered into subsequent to the action in relation to the sale of the 707 plane.  Will the Minister not accept that the Irish Government have been weak-kneed in relation to this matter?  They should have taken a stand and completed the sale.  We see now what Belgium has done.  Is the Minister aware that in the past four weeks the British authorities have entered into a contract to train many people and are making aircraft available also?  We are being left out in the cold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the Deputy that there has been any weakness with regard to this matter.  The Deputy is obviously unaware of the fact that the vast majority of the Aer Lingus fleet is supplied by the Boeing Company under regulations prescribed by the American Government.  He is also overlooking the fact that Aer Lingus recently set up a very big plant called Airmotive in the old Potez factory on the Naas Road.  Much of its work is concerned with the refurbishing of Boeing jet engines and obviously they will have to depend on the Boeing suppliers for parts for that factory. There are implications here of which the Deputy is well aware.  It does not do to try to make political points&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Bus lanes will also be implemented at city centre locations.  In general, observance of bus lanes by non-bus traffic has been quite good. Garda efforts to reduce infringements to the minimum will continue.</P>

      <P>I know the Garda have many duties to carry out but in some cases in Dublin the regulations governing the bus lanes are being abused.  What steps can the Minister take to ensure that there is a motor cycle traffic squad to police the bus lanes?  If the regulations are not enforced the bus lanes will meet the same end as the one in Fairview met in 1971.</P>

      <P>The Cork Land Use and Transportation Study (LUTS) was published in 1978.  It recommended a programme of improvements in roads, public transport, parking and traffic management to service the needs of the Cork area into the nineties.  Implementation of this programme is in progress.</P>
      <P>As far as bus priority schemes are concerned, I understand from CIE that, deriving from the LUTS recommendations, a bus-only road has been provided at Albert Quay, development of two other bus priority schemes is at an advanced stage and installation of a computerised traffic signal system which will provide a degree of priority for buses is also in hands.</P>
      <P>The LUTS study recommended a number of other bus priority schemes and as far as public transport is concerned I will keep myself informed on the implementation of these recommendations so that further initiatives may be taken as necessary.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to consider setting up a separate Kerry harbour authority with jurisdiction over part of the Shannon estuary.  It is my view that the general development of the Shannon estuary could most effectively be achieved by the establishment of a single <Col N="600" /> ports authority with control over the entire waters of the estuary.</P>
      <P>The House was informed last week, in the course of a reply to other parliamentary questions, of the meeting which I had on 9 November 1981 with the chairmen and other representatives of Limerick Harbour Commissioners, Foynes Harbour Trustees, Kilrush Harbour Authority and representatives of the Mid-West Regional Development Organisation at which the three harbour authorities agreed to resume their discussions with a view to submitting to me within three months agreed proposals, if possible, for the establishment of a Shannon estuarial authority.

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport the current position in relation to our quotas in bilateral and multilateral haulage licences; and if he has any plans to improve further our position in relation to the current quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Bilateral road transport agreements have been negotiated and are in operation between Ireland and Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy and the UK.  These agreements provide for the issue of permits to the hauliers of either country within the limits of annual quotas fixed on a reciprocal basis.  In each case the permits, which are issued by the competent authority &mdash; in Ireland the Department of Transport &mdash; of the country in which the vehicle is registered, authorise the carriage of goods by road between Ireland and the other country concerned or in transit throughout either country.</P>
      <P>Road transport agreements have also been negotiated with Norway, Sweden, Finland and Greece and these agreements will come into operation shortly. Negotiations are proceeding on proposed agreements with the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.</P>
      <P>The annual quotas under the six agreements at present in operation are adequate to meet current requirements. They are kept under constant review and, where necessary, my Department seek increases in the quotas to keep them in line, as far as possible, with Irish requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has an allocation of 76 multilateral authorisations under the EEC Community quota system, which permits haulage for reward on a multilateral basis between the ten member states of the EEC, as well as an allocation of 22 multilateral licences under a similar licensing <Col N="602" /> scheme operated by the European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT) which covers Austria, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and Yugoslavia as well as the ten EEC member states.</P>
    <P>The question of increasing the number of licences available under the ECMT scheme was considered at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the ECMT which I attended on 26 November 1981. The council decided to refer the matter to a meeting of the Committee of Deputies of the ECMT to be held in January 1982 so that it can be examined in the light of decisions taken by the EEC Council of Transport Ministers on 15 December 1981 on a Commission proposal to increase the Community quota for 1982.</P>
    <P>These two multilateral licensing schemes are of considerable significance for Ireland because of our geographical situation as an island on the periphery of Europe.  I will continue to press strongly both in the EEC and in the ECMT for increases in Ireland's allocations of multilateral licences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate the number of French licences in the bilateral agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I do not have the number of licences granted under the bilateral arrangement with France.  But I can say that the annual quota of journeys is 5,300 plus a co-operation quota of 400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is need to have this number increased and that it militates against satisfactory improvement of our international road haulage industry?  I understood that negotiations took place on a continuing basis.  Is the Minister involved in any negotiations at present to improve our position with the French authorities under the bilateral agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In April last I understand there was an increase of 300 journeys negotiated with the French authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That was as a result of good negotiation by the Minister at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that that is sufficient to meet the requirements of the industry at present.  But the annual quotas under the bilateral agreements with all the countries, not just France, are kept under constant review and wherever necessary negotiations to increase them will take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there has been no improvement at all under either our EEC licence or the ECMT and that it was suggested that we should convert more of them to short-term authorisations.  Has the Minister any plans to convert any of them this year to accommodate road haulage development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a limit as to the number that could be converted without totally undoing the good of having multilateral licences under the ECMT.  A certain number are converted depending on the demand from time to time under the traffic requirements.  These things are kept under constant review and adjustments are made depending on the trafficking from time to time.  The Deputy can be quite certain that the haulage industry and my Department keep in close contact with each other with regard to the licensing requirements and, in turn, we keep in close contact with the countries with whom we are in bilateral agreement and in the international community, in the EEC and at the ECMT we will make our case also.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difficulty with regard to bilateral agreements.  The difficulty arises with regard to the multilateral quota.  Undoubtedly the country mentioned by the Deputy, Germany, was one of the objectors at the meeting last week of the European Conference. There were other countries objecting, those that find themselves transit countries in Europe &mdash; Austria, Switzerland, to a lesser extent, Yugoslavia and Germany. They are objectors to the quota being increased on the grounds that they have to take all the extra lorries the increased quotas generate.  This is something that is being negotiated within the EEC and within the ECMT.  It calls for further consideration by the EEC in a fortnight's time and possibly if a change is effected there that change will find its way into the ECMT.  We might effect an improvement there next May when the ECMT meet in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the position of power the Minister now holds within the ECMT, of which he is the new chairman, could he be in any way hopeful that the quota of ECMT licences of 22 can be increased next year as a result of the meeting of last week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to offer any hope at this stage because the objections being made by the objecting countries were put forward fairly unequivocally. Nevertheless there is hope that movement might be got at the meeting of the EEC on 15 December.  If movement can be got there it will have a strong influence on the ECMT because there was a compromise suggestion at the ECMT meeting that the ECMT meeting would accept &mdash; at the meeting of Deputies next January &mdash; any changes upwards that might be made by the EEC at their meeting in December.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware of the history in regard to the implementation of the tachograph and that considerable postponements and derogations were afforded this country.  He must be equally well aware that the matter is now at the stage where it has to be implemented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether, in view of the obvious unsatisfactory working of the restrictions imposed under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, 1960 and the expressed criticism by RTE staff of the manner in which such restrictions interfere with normal news reporting, he will consider revoking such restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that the working of the restrictions is obviously unsatisfactory. I would point out that the Houses of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies noted the views of journalists on the problems caused by section 31 but held &ldquo;that the section is a necessary contribution to public order at this troubled time in our history&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give any consideration to allowing duly elected local authority members to be interviewed on matters affecting their areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to allow anything on the lines suggested by the Deputy.  I note that he did not allow any changes when he had the opportunity.  It is particularly appropriate that no changes be made in view of the rather chilly statement made at a recent gathering of the Provisionals when they waved a ballot paper in one hand and, metaphorically, an armalite in the other hand.  Are we to allow local authority representatives, waving a ballot paper with one hand and with their armalite rifle behind their back in the other hand, access to our airwaves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There were no representations whatsoever made to me in relation to this factor.  In fact during my term of office it transpired that two local authority members in this category were interviewed and it was only as a result of inquiries and representations in relation <Col N="607" /> to that that the question arose.  All I asked the Minister was: will he give any consideration to interviewing those local authority members on local affairs only? I am quite in agreement with the other part of the Minister's statement in relation to the need for section 31.  But there should be a somewhat more open approach in relation to these matters.  I could not see that it would infringe the spirit of the part of section 31 to which he referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already explained to the Deputy, these local representatives are waving the ballot paper with one hand and have the armalite behind their back in the other hand.  I do not propose that they should get freedom of the airwaves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that up to perhaps half the young people of this country are tuning in, in one way or another, to pirate radio, has the Minister anything in mind to deal with such interviews over this pirate radio system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course pirate radios are unlawful.  The position there is that amending legislation is necessary to deal effectively with them.  That is the proper way to deal with them.  There is a question later on dealing specifically with that question.  Perhaps the Deputy will wait until I give the answer to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware of the controversy regarding the live transmission of the Castlebar Song Contest on Friday, 2 October 1981, and of the suggestion that the disastrous quality of sound and vision was the fault of the Post Office; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the quality of the transmission was not satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in a statement issued by the Department on 5 October, the degradation <Col N="608" /> in the quality of transmission did not occur in that part of the transmission for which the Department was responsible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this was a most unfortunate occurrence, that every assistance in fact was given by the technical staff of the Post Office to the engineering section of RTE to have this matter sorted out and that no blame should attach to the people of the Post Office in this regard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly accurate to say that there is duplication.  There are two authorities responsible.  To that extent there can be differing qualities of transmission.  I agree that the proper thing would be to have one authority in charge of all transmissions but that might not be technically feasible at all times. But so far as is technically possible we will have the position rectified for next year.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, having regard to the constitutional requirement in the interests of practical democracy that Members have unimpeded access to the House for the purpose of doing their business, I wonder if the Ceann Comhairle would use his good offices to ensure that the free passage of Members and, indeed, of the public to this House is no longer hindered by members of the Garda Síochána in proximity to this House who, out of sheer boredom, are causing obstruction and traffic hazards, such as is occurring today because cars are being prohibited from entering Molesworth Street from Kildare Street and cars are delayed entry to Leinster House for the purpose of carrying out facile and futile security operations while at the same time protesting citizens are marching in the street in a lawful manner.  The result is that all the approaches to Leinster House are seriously obstructed and a number of Members have been delayed in getting access to the House.  With respect I would suggest that the Ceann Comhairle's own personal inspection would show that the obstruction of cars entering Molesworth Street from Kildare Street is utterly useless and is in fact creating a traffic hazard which would not otherwise exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes an increase from 12 to 14 in the statutory number of ordinary judges of the High Court.  It also takes account of the fact that, by virtue of the provisions of section 14 of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, the number of such judges may in certain circumstances be one more, but since no High <Col N="678" /> Court judge is currently a member of the Law Reform Commission the provisions of the section in question do not affect the High Court at the present time.</P>
    <P>The necessity for additional judges of the High Court, as provided for in section 1 of the Bill, arises from the increased volume of business coming before that court in recent years, coupled with the fact that the court is in effect short of two judges, because the full time of one judge has been for some time, and still is, taken up with sittings of the Special Criminal Court, and the assignment of Judge Keane to conduct the Stardust fire inquiry has meant that his services have not been available to the High Court for many months past.  It is important that the Presidency of the Special Criminal Court be filled by a judge of the High Court and, in order to ensure that there would at all times be a High Court judge available to act as President, it became necessary to appoint four High Court judges to be members of that court.  The effect of this has been to deprive the High Court of the full time of one judge.</P>
    <P>The necessity to assign a High Court judge to conduct the Stardust fire inquiry has meant, as I have already said, that the judge assigned has not been available to the High Court for many months past and, although the public hearing of the inquiry has ended, he is unlikely to be able to resume full time High Court duties until well into 1982.  This is the second occasion within the last three years that a High Court judge has been called upon to absent himself from the Bench over an extended period to conduct such an inquiry and I consider that the complement of High Court judges should now be such that when a judge is called on to conduct an inquiry of this nature the remaining number of judges will be adequate to deal with the volume of business coming before the court.</P>
    <P>Another source of strain on the resources of the High Court has been the substantial growth in recent years of family law business which, because of its personal nature, needs to be disposed of with the minimum of delay and the stage has now been reached where it has been found necessary to allocate the full time <Col N="679" /> of two judges to it.  The time of two of the three additional High Court judges appointed on foot of the Courts Act, 1979, has thus been absorbed and the court has not had an opportunity of reducing either its arrears of business or the average time-lag between the date of setting down of a case and the date of hearing which, in the case of jury actions, is now 20 months.  It had grown from 16 months in 1979 to 18 months on 31 July 1981, the end of the 1980-81 legal year. In that period the number of jury actions set down for hearing in the High Court has more than doubled, rising from 1,691 during the year ended 31 July 1979 to 3,653 in the year ended 31 July 1981, and although the Court disposed of 1,842 cases during the 1980-81 legal year, arrears continue to accumulate and a serious position now exists.</P>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill, therefore, are designed to enable the High Court to eliminate its arrears of business and I hope Deputies will appreciate from what I have said that the proper administration of justice requires that additional judges be made available to the High Court as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to the Minister of State today, read carefully what he said in the Seanad and followed the debate in the Upper House. Without wishing to score off him, his script is so like mine of 1979, when I came before this House looking for three additional High Court judges, that the same script would have done.  I am not at all convinced that a case has been made in this afternoon's ministerial speech.  Perhaps, when replying to the debate, the Minister might have more convincing arguments for supporting the Bill.  The solution offered to the House on 19 June 1979 did not succeed because of the huge backlog.  It is questionable whether that same solution will succeed today, which is why I am drawing the attention of the Minister of State to the contents of this Bill.  I was assured by my advisers in 1979 that the case then made was the answer <Col N="680" /> to the problem, but that did not work. The solution offered now is not the answer either.</P>
      <P>Being a barrister himself, the Minister will know that justice delayed is justice denied.  He knows better than anybody here that ten or 15 years ago there was a policy to appoint the minimum number of judges.  Perhaps at that time the Oireachtas were worried about costs. Everyone is now of the opinion that the expeditious disposal of business in the High Court and the elimination of delays are more important than the cost involved in the appointment of further judges.  Delays in court cases bring the law into disrepute and lead to unnecessary frustration among the general public. I am not suggesting that all the delays emanate from the courts.  There surely are delays all along the way &mdash; in solicitors' offices, in the Bar Library, in receiving reports from expert witnesses &mdash; and some may be unavoidable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a backlog of cases about which something must be done.  I am not opposing the Bill.  I am open to being convinced and hope that the Minister will convince me.  However, I make a couple of interesting suggestions.  Now may be the time to make an exhaustive review and study of the practices and procedures in the operation of the High Court.  There is not a Member of this House who has not at some time heard from members of the profession that delays occur which seemingly should not happen and that some practices and procedures are seemingly outdated.  I believe, now more than ever before, without any hope of contradiction, that there is a case for the establishment of a High Court regularly sitting in Cork, which would cover, surely, all the south and west.  At present the High Court sits three times a year in Cork city, three weeks at a time.  It sits twice a year for two weeks in Limerick and I am open to correction on this &mdash; it sits twice a year in Galway and for two weekly periods in Sligo.  The Minister might have more information on this aspect, but I understand that there are delays of up to one-and-a-half years in the hearing of cases in Limerick, of approximately two years in Galway, and approximately three years <Col N="681" /> elapse from the setting down of a jury action to the date of hearing in Cork city. From the date of instruction to the actual hearing of a case, a period of five or six years might elapse.  Delays of this magnitude do not promote the wellbeing of the general public.  In many instances they can cause severe hardship to litigants.</P>
    <P>I believe what I am saying to be fact and people on all sides of the House will agree with me.  I propose, on Committee Stage, which probably will not be taken today, to table an amendment which might in some way allow the Minister to establish a High Court sitting in Cork.  It has been said in the past, that judges are slow to leave Dublin and go to the country on a permanent basis.  I would not suggest that either of the two new appointments should be based full-time in Cork, but that a High Court in Cork should be serviced from the present panel of High Court judges.  If somebody is designated to sit for a six month or 12-month period, there is more than enough work for him to do in the south and west.</P>
    <P>I have met a number of professional people&mdash;doctors, engineers, veterinary surgeons&mdash;who have been called as expert witnesses in High Court cases.  The Minister of State probably knows better than I that they come to Dublin to the High Court sessions, wait two to four days for a case which might be listed as No. 4 for a particular court and that case may never be called.  There may be some monetary reward for them, but it is fair to say that if they had the choice, they would by far, prefer to be working in their own professions.  Instead of bringing the people to the courts, we should bring the courts to the people.  I believe that there would be agreement on this important matter from all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat frightened to read in some newspaper articles in the Official Report of the Seanad that there was a possibility, because of lack of space in Dublin for High Court judges, of a High Court more or less permanently based in Naas, County Kildare.  With all due respect, the Minister of State, having recently half promised a High Court for <Col N="682" /> Tralee when he opened the courthouse which I had got under way for him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>A High Court operating in Naas would not be any good to anybody in rural Ireland, other than those within the immediate proximity of Naas.  Anybody coming from the west, north-west or south would still have to come to Dublin by train and find his or her way to Naas.  It is not just a question of keeping within the Pale.  Let us bring the court to the people of the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider the holding of High Court sittings in Tralee.  I hope he will do so.  It is between 60 and 70 miles from Limerick and about the same distance from Cork.  There is an excellent courthouse in Tralee which could be used for High Court sittings.  In Waterford there will be a fine courthouse soon and Cork is a base from which Waterford could be served.  There have been demands in the newspapers for High Court sittings in the north-west, in Letterkenny.  I understand there will be courthouse facilities there reasonably soon.  I should like the Minister to check it out to see if the facilities in Letterkenny are being improved.  I hope he can let me know in his reply how soon we can expect the High Court to begin sittings in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the hugh increase in running-down cases many people are waiting so long to have their cases heard that with inflation running at its present rate they are out of pocket by the time their business is sorted out.  This is of great importance to many people and the Minister should consider all means to give people speedy access to the courts. The Minister might tell me later whether <Col N="683" /> in the circumstances a committee could be set up by the Department to examine the operations of the courts at the present time.  I do not like to begin to talk about the holidays judges have, whether it is 15 weeks or 20 weeks, because it would be unfair.  That sort of thing happened in the past and it was wrong because even when a court is not sitting, members of the court have to write up their books and record their judgments, tedious and onerous tasks.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately people have to wait four or five years for judgments and this should not happen.  I would urge the Minister to consult regularly with the President of the High Court to see if anything can be done to expedite judgments after a certain length of time.  Criticisms have been made of individual members of the High Court and it has been said that judgments were given only after questions had been asked in this House.  There is not a single Member of the House who would not do everything possible to uphold the high regard which the Judiciary enjoy throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Another reason why I am not convinced by the case the Minister has made is my fear that the recruitment embargo on staff from 31 July has been applied to the courts.  Are there shortages in the courts of registrars, stenographers, clerks?  If we are to appoint more judges will the Minister give a categoric assurance that they will be properly and fully facilitated with adequate, qualified staff which they need to conduct their courts.</P>
    <P>It has been said, and I am not able to deny it, that there are several vacancies in court staffs.  I know there are vacancies in the personnel section, that the position of head of that section is vacant at a time when it is highly important to have it filled, when the Government are appointing extra judges.  It is pointless coming in here for permission to appoint two judges if the staff are not there.  Incidentally, I wonder why this little Bill has been given precedence in the House over other important legislation.  I am sure there will be a short list of applicants for the post, or have they been given away already? There seems to have been a hurry to get <Col N="684" /> this little Bill through and I might suggest that it could be because the Government lack confidence in themselves and feel they might not be around for too long. However, I will leave that for another time and another place.  I want to be convinced that there will be sufficient qualified staff to help all the judges.</P>
    <P>I repeat my request in regard to the High Court on circuit.  Cork, Limerick, Galway and Sligo are the bases from which the service could be extended to places like Waterford, Tralee and Letterkenny, whose people at the moment have completely inadequate access to that court.  I agree there is more than sufficient business for two extra judges, dealing with jury or non-jury cases, in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Sligo and there-for serious consideration should be given to holding sittings in Letterkenny to the great relief of pressure on Galway. I suggest there is a case as well for holding sittings in Ennis where there is a very fine courthouse, two vacant rooms and plenty of office space which is at present occupied by the county council.  I am sure that if required the county council could get office space elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is a backlog of cases in Dublin. I accept that the President of the High Court has had a difficult time with the absences of Mr. Justice Costello during the Whiddy Inquiry and Mr. Justice Keane at the Stardust investigations.  In a written reply to question 9 on 28 October the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Sittings of the Tribunal appointed to report on the Whiddy Island disaster commenced 26 April 1979 and were held on a total of 72 days between then and 20 December 1979.  The writing of the report was completed by Mr. Justice Costello on 7 May 1980.  The High Court sat on a total of 196 days between 23 April 1979, the first day of the 1979 Easter Term, and 7 May 1980, and High Court records show that Mr. Justice Costello sat in the High Court on 54 days during that period.</P>
    <P>The first preliminary hearing of the Stardust Fire Inquiry was held by Mr. Justice Keane on 2 March 1981 and sittings have been held on 106 days <Col N="685" /> since then up to and including 23 October 1981.  During that period there were 105 High Court sitting days and Mr. Justice Keane sat in the High Court on 23 days during the months of March and April.  Sittings of the tribunal were held on 28 days during the months of April, June, August and September at times when the High Court was on vacation.</P>
    <P>I have always heard it said that the Long Vacation was sacred, but we had Mr. Justice Keane sitting on 28 days while the High Court was on vacation.  Mr. Keane certainly set a headline.  Perhaps this is something which could be looked at when the Minister of State gets approval from the Government to establish a High Court committee to examine the practices and methods of operation of the High Court.  It would be the easiest thing in the world for the Minister to say they do not have to do that because they know what is happening.  The arguments I used in 1979 when I was trying to wipe out the backlog&mdash;we got more judges, but we did not wipe out the backlog&mdash;are being used today by the Minister.  This will not wipe out the backlog.  If we agree to give him the two extra judges, he will be back again in reasonably short time looking for more, that is, if he has courtrooms for them.</P>
    <P>It would be inconceivable that we should appoint two new judges if we had not the staff to service their courts.  We will get assurances on that when the time comes.  It would also be unreal to appoint two new High Court judges if we had not got somewhere for them to sit.  Accommodation raises a big question.  One of our courts&mdash;I think it is No. 4&mdash;is out of action because of the fire.  Is it a fact that we have now more judges than we have courtrooms to accommodate them?  If so, will not that situation be aggravated by the appointment of two new judges, unless we are to have a permanent High Court in the south operating from Cork and covering the south and the west?</P>
    <P>Knowing how difficult it is to provide proper accommodation for the High Court, and how difficult it is to get this sort of accommodation because of what <Col N="686" /> is required, and having regard to the fact that the Incorporated Law Society's building in Blackhall Place has been used for the inquiry into the Stardust fire, and has been praised by all as being a very suitable building, I suggest that perhaps it could be leased from the Incorporated Law Society to be used as a court.  The Minister will be coming back to us again shortly looking for £500,000 from the Suitors Fund to do a face lift job on the old Kings Inns building in Green Street.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Minister's pardon.  It would be nice to look for it and it would be nicer still to get it.  Can we get anything in return for it for the ordinary people of Ireland?  Is there any part of that building which could be used as another court for the High Court?  If so, it may be offered by the Bar Council now that the matter has been raised.  This would be worth looking at.  It is nice to give something when one is getting something. More space for the courts to operate in would be welcomed by the President of the High Court and his judges.</P>
      <P>As the Minister knows, the jurisdiction of the lower courts is to be increased considerably.  The operative date of the Courts Act, 1981, is 12 May 1982.  A rumour is circulating that the Minister and the Department want to put back that date.  Can the Minister say whether there is any truth in that rumour?  Is it still planned to bring the provisions of that Act into operation as and from 12 May next year?  If not the increased jurisdiction of the lower courts would be eroded considerably.  Indeed, one can see the effects of erosion as of now.  It will be eroded considerably more if it is delayed much longer than May 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increased jurisdiction of the lower courts will take part of the load off the High Court, and should make access to the High Court easier than it is at present. I am anxious to see the provisions of the Courts Act, 1981, implemented as soon as possible.  I accept that there are difficulties. That is why, when we were putting the legislation through the Houses last year, we had a year's stay on the <Col N="687" /> implementation of its provisions.  I hope that year's grace was used fully to try to sort out the difficulties which had to be sorted out so that it could operate successfully.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I feel I should raise and, being a barrister, perhaps the Minister will not throw me out for raising it.  What are his views on the appointment of members of the other profession, solicitors, to the High Court?  Would he agree that a solicitor of 20 years' standing would be suitable?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of putting the solicitors and barristers at each others throats.  I know a committee made up of both professions are trying to iron out the little problems between the two groups.  I hope that, in the interests of efficiency, in the interests of economy and in many other interests, that at some time we will have one profession rather than two sections.  The Minister might let us know his views and whether he would be prepared to recommend that the Government should consider appointing a solicitor of 20 years' standing.  I know &mdash; and I am sure others do as well &mdash; a number of very eminent people amongst the members of the Incorporated Law Society who would make excellent members of the High Court if they were appointed to it.  I should like the Minister to consider it and give us his views on it.</P>
      <P>In his opening speech the Minister put forward the argument that a judge of the High Court is the President of the Special Criminal Court.  That is so, and that is as it should be.  We are all very thankful to the judges of the High Court who have given service in the Special Criminal Court.  In reply to a parliamentary question I put down to the Minister recently I was told that a judge of the High Court sat in the Special Criminal Court on 142 days in 1979, 150 days in 1980 and 93 days up to the end of September 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention this to show that the argument put forward by the Minister is not as strong as he though it was or his advisers thought it was.  In eight months <Col N="688" /> of the year, 93 days would not take up the full-time services of one judge of the High Court.  In 1979, 53 cases were disposed of, in 1980, 43 cases and up to the end of September 1981, 26 cases.  Unfortunately, no records are kept of the number of actual sitting hours of the court or the time spent by the members of the court in considering decisions.  I am not quibbling about any of that.  I am just pointing out that the Minister's argument would not convince anyone in this House that there is a need for an extra High Court judge because of that fact.</P>
    <P>We will always have members of the High Court tied up in inquiries.  Nobody wants to see another disaster like the one in Bantry or the one in the Stardust in Artane.  Please God we will not have any more of those.</P>
    <P>There is a huge backlog in the courts and we must have a fundamental examination of the whole process to see if there is anything we can do to speed things up. If we have more judges and buildings, could the buildings not be used on a staggered scale?  Have we enough staff? There is need for a permanent High Court based in Cork to cover the south and west.  Would the Minister give his views on the other matters I raised because justice delayed is justice denied. I should like to pay a special tribute to members of the Judiciary who do a tremendous job and are held in very high esteem by practically everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that delays have become notorious and one can read of it with some amusement in the writings of Dickens and even in Shakespearean times.  It is a remarkable reflection in this day and age, with all the magnificence of technical improvements and so on, that we should find a situation reflected in the Minister's address giving the delays that are implicit for any citizen seeking justice in the High Court.  From the time a case is set down for hearing there is a waiting period of some 20 months.  The Minister did not say it could take perhaps up to a year before the case is even set down for hearing so we are talking about anything from a two-and-a-half years to a three year delay.  From my own experience it is not unusual to have a period in excess of that, going up to four or five years before a hearing is obtained.  It is intolerable and of great prejudice to citizens who, unfortunately for them, need to have recourse to the law.  When the necessity arises a citizen is entitled to expect reasonably speedy justice to have his complaint disposed of.</P>
      <P>The overwhelming bulk of cases which come before the courts today are those arising from road accidents and injuries sustained by people at work.  The fact that damages to which those people would be entitled are delayed and held up for years is something that prejudices them.  It means that in the intervening period when many of them would be suffering from serious injuries, incapacitated, in need of medical care and institutional support, they would be denied the money required to support themselves during those intervening years, when the injuries are at their worst, by reason of delays in the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Delays suit insurance companies who have the responsibility, for the most part, of paying damages in those cases.  Those delays mean that the insurance companies can retain the money, which more <Col N="690" /> properly belongs to the citizen who was injured, and can earn considerable sums in interest until they are required to pay it to where it is right and properly owing. We are talking about millions of pounds and a very large measure of the excessive profits of the insurance companies is earned at the expense of citizens injured in accidents who are entitled to damages from them but who do not get it as a result of the situation described in the Minister's address.  Very often a person who has sustained serious injuries may be crippled and may be induced, by reason of the delay, to accept a lesser sum in settlement of his claim than he would otherwise be entitled to because he knows if he insists on the full measure of his rights he will be held up for a period of years.  He may find that unacceptable or he may not be in a position to tolerate it.  Insurance companies often play a cat and mouse game with an unfortunate injured person.  They will offer £X on the table and if the person does not accept it they will tell him to bring it to court where it will be three or four years before he gets anything.  That is an unwarranted pressure on the citizen who, of necessity, must have recourse&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before the interruption I was referring to the impact on private citizens and its effect upon their financial position during the trying time when many people have been involved in accidents and perhaps sustained serious personal injuries, and pointing out that it was at that time that they needed the utmost support and because of the system it was denied to them.  It is essential that we should address ourselves very seriously to the methods that can be employed to secure a substantial reduction in that delay period.  The Bill is directed towards that end.  Of itself it is not going to make any substantial inroads into the delay period.</P>
      <P>Apart from the necessity of appointing the additional judges in the High Court, Deputy Collins was correct in referring to the necessity for staff.  The staffing situation in the courts, even with the existing number of judges, is totally inadequate. I have heard that there is some form of go-slow at present in operation in the courts and among some of the registrars in the High Court, as a result of which even the existing system is not working full steam ahead.  The situation of a judge is similar to that of an army in the field.  For every soldier fighting at the front, there must be five or six men backing him and providing him with the necessary services.  For each judge sitting and adjudicating on the bench, a substantial back-up of skilled staff would be needed to enable him to discharge his functions adequately, efficiently and with speed. Consideration will have to be given to the staff situation.  There is no point appointing additional judges unless the Minister is prepared to make sure that the necessary staff back-up will be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> Reference has been made to the necessary increases in the jurisdiction of the lower courts.  I believe the bringing into operation of the Act increasing the jurisdictions would be a major step forward. The procedures in the lower courts are considerably more speedy than the procedure in the High Court.  The high percentage of inflation over the last decades has thrown the jurisdiction question completely out of gear.  Successive Ministers for Justice have allowed that situation to run on for too long.  In other words, they wait until the maximum jurisdiction of the Circuit Court becomes almost ludicrous in comparison to what was intended, and has been so eroded by inflation that it is more comparable to the District Court than the Circuit Court. Successive Ministers should note that a review of jurisdictions should be required in the present inflationary situation on a more regular basis &mdash; perhaps no more than two or three years in this kind of situation should be allowed to pass before the jurisdiction of the District Court and the Circuit Court are substantially upgraded.  If that were done it would cut down on the build-up of cases we have seen in the High Court.</P>
    <P>The procedures in the High Court have been relatively unchanged for centuries. Modern techniques, typing, office equipment, computers and so on, could be adopted and should be brought into the system.  There should be a serious review of the whole method of pleading and procedures in the High Court.  The method of pleading is antiquated in the modern context.  The procedure in the Circuit Court is speedier, more satisfactory, shorter and no less efficient.  The Law Reform Commission, or the appropriate body, should have a look at that situation and recommend improvements that would simplify procedures in the interest of speed and in the interest of those hardy litigants who take to the courts on their own account without the assistance of solicitors or barristers.</P>
    <P>In England the procedures are different. They were originally the same but various improvements have been made. Here in the High Court there is only one person carrying the title of the Master of <Col N="693" /> the High Court whereas in England there are a number of masters who fulfil very useful functions in shortening the procedures that would otherwise have to be dealt with by the judges.  I am referring to the English system which we never got round to bringing in here whereby at an intermediate stage of the pleadings and the preparations for a case the parties are called in before a master for the purpose of determining what matters may be common between the parties and could be dispensed with when the hearing of the action is brought to trial.</P>
    <P>The question of medical evidence could be dealt with.  I understand that at the preliminary hearing the master would endeavour to obtain agreement on the medical evidence and get both parties to accept that the medical reports issued by the doctors on both sides would be acceptable.  The problem of professional witnesses &mdash; doctors, engineers, architects and others &mdash; causes a considerable backlog and delay because when cases come to hearing in the High Court they are dependent on these expert witnesses. Doctors in particular cause the biggest problem because one often finds that when they are required to give evidence they are in the middle of operations, or cannot be got because they are at conferences in America, England and so on. The court's time having been set for that day, it now has to put the case back again and it joins the ever-growing list building up to the thousands of cases which are at present awaiting a hearing.</P>
    <P>The delays to the citizen in matters of justice are not confined to the courts, although I realise the Bill refers to courts only, but other bodies that determine the rights of citizens, such as An Bord Pleanála, also have run very substantially into arrears, as happened in the courts. The same responsibility that applies to the rights of the citizen before the courts also applies to his rights before Government bodies which are there to determine the rights and duties of the citizen.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill and urge the Minister to look into these supplementary matters that are so essential if it is to have any beneficial effect in achieving the object for which it was intended.</P>

      <P>I wanted to speak on this Bill.  I am in a rush because I wanted to get the 5.30 p.m. train as I have to attend a meeting of the Mallow Urban District Council.  I welcome this Bill which appoints extra High Court Judges. In the Cork area there is an inordinate delay between the time of the accident and the time cases are set down for hearing before a High Court judge.  The vast number of cases awaiting trial concern persons who have received personal injuries arising out of accidents.  I understand that at the end of July a total of 987 cases were awaiting trial in the Cork area. Recently I had occasion to discuss this matter with a local solicitor who I thought was delaying a case.  He said that he had inquired about the position from the Central Statistics Office in Dublin and he was given to understand that at the end of July the number of cases awaiting trial in the Cork area was more than 4,000.  I am not questioning the Minister's figure but I am anxious to get it across that a big number of cases are waiting for hearing in Cork.  Therefore, there is a case for the appointment of a High Court judge for the Cork area or that the High Court sittings in Cork be more frequent and for a longer period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The High Court sits in Cork for a total of seven weeks, three in January, two weeks in April and two weeks in July.  As a result it takes more than two years, or longer, before cases are set down for trial.  I should also like to make the point that there is no reason why the High Court should not sit in Mallow.  There is a fine courthouse there and if a sitting of the High Court could be arranged for that town it would be of great benefit to the people of North Cork.  Unless something is done people will have to wait up to five years to have personal injury claims dealt with.  It is wrong that those who sustain injuries in an accident must <Col N="695" /> wait that length of time for compensation. The matter is more accentuated because in many cases breadwinners with young children are the plaintiffs.  It is because of personal pressures on them while they are out of work and not in receipt of any income that many of them are often forced to compromise their case.  In some cases they have to settle for a figure less than they could expect to receive if the case was heard before a High Court judge.  That situation must be rectified.  It is not good enough that a breadwinner without adequate income must wait for years to have his case heard and may settle for a sum less than would compensate him for the loss he suffered. I hope the Minister takes cognisance of the points I have raised in relation to the Cork area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill although I wonder why we are here at all dealing with such legislation.  I suggest this is a matter that could in the future be usefully regulated by ministerial order as the need arises.  Deputy Collins has already told the House that during his period of office he had to introduce a measure in similar terms and, in support of it, made a speech similar to the one made today.  Clearly, the question of the optimum number of judges is a matter that will fluctuate from time to time and is one that could appropriately be dealt with in future by ministerial order.  The Minister should consider taking that power unto himself at an appropriate stage.  I welcome the Bill with some enthusiasm though I speculate that perhaps two additional judges is not, in all the circumstances, adequate because one of these judges, one suspects, is likely in the near future to be removed from availability in the High Court to take up duties with An Bord Pleanála.  Statutorily the chairman of An Bord Pleanála must be a judge of the High Court or a retired judge of that court and I understand that the term of office of the present incumbent is due to expire within a matter of months.  If that is the case then the total complement of High Court judges will be again reduced by one.  For that reason I <Col N="696" /> suggest that as a very minimum we should be thinking of three and not two extra High Court judges.</P>
      <P>The point has been well made that there is a constant strain on the manpower available to the High Court given the need for High Court judges to serve on various tribunals.  Reference has been made, in particular, to the Whiddy and Stardust tribunals.  Deputy Collins expressed all our hopes that there will not be a repeat of those tragedies or a need for a similarly lengthy tribunal, but while we all hope that there will not be a tragedy of those dimensions it is fair to say that there is a constant demand for High Court judges to serve on tribunals of one sort or another because of their status and independence.  They bring a quality to tribunals and in some instances are regarded as being necessary.  Going back over the years one can think of subjects as diverse as the need for Mr. Justice Kenny to adjudicate on the proposals dealing with land speculation and the acquisition of building land, the Seven Days Tribunal on the money lenders and a succession of others.  We should accept as a basic premise that there is going to be a constant demand for High Court judges to participate in these, in a sense, extra-curricular activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is the case we should accept that the increase in the number of judges is needed urgently.  There has already been some discussion of the injustice that arises from the present situation and that injustice arises on both the civil and the criminal side of the courts.  The civil side has already been dealt with at some length by Deputy Mervyn Taylor but in crude terms what it amounts to is that an insurance company can go to a plaintiff and say: &ldquo;We know your injuries are worth £35,000 or £40,000 and in three of four years time you will get that amount but you may not be able to survive until then so why not take £20,000 or £25,000 and it is into your pocket now&rdquo;.  That sort of system whereby people have to be bought off for less than their entitlements on the basis that they cannot afford to wait to get their entitlements is a manifest unjustice that must be stopped.  Similar difficulties arise on the criminal side and, <Col N="697" /> specifically, in the case of the Central Criminal Court.  Again, there are long delays.  I recall a speech at a seminar for young solicitors some time ago by the most eminent practitioner on the defence side in criminal law who made the point that the single most effective guarantee of a fair trial in a substantial criminal cause was a quick trial.  While there has been much talk about the need to reform the procedures in relation to criminal law &mdash; of course there is need for reform &mdash; the single most effective step that could be taken to make sure that those who are in fact guilty beyond reasonable doubt are convicted and that those who are in fact not guilty beyond reasonable doubt are acquitted is to ensure that cases are brought on to trial quickly when witnesses' memories are still fresh and when people give evidence of what they actually recollect rather than on the story that has been refined and solidified over two or three years as they retell it to their friends in the process.</P>
    <P>In Dublin there is a clear need to see the operation of the High Court in an integrated manner with the way in which the Circuit Court operates.  The position is that in Dublin up to about three years ago there were absolutely intolerable delays.  People were being charged with serious criminal offences, returned for trial to the Circuit Court and it was taking from 18 months to two-and-a-half years for their cases to be heard.  Successive Ministers for Justice &mdash; Deputy Collins and Deputy Mitchell &mdash; have crusaded against a rise in violent crime.  I suggest to them that there is no single step they could take that would be more effective than to guarantee to culprits that they are going to be brought to trial quickly.  It is no deterrent to say to somebody: &ldquo;You are caught.  You are going to be brought to the District Court; you are going to be released on bail and your trial will come up in many months' or in many years' time&rdquo;.  As a result of the activity of Judges assigned to the Circuit Court in Dublin and with the co-operation of both branches of the legal profession and of the Garda a situation had been achieved whereby people returned for trial in the <Col N="698" /> District Court could be tried within six weeks in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>However, for several reasons that is no longer the case and the situation is that people being returned for trial now will not be tried before March or April of next year.  Overwhelmingly that means that people will be on bail from now until then and the statistics show that a significant number of offences are committed by people while on bail.  I suggest that rather than contemplate the possibility of changing the law in relation to bail, we would be more usefully employed in devoting out attention to ensuring that people charged with serious offences are brought to trial speedily.  If they are innocent this will be in their interest in terms of the availability of witnesses and so on but if they are guilty it will be very much in the State's interest to have an early trial.  Therefore, I ask the Minister, in the context of considering the operation of the courts in Dublin as a whole, to consider the appointment of at least one extra judge to the Dublin Circuit Court to deal with criminal business.  The position is that some 58 per cent of indictable crime is committed in the streets of this city and no single step that we could take would be more effective in providing a deterrent in this area than that people would know that if apprehended they would be brought to trial speedily and that shortly after the event they will face the consequences of their crime.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Circuit Criminal Court is grossly over-worked now compared with the situation of a year ago.  There are several reasons for this.  One is that at that stage many trials that were originally listed for that court would transfer, at the option either of the prosecution or of the defence, to the High Court exercising its criminal jurisdiction.  As a result of recent legislation that option is no longer available. In other words, this leakage has been plugged.  Indeed, the reverse happens in that trials listed originally for the Circuit Court around the country can be transferred to Dublin at the option either of the defence or of the prosecution. Many of the trials that are so transferred are likely to be lengthy and to clog up the business of the Circuit Criminal Court in <Col N="699" /> Dublin for a long time.  There was evidence of this in relation to the major drugs trial that came before that court recently.</P>
    <P>If the really unsatisfactory situation that prevailed a few years ago is to be avoided there is a need for action to be taken immediately and before the situation gets out of hand.  That is why I suggest the appointment of a minimum of one extra judge and his assignment to the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to deal with criminal cases.  If it is the norm that Circuit Court judges in Dublin are over-worked and incapable of dealing with the volume of business on the criminal side, that is not the practice every day because it can happen that none of the trials listed for any one day can go ahead.  This may happen because of the absconding of an accused while on bail, the non-availability of essential prosecution witnesses or for some other reason.  The result of this situation is that judges assigned to the Circuit Court find themselves without anything to do for the remainder of the day after 11.10 a.m. while across the corridor the High Court judges are not able to cope with the workload assigned to them for that day: family law cases may be held up and drift over to the next day. People may be waiting around the corridors and these may include expert witnesses. All this time the cost to the litigants is rising.  I suggest that the Minister consider the possibility of amending the legislation to provide that Circuit Court judges assigned to sit on a permanent basis in the Dublin Circuit Court should, <i>ex officio</i>, be judges of the High Court. That situation exists in the case of the President of the High Court and if it were extended as I suggest it would mean that on those rare occasions when judges in the Circuit Court are surplus they would be available to go to the aid of their High Court colleagues.  This would provide a more efficient use of the available manpower.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment briefly on a suggestion by Deputy Collins regarding the appointment of solicitors to the High Court bench.  I appreciate fully the motivation for the suggestion.  There are many <Col N="700" /> people among the solicitors' profession who would have all the qualifications necessary for such an appointment.  So far as I know there would be no statutory objection to their appointment.  However, I suggest that the present system whereby judges of the superior courts are drawn from the ranks of the practising Bar is by far a preferable situation because it means that those who sit in judgment are people with considerable experience of court practice and who have a degree of familiarity with those who appear before them daily.  That is a healthier situation than would be the introduction of a solicitor into a court atmosphere, an atmosphere with which the great majority of solicitors are not familiar.  Therefore, I urge the Minister not to be influenced too much by that suggestion from Deputy Collins.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  There is a need to deal with the backlog of cases that exists and the appointment of two further judges is a step in the right direction.  I hope that the Minister of State will be proceeding further along that road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for the appointment of extra members to the High Court because of the great backlog of cases there and the great increase in the workload in a number of legal areas.</P>
      <P>I intend to concentrate on one aspect and this is an aspect that the Minister of State has highlighted in his opening remarks as being one of the reasons for our needing this legislation.  He referred to the fact that there has been a very large increase in the volume of family law work coming before the courts.  This is something of which I am aware from my personal involvement in such cases.  In so far as the appointment of two additional High Court judges is concerned, this may speed up the manner in which such cases are dealt with and to that extent I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like preceding Court Acts the Bill is effectively a remedial measure to deal with a problem, to some extent to deal with it piecemeal, though this is no fault of the Minister or of the Government and neither is it any fault of the previous administration because despite the existence <Col N="701" /> of a large number of various committees who down through the years have considered different aspects of the courts structures and have made recommendations for changes, there has not been a comprehensive re-examination in this area since the foundation of the State. Effectively we have the same courts system today as we have had since 1922. Indeed, the system that we commenced with in 1922 was effectively the system which existed prior to the establishment of the Free State.  There is a need now in so far as the law is administered in a number of areas to have a fundamental re-examination of the manner in which our courts work.  This is required more in the area of family law than in any other area.</P>
    <P>The position is that the various courts operating within our system are administering family law.  The District Court has some jurisdiction in this area as have also the Circuit Court and the High Court.  We have an overlapping court structure that lacks co-ordination and which is wasteful financially in so far as one often finds judges at different levels in the courts dealing with family problems involving the same people but not being in a position to deal with such problems in a comprehensive way since different courts have different powers.  The time has come to reconsider that situation. A number of bodies have been set up for the purpose of reviewing the courts structure.  The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure produced a large number of reports and recommended many significant changes in the jurisdictional basis on which the courts operate. The Courts Act, 1980, which was passed last May sought to implement the recommendations of that committee.</P>
    <P>Some speakers in this debate have said that the content of that Act is to be welcomed. When much of the content of that Act comes into force in May 1982 it will greatly increase the jurisdiction of the lower courts and bring them into touch with the realities of inflation and the need to provide a more efficient court system. So far as the Courts Act, 1980 will have the effect of conferring family law jurisdiction on the District Court to deal with <Col N="702" /> custody cases and so far as it intends to deprive the High Court of substantial family law jurisdiction, it is a recipe for disaster.  I urge the Minister to think very seriously about amending the Courts Act, 1980, before it comes into force next May in so far as it affects family law.</P>
    <P>The Courts Act, 1980, will deprive the High Court of jurisdiction in a number of areas of family law in which the Judiciary in that court over the past 15 years have acquired a tremendous degree of expertise and knowledge.  In seeking to deprive that court of this jurisdiction this Act is conferring it in part on the Circuit Court, which it is fair to say, without being in any way disrespectful to the members of that court, is a court in which there have been very few family actions heard.  The judges in the Circuit Court have had very little real experience in the family law area.  If this Act is not amended, the Circuit Court from May 1982 will be inundated with family law proceedings and will be ill-equipped to deal with them.</P>
    <P>There is a similar difficulty in relation to the District Court in so far as this Act, in depriving the High Court of the jurisdiction and competence to deal with custody cases, disputes about custody of children between married couples, will confer this jurisdiction on the District Court in addition to the Circuit Court. The District Court at the moment has very limited family law jurisdiction.  I do not believe the physical structures of the District Court are able to deal with custody cases.  The present family law jurisdiction of the District Court is essentially to deal with maintenance applications by spouses or with barring orders &mdash; an application normally brought by battered wives to have their husbands barred from their homes.  In the District Court this can only be done for a period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>Such District Court proceedings normally last from one hour to two hours and rarely take longer than that.  Custody cases can run for two or three days in some instances.  It is unusual for a fully fought custody case to take less than a full days' hearing.  I do not believe that the work the District Court presently <Col N="703" /> deals with, which will be increased in other areas by the Courts Act, 1980, will enable that court to deal properly with custody cases.  The physical structures of those courts do not permit them to deal with family law in a proper fashion.  Many courts lack any real consultation facilities. Some of them operate out of rugby clubs or dance halls.  In my constituency the Rathfarnham District Court is effectively a court composed of one room where there are no consultation facilities available.  If a person has a family law case and he or she wishes to consult a solicitor outside the court while other cases are going on, that person has no choice but to stand in the main street of Rathfarnham or stand in the public lavatories which adjoin the court.  Many consultations in trying to resolve family problems have taken place in those lavatories. That is a disgraceful situation and it will be exacerbated by the Courts Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>I believe the intention of the Courts Act, 1981, was to remove some of the pressures which exist on the High Court. The appointment of two additional judges in the Bill we are discussing today will to some extent remove that pressure and, I believe, will render the transfer of custody jurisdiction to the District Court unnecessary.  I am not casting any doubts on the integrity of the district justices, but they do not have the experience to deal with this type of litigation.  They have never dealt with this.  There is however a great deal of experience and expertise in the High Court.</P>
    <P>I believe tremendous problems will be created by transferring this jurisdiction out of the High Court and placing it in the District Court.  I believe one of the motivating factors in having the Courts Act, 1981, passed was that the previous Minister felt that, if this transfer of jurisdiction took place, it would reduce the cost of such family proceedings.  However, I believe that will not be the reality. I believe that, irrespective of whether custody cases are dealt with in the High Court or in the District Court, a similar amount of work will have to be done by lawyers.  I believe this transfer of jurisdiction could increase the costs for litigants <Col N="704" /> because district justices have no experience of dealing with these cases.  I believe that when this Act comes into force a great many of the people involved will appeal to the Circuit Court for a further full hearing before that court.  At the moment it is unusual for custody cases to appeal to the Supreme Court from the High Court.  I believe that, instead of the matter being dealt with as speedily and as inexpensively as possible, those cases will straddle the District Court and the Circuit Court and take even longer than they take at the moment.  This will end up being more costly for the people involved.</P>
    <P>I believe the intention behind the Courts Act, 1981, in dealing with family law was wrong, although much of what was contained in that Act, as far as it affects other areas of civil law, was right and possibly should have been done years earlier.  I am not in any way critical of such matters.  But the provisions in relation to family law indicate a lack of understanding of the manner in which family law problems are dealt with and of their effects.  The recommendations of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, which were the guiding hand behind that Act, were indicative of the fact that the members of that committee did not appreciate the implications of what they were suggesting.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to look seriously, as I believe the Government are committed to do, at establishing as quickly as possible a unified court structure to deal with family cases.  There is no reason why these problems should straddle three different courts.  There is no reason why we cannot set up a unified family court at the level of the High Court which deals with all family matters.  There is no logic in the area of family law in dividing cases between three different courts.  I believe the Government are committed to the establishment of a family court structure. I hope we will have a unified system of family courts.  For constitutional reasons it would have to have the status of a High Court.  Each court should be situated in an area where the Circuit Court operates at present.  That would not cost additional finance but would have the merit that it <Col N="705" /> would save the State funds in that it would remove much of the overlapping and inconsistencies of the present system. It would produce a more coherent and unified system of justice.</P>
    <P>In this regard one must refer to the other committees that have some jurisdiction to make comments on the reform of the court system.  The Law Reform Commission were established by an Act in 1975 and they came into operation in 1976.  In that year the commission published a programme for law reform.  The programme stated that in examining various aspects of family law the commission &ldquo;will consider the question of the best type of judicial or court structure or structures appropriate to deal with different matters which fall under the general heading of family law&rdquo;.  That was said by the commission in 1976.  We are now in 1981 but the Law Reform Commission have not produced even a working paper to deal with this aspect of the problem. That is not the fault of this administration or the previous administration.  It is the fault of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>In their work programme published in 1976 the Law Reform Commission stated they regarded family law as a priority area for reform.  In a recent question to the Taoiseach, to which I got a very detailed reply, I asked him to list what matters were now being considered by the Law Reform Commission for the purpose of introducing new legislation or reform.  In an answer on 20 October 1981, the Taoiseach listed approximately 23 different areas of law that the commission are supposed to be examining at present. Some of them were presumably referred to the commission by previous Attorneys General and some were taken up by the commission on their own initiative.  In the 23 areas listed there is no reference to a family law court structure.  What has happened to the programme originally put forward by the Law Reform Commission? Do they intend to do any work in this area?  I know this is not the function of the Minister of State, but I hope this matter will be clarified.</P>
    <P>In the context of court jurisdiction, as in the context of family law reform generally, <Col N="706" /> we have a major problem, namely, that the Law Reform Commission have become one of the greatest impediments to law reform, which is a contradiction in terms.  When the commission were established they were welcomed by all sides on the basis that they would provide a very real input and would act as a catalyst to much badly-needed law reform.  Since their establishment in 1976, I believe the Law Reform Commission have failed abysmally.  Possibly some of the failure is not the fault of the commission.  To some extent they have become a form of political dustbin in that the previous Government willy-nilly referred all sorts of areas of law to them to produce reports when they themselves had no policies or opinions on the problems that existed and what law reforms were required.  To some extent the commission have had areas of law referred to them for reform that were not purely lawyers' law.  To some extent the commission have been asked to do things they are not capable of doing, to make political judgments on social decisions in dealing with questions of law reform.</P>
    <P>I find it extraordinary that the Law Reform Commission have managed to produce only one final report in five and a half years.  They have produced a number of working papers but in the context of the work done by them and of the great intentions and hopes for the commission they have now been seen to be incapable of carrying out the tasks originally assigned to them.  Effectively it is the function of the Attorney General as opposed to the Minister of State, but I urge the Government to have another look at the Law Reform Commission and see what reforming legislation might be introduced to deal with the problems that appear to exist with the commission.</P>
    <P>On the evidence of the manner the commission have operated, I do not believe they are capable of dealing with the question of the best type of court structure that should be used in the area of family law.  Despite their declared intent to do so, the commission have apparently, quietly and without announcement, dropped that as one of the areas of law they will review.  We <Col N="707" /> should deal with this area.  Possibly it should be dealt with in the context of the committee that is to be set up which I hope will be an all-party committee, despite what I have been reading in the press.  That committee will deal with the problems of family law and family life, particularly in the area of marriage.  This matter should not be left to the Law Reform Commission because I do not believe they are capable of dealing with it.  The final report the commission produced contained all sorts of extraordinary recommendations for reforming an area of family law on which the commission previously produced a working paper. The major part of the recommendations were rejected, quite rightly, by the former Minister.  He flew one or two kites suggesting he might accept them but ultimately they were rejected.  That is indicative of the failure of the Law Reform Commission to deal properly with family law problems.</P>
    <P>The other two committees that made comments relevant to the court system in dealing with family law include the task force on child care which is a report to the Department of Health in which there are recommendations for changing the District Court structure so far as it affects children's cases and law relating to children, in particular cases brought against children where the criminal law is involved and care proceedings where children have to be taken into care.  I urge the Minister not to create more overlapping court structures or to have a series of different types of court.  If we are to have a family court, which I hope we will, part of the duties of that court should be to deal with the various matters of law relating to children, which were referred to in the report of the task force.</P>
    <P>In welcoming the Bill in the context of the appointment of new judges to the High Court, it is still the position that to become a member of the Judiciary in the High Court &mdash; and here I disagree with my colleague, Deputy Birmingham &mdash; the legislation specifies that the person must have been a practising barrister of at least ten years standing.  There are few other qualifications attached to it.  If we <Col N="708" /> are talking about the possibility of establishing a unified family court system, I draw the attention of the Minister of State to a report by a working party which was set up in the Department of Health in 1976 on non-accidental injuries to children which looked at the question of the courts system.  It made the recommendation that judges appointed to courts responsible for children's cases should have some training in the area of family problems and child care.  If we bring in a family court structure I hope a similar requirement will be applied to it.</P>
    <P>This Bill by providing two new judges will provide some relief in the courts, particularly in the criminal and civil areas.  In the area of family law it is a holding operation and is merely continuing what we have, although it may be speeded up.  I hope the Courts Act, 1981 passed last May, will be amended to remove the custody jurisdiction it intends to transfer to the District Court from that court and reinstate it in the High Court. There is much merit in the Circuit Court having additional jurisdiction pending the provision of some family court structure because it will make justice in the courts available to people living outside Dublin who do not have easy access to the High Court.  It is essential that High Court jurisdiction be reinstated.  If it is not, there may well be sound reasons for suggesting that the 1981 Act is unconstitutional having regard to Article 34 of the Constitution which confers on that court unlimited jurisdiction in dealing with all matters.</P>
    <P>The fact that this is a problem has been highlighted by the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981 which was passed on 21 June and came into force on 21 July.  This legislation was intended to increase the protection available for battered wives.  It amended the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 and in so doing conferred jurisdiction explicitly on both the District Court and the Circuit Court to make barring orders to protect battered wives and husbands.  It enabled the court to exclude from the family home any spouse whose behaviour had a detrimental effect on the safety and welfare <Col N="709" /> of the other spouse or children.  The flaw in the 1981 Act is that it contains no reference to the High Court having jurisdiction which it formerly had under section 72 of the 1976 Act.  The effect has been that many High Court Judges take the view that they do not have power to make barring orders to provide protection for battered wives.  Some judges refuse to make these orders and try to make alternative ones which do not afford the protection the 1981 Act intended to make available.  I had hoped that this difficulty would have been dealt with in this Bill.  It is a matter that requires to be dealt with urgently.  The Minister should introduce legislation to deal with it together with matters arising out of the Courts Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>Another problem in relation to High Court jurisdiction is the manner in which these cases are dealt with.  Family law cases are held in private.  There are many such cases going through the courts.  In 1980 approximately 1,000 family law actions were instituted in the High Court. From July 1979 to July 1980 there were 2,500.  The vast majority were disputes between husbands and wives whose marriages had irretrievably broken down. There were also cases of disputes about children being placed for adoption or adoptive parents seeking to have adoption orders finalised.  The general public are totally unaware of the manner in which these cases are dealt with by the courts, of the volume of cases and the problems attached to such cases in so far as the manner in which they are dealt with and the judgments delivered often highlight deficiencies and inadequacies in the statute law.  Family law matters, marital problems and adoption problems should be dealt with in private and the parties involved should have an assurance that in no circumstances will their difficulties become public knowledge or will they be identified.  In no circumstances should we allow the type of scurrilous court reporting which appears in some journals in countries outside this country.</P>
    <P>There is need for balance.  We need to provide, not only to the public but to the legal profession, information concerning the type of decisions reached and the <Col N="710" /> manner in which cases are dealt with. When we read the newspapers we can see that High Court cases are reported in different areas of law from road traffic cases to constitutional cases but family law is rarely reported.  It is one of the biggest areas of law going through the courts.  The public have a right to know what is happening in this area.  The manner in which the privacy rule has developed has made life more comfortable for members of the house in so far as there is little publicity attached to the judgments delivered and the manner in which the law operates.  This means there is little public demand for law reform because the only people who understand the inadequacies of the system are those in the courts.  They are so involved in solving their own problems that they cannot be expected to start crusades for reform to deal with inadequate laws particularly after their proceedings have been resolved.  We need to develop a system where judgments delivered in family cases can be made available to court reporters in a manner in which there is no possibility of the identity of the parties being made known but, at the same time, the public know what is happening. The healthy effect of this can be seen in the one or two cases which have become public knowledge.  We all know the outrage and uproar which resulted from the McL adoption case some years ago when the result of that case and the judgments delivered were published in the press while maintaining the anonymity of the parties involved.  The need for law reform became apparent because of the publication as a result of which so much pressure was put on the Government of the day that, even if they had not the will to introduce reforming legislation, they would have had to do so.  I believe that Government had the will. Nevertheless I have no doubt that the great public reaction to that case forced into this House a legislative measure that otherwise would have taken a good deal longer to come before it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In this context it is important that we find a balance not only in the context of the High Court but of the other courts also and that the general public are made aware of the manner in which our law operates and the effect it is having on people in the real world.  I urge the Minister to have another look at this problem.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment on only one other area in relation to the High Court.  It is not appropriate under this Bill to go into it in any great detail, but it should be mentioned.  We are often told that justice delayed is no justice at all.  Because of emergencies not only in the family but in other areas also, people often need quick access to our courts, including the High Court, to seek emergency relief in different areas of life.  After much delay and after a case before the European Court and the production of another report &mdash; the Pringle Report which was largely ignored &mdash; the previous Administration introduced a non-statutory scheme of civil legal aid for those unable to afford legal fees.  It is not appropriate in the context of this Bill to become involved in the general inadequacies of that scheme, but I feel that one or two points should be made in so far as they relate to the High Court, with which this Bill is designed to deal.  It should be on the record of this House that the scheme as it stands is totally inadequate.  At present it does not provide the facility for people to have emergency access to the High Court, due to the delay in processing applications for legal aid, and the centres that exist at present are so inundated with work that some of them have virtually closed their doors on new work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some areas of law &mdash; for example, adoption &mdash; I have come across instances lately where the Legal Aid Board failed to provide legal aid within sufficient time to ensure that the rights of the applicants concerned were protected properly.  It is not appropriate to name individuals or cases that could be identified.  Particularly in the area of adoption, it is essential <Col N="712" /> that the adoptive parents, for instance, or a mother seeking to regain custody of a child placed for a short period for adoption, make application for legal aid in order that they may be represented legally.  The only court in which these proceedings can be heard at present is the High Court.  I have little doubt that the manner in which the legal aid centres have dealt with some of these applications has prejudiced greatly the chances of success of those people who sought legal assistance from that scheme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announced intention to review the whole workings of the legal aid scheme as established.  As I predicted when the scheme was first set up, it is now effectively collapsing.  I hope that we can introduce a statutory scheme within a short time that will ensure people's legal right of access to the courts.  This scheme can be amended by ministerial order as opposed to legislation. This is relevant in the context of the High Court, and this court has original jurisdiction in determining all constitutional cases.  No doubt the new judges to be appointed under the Bill before us will find themselves dealing with constitutional actions.  For reasons best known to the former Minister it is not possible under the existing legal aid scheme to obtain legal aid from that scheme in a constitutional action.  I am aware of instances in which applicants whose means clearly qualified them for legal aid under the scheme were turned down because the action they were to bring was of a constitutional nature.  If the scheme remains as it is and if that aspect of it is not amended quickly &mdash; and I hope it can be amended by ministerial order even pending the introduction of a statutory scheme &mdash; I have very little doubt that this country will have the ignominy of facing a further case before the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg due to the fact that legal aid is not available in this country for the defence of fundamental rights of a constitutional nature before our courts.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as a measure which will provide some interim relief.  I reiterate that I hope, particularly in areas of family law, that we will have a fundaat <Col N="713" /> mental re-examination of the problems and provide a structure more coherent and unified than we have at the moment. In so doing we will take away some of the pressure that exists on all three branches of our courts at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has the acclaim of everybody in this House in that the main intention of it is to increase the number of High Court judges.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment on the situation in regard to the courthouses throughout the country.  My colleague has just mentioned a courthouse in his constituency. I would like to draw the attention of the House to some of the areas where High Court cases are held.  I am thinking particularly of Galway, where I had business some weeks back.  I was at the High Court there and I was appalled at the situation. High Court cases in which awards of £100,000 or £250,000 or more are made are heard before a judge from Dublin.  I was interested to hear a judge commenting that he was having difficulty in hearing what was taking place.  The situation, particularly with regard to acoustics, in that courthouse in Galway is unsatisfactory. There is no such thing as a consultation room and consultations are held outside in the halls, on the street and at the back of the courtroom itself.  All in all the situation is unsatisfactory and it has not improved in the last ten years.</P>
      <P>Most of the courthouses in this country are unsatisfactory and unsuitable for their purpose and in this day and age they are a disgrace to our society.  That is the situation obtaining in a certain number of our courthouses, at District Court, Circuit Court and indeed High Court level.  It is particularly difficult for elderly people in such courtrooms, perhaps people who have never been in court before.  They find they cannot hear what is going on, they are sitting in cold courtrooms where the acoustics are very bad and the overall accommodation unsatisfactory. In this day and age our society should be able to provide proper facilities for the hearing of court cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give our courthouses priority.  At present resposibility for them is divided among the <Col N="714" /> local authorities, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Justice. Inevitably where there is divided responsibility an unsatisfactory situation obtains.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to assume absolute responsibility in his Department for our courthouse accommodation.  I know it involves a considerable task but he is a young man with much energy and I would prefer to see him tackle the problem than many others.</P>
    <P>I am amazed to read that, even with the situation obtaining, the number of cases continues to increase and that the time lag between the setting down of a jury action and the actual date of hearing can be as much as 20 months.  The provision of additional judges may or may not prove to be helpful in obviating the present backlog, but it is a step in the right direction.  The Minister has said that something of the order of 3,653 cases were heard in the year ended 31 July last. As far as I am aware, there are something like 4,000 cases awaiting hearing at present, which constitutes a huge backlog. The system operating is particularly unfair to poorer people.  At present there can be a timelag of four to five years between the date on which an accident or wrongdoing takes place and the date of hearing of that case.  Something must be done in an effort to remedy that entirely unsatisfactory situation and speed up the whole process.</P>
    <P>I should like to touch on the situation with regard to the list system as it applies in both the Circuit Court and High Court. In the case of the Circuit Court a list is issued to all of the solicitors and barristers in that court area.  Normally all of the cases are listed for hearing on the first morning.  The majority of people turn up on the first morning, when the cases are then allocated for the coming week.  Usually what happens is that doctors, solicitors, barristers, engineers and other witnesses, including the litigants themselves, arrive the first morning.  Cases may be put back and these people may be there for two, three or four days.  This is not good enough.  A common-sense arrangement should be arrived at, through the county registrar, with the solicitors and <Col N="715" /> barristers on both sides so that at least opposing solicitors can inform the county registrar when they expect a particular case to be heard.  Common sense should be used in an endeavour to avoid these backlogs and the inconvenience caused so many people.</P>
    <P>The situation obtaining in the High Court is totally unsatisfactory also.  I am constantly amazed to see the situation affecting so many of our best brain, heart and other surgeons called as witnesses in the High Court.  The solicitor who may be calling a particular surgeon as a witness may telephone him on a Thursday to say: &ldquo;The case in which you are a witness may be heard on next Tuesday or Wednesday.&rdquo;  That surgeon then endeavours to arrange his operations a week in advance.  The next thing that happens is that on the following Tuesday the solicitor realises that that case will not be heard on the Tuesday and he telephones the surgeon to inform him saying: &ldquo;It looks now as though it will be heard on Thursday.&rdquo; But because of a backlog on the Thursday the solicitor must telephone him again and say: &ldquo;I am sorry, that case will not be heard now until next Tuesday.&rdquo; I would hope that that situation could be remedied in some way, thus obviating the inconvenience caused so many people.  I have seen people waiting for two days in the Four Courts for their cases to come up.  All of this means that there is expense involved for everybody. Hopefully the Minister would arrange immediate consultations with the President of the High Court, the Chief Justice, senior officials of his Department and some of the senior people from the Incorporated Law Society.  Indeed the Minister should chair such a meeting to ascertain if the situation can be remedied.  It is not an insurmountable problem.  Something can and must be done to alleviate the situation.  Because of the apparent haphazard system of having cases heard, the law is brought into disrepute.  The Bar Council, the Incorporated Law Society, the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court, together with the Department, must find a remedy for this problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="716" /> I have a proposal to put to the Minister this evening.  I live in Laois-Offaly.  As the House is aware, the main prison in this country is situated in the town of Portlaoise.  I travel to Dublin a number of times a week.  Because of the Special Criminal Court being situated in Dublin at times one finds oneself being overtaken on the road by a convoy of squad cars, Army trucks, jeeps, armoured cars, the lot, bringing defendants to Dublin. In my view these convoys constitute a danger to other people using the roads because of the speed at which they manoeuvre in and out of the traffic.  There are three factors involved here.  The first is the safety, one which is of paramount importance to people using the roads. There is then the cost factor to the State, also of importance; and the security factor, which is again of importance to the State.  There is all this high speed driving involving defendants, drivers and so on. Would the Minister consider a Special Criminal Court sitting in, perhaps, Portlaoise? The present courthouse there is not satisfactory but it is quite feasible that a satisfactory courthouse could be provided in the town or its vicinity, in close proximity to the prison.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Minister's anxiety regarding the attendance of solicitors, barristers and expert witnesses.  In that regard, there is an excellent train service between Portlaoise and Dublin of which the professional people could avail, or special arrangements could be made, if necessary.  This would avoid danger on the roads, be less costly and provide a speedier and safer method of having the cases heard.  It would not cause any inconvenience in Portlaoise, although the feelings and anxieties of the local people would have to be taken into account.  The Minister has not had a chance to consider properly this highly desirable addition to our courthouses and I would ask him to do so now.  If he wishes to discuss the matter with me at further length, I will be very happy to do so.</P>
    <P>This is my first opportunity of speaking in the House since the Minister of State was appointed to the Department of Justice. I hope that he will be in that post for a long number of years and I wish him <Col N="717" /> every happiness in his office.  I also wish this Bill a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  I join with my colleague in welcoming the Minister of State to the House, particularly with this legislation and wish him well in his very interesting position.  The responsibility for law reform is a very challenging one, but the Minister of State will acquit himself very well in his task. As he knows by now, there is a great lot of work to be done, much of which is not only desirable but urgent.  However, before we can begin speaking about law reform in any real sense we must look at the ordinary administration of our courts at present.  I welcome this Bill very much. One could go in depth into the courts system as it works at present but I said that I would be brief and brief I will be. I hope, by being brief, that the couple of points which I will make will be considered very carefully by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the House passed legislation increasing the jurisdiction of the lower courts.  It was said that this was part of a drive to overcome the massive arrears which had built up in the High Court.  At that time it was indicated that additional facilities would be made available to the lower courts and that courthouses would be improved and the office and court staff of the lower courts extended.  If my recollection is correct, that legislation was delayed for one year to enable these physical reforms to be carried out.  I have not seen, at first hand, any of these reforms undertaken so far and I would like the Minister's assurance that the work involved is being undertaken. If the greater jurisdiction being given to the District and Circuit Courts comes into effect before the facilities are improved, a massive problem will develop in the lower courts which will be far more difficult to solve than those in the High Court at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expressed the view at the time, and I still maintain, that that was not the proper way to overcome the problem of High Court arrears.  Work which it was believed should be dealt with by the High Court should be dealt with by it.  If there <Col N="718" /> is a shortage of judges and of improved facilities in the High Court, the number of judges should be increased and the facilities improved.  Although the measure which the Minister has brought forward this evening will go some way towards helping to solve the problem, I cannot see it solving it completely.  The Minister should consider immediately increasing the number of judges in the High Court even further.  Even when the jurisdiction of the High Court has been somewhat relieved by the increased jurisdiction of the lower courts a situation may not arise where one serving a notice of trial of a High Court action can expect a trial within three or four months.  Any longer than that is justice delayed for a litigant and this we should not tolerate.</P>
    <P>Our entire judicial system, so far as the High Court is concerned, traditionally has been centralised in Dublin.  In recent years the High Court has sat in provincial centres such as Cork, Limerick and Galway, to great effect.  Unfortunately, these centres became so popular that they have serious arrears problems building up. Would the Minister consider urgently the establishment of at least one permanent provincial High Court, let it be in Cork, Limerick or Galway?  Put it south or west, but away from Dublin, and make it permanent. In relation to two or three other court centres which will not have the benefit or advantage of a permanent sitting, the sitting which takes place twice a year should be extended and if necessary an increased number of judges brought in for the currency of the sittings. The work which is put down for hearing at the sittings will then be disposed of.  It is quite intolerable that cases are put down which may not be listed because judges are not available, or time is not given to deal with the amount of work before these courts.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Enright has pointed out, it is desirable, from the point of view of professional witnesses, litigants and legal practitioners, that this work be dispatched in an efficient manner.  That is not happening at the moment, which is to our discredit.  I want to stress the importance of a further increase in the number of High Court judges and the <Col N="719" /> establishment of at least one permanent provincial court sitting.</P>
    <P>Finally &mdash; and I hope I am not going outside the terms of the Bill &mdash; in the administration of our court system we are very inefficient in some respects, probably because of tradition and because we have not been flexible or willing to consider changes which we should have considered as business grew upon us.  In the central office of the High Court at present if one wishes to file pleadings or formal legal notices one must present oneself in person &mdash; either the solicitor or his agent &mdash; to deliver these documents.  It seems extraordinary that the central office of the High Court does not realise that we have a postal service.  Though the postal service may not always be as efficient as we would like it to be, I would ask the Minister to request the central office of the High Court to accept pleadings and formal legal notices by post.  In so far as legal personnel and their staff are concerned, I find it hard to accept that any great additional burden would be placed on the central office staff.  Perhaps the matter has been considered already and had been rejected for some reason.  I do not expect the Minister to be able to give me an answer to that when replying to this debate but perhaps he will communicate with me in some other way.</P>
    <P>I believe that the structures of our courts, particularly the lower courts around the country, need to be looked at.  When the last Minister for Justice introduced the Bill increasing the jurisdiction of the District Court I had hoped that his reforms would include the provision of proper courthouses and court facilities throughout the country.  That has not happened and there is no obvious hope of it happening by the time the new jurisdiction will come into effect.  It is disgraceful that litigants, particularly those involved in family law type litigation, have to tolerate the facilities that exist at the moment.  Members of the Garda must tolerate appalling conditions and they are expected to work in such conditions.  Many gardaí spend a great deal of their time waiting for cases to come on without proper consulting <Col N="720" /> rooms or waiting rooms.  The courts frequently are held in community halls or old buildings which are draughty, damp and very uncomfortable.  If we are to increase the jurisdiction of our lower courts we should have those courts fitted out with the dignity one would expect of legal administration.  I welcome the Bill which I hope is the first step only in much needed reform in our court system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the contributions made by the Deputies who saw fit to be here for the moving of Second Stage.  One point which emerged throughout the contributions is that there is a necessity for this Bill which increases the number of High Court judges.  A second point which emerges is that there is general dissatisfaction at the delays from the time of the setting down of trials to their actual hearing, and the general administration of court actions.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies referred to the implementation of the Courts Act, 1981, which is due to come into effect on 12 May, 1982.  I should like to clarify what seems to be a misapprehension that the wheels were set in motion through which certain things would take place in the course of the 12 months between the passing of the 1981 Act and its coming into operation. Deputy Collins asked for the position to be clarified as to whether I have reservations about the implementation of that Act in May 1982.  I have already stated publicly, and it is the feeling of those in the profession, that the implementation of the Act in May 1982 in itself would be a cosmetic exercise particularly the part of it relating to family law and the transfer of jurisdiction to the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain provisions in that Act are very welcome.  I would particularly mention the raising of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in tort matters to £15,000. Anybody familiar with the working of our courts must appreciate that the sum of £2,000 for tort actions in the Circuit Court had become outdated.  Deputy Taylor suggested that in monetary terms our jurisdiction should be index-linked or at least reviewed every three or four years so that we would not have to change <Col N="721" /> the monetary levels of our jurisdiction. In this matter the jurisdiction had been there for ten years.</P>
    <P>In the matter of family law, anybody who has attended a District Court in rural Ireland will appreciate that in matters of custody our District Courts as at present constituted are not geared to cater for custodial matters in family law.  Until certain steps have been taken, the Minister for Justice and I are satisfied that these custodial matters should be dealt with in the manner in which they are being dealt with up to now and until then as far as District Court jurisdiction is concerned the provisions of the 1981 Act will not be introduced.</P>
    <P>When I consider the concern expressed about delays in the hearing of actions, I am glad I am not the architect of those delays or in any way responsible for them.  It is obvious that there is a great demand for the elimination of those delays.  I accept that Deputy Collins tried a remedy in 1979, but, the fact that we are here now debating this Bill makes it obvious that his remedy was not altogether successful.  We must tackle the problem, and our decision to increase the number of High Court judges is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Points were made about the courthouse accommodation and I should like to clarify the situation.  Before the recent destruction of Courtroom No. 4 there were ten courtrooms available exclusively for High Court business.  One High Court judge sits in the Special Criminal Court in Green Street Courthouse and one courtroom is shared with the Dublin Circuit Court.  At the moment, therefore, it is possible, in the absence of Mr. Justice Keane, to accommodate 11 judges, including the President, at High Court sittings in Dublin.  If, however, additional judges are appointed, they could be accommodated because, for various reasons, courtrooms are free for 15 to 20 weeks of the working year as a result of the absence of judges on the spring and autumn sittings of the High Court on Circuit, each of which lasts four weeks, while the Cork jury sittings, which are held in January, March and July, account for a further seven weeks.  Courtrooms <Col N="722" /> are also available when judges are working in their chambers on preparation of judgments, vetting transcripts of cases, writing notes on cases appealed to the High Court or studying relevant papers for sittings of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  When the Court of Criminal Appeal, which is comprised of the Chief Justice and two High Court judges, is sitting and when divisional courts hearing State side matters such as <i>habeas corpus, certiorari, mandamus</i> and prohibition are sitting.  There is provision for the hearing of these cases by divisional courts of the High Court consisting of three judges.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I understand that at the moment the President of the High Court is looking at the possibility of having High Court sittings at alternative locations. This indicates that even without further courthouse accommodation, which I admit would be desirable particularly with the increase in the number of judges, there will be an improvement.  The facilities are available and will be available at various times.  My personal view is that judges, having sat on cases for periods of days or weeks, should be allowed time to research their judgments and deliver them as expeditiously as possible so that we will not have a situation when, because of pressure of work, judges would have to get back to work in court much more quickly than would be necessary or desirable.  If they were allowed to prepare and deliver their judgments as quickly as possible, we would not have the problem of delayed judgments.</P>
    <P>A point was raised on the location of the High Court in various centres throughout the country. Deputy Collins stated his reservations about siting the High Court in Naas.  It is not a case of siting the High Court in Naas to get it out of Dublin, or any reason like that.  Due to its proximity to the Four Courts, it is considered that we could have sittings on a regular basis in Naas without any great disruption of court business in the Four Courts.  I agree with Deputy Collins that it is desirable that the High Court should be taken to the people, rather than having the people travelling to the High Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> We are all aware of the great inconvenience caused.  Delays are caused to expert witnesses, engineers, surgeons, mappers, and so on, who travel from the country to the High Court in Dublin. They are not sure that the case will be heard on that particular day.  Great inconvenience is caused to the litigants, the expert witnesses and the people depending on their services in their native towns.  Deputy Collins claimed credit for commissioning the renovation of the court building in Tralee.  There was a certain amount of short sightedness because, having only one jury box, it would not be suitable for a sitting of the High Court.  I can assure the Deputy this matter will get urgent attention.</P>

      <P>After all, I come from the country.  The appointment of solicitors to the Bench was raised.  While it is not within the ambit of this Bill, it is worthy of comment.  It is an idea with very far-reaching consequences and it should be tackled by members of the Bar Council and by the solicitors' profession.  I would have no hesitation in complying with the suggestion made by Deputy Collins.  If we are to look at the question of appointing solicitors to the High Court, the whole question of the legal profession, solicitors and barristers, should be looked at from the point of view of the litigants and whether the service provided by a split profession is the best.</P>
      <P>As a member of one of the professions, I have absolutely no reservations about welcoming any discussions between both bodies.  I am sure my Department would facilitate both bodies in every way possible. This question must be considered against the background of access to justice and whether the litigants are getting the best value for money when they take a case to court.  I would have neither reservation nor hesitation in opening any discussions with both professions on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Enright talked about the disadvantages <Col N="724" /> of having the Special Criminal Court in Dublin.  I do not consider it feasible to hold a sitting of the Special Criminal Court outside Dublin for basic reasons.  The Judiciary are almost completely based in Dublin.  Most of the members working in the Special Criminal Court are based in Dublin.  There is also the fact that the Special Criminal Court can sit five or six days a week and, at times, it has to sit at short notice on Saturday.  This would not be facilitated by a sitting of that court in Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molony talked about serving pleadings and lodging papers in the central office of the High Court.  This matter is worth looking at because of the change in mobility, and because of the rule stipulating that one had to have a town agent within two miles of the High Court to serve proceedings.  That rule may be outdated and it is worth looking at.</P>
    <P>Many of the points raised were not within the ambit of the Bill, which proposes to raise the number of High Court judges by two, which we all accept is necessary.  I would ask members of the Opposition in fairness to allow time to see how it develops, coupled with the implementation of the increase in jurisdiction, so that the problem of delays can be tackled seriously.  Those delays are not acceptable to any Member of this House. Deputy Sherlock said he came across many instances in which he felt the delays were caused by the practitioners.  Cases were set down and because the system was clogged up they could not be taken. I commend the Bill to the House.  The points raised will be considered and we will report back at a later stage.</P>

      <P>I apologise for not clarifying that point when I mentioned the possibility of setting up a court in Naas. That matter is receiving active consideration from the point of view of bringing the High Court to the litigants rather than having the litigants coming to the court. <Col N="725" /> It can be said fairly that the delays are distributed throughout the Dublin area and the rural areas and any remedy must be implemented equitably in both situations.</P>

      <P>On the question of the prospective transfer of the High Court to Naas or Cork, has the Minister engaged in consultations with the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council and other interested parties?  I agree that the litigants are the priority in any legal action.  On the question of the fire in Court No. 4 in the Four Courts, is the Minister aware that an increase in the number of judges will not reduce the number of cases on the list?  Unless Court No. 4 is rehabilitated as a matter of urgency, justice will continue to be denied to those litigants who want it at its freshest.</P>

Anything else would be totally undesirable and unworkable. Representations have been received from the solicitors' profession with a view to setting up a High Court in Cork.  On the question of Court No. 4, I can assure the Deputy that its reconstruction is regarded as a matter of urgency by the Department.  We realise the difficulties the burning of that court is causing and it will be repaired with all possible expedition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) For the purpose of an investigation under subsection (2) (d) the Council shall have discretion as to the manner in which the investigation shall be carried out and in particular may carry out the investigation wholly or partly in public and the Council or a person authorised by the Council (in this section referred to as an authorised person) may&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  enter at all reasonable times and inspect any land or building,</P>
      <P>(b)  take on to land or into a building any person or equipment and examine, test or take samples of any thing,</P>
      <P>(c)  by notice in writing require any person to give any relevant information or produce plans or documents and for such purpose to attend and to give evidence before the Council or an authorised person, and</P>
      <P>(d)  take evidence on oath and for that purpose administer an oath.</P>
      <P>(4) Any person who&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  refuses entry to any land or <Col N="728" /> building for the purpose of this section, or</P>
    <P>(b)  obstructs or impedes the Council or an authorised person in the exercise of the powers conferred by subsection (3) *, or</P>
    <P>(c)  fails or refuses to comply with any requirement of the Council or an authorised person, or</P>
    <P>(d)  wilfully or recklessly gives to the Council or an authorised person any information which is false or misleading in a material respect,</P>
    <P>shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, a number of Deputies urged me to consider giving the council powers to conduct inspections, require the attendance of persons and take evidence on oath for an investigation of fire or other incident under subsection 2(d) of section 16 and that provision should be made for public hearings.  I carefully examined all the points made by the Deputies and, in response, I put down the amendment before you and which I believe answers the criticisms made.  The amendment gives the council itself or a person conducting an investigation on their behalf, power to enter lands or buildings at any reasonable hour and conduct an inspection.  They may also take other persons or equipment with them and are being given power to carry out any necessary tests or to take samples for testing.  They will also have power to compel a person to provide information or documentation relevant to the investigation and to require a person to give evidence on oath, if necessary.</P>
    <P>While the council will be free to decide how they should carry out their investigation they will also have discretion to decide whether all or part of it should be held in public.  As I stressed on Committee Stage, if there is need for a full-scale public judicial inquiry, the powers under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921-1979, can be availed of, as they were in the case of the Whiddy and Stardust tribunals.  It should be remembered also that, in view of the obligations imposed by section 18, in future more fires are likely to come under scrutiny by the <Col N="729" /> courts.  While this amendment gives the council discretion to conduct the investigation in their own way and to determine procedures to be followed.  I must emphasise that it it is my belief and intention that the power of investigation given to a council should be used as informally as possible.  I expect the council will get the co-operation of people connected with incidents being investigated and the powers which the amendment seeks to confer should be regarded as reserve powers only to be used when absolutely necessary. I hope this amendment meets the points raised by various Deputies on both sections 16 and 22.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the change of heart by the Minister.  I am glad he took the opportunity of the week's delay from Committee to Report Stages to reconsider the stand which he took on Committee Stage debate on the previous amendment.  This is a vast improvement and meets many of the arguments we made in the four-hour session when we discussed his original proposals included in amendment No. 12 on Committee Stage.  Our argument then was that the type of investigation to be carried out by the Fire Services Council, as envisaged in the amendment, was far too weak and left too many loopholes with regard to inquiries.  This new power now envisaged by the Minister is much stronger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister and the Government have had an opportunity to consider the situation, is the Minister yet in a position to say what type of inquiry will be held into the Bundoran fire?  We discussed the Bundoran tragedy at great length on Committee Stage and it was regrettable that the Minister was unable to confirm commitments made in the past, when his party were in opposition, with regard to holding a public inquiry into the tragedy. The Minister has gone so far to meet the wishes of the Fianna Fáil Party with regard to the amendment on Report Stage that he should go the rest of the way and let us know which form of inquiry is to be used in the investigation of the Bundoran tragedy.  The argument repeatedly put forward by the Minister on Committee Stage was that pending <Col N="730" /> the passing of this legislation through The Dáil and Seanad and signing by the President and the setting up of the council, he would stay his hand with regard to the type of inquiry to be set up.</P>
    <P>The Minister has come forward with this type of amendment which calls for witnesses and evidence under oath.  This is similar to the tribunal of inquiry to be set up up under the 1921 Act.  Would the Minister care to comment on what type of inquiry there will be?  On Committee Stage we argued this point at great length and the Minister should give us this information. What will be the tribunal's terms of reference?  Who will chair it?  On what date will it first sit?  The Minister made the point that in his view the need for a public inquiry is not now so urgent because of the time lag since the tragedy. However, I do not share that view because it has been revealed that there was a leak of part of the Garda report and there is a sense of unease in the public mind because there are other reports available on file which are not available to the public.  I ask the Minister to release this information.</P>
    <P>I do not want to spend this evening discussing the need for an inquiry into the Bundoran tragedy, although this comes under this amendment which says:</P>
    <P>(3) For the purpose of an investigation under subsection (2) (d) the Council shall have discretion as to the manner in which the investigation shall be carried out and in particular may carry out the investigation wholly or partly in public and the Council or a person authorised by the Council (in this section referred to as an authorised person) may&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) enter at all reasonable times and inspect any land or building.</P>
    <P>We argued that a discretion similar to the power envisaged in the Bill for the staff of fire authorities should be extended to the council and its staff and agents.  I am glad the Minister accepts our point and has included in this amendment which reads: &ldquo;the Council shall have discretion as to the manner in which the investigation shall be carried out&rdquo;.  Will the council <Col N="731" /> be totally independent of the Minister? On Committee Stage the Minister's amendment No. 12 to section 16 read:</P>
    <P>16.&mdash;(1) The Minister may by order establish a body which shall be known as the Fire Services Council (in this section referred to as the Council) to perform such services for or on behalf of the Minister or fire authorities as he may specify from time to time.</P>
    <P>In section 1 we are talking about the investigations carried out on the Minister's behalf from time to time.  New section 3 says &ldquo;the Council shall have discretion as to the manner in which the investigation shall be carried out&rdquo;.  Will the council be totally independent and carry out investigations without instructions from the Minister?  Will they carry out investigations with the co-operation of the Minister?  How does the Minister see section 1 and new section 3 sitting together?</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the public aspect of these inquiries.  In this amendment it says that the council &ldquo;may carry out the investigation wholly or partly in public and the Council or a person authorised by the Council...&rdquo;  Fianna Fáil will be asking for the Bundoran fire tragedy inquiry to be held wholly in public, whether it is set up under the 1921 Act or under this council.  All inquiries by this council into any tragedy or disaster, whether fire, flood or any other tragedy, should be held in public.  The Bill envisages that the fire authorities will not only be active in the area of fires but also in the performance of other duties.  Section 25 says:</P>
    <P>A fire authority may carry out or assist in any operations of an emergency nature, whether or not a risk of fire is involved, and a fire authority may accordingly make such provision for the rescue or safeguarding of persons and protection of property as it considers necessary for the purposes of that function.</P>
    <P>An emergency situation can cover a train crash, a building collapsing and many other different types of tragedy and in such cases the public have a right to know what happened.  There should not be <Col N="732" /> even a suspicion of an attempt by bureaucracy to hide details of tragedies from the public and that is why investigations by this council should be held in public at all times.  While there might be only one person involved in a tragedy, his family, neighbours and the community at large have as much right to know the full details of what happened that night as the families of people involved in a tragedy where 30 or 40 lives were lost.  I ask the Minister to accept that the need for public accountability is vital in investigations into tragedies.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment in paragraph (a) about entering at all reasonable times to inspect any land or building, is a step forward and an indication that he has accepted the arguments put forward by this side of the House.  The same applies to paragraph (b) in the Minister's amendment.  It is along the lines of the points argued by this side of the House and by Deputy Mervyn Taylor on the Government side.  This brings me to the question of funding of the Fire Services Council.  Taking on these powers will involve the Fire Services Council in recruiting advisers and experts when investigating any tragedy.  That means manpower and money.  We all accept that the Bill, a comprehensive piece of legislation, reorganises the fire service, sets out general obligations with regard to fire safety and involves a change from fire fighting to fire prevention.  In this area of fire prevention it will be necessary to employ experts and additional staff.  It will also be necessary to retrain existing staff That leads me to the embargo of last July on the employment of additional staff in the public service.</P>
    <P>When the Committee Stage debate commenced the Minister gave as an assurance that there would be no problem with regard to staff for the operation of the provisions in the Bill.  He gave that categoric assurance but on the second day the Bill was discussed that assurance was somewhat watered down and the Minister was less than positive.  The last thing we need at this stage is legislation that will not be implemented.  There is a legitimate demand from the public for a reorganisation of the fire fighting services, <Col N="733" /> not only fire fighting but fire prevention also.  That demand has arisen because of the concern that has developed following the tragedies that occurred in the last two years.  It is possible that all political parties have been lax in the past with regard to a commitment to the fire service, recognising that there were demands for the development of other services such as libraries, roads and so on.  As a result the fire services did not get the attention they should have from all political parties, but it has now received a commitment in the form of this Bill and to the extent that we have the task force under the Fire Prevention Council operating, and the new building regulations operating without legal force but operating in most local authority areas.  Those improvements in safety and standards are welcome but when we pass this legislation our citizens will expect, rightly, that the Government will be serious about this business and will put the various provisions in the Bill into operation.</P>
    <P>I should like an assurance from the Minister that he will employ whatever extra personnel are necessary to implement fully all the provisions in the Bill. We want to see the fire authorities operating; we want to see the transfers involved and we want to see all authorities involving themselves in the area of fire prevention.  On Committee Stage the Minister moved an amendment, which we accepted, concerning fire hydrants. That definition of a fire hydrant in section 2 is a commitment by the Oireachtas that when the hydrant is erected it will be inspected by the local authorities and the fire personnel of those authorities.  It is vitally important in the event of a fire that firemen are able to go to a site and be sure that the hydrant is in working order.  Inspection of such hydrants involves manpower and overtime.  It involves money and a commitment by the Government to employ additional manpower. The operations of the Fire Services Council also involve considerable expense.</P>
    <P>I will not accept a reply from the Minister to the effect that the staff will be made available.  I expect that he will put <Col N="734" /> forward a clarification, such as he did in the case of Tallaght station, that that station is being manned as part of the overall manning level of the local authority in which it is sited.  Therefore, the overall manning level is not increased by the new service.  In fact, it is being reduced by the number of firemen necessary to man that new station.  As a result some other section of that authority suffers, whether it is road sweepers, maintenance men on housing estates, those involved in maintaining public parks or those involved in the construction of footpaths and roads.  The overall manning level is reduced by the manpower necessary to staff that station.  It is right that the fire station should be manned but it should not be done at the expense of some other service in the local authority area.  That is why I want an assurance from the Minister that in implementing the provisions of this legislation the manpower involved will be additional to what is in existence already. I accept that there may be room for reorganisation &mdash; there is always room for improvement and productivity in any service, even one as efficient as some of our fire services are &mdash; but I want a commitment that once the Bill is passed the Government will not adopt the attitude that that ends their commitment to the fire service.  I hope the Government do not hold that the passing of the legislation will cover any criticisms from the general public or that in reply to questions in the House they will say that they are examining the Act now that it has been passed. We are all aware of the bureaucratic and political delays that can occur but I want to hear the Minister say that there will be no such delay in this case.  The legislation is too important to allow it to suffer from the Scrooge mentality of the Department of Finance.  I accept the goodwill of the Minister when he says that this will not happen but I should like him to realise that in his battle with the Department of Finance he will have not only us on his side but also the full support of the general public who, legitimately, are concerned about the inadequacies of our fire protection and prevention services. Many of those inadequacies will be put <Col N="735" /> right by the full implementation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs (c) and (d) of subsection (3) represent a very important acceptance by the Minister of the points made by us during Committee Stage.  These provisions which relate to the production of relevant information, plans or documents as well as to attendance for the purpose of giving evidence before the council and to the taking of evidence on oath are very important.  They are central to the credibility of the type of inquiry to be set up by the fire council and they remove from my mind any suspicion or doubt I had that the type of inquiry to be held might be less than searching or less than revealing.  If somebody refuses to give evidence that is required of him he will be guilty of an offence under the Act. The penalties in this regard are severe &mdash; £10,000 fine or two years in jail.  I assume that is the penalty that will be involved but that is not spelled our here. The other penalty is the £500 penalty and six months in jail.  The Minister might clarify which penalty is to apply in the event of lack of co-operation or refusal to co-operate with the inquiry.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the Minister realised the validity of the arguments we put forward in the long debate on Committee Stage.  This is a total justification, if such were necessary, for having a Committee Stage debate during which details of a Bill can be teased out.  Now that the Minister has gone so far I should like him to clarify the type of inquiry that is to be undertaken.  In both cases the inquiry is to be sworn but we should like to hear which type of inquiry will apply in this case.  In any event, the inquiry should be public.  While the Bill is going through the Seanad perhaps the Minister would amend it so as to exclude the words &ldquo;or partly&rdquo; and thereby ensure that investigations will be in public.  One can understand the need for some evidence being taken in private, perhaps technical evidence, but the need for a public inquiry is vital.  I welcome the amendment.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Burke, I welcome the Bill in its amended <Col N="736" /> form.  It is a valuable addition to the fire services system and to the operation of fire authorities.  I regret, however, that there remains in the Bill one provision that I can regard only as a retrogressive measure, a measure that so far as progressive thinking is concerned puts the clock back.  I refer to that measure which grants an immunity to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When we were discussing this Bill on Tuesday last I raised the matter that is being dealt with in this amendment.  At the time the Minister seemed to think that I was throwing water on the measure, so to speak.  It would be far from me to do anything of that kind. With due respect to the people who drafted the Bill, the section in question could not have been operated as drafted originally.  I stated at the time that the evidence that is called will not be on oath. I believe there will be a cloud over such evidence.  The Minister's amendment has improved the Bill and meets our requirements. The councils and corporations will need the necessary personnel to implement this Bill.  I do not believe they have the necessary personnel to do that and to inspect the many premises in their counties or corporations.  Last week the Minister stated that no additional personnel will be employed and that personnel for this work will only be employed if there is a retirement or if a person leaves that employment to go to other employment.</P>
      <P>This is the kernel of the Bill and of the amendment we are dealing with.  Subsection (3) (a) of the amendment states:</P>
      <P>Enter at all reasonable times and inspect any land or building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A vast number of people congregate in buildings, especially in the large urban areas.  When anything happens it is easy to throw around the blame and to say that the inspections were not carried out. When something happens it is the usual <Col N="737" /> cant to look for a scapegoat.  That is not good enough.  This side of the House will have to be assured that the necessary personnel are available.  In view of the embargo on additional employment imposed by the Minister for Finance, the Bill will be hampered.  A number of people engaged in this type of work have informed me that they have not sufficient personnel to enforce the Bill when it is passed.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see in subsection (3) (c) of the amendment that evidence will now be taken under oath.  As I stated last week, if evidence is not taken under oath the person involved might not attend a hearing and, even if the person attended the hearing, the evidence might leave a lot to be desired.  I have some reservations about an inquiry being held partly in public and partly in private.  It may leave it open to suspicion, if it is held in private, that there is some type of a cover up in regard to evidence.  It is hard to define what a major investigation is, because that is open to interpretation.  I do not want to get into the legal aspect of that.  If it is a major investigation like Bundoran or an inquiry of that nature, this would apply.  I believe a public inquiry should be held in respect of the Bundoran disaster.  I hope the Minister will give us an indication when that will take place.  The sooner that takes place the better from the public point of view. Subsection (4) (d) of the amendment states:</P>
    <P>wilfully or recklessly gives to the Council or an authorised person any information which is false or misleading in a material respect shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>I understand what the word &ldquo;offence&rdquo; means but will that be a fine of £5,000, £10,000, three months in jail, 12 months in jail, or both?  This is a very interesting point.  I would like the Minister to tell us what is the penalty for an offence of that nature.  If the penalty is not big enough it will not carry sufficient weight.  It is most important that the Minister should spell out clearly what is the amount involved.  I hope when the fire council are set up they will have sufficient personnel <Col N="738" /> to deal with an inquiry.  I hope they will not have to ask other consultant experts to help them.  If consultants are called in, this can cost thousands of pounds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the decision of the Government not to proceed as rapidly as possible with the programme already underway to decentralise Government offices in the following regions: Limerick, Ennis, Nenagh, Waterford, Dundalk, Sligo, Letterkenny, Cavan, Ballina, Killarney, Athlone and Galway; and in view of the serious social and economic repercussions of this decision, calls on the Government to make an immediate announcement that the decentralisation scheme will proceed as planned.</P>
      <P>This motion asks the House to condemn the decision of the Government not to proceed as rapidly as possible with the programme already underway and which was announced some time ago to decentralise various Government offices to about ten locations.  Because of the serious social and economic repercussions of their decision it asks the House to call on the Government to go ahead with the plan as already announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An amendment has been put down in the name of the Minister for Finance that from its wording seems to envisage it is not the intention of the Government to proceed with this plan, although they say currently that the matter is subject to examination by one of these innumerable study groups about which we hear so much nowadays where action is sought to be deferred.  It is becoming increasingly clear that the deferring of action is synonymous so far as this Government are concerned with the non-implementation of the plan or objective they have <Col N="739" /> announced will be deferred.  I will deal later with the wording of the amendment. It is curious and significant that it should be worded in this way.</P>
    <P>The history of the proposals of the previous Government for decentralisation started with the publication early in 1978 of a White Paper when it was announced that the Government intended to decentralise at least 2,000 public service jobs to the provinces. Work was done on that over a period of some years.  On 16 February 1980 the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, in his presidential address to the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, announced that the Government would give effect to their decision to implement what was described as a comprehensive policy on decentralisation of Government offices.</P>
    <P>The details of that proposal were announced by the then Minister for the Public Service, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, in this House during a debate on the economy on 22 October 1980.  The details were that 1,300 people from the Revenue Commissioners would be sent to Limerick, Nenagh and Ennis; that 700 from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs would be sent to Waterford and Dundalk; 400 from the Department of Social Welfare to Sligo and Letterkenny; 200 from the Department of Defence to Galway, although that had been announced some time previously by Deputy Molloy when he was Minister for Defence; 150 from the Department of Agriculture to Cavan; 200 from the Department of the Environment to Ballina; 150 from the Department of Education to Athlone and 110 from the Department of Justice to Killarney.  This made a total of 3,210, a substantial number of people and which justified the description by Deputy Haughey as a comprehensive policy of decentralisation of Government services.  That announcement was welcomed universally.  It was welcomed just as heartily in Dublin as it was in the areas that were to be the recipients of these people who were being decentralised.  The pressures in Dublin had built up to such an extent that it was and is clearly recognised that, if anything, <Col N="740" /> there is serious over-concentration of office or administrative-type employment in this city.</P>
    <P>Work was put in train very rapidly after Deputy Fitzgerald announced the details on 22 October 1980.  Detailed consultations were held by him and other Ministers with the Office of Public Works, who would have to be the main instrument of implementing the decision.  I am glad to say that quite rapid progress was made. Sites were acquired by June of this year in virtually all the centres and in some of them it had gone beyond that stage. Tenders were received and in some cases contracts were placed for the preliminary work.  In one or two cases work had actually started.  There was every indication of the commitment of the Government at the time to the implementation of that programme and this was widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>It came as something of a bombshell to everyone when news began to trickle through from July onwards that this Government had no such commitment to this plan, that they proposed at least to defer it and to have further studies carried out. When questions were asked here earlier this month about the matter &mdash; unfortunately that was the earliest opportunity Deputies had to ask questions &mdash; the gist of the answer they got from the Minister for Finance was that the decentralisation plans were being reviewed as part of the general review of expenditure programmes which the Government put in hand on assuming office.  He said he hoped the review would be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>From the replies to the many questions asked, it appears that the principal or only reason for this deferment, which unhappily we suspect will mean the knocking of these proposals after a time, was the question of cost.  We were told by the Minister for Finance that the cost of the programme would be £50 million. It may well be that the cost would be £50 million in the sense that buildings would have to be erected, but the net cost to the Exchequer would be nil because if the premises were not built in Limerick, Galway, Waterford or the other places listed they would have to be built in Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> The cost of building in central Dublin is astronomical, the cost of sites is huge and the cost of actual construction is much higher than elsewhere in the country. Rather than costing £50 million, it may be that the Exchequer by implementing this programme would save £5 million, £10 million or £15 million.  That is the correct way to assess this in terms of cost. Of course, the benefits are much wider than just the money saved on construction. What the Minister for Finance has said assumes that all the building would be done at expense to the public capital budget when it was envisaged by the previous Government that part of this capital work would be financed from private sources, as it is quite feasible to do.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the kind of situation we are faced with in Dublin and the regional imbalance that is such a dominant feature of the country.  Some 30 per cent of the population of the Republic of Ireland live in the greater Dublin area, by which I include Dublin city and county.  This must be one of the highest proportions in any capital city.  Even an enormous city like London constitutes only 12 to 14 per cent of the population of Britain.  Tokyo with a population of 11 million only constitutes 9 per cent of the population of Japan.  They have enormous problems with a city of that size. We can readily see the degree of imbalance that exists with 30 per cent of our population living in the capital city and suburbs.</P>
    <P>The periodical <i>Administration</i>, volume 26 No. 2, 1978, shows that on the latest figures available although Dublin has 30 per cent of the population of the Republic it has 59 per cent of the office jobs.  There is a corresponding deficit in opportunity for that type of employment in the remainder of the country.  The same article goes on to give the percentage of the headquarters of the offices of various types of organisations located in Dublin. If one compares this with other countries, there is a frightening imbalance.  The article shows, on page 188, that Government Departments are 100 per cent in Dublin, embassies 100 per cent, State-sponsored bodies 86 per cent, commercial State bodies 90 per cent, trade, <Col N="742" /> professional and other organisations 93 per cent, trade unions 93 per cent, large public quoted companies 90 per cent, banks 95 per cent, higher purchase firms 71 per cent, insurance companies 100 per cent, publishing companies 89 per cent, advertising agencies 97 per cent.  It is not surprising, in the light of those statistics, that Dublin has twice the percentage of office-type job as population although its population is greatly inflated as a proportion of the population of the country.</P>
    <P>There is a visible imbalance in provincial Ireland between the relative availability of industrial manufacturing employment &mdash; I use the word &ldquo;relative&rdquo; advisedly because there is not nearly enough in any region &mdash; and the almost total non-availability of administrative type office employment or white collar employment.  One of the results of over-concentration of population in Dublin is the impossibility of conditions which have developed in recent years.  The argument is summed up in a letter published in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times.</i> It is from the Westland Row Community Council and states:</P>
    <P>The Westland Row Community Council notes with concern the recently reported decision of the Government to delay or abandon the programme of decentralisation of Government offices.</P>
    <P>Our area has been blighted by Office-block developments which dwarf the local dwellings, choke the streets with parked cars and displace housing and employment opportunities for local people.  The demand for sites for office development in the area shows no sign of abating.  This pressure has raised the price of land which is needed for housing and industrial activity to the extent that these land-uses are prohibitively expensive.  Most of the recent offices built in the area have been let to Government Departments.</P>
    <P>We regret very much that decentralisation of Government offices is not to proceed as planned; decentralisation would reduce the demand for office space which has led speculators to ravage <Col N="743" /> our community.  So an indirect benefit for the inner city would accompany the direct benefits flowing from the regions selected for decentralisation. The cost of land and building costs must surely be lower almost anywhere than in the centre of Dublin.  Given that there is no shortage of Government custom for office blocks being finished now, this would mean a saving for the Exchequer, which is surely not to be ignored.  We have written to An Taoiseach and other local TDs to enlist their assistance in having these points investigated. &mdash; Yours, etc.,</P>

    <P Just="Right">Secretary,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Westland Row</P>
    <P Just="Right">Community Council,</P>
    <P Just="Right">c/o 9 Westland Row, Dublin.</P>
    <P>That letter sums up the kernel of the argument.  The very things provincial Ireland is crying out for and patently badly needs are the very things central Dublin is crying out against and does not want.  The things that would revitalise much of provincial Ireland are choking Dublin today.  In these circumstances how can any Government seriously not implement the programme which Fianna Fáil in Government had laid out in such detail over the last year or two?  I ask in all honesty how can it not be implemented in view of the benefit to Dublin and the regions involved?</P>
    <P>The argument in relation to cost is spurious because the cost is much greater if it is not implemented.  All the accommodation would have to be provided in Dublin and this would be at a greater cost.  It will put further pressure on the infrastructure in Dublin which is not able to bear existing pressures.  The infrastructure in the places I listed when I read Deputy Fitzgerald's announcement of October 1980 is not fully utilised.</P>
    <P>I doubt if there is any Member from outside of Dublin who is not approached weekly by constituents who have sons or daughters in the civil service.  They plead and beg with TDs to try to get their children out of Dublin, if possible, to be transferred to somewhere near their <Col N="744" /> homes.  In many cases the request of the parents and young civil servants is that if they cannot get back to somewhere near their homes they will go anywhere to get out of Dublin.  Reasonable steps will have to be taken to avoid the unhappiness, loneliness and misery that many young people experience because they have been brought up to the city in hordes from all parts of the country.  What we are asking the Government to implement is a reasonable step.  It will ease the life of TDs from every constituency outside of Dublin.  It is one of the most constant requests we receive.</P>
    <P>The sites which are available and have been acquired in all these centres are far superior to anything available in Dublin. They have been provided by local authorities at no profit, at whatever it cost them to acquire the site, whereas in Dublin the Board of Works cannot acquire worthwhile sites from the local authority, who do not have them as a general rule.  They have to buy in the open market from developers and others who may have been speculating in property and endeavouring to maximise their profit and the cost of the site.</P>
    <P>As well as good sites being available in all these areas about which I have spoken, some of the sites are in parts of cities or towns that have become derelict over the years where, unfortunately, there was not the demand for office development to enable them to be redeveloped as in the case of Dublin and, to a lesser extent, Cork.  My own city of Limerick is a good example of that, where a very large site in a very favourable central location in the city was made available by the local authority to the Board of Works without any difficulty and where the building of a 170,000 square feet office block as was proposed for Limerick would have the effect of revitalising &mdash; in a way that will never be done, unfortunately, by the private sector &mdash; a whole area of that ancient city which has fallen into disrepair in the last number of decades.</P>
    <P>I have here before me numerous extracts from NESC reports published over the last several years which I could quote to the House at some length if that was thought necessary, but I feel I should <Col N="745" /> not take up the time of the House in reading out all these quotations.  It suffices for me to say that the constant view and pressure from the NESC over the years in discussing these matters of regional imbalance, urban development and so on, was that if any one thing that needed to be done was obvious it was to move as much administrative type employment out of Dublin as possible.  I have long quotations here of what the British, for example, have done over the years in getting things out of London, what the Swedes have done in getting them out of Stockholm, what the French have done in getting such a huge proportion of their civil service and general administration out of Paris.  The list is almost endless and at the bottom of that list, unhappily for us, comes Ireland where we have tended to concentrate all these employment opportunities more and more in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In the past four years during the term of office of the previous Government, while this proposal to move 3,210 people was obviously the major proposal, nonetheless many of us as Ministers in our own Departments were able to decentralise small parts of Departments or small sections of semi-State bodies to the provinces with some worthwhile results. I could give a list of some of these related to my own Department, but I want to concentrate on one, which is the electronic testing facility of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  This is a wholly new section of the IIRS.  It had to be established from scratch, and I gave a direction to the IIRS board that they were to establish it outside Dublin city and county.  After some misgivings &mdash; one has to keep up the pressure in these matters &mdash; the IIRS finally went along with that and decided that the best site that they could see in Ireland bar none was the campus of the NIHE in Limerick, an institution which was rapidly acquiring a reputation for itself in terms of technology and innovation and which has attracted on to its campus two high technology electronic companies both of whom are just about to go into production.</P>
    <P>It was the ideal location for such an <Col N="746" /> undertaking, which was announced several months before the change of Government and all the arrangements were being put in train.  But, lo and behold, what happens in the month of July after the Government changes?  An announcement is made that the IIRS electronics laboratory will not now be going to Limerick, it will be established in Ballymun in Dublin where the existing facilities of the IIRS are extremely overcrowded and where the opportunities for further expansion are very limited, to say the least.  I was rather upset about that. I need hardly add that I thought it was a foolish decision to make, but my work was done for me by two of the Fine Gael Deputies for Limerick East, Deputy Kemmy and Deputy O'Donnell, who howled to high heaven.  Being in the privileged position that he is, with all the privilege of membership of the Fine Gael Party without too many of the liabilities, Deputy Kemmy's voice or view prevailed and after an interval of three or four weeks the Minister for Industry and Energy announced that the decision to rescind the original decision was itself being rescinded and that the original decision would now stand.  I suggest to the Government tonight that the change of mind they had in regard to the IIRS in Limerick would be welcomed very much if it was exercised equally in relation to the 3,210 jobs involved here because the arguments are exactly the same and they are just as valid as they were in relation to the IIRS in Limerick.  I hope &mdash; I do not know &mdash; that this decision of the Government to rescind the plan of the last Government for the decentralisation will not extend to An Foras Forbartha in Cork, but I fear that that might well happen.</P>
    <P>The mentality of the present Government in relation to things happening outside Dublin is demonstrated amply by their attitude in relation to the IIRS in Limerick which project was quashed within some weeks of their going into office and their announcement in relation to these plans which was made again within weeks of their going into office.  If we want to show the double mentality involved we need not confine ourselves <Col N="747" /> simply to administrative jobs of this kind. Manufacturing and similar type jobs outside Dublin are getting a pretty rough time from this Government also in the few short months that they are in office. We all recall what happened in relation to the Tuam sugar factory which the Government have succeeded in getting the House to close down by one vote, that again of Deputy Kemmy.  In the last few days it has begun to trickle out that the power station which I announced for Arigna based on native coal, which certainly was going ahead up to the time we left office at the end of June, is now to be scrapped.  The ITGWU, who apparently discovered this yesterday, are very anxious to meet the Minister for Industry and Energy in relation to the matter.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable in a time such as this, with the possibility of further energy shortages, that a proposal to utilise the limited coal resources we have in this country by the erection of a 45 MW station at Arigna is being knocked.  It is another example of this hostile attitude to things that are not happening outside Dublin that coal &mdash; imported, of course &mdash; will now be burned in Moneypoint in Clare and perhaps in one of the Dublin stations.  At the very time that that is happening we hear also that the new briquette factory which the last Government authorised about two years ago for Ballyforan on the Galway-Roscommon border has now been knocked also.</P>
    <P>These moves are tragic for the areas concerned.  I mention them to demonstrate the lack of anxiety on the part of this Government in relation to activity of this kind under public control which is outside of this city and the lack of commitment to such development, whether through administrative, white collar employment, or any other kind of employment.  When the announcement was made in Limerick in October 1980, or when Deputy Fitzgerald's announcement was read in Limerick, I am glad to say that a committee was formed there representing no less that 20 worthwhile bodies in the city and region who gave themselves the task, as it were, of trying to facilitate the movement of about 1,000 <Col N="748" /> civil servants to Limerick because they realised there would be many problems and difficulties encountered.  Great credit is due to them for what they did.  On the change of Government this summer they wrote to the new Minister for the Public Service offering their assistance as a local liaison group to ensure the smooth transfer of the Revenue employees to Limerick.  The Minister's reply was very brief.  He simply noted their offer of assistance, which he said could be taken up in the future if required.  This reply, as they put it to me, coupled with the many disturbing reports of shelving the transfer, has caused great concern throughout the community in Limerick.</P>
    <P>What I say about Limerick is equally valid in each of the other cases.  While the numbers in Limerick may be larger the fact of the matter is that all of the others, even where the numbers are smaller, are to their own community proportionately of equal importance.  This is especially so in a place like Letterkenny which is cut off to such an extent.  It is particularly so in a place like Cavan because of the difficulties that town has encountered for some time due to its proximity to the Border.  The Limerick people go on to say that their committee, which manifestly represents the views of many organisations and a cross-section of the community, is perturbed by the Minister's reply and by the recent setting up of a committee to review the funding of the decentralisation programme.  They say that they feel very strongly that both moves are aimed at deferring the transfer and may lead to a total cancellation.  They want it known that in no circumstances will they contemplate the cancellation of this transfer nor will they contemplate indefinite deferral.  They say that every delay deprives Limerick of many benefits and considerable spending power and they elaborate on that in some detail.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly evident that the case in favour of the proposals of the previous Government, which had begun to be implemented on the ground in all cases, is a compelling one and that no contrary case has been or can be made against it. I would say that we have it in our power here in this House to compel the Government <Col N="749" /> to go ahead with these plans which are demanded all over the country and equally demanded in Dublin.  The House can be sure that all Fianna Fáil Deputies who are here will vote for this motion and, if the motion is passed, the Government will have no option but to implement these plans at once.</P>
    <P>Therefore the question remains whether the Independents who sit in this House are prepared to support this motion.  I should like to address a few remarks to them in particular.  For example, to Deputy Kemmy I would say that, with his rather unhappy record of voting in this House, if he fails to support this motion he will be driving 1,000 jobs out of Limerick city as well as 2,210 out of various other towns and cities in provincial Ireland.  It is a matter for him and his conscience to face up to, but let him be aware of what he is doing before he does it.  It may not come as any great surprise to any of us, perhaps it should not, that Deputy Kemmy could vote to prevent 1,000 jobs being brought into the city he represents.  It may not be all that surprising because a man who could, when he was free to vote whichever way he wanted to, voted to increase VAT by 50 percent, to close the Tuam Sugar Factory, to raise the school entry age &mdash; incidentally all of which were carried by one vote and, therefore, by his vote &mdash; is not beyond keeping those 1,000 jobs out of Limerick and the other 2,210 out of all the other places.  But I am putting him and the various other Independents on notice now.</P>
    <P>This is clearly the sort of motion that Deputy Sherlock should support.  Otherwise all the things he has been saying for years are meaningless and he paints himself as big a hypocrite as some of the others who put themselves in that situation. I hope he is not, I believe he is not, I am sure he is not and that he will support this motion.  Deputy Dublin Bay-Rockall Loftus has frequently put himself on record and indeed gone to great extremes to complain about certain types of development in Dublin and their undesirability &mdash; the way Dublin was becoming polluted and overcrowded.  Here he has a glorious opportunity to help his own city, the <Col N="750" /> environmental welfare of which he has striven to protect with such zeal for so long.  I hope he will grasp that opportunity because the people of Dublin will not thank him for having another few thousand civil servants in on top of them unless he does that.  Equally Deputy Browne must be concerned about the inability of the city and county of Dublin to cope with and to cater for all the people who now live here.  It must be obvious to him, as it is to everyone else, that this programme of decentralisation is as vital and beneficial to Dublin as it is to the recipient towns and villages.  Of course, I would remind Deputy Blaney that Letterkenny in his constituency stands to benefit substantially by this programme if implemented and will lose out very heavily if not.  In those circumstances I call on those Independent Deputies to exercise common sense and show loyalty to the people who in each case elected them by coming into the lobbies tomorrow evening to vote in support of this motion, the compelling truth of which is so evident to everybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;accepts the necessity in the context of the present difficult economic situation to review expenditure programmes including the decentralisation programme to ensure the best possible return for public investment; and also accepts that the review of the decentralisation programme should take into consideration in addition both the need for balanced regional development and the improvement of services to the public.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad this motion has been moved here this evening by Deputy O'Malley.  As a result of its being put down we have an opportunity of discussing in this House the decentralisation programme which is a very important part of the Public Capital Programme inherited by the present Government <Col N="751" /> from the previous one.  I say that deliberately because it is worth recalling that there has never been a debate in this House on this decentralisation programme. Even if the money to finance this programme &mdash; as it will and would be &mdash; is borrowed in its entirety from foreign banks it will be the Irish taxpayer who ultimately will repay the cost.  It is important before undertaking the investment of such a substantial sum of money &mdash; and there are many other ways that the money might be invested if it were not invested in this way &mdash; that we should have a debate here in this House.  No debate took place on this matter before the previous Government committed themselves to it.</P>
    <P>The Government have behaved in a logical fashion in deciding, in the first instance, that when they came into office in July they would not necessarily be committed to all of the programmes that they inherited from the previous administration. After all, we were a new Government, elected with a new mandate, and had the responsibility to examine for ourselves whether the programme put forward by the previous Government, who had after all been defeated in the election, was the right programme to proceed with.  The Government behaved in the only way possible by undertaking this review.  As I have indicated in my response to questions put by a number of Deputies, I and the Government accept that this review must be carried out quickly.  We accept that there must be no undue delay in coming to decisions about this matter.  What is important is that expenditures of such substantial sums of money &mdash; £50 million at a minimum &mdash; must be properly examined by the elected Government and properly debated here in this House.  I am glad to say that they are to be debated tonight and tomorrow night.  I do not believe that we should rush into commitments of such substantial sums of taxpayers' money without such a proper and detailed review.</P>
    <P>I would like to return to the point that the bulk of this money will in fact be borrowed.  Most of it will be borrowed from abroad.  As a nation we will have to <Col N="752" /> pay the interest on that money.  Before we embark on such a substantial expenditure we must satisfy ourselves that we have the capacity to repay the debts we incur for that purpose and, in the meantime, pay the interest at very substantial rates on the international market which the loan to us of that money would require us to meet.  Having said that, let me say that what the Government are doing is reviewing this programme.  We have not decided to depart from it or abandon any part of it.  We have decided that it should be reviewed in detail before we proceed with it.  That is the appropriate way to proceed.  Also, a programme such as this has serious implications for the staff involved.  There are people, some of whom as Deputy O'Malley has indicated, would want to move.  But there are many people whose presence in the new centres is absolutely essential to the proper functioning of the offices because of the seniority they hold in the branches of the public service which are to be decentralised.  It is essential that they move if the offices are to move.  As I understand it, there was not sufficient consultation undertaken with the various associations as to how this matter might be dealt with.  This delay in considering the matter affords a valuable and necessary opportunity for the type of consultation that is necessary to ensure that whatever programme is embarked upon has the support and co-operation of the staff involved.</P>
    <P>Given the resources and other considerations involved in decentralisation the Government make no apology for their current review and re-examination of these proposals.  It is important to set the question of decentralisation of Government offices in context at the outset. Decentralisation of Government offices to improve services to the public is a long-standing feature of public administration here.  It is perhaps not widely known that almost 40 per cent of the civil service is already located in provincial centres.  I am talking here about some 23,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Postmen.  Where else would they be located?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that there are 23,000 postmen in the country?  Only a tiny fraction of these, under 500 of the total, are in fact located in provincial centres as a result of the policy of decentralisation for its own sake.  Instead they represent staff being decentralised not for the sake of decentralisation but because locating them in provincial centres provides the best means of administering the services involved.  These people do not involve only postmen but the staff of the Departments of Agriculture, Social Welfare, Fisheries and Forestry and the Revenue Commissioners.  This is the way decentralisation should be.  We should disperse staff throughout the country not because we decide that we should decentralise for the sake of decentralisation but because locating them in particular centres is the best way to give the service that the public need in the most efficient manner possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course one must recognise that in embarking on any programme of relocation of Government services, central Government services located in Dublin allow relatively easy access for the public to them from all parts of the country, and this is particularly the case in respect of specialised services where the number of people involved would not be large enough to allow them to be broken up into individual parts for individual sections of the country.  The national transport grid does afford relatively easy access for the public from all parts of the country to Dublin.  One must be sure, in embarking on any policy of decentralisation, that one does not end up worsening the service to the public.  If one relocates in some part of Donegal an office serving the people of the entire country one is likely to find that people from Cork who want to avail of the service in that office are going to find it a lot more difficult to get to Donegal than to get to Dublin, and of course Dublin is nearer to them and the transport system to Dublin is relatively better than transport to Donegal. So in any programme of this sort we must make sure that at least we go as far as maintaining existing standards of services. This is one of the reasons for reviewing <Col N="754" /> the programme that the new Government inherited from their predecessors. We decided to undertake this review within two weeks of office.  We did not say that any or all of it was necessarily wrong.  We did say that we, as the elected Government, have to make up our minds as to what we believe is right both from the point of view of cost and service to the public.  We would be failing in our duty if we simply took over, willy-nilly, what the previous Government had decided to do.  They were defeated in the election and we were elected and we must make up our own minds about it.  We undertook this review to fulfil the responsibilities that we were elected to fulfil. That does not involve simply accepting what we inherited from the previous Government.</P>
    <P>If Deputy O'Malley were to come into office succeeding a Government of another party he would not be bound to accept every decision taken by his predecessor. He would adopt the view that having been elected by the public it was his duty to satisfy himself that what he had inherited was right.  That is what we are doing in this instance.  We ae satisfying ourselves about the policy that has been undertaken.  If we did less than that we would not be doing our duty.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the matter of cost and I would point out that the programme which we inherited from the previous Government would cost over £50 million for construction alone.  But that is not the end of the story.  Other costs will inevitably arise and all of them will have to be borne by the Exchequer and, ultimately, by the taxpayer.  These additional costs include removal costs arising from the transfer to the 12 centres concerned of 3,000 people.  It is an established practice that the cost of such transfers are reimbursed to the public servants involved by their employers, mainly the taxpayers.  The relocation of staff would be on a voluntary basis, but, as with previous decentralisation, the staff's costs on moving would be borne by the State.  In the case of householders these removal costs would include the cost of selling an existing house and buying <Col N="755" /> another, auctioneers' and solicitors' fees and stamp duty and bridging finance.  For all categories of staff, the costs of advance visits to secure accommodation and of furniture removal would also have to be paid.  Obviously, the actual costs would depend on the individual circumstances of the transferee.  Based on numbers and grades designated for transfer, they are likely to come to at least another £4 million or £5 million, which brings the cost to £54 million or £55 million.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the construction of the offices themselves will create an immediate demand for the development of related infrastructural services &mdash; communications, power, water and the like. That has a cost on which I am not in a position to put a figure, but the Deputies opposite will agree that it would be significant.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the needs of the staff and their families to be transferred would also create an immediate demand for additional infrastructures and services &mdash; houses, roads and so forth.  The resources available to undertake such development are not unlimited and the need to develop such services in a chosen centre may well delay the provision of similar services elsewhere if, as a result of a very big increase in population in one centre, brought about by decentralisation, one may, in a given county, have to divert moneys for water, sewerage and so on to that town and away from other towns in the same county.  That will not necessarily make the county as a whole any better off.  In fact, it may well mean that the level of services to the existing population in that county will be less good than they would otherwise have been, unless substantial additional resources are devoted to the needs of that county.</P>
    <P>There were a number of omissions from Deputy O'Malley's speech.  He undertook to parse and analyse my motion, with a view to demonstrating that, in fact, I was totally opposed to decentralisation.  He must have forgotten what he said at the outset, because at no stage did he return to the terms of my motion, or attempt in any way to fulfil his intention in the matter of proving, by <Col N="756" /> textual analysis, that I believed other than what I said I believed.  He also did not make a point which may well be made by Deputies opposite and which was made, by inference, by the Deputies during Question Time on the matter, this was by reference to the original intention that the decentralisation programme would be financed, as far as possible, from funds outside public capital programme &mdash; in other words, by private funds.  Public advertisements were issued, inviting private developers, financial institutions and building contractors to make proposals.  Several firms expressed interest.  The majority expressed interest in providing the accommodation on a leased basis.  However, when detailed discussions took place &mdash; and the Deputies opposite may not be aware of this &mdash; two problems arose which are worth bearing in mind in assessing the potential savings from this source.  First, there was the insistence by some of the developers that they, and not the Government, should manage the projects from the beginning, using their own architects and design teams.  In other words, the safeguards which usually apply in respect of public money in regard to accepting the lowest tender and ensuring fair play in every way in regard to the use of public money would not apply in those cases.  There would not be the normal supervisory role for the Office of Public Works in ensuring that costs are kept in proper balance.  As this House should be aware, the Office of Public Works are very strict in regard to cost over-runs in public sector contracts for which they are responsible &mdash; a degree of care which is not taken, I might say, either in the private sector or, indeed, in some of the public sector enterprises which do not come within the purview of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Secondly &mdash; and this is, perhaps, the most interesting point about the so-called very easy money which was going to be obtained from private developers &mdash; there was almost unanimous insistence from the private developers that the rent levels and rent reviews which would be charged on these premises in the provincial centres would be the same as <Col N="757" /> chargeable for prime office space in Dublin.  This demolishes the point which Deputy O'Malley was making so plausibly that one would save money by decentralisation of these offices because one would be able to build them more cheaply than in Dublin city.  On the basis of the rents which the private developers were prepared to charge, that was not the case. Perhaps, on reconsideration &mdash; and perhaps as a result of the review being undertaken by the present Government &mdash; the developers may see that if they are to get this decentralisation they may have to improve their offer.  Perhaps, as a result of our action they may be prepared to offer more reasonable terms than they were prepared to offer on the basis of the programme outlined by the previous Government.  So far, that has not happened. One cannot glibly say, as Deputy O'Malley seems to infer, that one can, in fact, save money in this way if the costs would be just as great in the provincial centres as in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I accept fully that there is a need to disperse to the maximum extent service employment throughout the country.  We already have a programme of assistance to disperse &mdash; or decentralise, if you like &mdash; manufacturing employment, through the differential aids given by the Industrial Development Authority to mount the location of manufacturing outside Dublin, the largest aids being given in the areas most remote from Dublin and the least aids being given in Dublin.  No similar incentives exist for the dispersal or decentralisation of service, as distinct from manufacturing, employment.  There is, therefore, a case for considering what the public sector can do in the matter of giving a lead to other service employers by decentralising their employment.  The Government accept this and this consideration will be taken into account when the Government come to decisions on this matter, as they must do soon.</P>
    <P>I accept, also, the very valid point made by Deputy O'Malley, one which I have made in this House on a number of occasions, that Ireland is somewhat top heavy, in that there is an undue concentration of population in the city and county of Dublin and, perhaps, in the surrounding <Col N="758" /> counties which are now experiencing the overspill from Dublin.  One must, however, recognise that there is also a need for employment in Dublin.  In fact, the most substantial increase in unemployment in recent times, with not many exceptions, has been in the Dublin area and there is a need for construction employment in the Dublin area.  Many workers from my own constituency, Kildare, and even from Deputy Wilson's constituency, travel to Dublin every day for employment in the construction industry.  It would be wrong to infer, as it is assumed that Deputy O'Malley infers, that there is no problem as far as finding employment in Dublin is concerned. It is ironic that he should be making the case which he is making, because he is the Minister who decided that IDA grants should be given in Dublin for industry in the Dublin area. He recognised the problem which he now seems to ignore, that there is need for projects to create employment in Dublin, as well as in Limerick and other centres. One must bear in mind in weighing up this programme the growth and acuteness of unemployment and the lack of alternatives for many unemployed people in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to matters concerning electricity.  The decisions which have been taken, or may be taken, in regard to electricity, do not come within this motion.  As a nation we cannot ignore that our existing capacity to produce electricity results in a production of 40 per cent more than our needs, that we use only about 60 per cent of our capacity. That gap is wider here than in most countries.</P>
    <P>The money we are using to increase our capacity to generate electricity is being provided by the European Investment Bank and other such bodies and they will naturally ask whether we need this additional capacity at this time, whether we need this additional investment in electricity generation, and whether we have the ability to generate the income from the use of electricity to enable us to repay the debts incurred to build the additional capacity.  If average use is no <Col N="759" /> more than 60 per cent of existing capacity to generate electricity there are arguments for at least being careful before committing ourselves to raising capacity even further, possibly widening the gap between use and capacity.</P>
    <P>That does not come within the terms of the motion but it is something Deputy O'Malley might think about before he makes this point again, before he makes dogmatic statements on this matter.  As a community we must look very carefully at the whole of our public capital programme, and decentralisation of Government offices is part of it.  The public capital programme cost, the investment undertaken not by private enterprise but by the Government on behalf of the people, has risen in ten years from about 11 per cent of GNP to about 18 per cent, yet the number of jobs created by that public sector investment has not increased at all.</P>
    <P>We need to ask questions about that. It would appear on the face of it that as a community we are not getting the return we deserve from the money the Government are spending, and borrowing, on behalf of the people.  It is the people who will repay those borrowing debts.  We are not getting the jobs in the volume which we are entitled to expect. We are getting jobs, but not a sufficient number, from the type of investment we have been undertaking at such considerable cost.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that I have insisted, in the programme recently published by the Government, on a better way to plan our national finances.  I have insisted that we must be critical and careful about all expenditure, particularly capital expenditure, to ensure we will get the return we are entitled to expect from those investments. The record of the past ten years on this matter bears out the points I have made here on many occasions: we do not have sufficient opportunities in the House to debate capital investment. There have not been debates at any time in the House, from the beginning to the end of a year, specifically on our public capital programme.</P>
    <P>How can the House be expected to <Col N="760" /> come to rational decisions about whether a particular project will yield the jobs that it should yield for the amount of public money put into it if we do not have an opportunity to debate it?  That is why I said at the outset that I very much welcome Deputy Fitzgerald's initiative in putting down this motion, although naturally I do not agree with its condemnation of the Government.  However, I agree with the opportunity it provides to debate this issue because we should have a debate here before we undertake an expenditure of £50 million just because a Government on the eve of an election agreed to do it.  If we are to be true to our responsibilities we must have this sort of debate much more often than in the past.</P>
    <P>The Government now are going the right way about their responsibilities because they are ensuring that this matter will be reviewed properly so that decisions of this sort in the future will be examined thoroughly in this House before the expenditure will be undertaken on behalf of the people.</P>
    <P>In the time available I will review quickly the considerations the Government have been bearing in mind in the review they are undertaking.  We must look closely at the improvements or otherwise in the efficient administration of the public service.  We must look at the impact this would have on balanced regional development.  We accept there is a case for the proper type of decentralisation which will make a genuine contribution to sustained regional development. We are giving that factor its due weight in the review we are undertaking. We will also bear in mind the impact this move will have on the construction industry.</P>
    <P>We accept there is unemployment in that industry outside Dublin and that a decentralisation programme would help to right that imbalance.  However, there is unemployment in the construction industry in Dublin also and we must look at that as well.  Above all, we believe the decision in this matter must be taken quickly.  We undertook the review in July and I would hope that we will have made a decision on it before Christmas because <Col N="761" /> we should not allow the matter to drag on.  We have got to make a clear decision on what we will do, how much and where, with due speed so that people who had built expectations around these proposals will know where they stand.</P>
    <P>I accept that the motion is a useful contribution because it gives us an opportunity, before the decision has been made finally, to have a proper debate in the House.  We have not been given such opportunities in the past, particularly before the previous Government made the decision to commit £55 million of public money in centres which they had selected for their own purposes without any debate in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a full heart that I recommend that the House reject the decision of the Government not to proceed with programmes already under way in the regions and towns mentioned in our motion.  I contend that the thought put into the construction of that programme of Government office decentralisation was one which considered the best possible return for public investment not merely in economic terms, in terms of stimulation of the construction industry, but for the social advance of the regions mentioned.</P>
      <P>I will take up a few points made by the Minister for Finance.  He was more bland than usual when talking to his amendment. Every time he mentioned money he did so in hushed tones &mdash; he was nodding.  The golden calf was being duly honoured, but when he mentioned the 3,210 employees with whom we were concerned when we designed this plan there was no such note of awe to be detected in his voice.  He avoided what Deputy O'Malley said, that these offices would have to be built anyway and that if they were not built in the regions they would have to be built in Dublin, a much more expensive exercise than the one planned by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He went on to say that these decisions were taken without due consideration. He is an innocent man if he thinks that. At many meetings of the Government all the factors were considered and due weight was given to the points made by <Col N="762" /> Deputy Bruton.  This very carefully thought out plan for decentralisation emerged from all that consideration.  He need not come in here and pretend no due care was taken in formulating the plan.  He need not insinuate that the previous Government had any motive other than decentralising Government Departments with the attendant advantages which would come from that decentralisation.</P>
    <P>He mentioned that some staff would not be willing to go to the various centres and that there was not sufficient consultation. That again is not so.  That is not in accordance with the facts.  The various unions were informed of the Government's intention.  Every rural Deputy, every Deputy from outside Dublin, has a briefcase full of requests from people in the public service who are anxious to get back as near as possible to their own areas.</P>
    <P>He said there was a greater ease of access to Dublin than to a provincial centre.  He talked as if the stage coach were the way to get from Cork to Donegal &mdash; those were to two counties he mentioned &mdash; and as if he were completely unaware of the advances made in this electronic age.  The Minister for Finance may not be remembered for his brutal and draconian budget, or for the fact that he sold a pup to the Minister for Education, or that he is mickey-mousing with income tax, or that he was guilty of blatant political patronage in his own Department.  If he does not carry through the programme of decentralisation outlined by the previous Government, he will be remembered for that.</P>
    <P>There was no real meat in the Minister's objections to our scheme.  He mentioned privatisation and problems which arose with regard to it.  If he continues with our scheme which is a worthwhile one, and very carefully thought out and very well constructed, and the centres for which were very well placed, he will find that he can impose his own kind of rules on the privatisation scene, and that the State will not lose out in the long run.</P>
    <P>He was totally illogical when he came back to the idea of building in Dublin. He said there was unemployment also in <Col N="763" /> the Dublin area.  This seems to me to be totally out of keeping with the hushed tones in which he introduced his speech when talking about money and expenditure. He said, which was not true, that capital expenditure is never discussed in this House.  For example, the building of schools, whether primary or vocational, aids for the building of secondary schools and the provision of moneys for third level education, have all been discussed in this House.  With his holier than thou attitude, arrogating to himself an integrity which he says no-one else ever had, I am not surprised he has come to the conclusion that we should not go ahead with this decentralisation in the manner elaborated and evolved after long consideration by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister admitted it is generally recognised that there are particular virtues in decentralisation in any country and in particular in this country.  I will read for the House something said on decentralisation in the recent past.  I am quoting from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 23 November 1981:</P>
    <P>In the absence of a coherent decentralisation policy, new technologies will serve to reinforce the dominance of Dublin and perpetuate regional disparities, according to the author of a recent National Economic and Social Council report on the problems of growth and decay in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Dr Michael Bannon, of UCD, said on Thursday that the present highly-centralised Government bureaucracy should be dismantled in favour of strong urban-centred regional units, where public sector decision-making could be relocated.  The decentralisation of private companies should also be encouraged.</P>
    <P>We heard the statistics given by Deputy O'Malley, when he was introducing this motion, on the great disparity between Dublin and the provinces in that regard. The report goes on:</P>
    <P>Addressing an EEC conference on the implications of new technologies, Dr. Bannon said their use would require careful planning if they were to <Col N="764" /> prove socially desirable.  He suggested that the capacity of a region to innovate, attract investment and generate self-sustaining growth was hampered by loss of leadership to the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>This has been a problem in other countries. As Deputy O'Malley said, with 30 per cent of the population in the Dublin area, the position here was far worse than in other cities such as London and Tokyo. Vienna was always given as an example of the head which was much too big for the body.  It was, of course, the capital of the Austro-Hungarian empire and a huge structure was left there when that empire was dissolved.  It was a grave and heavy drain on the people of Austria.  The balance has been established since then, and it is precisely that kind of balance that the Fianna Fáil Government were trying to establish in putting forward their plan for decentralisation.</P>
    <P>It is true, as was said by Deputy O'Malley and admitted at least by implication by the Minister, that many civil servants are trying to get back down as near as possible to their own regions.  We consulted the unions.  We told them what we were about to do.  We said full consultation would take place on the move to the various areas from Departments.</P>
    <P>The fact that young people and middle-aged people are anxious to go back is, in a sense, a tribute to the development of amenities in rural Ireland.  Some 30 or 40 years ago it would have been difficult, even with gelignite, to blast these people out of the capital city.  There have been considerable amenity developments in rural Ireland and, for the quality of life and because they know the social structures in their own areas, people are anxious to get back to them.</P>
    <P>It is very important to realise what this injection of human resources into a provincial town means to that town.  In the recent past in the case of hospitals we have been able to attract &mdash; and I hope the Minister does not lay his cold and clammy hands on the development of the general hospital in Cavan, which would also inhibit development in that area &mdash; highly qualified medical personnel.  We <Col N="765" /> have examples of highly qualified medical personnel who have had experience in Britain, the United States and other places coming to our local hospitals and this means a great deal, not merely from the point of view of their medical skills but also the social development of the area.  When civil servants come to the various towns, they will be in a position to apply their considerable sophistication to the development of the specific area to which they are allocated.</P>
    <P>I want to make a plea for my own area. I know all the areas mentioned, Letterkenny, Sligo, Ballina or Cavan, have their own needs for development, but we exemplify what has happened in provincial towns.  Deputy O'Malley mentioned that a very high percentage of personnel was concentrated in the city.  In Cavan there is no Industrial Development Authority office.  We do not have the North Eastern Regional Development Organisation offices; there are no Army headquarters, and even the income tax offices are far away from the town.  Some people think it is not far enough and if this Government continue in office they would probably wish they were even further away.  We were cut off when the railway system was discontinued.  The North Eastern Health Board, who cater for the health needs of the area, are located elsewhere.  All these points were made when the Government were considering various areas for the location of offices and, contrary to what the Minister of Finance, Deputy Bruton, said, very careful consideration was given to the claims of various towns.  There was a very long and serious debate and all the relevant factors were taken into account. It was not an off-the-cuff decision.  It resulted from serious consideration and study of the whole matter.  The last thing that the Minister for Finance said before he left the House was that he was the one who had responsibility, and that he was exercising this responsibility with regard to capital development.  The implication was that nobody else had done this.  I repudiate that.  It is not true.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley outlined the genesis of the plan of the previous Government. The then Taoiseach mentioned it at the <Col N="766" /> Árd Fheis on 16 February 1980.  The then Minister of Finance, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, made his announcement on 22 October 1980 and listed the various centres and the number of personnel, 3,210.  Of that, the Department of Agriculture was to decentralise to the extent of 150 officers to Cavan town which would mean the building of offices to cater for that 150 plus other officials from the Department of Agriculture who were already there, bringing the total number to 230.  We had a visit from Deputy Seán Calleary, who had special responsibility in that field, on 14 March.  The county council, conscious of the need for development of the town, which in the 1979 census showed a population of 6,300 or so, immediately made a prestigious site available for this office on Farnham Street &mdash; Casement Street.  Plans had progressed to such an extent before we left office that tenders had been invited for site development.  At Question Time I asked the Minister for Finance what had happened to those tenders and to employers who are waiting for some word from the Government.  He had no answer for me then and I did not get any answer since.</P>
    <P>The construction industry which had been mentioned both by Deputy O'Malley and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, is in a parlous state at present, despite the fact that the outgoing Government consciously decided to enlarge the capital programme deliberately to sustain employment and to provide infrastructure which will be needed when the international recession is over and we can make an advance as we did in 1977, 1978 and 1979.  Despite the fact that the Government decided on a large and substantial programme, the building industry is in trouble and the Government are compounding the difficulties by their shilly-shallying.  I could not make out from the Minister for Finance whether he is going to scrap the whole scheme or not.  He was bland to start off with and confused at the finish.  We would like clarification of the position.</P>
    <P>We were to have a section of the Department of Agriculture located in Cavan.  Certain facilities were to be provided, <Col N="767" /> facilities which are easily located and will not in any way produce the difficulty that Deputy Bruton was talking about with regard to access.  We want to tell the committee who are supposed to be examining this since last July that if they are worried &mdash; Deputy Bruton said they were worried &mdash; about staffing, they are coming to a town which has particular strengths, as have Ballina, Letterkenny and Sligo.  We have our own strengths from a social point of view.  We are strong in drama.  We have two drama festivals each year.  We have a strong centre of the arts, we have an arts officer who, with the aid of Cavan Urban Council and Cavan County Council and grants from the Central Arts Council, An Chomairle Ealaíon, have developed the arts in the town to which the civil servants will be going.  We have a very strong sporting and games tradition.</P>

      <P>I do not understand Deputy Desmond's point.  Deputy O'Malley referred to serious gaps in industrial development.  He said that Arigna had been chosen for development for the generation of electricity and that this scheme had been scrapped.  He also mentioned Ballyforan, which is very serious for Galway.  We in County Cavan are perturbed by rumours &mdash; and I was in consultation with the local officer of the ITGWU &mdash; that one of our factories is in <Col N="768" /> serious trouble, which may mean the loss of over 100 jobs.  Since the Government took office one hammer blow after another has been directed at our area. There are people who still cannot believe that the Government would even contemplate scrapping the location of the Department of Agriculture office in Cavan town.  I can assure the Minister for Finance and his ADC, Deputy Desmond, that if they renege on the previous Government's commitment to this development there will be a very hot reception awaiting them when they come for the by-election, whenever we can reluctantly drag them before the people.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to maintain morale in a community which is geared to development in a certain way, and we are crying out for development in that area. We have been cut off for some considerable time.  Belfast was our commercial and industrial capital up to the time the country was artifically divided.  The Great Northern Railway and the Midland Great Western met at Cavan town.  The division of the country and the deterioration of the railway service meant we were cut off from Belfast, both politically and commercially, and we had very poor communication with Dublin.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 269 and 270 together.</P>
      <P>A detailed examination is nearing completion of the way in which the Garda Síochána is at present deployed in Cork city and of ways in which deployment could be improved so as to provide a better police service to the community there.  The examination is being carried out by the Garda themselves with assistance from the operations research unit of the Department of the Public Service.  It is accepted that a new Garda station is needed to serve the Douglas area but the exact location of this station will have to be determined in the context of a general reorganisation of the force in the city and the surrounding areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of the allocation of official transport to Douglas station, the position is that the Garda Síochána are provided with sufficient official transport to cater for their overall needs and the precise allocations to be made to individual areas from time to time are matters for the professional judgment of the Garda authorities.  They report that the existing arrangement, whereby the patrol car based at Togher station serves the Douglas sub-district, <Col N="611" /> makes the best use of available resources. In addition, the Douglas sub-district receives attention from the official transport based at the district and divisional headquarters at Union Quay, including the district detective unit cars and the traffic corps cars.</P>

Subsequently cheques in payment of benefit issued to him on 30 October, 10 November, 19 November, 20 November and 26 November paying up to and including 25 November 1981.  In fact, he has been overpaid £35.94, as the cheque for that amount which issued to him on 10 November was in respect of pay-related benefit for the period from 29 October to 4 November 1981, which had already been included in the payment which issued on 30 October 1981.

      <P>At the date of claim to unemployment benefit by the person concerned my Department had no record of his employment during the relevant contribution period April 1979 to April 1980. He was written to and asked to furnish evidence of employment during the period in question and in reply he supplied a form P.60.  However certain aspects of the details of his employment on the form required clarification and the person concerned was written to again but has not replied to date.  In the meantime, based on his insurance record in the year 1978-79, payment of unemployment benefit has been recently authorised at the reduced rate of £18.00, increased to £18.65 from 5 October 1981, together with pay-related benefit at £4.00 weekly. As the claimant is a postal applicant, a paying order in respect of all arrears due was sent to him for encashment at his local post office on 26 November 1981.</P>

      <P>A social assistance allowance had been in payment to the person concerned since early in 1978.  When she reapplied for the allowance at the end of September last her case was re-investigated and it came to light that she had been working from 1 May to 15 September 1981 but had not cashed any orders during that time.  Her allowance for this period was terminated as her means exceeded the statutory limit for receipt of the allowance but it was restored to her with effect from 17 September 1981. An allowance book with orders payable from 26 November 1981 issued to the designated post office on 24 November and she was notified accordingly.  Arrears due from 17 September have been paid, after adjustment for the amount of supplementary welfare allowance paid to her by the South Eastern Health Board since that date.</P>

      <P>I would refer to the reply given by me on 28 October 1981 to a previous question in this case.  It has since been established that the incapacity was due to an accident at work and the claim to injury has accordingly been allowed from 6 August 1981, date of the accident.</P>
      <P>The relevant regulations provide that where a person, who is in receipt of disablement pension, subsequently meets with another occupational accident, the rate of injury benefit payable shall be reduced by the amount of the disablement pension in payment.  Where, however, as a result of this reduction, the weekly rate of injury benefit is less than the weekly rate of disability benefit, the latter benefit and not injury benefit is paid.  In this case the rate of disability benefit exceeds the rate of injury benefit, as reduced by the weekly rate of disablement pension already in payment, and accordingly disability benefit is continuing to be paid.</P>
      <P>As, however, disability benefit is not payable for the first three days of the claim, injury benefit at the reduced rate has been allowed for the period from 6 August 1981 to 8 August 1981 and as indicated payment on the claim is being made as disability benefit thereafter.  All payment due has now been made to 28 November 1981, the date of the latest medical evidence received.  He is not entitled to pay-related benefit.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 14 August 1981 and subsequently maternity allowance in respect of a confinement on 6 October 1981.

It subsequently transpired that she had sufficient insurable employment in the 1980-81 contribution year to qualify her for payment of maternity benefit but due to the failure of the employer to pay the contributions at the proper time they were only recently credited to her insurance record.  Payment of all maternity benefit due on her maternity claim from 31 August to 21 November has now been made.</P>

      <P>The family income supplement aspect of the £9.60 scheme is designed to confer a benefit of at least £4 per week on families whose taxable income is £2,000 or more and is not in excess of £4,000.  Tapering relief will also provide some benefit to families whose taxable income does not greatly exceed £4,000.  The number of low-income families who will benefit from these measures will depend on the number of such families who participate in the scheme.  It is estimated that approximately 50,000 families are eligible for family income supplement.</P>

    <P>(a) projected.</P>
    <P>(b) up to the end of October.</P>
    <P>With regard to the success rate in finding permanent employment approximately 50 per cent of the participants on AnCO community youth training programmes in Galway go into permanent employment on completion of their training. This figure does not include those who subsequently take up apprenticeships with AnCO or pursue regular AnCO training courses.</P>
    <P>On a national basis 80 per cent of the participants on the National Manpower Service work experience programmes are successful in securing employment.</P>
    <P>Both programmes have been successful on a national basis.  AnCO's community youth training programme, which is a training rather than a work experience programme, has enabled AnCO to provide training in areas which may be remote from training centres.  From 1979 to date 28 projects have been completed in the Galway training centre catchment area.  Placement has been satisfactory considering the remoteness of many of the projects and the fact that many trainees subsequently attend other AnCO courses.  The success of the NMS work experience programme is indicated by the high placement rate of participants.</P>
    <P>The tables show an increase in the number of young people from the Galway area involved in these programmes.</P>
