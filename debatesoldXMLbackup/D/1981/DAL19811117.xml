      <P>The most up to date information on the number of people under 25 who are unemployed is available from the monthly live register statement which on 30 October 1981 included 35,501 persons under 25 years of age.  The live register does not include all persons seeking regular work for the first time.  No statistics are available for the number of persons under 25 years of age who are seeking work but are not included on the live register.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has met the Commission on Taxation since he became Minister; and when he expects to have the commission's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The only occasion on which there has been a meeting between the Minister for Finance and the Commission on Taxation was on 14 April 1980 when the Minister for Finance addressed the members at their inaugural meeting.</P>
      <P>As no deadlines have been set for the commission and as, I understand, they have yet to consider several aspects of taxation, I cannot say at this stage when a report will be finalised.  For the sake of completeness and consistency with the statement I made in the House on the Finance Bill, perhaps I ought to add to that circulated reply that I have met the chairman of the commission informally but I have not met the commission as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Having met the chairman, can the Minister give us any indication as to when a report will be received and whether there still will be interim reports or reports specifically related to certain aspects of the taxation system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2073" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will recognise and recollect, the commission were set up on an entirely independent basis. I would not, therefore, be in a position to say whether they intend to publish interim reports or when they intend to publish their final report.  If the Deputy has any queries on that matter he would be best advised to address them to the independent commission.  But I look forward to receiving their report and will consider its content with great care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I detect on the part of the Minister a decided lack of interest in the proceedings of this commission, or in the outcome of their efforts or any report submitted by them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me assure the House that there would be no foundation for any inference of any such tone in my statement.  I welcome the establishment of this commission.  It is useful to have, at substantial intervals of time, a thorough-going review of our tax system and an independent commission such as this is useful for achieving such a review. I will both welcome their report when it is received and will study it with great care.  No one can ask me to do any more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister expect the report to be available to him before the budget, and what will be the date of the budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Any question about the date of the budget would not be relevant as there was no notice of it.  In regard to the first question asked by Deputy Fitzgerald, they are an independent commission and I have no way of knowing when they expect to present either their interim report or their final report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could, of course, ask them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we have this independent commission and since the Minister has paid tribute to their <Col N="2074" /> objectivity, did he or the Government contemplate inviting their views on any of the taxation reforms put forward by the Government or did he invite them to submit some form of interim report which might encompass some of their views on those reforms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will recollect, the commission are independent. They are entitled to settle their own schedule of work.  If they decide, in their wisdom, that they want to present a report to us on any matter they are perfectly free to do so.  But I do not intend to direct them when to publish their report or what to report on.  That is entirely a matter for themselves and any pressure put on me by Deputies opposite to do other than that would be an attempt to interfere with the independence of the commission as established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not suggesting that any pressure be put on the commission but, since there is a body in existence which presumably has some competence in that area and since the Government have resorted to the device of inviting independent experts to comment on other aspects of economic policy, such as the &ldquo;Three Wise Men&rdquo;, it would seem a reasonable inference that the Government might have invited&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the world to stop the commission if they decide to present a report to me on this or any other subject, nor is there anything to stop the Deputy writing a letter to the commission suggesting that they do so.  I will not interfere with them in my ministerial position in the timing of the reports or the content of them.  Because of my position, any request of mine in that context could be construed as interfering with their legitimate independence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the proposals, if any, apart from the employment of a special project officer, he has to redress the social and <Col N="2075" /> economic decline in the economy of south west Kerry, where there is a serious decline in population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the Cahirciveen rural district where the population declined by 0.8 per cent &mdash; 80 persons &mdash; during the last intercensal period at a time when the total population of County Kerry increased by 2 per cent &mdash; 2,378 persons. The appointment of a special officer for the area is aimed at enabling the most intensive use to be made of the various State schemes concerned with economic development in industry, fisheries, tourism, and so on.  I consider that this approach, promoting the most intensive possible use of existing schemes and policies, represents the best approach towards the development of areas which continue to experience population decline despite the general increases recorded in recent censuses.</P>
      <P>In addition the Western Development Fund is, of course, available to assist any worthwhile projects which are not catered for by existing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether, in view of the serious social and economic decline in the economy of this part of south Kerry, he will direct all State and semi-State agencies to pay special attention to this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to appoint the officer in question was designed to achieve precisely that effect.  He is there to ensure that an overview is taken of the problems of this part of County Kerry so that the needs identified by the Deputy can be met by existing State agencies.  If he requires any assistance in his work, I will be happy to provide it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has got an opportunity of getting those geographic locations on the record but he <Col N="2076" /> has not asked me about them.  If he wishes to direct a question to me or to the relevant Minister on the particular project he has in mind, I suggest he should do so.  It does not arise directly on this question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, together, as the proposals for the construction of new offices in Galway and Letterkenny for the Departments of Defence and Social Welfare respectively form part of the proposed decentralisation programme.</P>
      <P>The plans for the decentralisation of Government offices are being reviewed as part of the general review of expenditure programmes which the Government put in hands on assuming office.  I expect that the review will be completed shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a scandalous <Col N="2077" /> reply, raising very serious problems for the areas concerned.  What is the present situation with regard to the intention of the Department of the Environment to transfer approximately 200 of their staff to Ballina and the decision to transfer An Foras Forbartha headquarters to Cork city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply relates solely to Government offices.  As An Foras Forbartha is a semi-State body, the reply does not relate to it.  I will give the Deputy the information about Ballina.  The position is that the purchase of a site has been completed and the preparation of contract documents is well advanced.  In view of the initial statement made by the Deputy and before he puts a question about the position in general, I believe it is right for any incumbent Government to examine schemes such as this with all due speed, given that the total cost is approximately £50 million.  It would not be right to rush ahead with the expenditure of such a substantial sum of money without satisfying ourselves that it is being spent in the best possible way to get the maximum benefit for everyone.  It is in that light, in the interests of the best use of taxpayers' funds, that we decided to undertake this review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this review being conducted solely in the rather narrow context of the immediate financial requirements of the budget or is it based on some new regional development policy? If it is the latter, is the Minister in a position to indicate what attitude he or the Government are taking towards a programme of decentralisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are very much in favour of maximum regional development.  However, whether this programme, costing a substantial sum of money, is necessarily the best way of achieving regional objectives which would probably be common cause among all parties is something that the Government are addressing themselves to at the present time.  I expect to be in a position to report to the Government in the very <Col N="2078" /> near future and they will then be in a position to assess the situation, bearing in mind not just financial considerations but also social, regional and other considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that tenders were in for the offices of the Department of Agriculture in Cavan town?  What is the position in regard to those tenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that tenders have already been received for the initial site development work, not necessarily for the entire project.  I do not know the exact date on which tenders were received, but if the Deputy said they were received before he left office I am prepared to accept that as being true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>What action will the Minister take on those tenders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As was obvious from my original reply, no action will be taken until decisions have been taken on the overall review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister had better take some action before he comes down for the by-election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister telling the House that since the change of Government a review has taken place? Have the site acquisition and the planning of the development been stopped and, if so, what has happened to the planning teams appointed for the developments in each area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the acquisition of sites where a legal commitment had already been entered into at the time the review was commenced in July is continuing.  Where consultants had been taken on to do work, again under a legal commitment, their work has been allowed to proceed.  Obviously, we do not wish to break any contractual arrangements which have been entered into.  Any further steps which would fall to be taken must await the final decision of the Government as a result of the <Col N="2079" /> review we are now undertaking.  To repeat what I have said in response to the first question, I intend to have this review completed and the decisions taken as quickly as possible.  Whatever decision is taken, nobody's interests would be served by prolonged delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Letterkenny area, is the Minister aware that a site has been provided by the local authority, that information has been sought by Letterkenny Urban Council from the Board of Works as far back as last August and, to date, that information has not been given?  Would the Minister further agree that the siting of the Government offices in Letterkenny, a decision taken by the previous Government, was to alleviate the unemployment situation there and to benefit the many employees of the public service who must travel to work in the city of Dublin? Would the Minister keep in mind that this undertaking should be a priority and must not fall under the axe of anticipated cutbacks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly bear in mind what the Deputy has said and am sure that the Government will also, in the light of the situation in Letterkenny. However, I would point out that there is nothing unusual about local authorities indicating that a site would be available. This is the case in many of the instances of centres to which decentralisation was to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that the Minister has said that the overall programme is estimated to cost £50 million, could I ask him not to take the simplistic view of not proceedings with the programme because it would save £50 million?  I take it that he is aware that that would not be true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I am aware. There obviously are certain commitments entered into which involve the payment of money which the Government cannot legally escape from paying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, apart from that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not come to a substantial sum.  I must give a complete answer to the Deputy's question.  The review in which the Government are concerned is designed to achieve the best possible use of £50 million, if we have that money available, bearing in mind that that money will, almost in its entirety, have to be borrowed abroad at substantial interest rates.  We must, as a community, ensure that we get a good rate of return, economic and social, from any expenditure of that size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite legitimate that a new Government should wish to review any major programme of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that the attitude and policy of this Government towards decentralisation or, to put it another way, assisting the regional development of this country, depends on the outcome of the review to which the Minister now refers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware that this is only part of the overall policy of regional development.  The Government recognise that it is an important part of it and regional development considerations will be given significant weight in the decisions which the Government will take on the review which I have indicated will be undertaken with all due speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering the progress which had been made prior to the change of Government on 30 June last, can the Minister tell the House why there was need for a delay of five months with, as yet, no news of that review, particularly as the matter was raised by Deputy Wilson and, in at least one case, tenders were already sought and in others sites have been acquired and planning was at a very advanced stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is being somewhat naive if he thinks that a review of this proportion concerning such a massive <Col N="2081" /> investment of public funds can be taken in the space of a month.  It requires careful examination in consultation with all the Departments concerned, to see how best we can review the situation with a view to getting the maximum return on the investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Procrastination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the previous Government, in their budget of 1981, indicated that they expected to get something in the region of £200 million from this source.  My information is that a realistic estimate now would be that the amount of money likely to be available in 1981 is closer to £100 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that approximately £90 million is available for the privatisation assets in the telecommunications industry from the private sector. That constitutes the bulk of the £100 million to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been a number of legal difficulties which were not, perhaps, foreseen when the project was launched. Many of these concern the legal situation in regard to the authority to borrow, which it was anticipated certain State agencies would have.  It was discovered that legislation was necessary to confer that authority on them.  The failure to foresee this problem has led to some difficulties.</P>
      <P>Also, there have been difficulties in relation to the provision of sites where those sites do not actually belong to the State itself, but to subsidiary bodies such as health boards and local authorities.  It was necessary to take legal advice on the proper course to follow to enable the transfers in question to be made.  The programme will proceed with all due speed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it from what the Minister has just said that he is prepared to accept that in the region of £100 million, which might have been available from the private sector, is now not going to be sought by him because of the legal difficulties which he has outlined? Would it not be more realistic for the Minister to approach the matter on the basis of finding a solution to the legal problems &mdash; which certainly are not insuperable &mdash; rather than, apparently, so easily allowing £100 million to slip from his grasp?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of allowing the money to slip out of my grasp.  My information is that certain difficulties which perhaps quite legitimately were not foreseen at the time of the conception of the programme have had to be overcome.  It is not possible to get the full £100 million this year but we will endeavour to get the balance next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to the House can the Minister detail where these newly-found legal and technical difficulties <Col N="2084" /> have arisen?  What is this excuse in aid of?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Significant progress had been made towards reaching the target of £100 million this year.  This has been achieved after much detailed negotiation and in addition much effort has gone into the additional new demands in terms of their effect on balance of payments financing.  Our ability to effect the full take-up is dependent on the satisfactory resolution of some matters.  These include the problem of the authority to borrow of the private company established by the previous Government, namely, Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited.  It was discovered that that company being non-statutory and private were not authorised to borrow against the guarantee of the Minister for Finance.  Consequently it was necessary to make arrangements for a statutory provision for that body so as to give them the requisite power.  Similar situations issued in regard to the vocational education committees and the health boards. The agreement of these bodies to any financial arrangement had to be obtained in each individual case but it is the judgment of the Department of Finance that for this reason at least it is unlikely that the proposals can be implemented in this financial year.  The probability of a shortfall of this size was conceded during a review of the budgetary position by the Department of Finance some time in September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the same legal arguments and difficulties to which he refers raised their heads as far back as April last but that solutions to them were found?  Is he aware also that there are many precedents for this borrowing?  For instance, there is the precedent of the Irish Steel Board, of the National Oil Corporation and many others.  The excuse being given concerning a situation of the type that has existed for many years is very simplistic. Is the Minister, aware, too, that in this House last week the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said that almost £100 million was available for the Irish <Col N="2085" /> Telecommunications Investments programme? Would the Minister like to comment on the fact that no private sector investment is being sought for the decentralisation programme referred to in the last question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated that £90 million would be available for the Irish Telecommunications Investments programme. That is close enough to £100 million and it is consistent with the statement made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I do not believe in proceeding to borrow money without having the necessary and statutory authority to do so.  The Deputy has cited precedents but I am not sure that precedents of that sort are entirely apt.  It is important that if money is being borrowed against the guarantee of the Minister for Finance and, consequently, the Irish people, all due care is taken to ensure that the borrowing is carried out on a proper, statutory and legal basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not appear to understand the problem he is outlining.  Am I right in thinking that he has referred on the one hand to borrowing and on the other to the question of guaranteeing the borrowing?  Does he not understand that these are two separate items and that the precedent referred to by Deputy Reynolds in the cases in which borrowing has taken place related to borrowing that was not guaranteed by the State and that in the cases to which he refers the borrowing would be possible without a guarantee from the State?  His concern in regard to the guarantee is really for those lending the money rather than for the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the House will agree that money which is borrowed under guarantee may be repaid by a body other than the State, if that body works successfully but that in the event of it not working successfully, the repayment falls to the State.  It is my conviction that every possible precaution must be taken in respect of the giving of guarantees by the State because the taxpayer is the one who <Col N="2086" /> will have to find the money if the body other than the State collapses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest published figure for consumer prices is that for mid-August 1981.  This showed a rise of 5.6 per cent over mid-May 1981.  It is not possible at this stage to predict accurately the CPI for the next two quarters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister the estimated figures for mid-November 1981 and mid-February 1982. We have now passed the mid-November 1981 date.  Is the Minister telling us that he cannot estimate the two figures requested?  Surely there is an accurate estimate at this stage of the mid-November figure and a reasonably accurate estimate of the mid-February 1982 figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could answer the question by quoting from a reply to a similar question on another occasion put to the then Minister, Mr. O'Kennedy.  He said that it was not possible at that stage to predict accurately how inflation would go for the remainder of the year having regard to such facts as the price of oil and of other commodities. He indicated that because of the many variable factors that could affect inflation <Col N="2087" /> in the following months it was not possible to give the type of reply Deputy Fitzgerald is seeking now.  Therefore, I am following a well-established precedent.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister cannot give an accurate figure at this stage but the question asked for an estimate.  Can the Minister confirm that there are estimates available although he may choose not to release them?  Specifically, I take it that the Minister is using some estimates of likely price rises in the context of formulating both budgetary policy and the Government's approach to any prospective pay increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be <Col N="2088" /> aware from his experience in Government, estimates of this sort are being prepared by the Department of Finance all the time.  Of course there are estimates available to me but it has not been the practice to publish this type of information.

Is he not aware that if he releases the figure on the file, no matter what it is, it will clarify the situation and will not cause unnecessary doubts and fears among the trade union movement and complicate further a situation which has been badly handled by the Government?</P>

      <P>Now that we have dragged from the Minister the fact that Councillor FitzGerald is employed in his Department in a consultancy capacity, could he tell us what fees are involved for this consultancy?  Secondly, could he explain how he can square the appointment of the special adviser, Mr. Prendergast, and of this consultant with the declaration made by the Taoiseach in his last Ard-Fheis speech that he would not become involved in &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo;? He did, of course, leave out the girls.</P>

I will take all steps to ensure that that is the case in so far as the non-established civil servants are concerned.  The case of Mrs. Eithne FitzGerald is a different one.  She is not becoming a non-established civil servant and for that reason the initial situation would not apply.  This adviser will work approximately two to three days a week and during the engagement will be paid a rate of £55 a day.  She will be required to perform any duties that may be assigned to her from time to time by direction of the Minister for Finance <Col N="2093" /> and the Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare as appropriate to the engagement and, in particular, as I have said, will be concerned with the preparation of the social aspects of the national plan.</P>

If this embargo is now lifted for this particular appointment will it be lifted in <Col N="2095" /> other areas that are even more important than this one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that previous Ministers for Finance have had special advisers, at least one of whom was at the same salary level and assistant secretary rank as Mr. Prendergast has now been appointed to, I am merely filling a post that in effect has been there in the past.  I believe that is reasonable.  I believe it is essential for the Government to be in a position to do their work with the best possible advice.  As I pointed out when this matter was criticised through the public press, it is quite normal in continental countries for Ministers to have special assistants with a political background.  I believe the information and the expertise they have obtained in the course of their political activity is useful to them in performing the functions which are to be assigned to them, but as long as they remain civil servants they will not engage in political activity. I intend to ensure that that is the case.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the Department of Finance are the most influential Department in the State, because this Department control the finances of the State?  In view of the very central role of the Department in our public administration it must be questionable, so far as the public are concerned, that the chief organiser for the Fine Gael Party is seen to be in a position of very considerable influence in relation to the activities of that Department and the decisions which are made in that Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The embargo on recruitment still operates.  This appointment has been made, as have the other appointments of special advisers, exceptional to that embargo, because quite clearly the embargo was introduced within a few weeks of the Government coming to office.  It was not possible for the Government to decide whom they wished to appoint to all of these posts in the short time available to them between the time they took office and 21 July when the embargo came into operation.  It is quite normal in that situation, because of the political transition involved, that appointments of this sort, subject to the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, should be made.  I am convinced that this is a correct appointment and that such appointments, so long as the people involved do not directly engage in politics, <Col N="2097" /> is a very useful contribution to public administration.</P>

Can we take it from that that the Minister no longer takes any advice from the Members of his party or his backbenchers? With the number of those new appointments at the government table and in every Minister's office has it become clear now to the members of the Government that they are incompetent and cannot manage their jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite the contrary.  The Government recognise that they need to bring in people of talent who can advise them on the extremely acute problems they inherited from the previous Government.

      <P>I assume the Deputy wishes to have the data requested in respect of all State bodies rather than just State companies.  As the Deputy will be aware, it is not the practice to furnish replies on matters of day-to-day administration of State bodies.  I am, however, prepared to give global figures for State bodies, the pay of whose staff forms part of the public sector pay bill, including health and fisheries boards.</P>
      <P>My reply relates to vacancies as of 21 July, the date from which the embargo applied since data are not readily available in some instances in relation to 1 July.</P>
      <P>There were the equivalent of 869 full-time vacancies on 21 July.  A total of 684 have not been filled, of which 11 have been identified as not having been filled for reasons other than the Government embargo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the introduction of this limitation on the very rapid increase in the numbers employed in the State sector is that we had reached the point when this Government took office where that process could simply not continue.  Our borrowing capacity was endangered by the irresponsible financial policies pursued by the previous Government.

If we did not take action to restrict the uncontrolled growth of public spending that occurred under the previous Government we ran the risk of being faced with the choice of imposing an unacceptable level of taxation or simply no longer being able to pay our way.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we begin our normal business I would like to refer to the brutal murder, by the Provisional IRA, of the Reverend Robert Bradford, MP in Belfast on Saturday last.  His death and that of Mr. Ken Campbell, caretaker at the Finaghy Community Centre, are part of a calculated series of atrocities committed in recent days.  I know that all the people we represent share the sense of sorrow, anger and outrage widely felt in Northern Ireland at present.</P>
      <P>The killing of an elected representative of the people calls for particular condemnation in the strongest possible terms and serves to remind us of the real objectives of the organisation responsible.  The IRA has once again shown its utter contempt for human life and for the democratic process which it has recently sought to distort for its own ends.  Its true attitude to democracy and freedom was summed up in a recent statement of an IRA spokesman who, when asked by an interviewer for a foreign newspaper about the wishes of the people in this part of the country concerning an aspect of reunification, replied, &ldquo;We call the shots.  We don't really give a damn what they want&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The first clear objective of the killers of Mr. Bradford was to incite vengeance among Loyalist extremists and thus to expose once again to murderous retaliation the innocent among the most vulnerable community in this island, the Catholics of Northern Ireland.  This has already begun to happen.  The sectarian killings of Belfast and Lurgan are a direct and intended result of the Provisionals' campaign of recent weeks, a campaign itself trenchantly described last Saturday by John Hume as one of &ldquo;sectarian genocide&rdquo; directed against Protestants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with those brave and responsible <Col N="2154" /> leaders, clerical and lay, in Northern Ireland who have said to the Unionists and Loyalists: &ldquo;Do not become the prisoners of the Provisional IRA's strategy. Do not respond as they have intended and planned that you should do &mdash; in anger and in a manner that could escalate violence to new levels of horror and ultimately undermine your rights and liberties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Rev. Mr. Bradford had, for some time, considered an attempt on his life to be a strong possibility.  It is a tribute to his courage that he did not flinch from that danger.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the House I would ask you, Ceann Comhairle, to extend our deepest sympathy to Mrs. Bradford and her family.</P>

We condemn also the murder of Ken Campbell and Thomas McNulty and the grievous wounding of Stephen Murphy, who are all the most recent victims of the tragic violence in Northern Ireland.

      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 3, 11, 12 (resumed), 13 and 14.  By agreement the proceedings on Fourth and Fifth Stages of the Finance (No. 2) Bill, 1981, if not previously concluded, will be brought to a conclusion at 6.40 p.m. today by putting from the Chair the question necessary to bring them to a conclusion and the question to be put from the <Col N="2155" /> Chair shall be, as the case may require, that all amendments set down by the Minister for Finance, including any requiring recommittal, and not disposed of, are hereby made to the Bill, and recommittals on Fourth Stage are hereby completed and the Bill is hereby passed. If the proceedings on the Finance (No. 2) Bill have not concluded before 6.40 p.m. Private Members' Business will commence immediately on the conclusion of the proceedings of the Finance (No. 2) Bill.  Otherwise Private Members' Business will be from 7 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., Item No. 30.</P>

      <P>The reason the Taoiseach has not got agreement for taking the Bill tomorrow is that the Order of Business for the week has already been settled between the parties and the whip has gone out to our Deputies on the basis of that agreement.  Is the Taoiseach aware that we have been circulated with a schedule of the legislation it is hoped to complete in the current session and that no further Finance Bill is included in that schedule?  Is it proposed to bring forward another Finance Bill before the end of this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is proposed to do so but given the time schedule it does not appear possible to get it through the House in the time.  The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that if the Bill is settled and published and they have a clear indication of the basis of the scheme they can take the necessary precautionary measures to prepare for it in advance of the Bill being enacted.  In those circumstances and given the pressure of legislation, we do not think it likely that this <Col N="2156" /> Bill can get through although it will be published in this session.  If the business of the House proceeds more rapidly than seems probable we will be happy to have it through but realistically it seems to me, and the Leader of the Opposition seeing the list of legislation may agree, that it would be difficult to get it through in this session as well.</P>

Is this not at variance with the undertaking given many times by both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance that this legislation would be enacted during this session?  Can the Taoiseach inform us whether it is possible that this scheme can be brought into operation next April if the legislation has not been passed through the House this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been advised that it will be possible to do so if the legislation is prepared and published. The Revenue Commissioners can take the necessary precautionary steps that we contemplated if the Bill was not put through in this session.  If it is possible to get it through we will still aim at that but there is a difficulty because of the number of Bills that have to be passed, and if we are satisfied, as we are, by the Revenue Commissioners assurances in this matter then it has not the same priority as it had when it was previously indicated to us that unless it was passed there might be difficulty getting it into effect.  It will be brought into effect next April and that is the guiding principle behind the Government's approach in the matter.</P>

      <P>When is it proposed to have the Bill circulated to Deputies?  Is it necessary, and is it the intention, that the legislation should be passed before next <Col N="2157" /> April or is the Taoiseach now saying that the scheme will come into operation next April even though the legislation has not been passed through both Houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is no question about that.  The scheme could only come into effect if the legislation is passed.  The question was whether it was necessary to have it passed or merely published in order for the necessary administrative action to be taken to prepare for its implementation.  It is on that issue that the position seems to be somewhat different from what we were originally informed.  It would be preferable for the legislation to be put through in this session as a separate Bill to the Finance Bill following the budget.  If we can get through the legislative programme we have and deal with this Bill as well I would be much happier.  The Bill will be published in early December.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there are some Bills in the schedule of legislation which are not of great importance or significance and could be postponed if there was real anxiety on behalf of the Government to take this third Finance Bill?

      <P>As regards the legislation I am informed that it is all urgent and requires to be got through before Christmas for a variety of reasons.  If the Leader of the Opposition wishes to go into that I would be happy to discuss it with him or deal with any questions subsequently. I do not have the list before me.  As we have only recently been advised of the change in position and the feasibility of the measure being brought into effect in April even if not enacted by Christmas the Government have not had the opportunity to take a decision on whether it is to be one or two Bills.  The intention as it stands is to produce a Bill dealing with tax reform in this session and to deal with it separately.  We could <Col N="2158" /> review that and see whether we will do the two together, but for the present that is the procedure we intend to implement. As I said, the Bill will be published in early December.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that it is unusual and, I believe most people would agree, most undersirable that before the details of the legislation are published &mdash; we are told now that this legislation will not be published until early December &mdash; advertisements are appearing in the public press which are giving rise to certain impressions among the general public with large questions unanswered?  Will he accept that from the point of view of the general public the whole situation is very confusing and that this is a most unorthodox and undesirable procedure for the Government to adopt?  Will he at least endeavour to convey to us and to the general public the full details of what is proposed in this taxation transfer?  If we have to wait to get the full details until the publication of the legislation early in December the general public will be very confused as to what exactly is going to happen and how the scheme is going to work.  Is there any way in which the Taoiseach even at this stage could give details of what is going to happen, who is to be included, who is to be excluded and so on?</P>

      <P>We have been advised that the advertisements are necessary in <Col N="2159" /> order that the new measures will be brought into effect.  Unless adequate notice is given &mdash; we are advised it should be given at this stage &mdash; so that people who would be entitled to the £9.60 per week can apply in time, the administrative processes cannot be completed in time for next April.  That is why the advertisements are necessary at this stage.  The whole procedure will be carried through and the tax reform, however much the Opposition may regret it, will be through this House and in effect next April.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition seems a little perverse on this subject.  I have explained to him that the reason the advertisments were issued was to ensure that people would apply for the £9.60 in time because it is necessary that they do so.  The Revenue Commissioners do not have available to them the names of people who would be entitled in every case, more particularly because of the extension of the scheme so that it will apply to people in lower income groups who are not paying or liable for income tax at present.  For that reason it is necessary to advertise early to get the people to apply.  We had to take the advice given to us on that and insert the advertisements accordingly.  For the rest, it is a matter for the Bill which will be published in early December.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Taoiseach said, that the main purpose of these advertisements is to get the housewives to register for the purpose of the scheme. That is self-evident.  I must draw the Taoiseach's attention to the fact that all the tables and all the explanations given in these advertisements indicate a basic income tax rate of 25 per cent.  Is the Taoiseach now telling me that that is misleading and that the Government have not yet decided that the basic rate <Col N="2161" /> of income tax for next year will be 25 per cent?</P>

      <P>I have.  There was a useful and mature debate on the Criminal Justice Bill in the Seanad.  It is a great pity that we have this delay now in the continuation of this plot in this House.  I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that this matter is dealt with fairly quickly as it is of public concern outside where it is resulting in some idle and useless speculation in the media.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very anxious to do that and the opportunity for that would be to take the Bill tomorrow.  The Leader of the Opposition has said that the reason for refusing to take it tomorrow is that it was not on the Order of Business as sent out.  The difficulty is that we could not put it on that Order of Business properly until it had passed the Seanad.  As it was sent out last Thursday, having passed the Seanad at that stage, it could not be on that Order of Business. The following morning as soon as we knew it had passed the Seanad we contacted the Opposition with the proposal that the Bill be taken tomorrow.  If I recall correctly the Leader of the Opposition asked me in this House how soon after the Seanad we would take it and I indicated to him immediately.  I was disconcerted on proceeding to take it immediately to be told that we could not take <Col N="2162" /> it immediately.  As the contents of the Bill are well known it seems unreasonable, but I have to tell Deputy Kemmy that that is the position as it stands.</P>

      <P>I must say something in this for the benefit of both the Taoiseach and of Deputy Kemmy, who finds himself a little perturbed about procedures.  I am a little perturbed about the procedures. It is well settled practice in this House that the Order of Business for a week is settled between the Whips and on the basis of that agreed settlement a whip is sent out to the members of this party and, I presume, to Members of the other parties. Our spokesmen have to prepare themselves for the legislation coming before the House.  It is quite unacceptable to us, as it would have been unacceptable to Fine Gael when they were in Opposition, that an arrangement is arrived at by the Whips to settle the business for the coming week, a whip is sent out on that basis and subsequent to that the Government decide to change their mind and take other business.  That procedure has never been adopted in this House and it cannot be accepted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This section imposes the duty on beer as a result of the July budget and this is consistent with a case we made here last week.  We believe that in this area there is a diminishing return and that the budget is contributing to the CPI figures and their effects on the possible effort to save the national wage agreement or centralised bargaining.  I welcome the Government's change of heart which has moved from the damaging 6.5 per cent <Col N="2165" /> report I referred to so often.  Apparently an air of realism has at last entered Government thinking on pay, pay negotiations and centralised bargaining.  I hope this belated effort is successful because it would be far more acceptable than a free-for-all which might create a great deal of industrial chaos.  It was an indictment of the Government who did not have the necessary commitment in this area and produced unrealistic figures and possibly encouraged equally frightening figures on the other side.  At last they have now shown a sense of reality.  Centralised bargaining and a new wage agreement would be welcomed by all.</P>
    <P>Last week we heard revenue was increasing and gallonage was increasing less rapidly.  As I said, we are reaching the stage of diminishing returns, the budget is contributing to the CPI index and unemployment in the State generally. Therefore I recommend that my amendment be agreed to.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Gene Fitzgerald was Minister for Finance he was fully aware of the problems that existed.  In his January 1981 budget he imposed a tax of 6p on the pint.  If he was concerned about the problems he is listing here today he would not have done that.  That puts his proposals in the proper context.</P>
      <P>Our proposal is based on a recognition that revenue had to be obtained quickly to fill a yawning and widening gap in the nation's public finances &mdash; what was obtained in revenue and what was being spent by the Government when we took over.  We had to decide on a range of tax options to get some revenue into the Exchequer to offset, in part at least, the dramatic imbalance that had grown up in the six month period between the January budget and when Fianna Fáil left office.  The budget target, which had been set a few months previously, had gone completely out of line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making our decision we had a limited choice because in a budget introduced in the middle of a year one is confined to indirect tax measures.  It is not possible to introduce changes in the <Col N="2166" /> income tax system in the middle of the year.  That must be done in the annual budget because it is income which is computed on an annual basis.  Therefore we were forced by events to turn to indirect taxes.  One of those taxes to which we had to turn was the tax on beer.  I readily concede there are problems here.  Beer consumption has decreased, not so much because of this budget but because of the two previous Fianna Fáil budgets which imposed taxes of 6p in February 1980 and another 6p in 1981.  That obviously causes problems not only for those engaged in the manufacture of this product but it poses problems for the Government because the buoyancy of revenue from this tax is diminished.  As I said, I recognise those problems but we were forced by a very serious financial situation to take this action.  It would be impossible for us to withdraw this tax at this stage because it would throw our budget out of joint.  In this budget we provided money for improvements in social welfare benefits and to maintain services which would have ground to a halt if the previous Government's budgetary dispositions had been allowed to stand.  I have no choice but to reject the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Minister's rejection of the amendment.  His whole theme throughout the debate on this Bill is being maintained.  This budget was an over-reaction by the Government. It was a simple plank in the propaganda exercise against Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil were their first target and the public service generally was the second.  I am glad to see that there has been some easing in the second attack and that is not difficult to understand in view of what we heard in the House today, all the imports into the Department of Finance and elsewhere. I am glad that to some extent the attack on the civil service has been lessened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course the Government are blind to the fact that because of a decision taken by the last Coalition Government in the seventies a census of the population was postponed, depriving two administrations of vital statistics.  We were not able to ascertain how many schools were <Col N="2167" /> needed, if extra teaching posts were necessary and so on.  In rejecting this amendment the Minister is displaying all of the inconsistencies he has imputed to me.  I have not denied that the imposition of indirect taxation had become more and more unpleasant, but the Minister may remember his comments early this year about the charges we were imposing. Remembering such comments it is hard to understand how he can reject this amendment.  I do not see why the words I have selected should not be deleted.</P>

      <P>This refers to the increasing excise duty on spirits.  Whatever may be said about diminishing returns on beer, it is evident that that theory applies particularly to spirits after this budget with the consequential increase in VAT as from 1 September. When on these benches a few months ago, Deputies Bruton, Fitzpatrick and others described the duty on spirits as too high.  Those people who then attacked us so strongly have now imposed this huge increase in excise duty on spirits, another over-reaction by the Government which brings us on to diminishing returns.  It is another item that will contribute to the CPI increase and that is of tremendous importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I what the effect of this will be on the CPI.  He knows that by mid-February inflation will have reached 22 per cent plus, and a considerable proportion of that will be due to budgetary actions taken by the Government since they came to office.  If the Government had not imposed unnecessary increase on the CPI through this <Col N="2168" /> budget the Minister's colleague who is trying to rescue the wages pact might have some hope of success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the argument made by the Deputy here is similar to that made by him in favour of the previous amendment, and inevitably the argument I will make in response will have to have certain similarity with that which I made on the earlier amendment. I will try to avoid repeating myself.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should cast his mind back to the budgets of 1980 and 1981 and compare them with this budget which introduced an increase of 2p on the price of a glass of whiskey.  That was followed by increases amounting to 7.2p per glass, making the total increase 9.2p, a modest increase by comparison with the last two budgets of the Government in which Deputy Fitzgerald was Minister for Finance.  In January 1981, when he was Minister for Finance, he increased the price of whiskey by 12p, 25 per cent greater than the increase I have imposed. In the February budget of 1980 he increased the price of whiskey by 16p a glass, almost twice the increase in the July budget this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Minister brought the duty content of the price of a glass of whiskey to more than 54 per cent.  This budget, which we have admitted to be a difficult and a hard one in difficult and hard times, brought the duty content of the price of a glass of whiskey to 52.2 per cent.  The increases in Deputy Fitzgerald's budgets were a good deal more severe, though they were imposed in relatively easy times economically, which is admitted.  I should like to point out to the Deputy opposite that his protestations about the effect of the increase on buoyancy of sales of whiskey ring rather hollow when one bears in mind that during 1980 there had been a decline of 7.3 per cent in the consumption of spirits and yet in full knowledge of that trend in the consumption of spirits he proceeded to impose 12p on a glass of whiskey.  The Deputy opposite was claiming at the time that the economy was in good fettle and there was no need for hard measures.  He proceeded to have a budget with a substantial <Col N="2169" /> current budget deficit which, in fact, was far exceeded in practice during the year, while he remained Minister for Finance up to June.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to recall those facts and to bring them to the Deputy's attention. They put the Deputy's case in some context.  I do not see a lot of point in a tit-for-tat discussion across the House. All Ministers for Finance have to introduce tax measures which, if they were in Opposition they would find themselves having to condemn.  That is par for the course and I do not think Deputy Fitzgerald is making an original discovery in finding that fact of political life.  If the Deputy was on this side of the House and some other members of my party, or myself, was on the Opposition side obviously one would have to go through, as is one's duty as an Opposition, the measure of criticising whatever the Government were doing because it is only through such criticism that improvements can be made in the policies concerned.  I accept that but neither of us should try to pretend that we are holier than the other in this type of comparison.  I do not think that would be the case.</P>
    <P>I recognise the problems there are in regard to the consumption of whiskey and I recognise the problem of diminishing returns.  It was, therefore, with great reluctance that the Government decided to introduce the budget containing increases in the price of those products but we did it because we felt we had to get the revenue in order to put the finances of the country on a somewhat better footing than they were when we took office.  Unfortunately, the process is not by any means complete.  There remains much to be done in the matter of giving Ireland sound public finances upon which we can defend the value of our currency and defend living standards on a predictable and secure basis for our people.  We intend to continue with the work we have in hand even though from time to time that may bring with it some unpopularity and worse still, the condemnations of Deputy Fitzgerald.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last day I do <Col N="2170" /> not think I availed of the opportunity of congratulating the Minister on his appointment or on his recent marriage and I should like to do so now.  The Minister made the point that in all budget debates there is a tit-for-tat discussion, that it was remarkable the flexibility one got when one changed sides in the House. I can recall listening to Deputy Bruton when in Opposition lambasting the former Minister for Finance regarding increases in the price of spirits but I suppose that is politics.  The point I should like to raise about indirect tax increases is whether they are appropriate at all.  We seem to have assumed on all sides that we should keep loading more and more on to indirect taxes.  The reasons for this are obvious because it is by far the easiest way to collect money.  Officials in the various Departments can tell what a percentage increase, whether it is in VAT or in exise duty, will realise in revenue. Since the purpose of indirect taxation is to collect money it is a ready source for Ministers for Finance to collect revenue. There has been a recent phenomenon in Irish political life in regard to indirect tax increases in that people seem to want less direct taxation so that they can have more money in the pockets to spend in whatever way they wish.  We seem to have come to accept that we should give people more control over their own spending.  There may be some political benefit in doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I became a Member of this House there have been mass street demonstrations by the PAYE sector demanding that the level of direct taxation be reduced.  I can recall when Ministers for Finance at budget time thought about increasing the appropriate rate of tax.  At one time a 10 per cent surcharge was put on the tax rates from 35 per cent upwards. That surcharge made the 35 per cent rate 38½ per cent and the 45 per cent rate 49½ per cent and so on.  However, in recent years pre-budget leaks do not talk of an increase in direct taxation because it is accepted that we must give more to the taxpayer by reducing direct taxation.  We seem to have strayed away on both sides, from the idea of ever again increasing direct taxation.  If I hold a point of view <Col N="2171" /> for a number of years and I do not see it working I do not stick rigidly to it and since everyone has gone down the road advocating less direct taxation and more indirect taxation we should examine the situation to see if we have gone too far down the road of indirect taxation and forgetting to consider direct taxation.</P>
    <P>I am sure I will not be popular nor will anybody else, for hinting that there might be an increase in direct taxation but we may have gone too far in one extreme just as we did in regard to direct taxation. Then, we were taking too much out of pay packets.  Just as I believe we went too far in regard to direct taxation some years ago I believe we are now going too far in the other direction.  It is time we examined this matter.  In the context of all indirect taxes I am certain that the law of diminishing returns has been breached not alone in this budget but for the last two years.  I am sure that figures will show that the volume of spirits, beer and cigarettes consumed has gone down and it may not be as effective any more for Ministers for Finance to turn to indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>A most alarming thing about this return to indirect taxation is that it has a disastrous effect on the consumer price index.  I can appreciate why workers want their wages to increase in line with rises in the CPI but the effect that the price of drink has on the CPI is disproportionate. I believe it represents a weighting in the CPI of about 11.1 per cent.  It is a reflection on our people that we spend that proportion of our income on drink.  If a new household survey is carried out I believe it will show that the percentage of people's income now being spent on drink is decreasing.  I do not think it will continue at that level.  The consumer of drink has been hit so hard over a number of years he has changed his attitude a little.  Nowadays a drink and a box of matches cost £1.</P>
    <P>We must examine the effects this increase will have on the CPI.  Perhaps the CPI should not include increases in the price of drink.  I am not making that case on this Bill.  If an increase in the CPI due to an increase in the price of drink <Col N="2172" /> means that we will have higher inflation, people will look for more wages.  Logically this means we are encouraging people to look for increased wages so that they can drink more.  Drinking forms an important part of our society, but it is not all that important.  We must ask has the time come to consider taking increases in the price of drink out of the CPI.  It is used for everything nowadays. A person drawing up a five-year rent agreement puts in a clause about the proportion to the CPI.  We are not getting to grips with inflation.  Increases in the price of drink play a more important part in increases in the CPI than increases in the price of meat or food.  For those reasons I am against increases in the price of spirits in this section of the Bill.</P>

      <P>We now come to the penal imposition on motorists in this Bill.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say X pounds, shillings and pence were imposed in January 1981 or in January 1980.  On these benches he and some of his colleagues spoke with vigour, sympathy and compassion about the farmers, the workers and other sections of the community when they said motoring was no longer a luxury.  Over the past decade the burden on motorists has been too high.  This is an easy way out in a budget which I submit was not necessary.  I do not want to go over the old arguments.  This imposition on petrol and other oils should not be proceeded with.  I appeal to the Minister to put into practice what he was saying in this House in the early months of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reiterate what Deputy Fitzgerald said.  The price of motoring has been increased consistently not only through increases in taxation but through ordinary price rises. Every few months the price of petrol <Col N="2174" /> seems to go up.  The imposition on people who have to use their cars to go to and from work is too heavy.  When the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Ryan, introduced an increase of 15p on a gallon of petrol he said it was to encourage people to walk to work.  It is not possible for people in my constituency in Kildare or the Minister's constituency in Meath to walk to and from Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Defence, used to recommend that workers in Kildare and Meath who travelled to and from Dublin should get a tax allowance for their motoring costs.  Because this section increases the cost of motoring, I would ask the Minister to endeavour to devise some system under which people living in County Kildare who must travel up to 100 miles daily are compensated.  As the Minister is aware, there are many people also in County Meath who must make similar journeys.  Perhaps some system could be devised under which such people would be allowed travelling expenses to and from work.  I am aware of the difficulties the Revenue Commissioners would encounter in endeavouring to frame such a section.  Suffice it to say that the present income tax laws preclude a person in employment from claiming the costs of travelling to and from his or her place of employment whereas their neighbour in business may be allowed such costs.  It is not as simple as saying that he will always be allowed the cost because of the wording of the PAYE section of the income tax code, schedule E, and under schedule D in regard to self-employed people.  However I do not think it should be beyond the competence of the Minister and his officials to devise some way of allowing such people some compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The traditional argument advanced is that such an allowance would be abused. Questions have been raised as to how it could be enforced and so on.  Certainly motoring costs constitute a severe imposition on people in my constituency, in that of the Minister and also those living <Col N="2175" /> in County Wicklow, who must travel to Dublin daily to their place of employment having a round trip of, say, 100 miles or a minimum round trip of some 40 miles.  In the light of this section, which increases the burden on those people further, I would ask the Minister to consider such allowance at a future date and request his Department to devise a system under which these people could be granted some compensation for their motoring costs.</P>
    <P>This is another section which increases the indirect taxes, excise duties or whatever one likes to call them, but which in any event increase the costs of motoring. We have arrived at the stage when motoring is no longer a luxury; people use their cars out of necessity.  We are now crippling the ordinary person who must travel to and from his place of employment by car.  Perhaps the Minister would consider this point when framing his next Finance Bill in an endeavour to relieve his constitutents and mine, which would be much appreciated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Having made much of the case made by Deputy McCreevy in the past on behalf of motorists from my constituency and his who must travel considerable distances to and from work I have a lot of sympathy for the case he is making.</P>
      <P>I shall deal with the section first and then with the point made by Deputy McCreevy.  The increase in the price of petrol as a result of the budget, it would be fair to say, was the one aspect of the budget about which I had the greatest reluctance.  I do recognise that for many people there is no choice but to travel to work by car considerable distances at considerable cost or else not work at all. Unfortunately, as has been pointed out earlier in this debate &mdash; and I think agreed in part on both sides &mdash; first of all the Government had no choice but to turn to indirect taxes in a supplementary budget, because one cannot introduce other taxes in a supplementary budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2176" /> Secondly, we could not have put on more taxes on either drink or cigarettes than we did because we were already in the position of diminishing returns. Therefore we were left with no option but to return to the main residual source of taxation, namely, that on the price of petrol.  Had it been possible to introduce other taxes which would have avoided this eventuality and still achieve the relatively modest rectification of our financial position which the budget did achieve, obviously I would have done so, because I did not wish to introduce a substantial increase on the price of petrol.  There was no choice whatever but to introduce the tax that was introduced or otherwise face the prospect of not doing anything significant about putting our finances in order.  It was in that context that the Government reluctantly had to introduce the measures they did.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy made a point about the possible introduction of an allowance against taxation for motoring expenses incurred by employed people going to and from their place of employment.  I have a lot of sympathy with this concept because I recognise that employed people are at some disadvantage in that a self-employed person may be able to charge such expenses against his work or business and use some petrol expenses in that context.  In fact he may be working from the moment he leaves his home.  He may be working at home and legitimately may be able to claim expenses of that sort not open to the employed person to claim to quite the same extent.  Obviously this imposes a problem as far as the PAYE person is concerned.</P>
    <P>However, I should like to say two things: first of all, any allowance of that sort would be very difficult to administer because there would arise the necessity to have vouching for petrol expenses. Also the attribution of petrol expenses as between journeys to and from work and other journeys which would not be allowable would impose a massive paperwork burden on the Revenue Commissioners who have already more than sufficient such burdens.  Secondly, there is the fact that under our present tax system anything like that given in the form of a tax <Col N="2177" /> allowance would be essentially regressive in operation because a person with a very high income paying the bulk of his tax at the 60p rate would receive far more benefit from such allowance &mdash; because it would be worth 60p in the £ to him &mdash; than would somebody with a relatively low income paying in the 35p band, when it would be worth 35p in the £ only to him in terms of an offset against his tax.  I know this is an objection which is inherent in the whole concept of tax allowances. The addition of a new tax allowance would merely constitute one further step in aggravation of what is an inherent injustice in the system.</P>
    <P>The major purpose of the Government's tax reform programme is to move away from the allowance system to the tax credit system which will not have the same regressive effect.  But, as the tax system stands at present, those objections stand against the suggestions made by Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    <P>The third point I should make is one that is very obvious indeed, that is, that any tax allowance reduces revenue substantially. Deputy McCreevy I know appreciates that the scope for reducing revenue in present economic circumstances is very limited indeed.  I suppose that is an overriding and almost conclusive objection, at present at any rate, to the proposal he is making.  I have urged what he has urged in the past.  I am sympathetic towards the case and should the opportunity arise I will be more than happy to introduce it, but I cannot see that happening in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>I regret the Minister has not seen his way to accepting my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to a few points raised by him when he referred to the tax allowance and the changes he is now introducing by way of tax credits instead of the old tax free allowances as we knew them.  I said in the House last week, in anticipation that if he was introducing these advertisements at the weekend we in the House deserved to be told what they would contain in advance of their being publicised, as they were in Sunday's <Col N="2178" /> papers.  The Minister refused to be drawn in the House.  He played his cards very close to his chest.  Not only was he unfair to the House but it transpired that the composition of the advertisements published, as was indicated in the House earlier today, seemed to give the impression that certain decisions had been taken by the Government because of assumptions made in those advertisements.  The Taoiseach was not forthcoming.  He was non-committal in his replies to our leader in the House today.</P>
    <P>To say the least of it, the advertisements that appeared since last week are confusing and difficult to understand.  I suspect that they will be the subject of debate in this House at some time although now, judging by what we heard on the Order of Business today, not as has been promised by the Minister for Finance when he said that we would have a discussion on this whole new tax system before Christmas.  According to the Taoiseach today it will be much later than that.  Here is a section which is imposing an indirect tax charge on the CPI and obviously the introduction of any of the commitments of Fine Gael's programme last June will involve considerable transfers to the indirect taxation system with a consequent pushing up of the CPI and a fuelling of inflation.  This will have serious repercussions in the economy.  As the Minister has refused to accept my motion, I regret that I must put it to the House.</P>

We are again increasing duty on what is termed a luxury, the tax being at such a high rate.  But for the majority of people a car is not a luxury but a necessity.  I covered this point before and I do not want to go over it again.  With a 50 per cent tax imposition the cost of motoring and the cost of motor vehicles here is higher than anywhere else in Europe due to excise duties and so on.  I am afraid there will be a serious downturn in the car industry.  Whether it is directly attributable to the increases here or to a number of other factors, I am aware from a number of garages in my constituency and everywhere else that there has been a serious fall off in business in the past couple of months and they do not expect it to pick up again before the end of the year.  This may be for seasonal reasons. But again we are killing the goose that lays the golden egg and there may be some lay-offs in the car industry in the next few months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is just a re-run of what I said before.  The Government did not particularly want to introduce this increased taxation.  I find all tax increases difficult to defend because we would like to avoid them all if possible.  But I found the increase in petrol to be the one that I was most reluctant to introduce.  I would be less reserved about this one because obviously this duty falls more heavily on people who buy big and expensive cars than on people who buy smaller and less expensive cars, whereas the duty on petrol falls more heavily on people who use their cars of necessity whether the car be small or large.  I feel that in a sense the duty we are talking about here introduces a relatively progressive element into the taxation of motoring in that it falls more heavily on the larger car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy referred to trends <Col N="2180" /> in car sales.  It is difficult to interpret these because sometimes the rate of purchases before a budget increases rapidly because people think if they buy before the budget they will get it cheaper than they would get it after the budget.  So that does not indicate any underlying increase in the trend of purchases and therefore it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions from the trend in car sales that has occurred this year.  But it is worth drawing to the attention of the House that the number of private car registrations has shown a dramatic increase from about 62,000 in 1972 to almost 91,000 in 1980. We have figures up to July and in every month of this year up to July, with the exception of March, more cars were purchased this year than last year.  That would seem to indicate an upward trend in car purchases.  The overall increase this year over last year in car sales up to July is about 13 per cent.  That trend has probably changed somewhat since July, but I do not have the figures for the period subsequent to that.</P>
    <P>However, there would seem to be a relatively healthy position in the car sales market.  When one bears in mind that the substantial majority of these cars are almost wholly imported, it is not the end of the world when we see some depression as a result of the State getting revenue which it badly needs from the sale of such cars.  It may well mean that people will try to use their existing cars for a little bit longer than they would have, and in doing so they will be economising both for themselves and for the economy as a whole in terms of the balance of payments.  That is not necessarily a bad thing.  In this context I think the imposition of a higher level of excise duty on motor cars in the very difficult set of circumstances which we are faced with was a perfectly defensible and correct measure for the Government to adopt.  It is also fair to say that the tax on motor cars is a progressive tax in real terms. People who are on social welfare and on old age pensions or living in poor circumstances rarely buy motor cars.  Certainly they rarely buy new motor cars, which is what this tax effects, whereas people who are reasonably well off and have secure <Col N="2181" /> jobs and are in the upper income bracket tend to buy cars more frequently.  To that extent this is a progressive measure, redistributing to some degree the burden of taxation in our society.  It is something which the Government, both on social grounds and on the economic and budgetary grounds which I referred to earlier, can defend heartily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few comments to make.  We are seeing a new style by the Minister for Finance. First there is lack of concern for some of the really important problems that we have here. He refers very lightly to the fact that fewer cars might be sold.  Perhaps I am being parochial too.  We have a worth-while assemble industry in Cork, our second largest city.  It has a tradition going back to 1926.  It has given worthwhile employment right through that period, even through the difficult war years, and not only is it a big employer, but allied industries in the immediate area are dependent on it.  It is indefensible for a Minister for Finance to say that the imposition of tax on vehicles is of little or no consequence.  He also said it was a progressive tax.  Perhaps it is but one would gather from what the Minister said that a motor cars is a luxury&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am entitled to interpret what I thought the Minister conveyed to the House.  He seemed to say that people in certain sections of our society did not own cars and, because there were others who did, it was a luxury. I do not believe that cars are a luxury. They are essential for workers, farmers, self-employed and all people actively engaged in the ordinary affairs of society. I am disappointed he did not accept the amendment as laid down.</P>

    <P>In the reintroduction of car tax, a vendetta was launched against motorists. Since the 1977 election, there were those in the present Government who wanted retribution for the fact that people who got a rebate of car tax had defeated them. Towards that end, they deliberately set out to ensure that, at the very first opportunity, they would take great pleasure in restoring car tax.  One remembers Deputy Bruton and Deputy Fitzpatrick in opposition saying how unfair it was that the car registration fee was being increased, what an imposition it was and asking if it was car tax on the way back. Of course it was not but, uppermost in their minds, was the desire to wreak vengeance on a group who they believed had removed them from Government in 1977.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have gone over this on Committee Stage at some length.  The Government felt it was appropriate that this tax should be reintroduced.  In 1977, in an election campaign which led the people into a land of unreality, the previous Government promised to do away with motor tax.  In so doing, they narrowed our tax base by throwing away a potential source of revenue which up to that had been available to all Governments to assist in the substantial costs of maintaining out roads.  In 1977 Fianna Fáil promised they would do away with this tax, notwithstanding the fact that in so doing, they were preventing subsequent Governments from turning to this source of revenue as a means of maintaining the road system, contributing generally towards the revenue of the State, and relieving the burden on tax payers which would be imposed by other taxes which would have to be raised in the absence of motor registration tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Government, on taking office in June, decided to take action to put our finances right and to reintroduce motor tax.  This will bring in much needed revenue and it will also show that the era of unreality, when one could throw away taxes as if they did not matter, has come to an end.  Governments can no longer go <Col N="2183" /> on trying to outbid one another in promising to do away with this, that and the other tax.  We sought, in introducing this measure, to show that this era, which is responsible for the fact that we are in financial difficulty now, is at an end.  I hope that will be recognised as being a reasonable and responsible attitude on the part of the Government.  It is in the national interest and I make no excuses or apologies for it.  I appreciate Deputy Fitzgerald's opposition to it, in view of the fact that it was his party who did away with motor tax.  He probably feels perturbed that his handiwork has been undone.  It is an understandable and natural reaction but it is not the correct one in the national interest.  We simply cannot afford to do away with taxes as happened right through the seventies because, by doing that, not only have we lost revenue but we have created unreal expectations in people's minds as to our ability to pay for the services which the State must provide with a diminished tax base.  This budget marks a turning point in the finances of the nation towards reality and making due to provision for the future rather than trying to buy popularity in the present.</P>

The Minister is fully aware of the difficulties which existed in the seventies and of the reasons for such an approach.  It is dishonest of him to suggest that the 1977 Fianna Fáil manifesto raised expectations when one compares it with the bonanza offered by Fine Gael in its pre-election programme. The Minister has no idea of what expectations have been raised by the £9.60 promised in the budget.  Who is to get this money and how will it be given?  How will discrimination and division be avoided?  The Minister has no idea of the problems which he has created in that <Col N="2184" /> respect.  I merely wished to answer the two points advanced by the Minister.</P>

      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 24 to 26.</P>
      <P>This is a short deletion of two lines, but the most important deletion of the whole section because it covers the increase in the rate of VAT from 10 to 15 per cent on the lower rate.  All the arguments have been raised for and against this increase, but I still believe that the increase should never have been imposed.  Last July I said that the effects of this, commencing in September, would be on-going for some time to come.</P>
      <P>The range of commodities and items affected, by short definition standards, exclude luxury goods and essential foodstuffs and clothing but the 10 per cent VAT rating applies to almost everything else.  This will affect the farm, the home, the work place, industry, entertainment, services &mdash; right across the board.  None of the Minister's arguments advanced today change my party's view that that penal imposition should not have been made.  I ask why it was the 10 per cent rate which was taken.  This was for purely political reasons.  The higher rate could not be touched and the income from the 10 per cent rate is enormous.  This is a penal imposition on almost every household, concerning items which are for the most part essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage, I asked the Minister for the Department's estimate of the total VAT to be collected in 1982 as a result of the increase in the rate from 10 to 15 per cent.  Perhaps he will be able to give this information in his reply.  I also on Committee Stage asked the Minister to consider on this section giving up the idea of having two rates of VAT, which are now 15 and 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When VAT was originally imposed in 1972 the rates were 5.26 per cent and <Col N="2185" /> 16.37 per cent.  Subsequently these were increased to 6.75 per cent and 19.5 per cent, then from 10 per cent to 25 per cent, and now the rates are 15 per cent and 25 per cent.  When VAT was first introduced arbitrary and subjective decisions had to be taken as to what went into the higher brackets.  Over the years I consistently made the point that what were then considered luxuries are now no longer.  There are certain items on the 25 per cent VAT rate which were presumably then considered luxuries but which could not today be considered luxuries.  I never could understand why we had to stay in the straight-jacket whereby if we increased one rate we increased the other.</P>
    <P>The reason why there were originally two rates was that prior to 1972 there was turnover tax and wholesale tax.  The 5.26 per cent was the equivalent of the 5 per cent turnover tax and the 16.37 per cent was the equivalent of the 5 per cent turnover tax and the 10 per cent wholesale tax.  We have been stuck in this straightjacket ever since.  Why should there not be one rate of tax, whatever it might be? Everything else should be put at nought. As the years go on, if the Government of the day need more money and see an item which should have a VAT rate they can include it in the list of items to be taxed.</P>
    <P>The enormous bureaucratic cost of implementing these measures is quite unbelievable.  The cost to the small business person of keeping sufficient records to make the two monthly return is astronomical. Apart from that the multitudes of officials from Departments checking and reporting to people who report to others are not warranted by the amount collected.  The amount collected from 20 small traders with a turnover of under £200,000, in mixed groceries, for example, would not pay the salary of one of these officers.  We are putting the cart before the horse.  Ordinary business people are demented by this record-keeping and now that we have the rates so near each other &mdash; 15 and 25 per cent &mdash; there is no longer a case for having two rates.  The Minister pointed out on the last occasion that this would be equivalent <Col N="2186" /> to one flat rate of 17 per cent.  Look at the simplicity of having one VAT rate, the advantages in collecting the money and the advantage to the shopkeepers in simple record-keeping.</P>
    <P>In section 12 we have allowed a relief for agricultural contractors in decreasing their VAT rate from 10 per cent to 3 per cent, which I welcome.  Finally, again, what is the estimate of the money to be collected in 1982 by virtue of increasing the lower rate from 10 to 15 per cent?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> Has the Minister considered the figure that an increase of 5 per cent would bring in in 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have.  The increase would bring in £28.2 million this year and the total net additional revenue from the increase from 10 to 15 per cent next year will, as I have said on numerous occasions already, be £188.5 million, which is a substantial increase in revenue.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Fitzpatrick raised the matter of the application of the increase in the VAT rate from 10 to 15 per cent on goods delivered before 1 September 1981 but not invoiced after that date.  This relates to subsection (1) (a) of section 12.  In transactions between persons registered for VAT the rate which should appear on an invoice is the rate in force at the time the invoice is issued or ought to have been issued and not the rate in force, if different, at the time the goods are delivered.  Therefore if a registered wholesaler delivered goods at the lower rate of VAT before 1 September and properly invoiced them to a registered retailer after that date, the rate of VAT chargeable will be 15 per cent. However, it does not matter that the rate on an invoice may be higher than the rate in force at the time the goods were delivered since the wholesaler recovers the VAT for which he is liable from the customer and the customer, being VAT registered, is entitled to claim in respect of whatever amount of VAT is invoiced.</P>
      <P>In transactions between registered and unregistered VAT persons the rate of VAT chargeable is the rate applying at the time at which the goods are delivered. It does not matter whether the goods are invoiced at a time at which the VAT rate is different from the rate in force at the time of delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2188" /> Deputy McCreevy asked about the new rules governing the first registration of traders.  Since this matter relates to section 12, I shall be happy to reply to the Deputy later, thereby remaining relevant.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite have made the case again against the increase in VAT.  As I have said so many times before, we had no option but to increase the rates if we were to put the nation's finances back into some sort of shape before the end of 1981.  The situation is that expenditure in the first half of this year was totally out of line relative to the trend in revenue that had been predicted in the January budget.  Had we failed to take the action we took the current budget deficit which would have transpired by the end of 1981 would have been almost twice the deficit that was predicted in that budget.  That was the situation that became obvious not only to us but to the public and to the world financial community when the Exchequer returns for the first half of the year were published.  That was on 30 June.  We took action immediately on that serious situation and to that end we acted by availing of the relatively limited number of means available to us.  These were mainly in the area of indirect taxation. That was why we had to increase VAT in the case in question by a substantial amount, thereby raising a substantial amount of revenue which would contribute largely to putting the finances for 1982 in a much more healthy position than was the case in 1981.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy referred also to the desirability of introducing a single VAT rate rather than having the three rates which apply now &mdash; the 3 per cent on building and farm contracting and the other two rates of 15 and 25 per cent.  I have some sympathy with the Deputy's proposal.  There is a lot of force in it. However, it would involve a major reform of the system and that is something that the Government would need time to consider, but we will consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>All I wish to say at this stage is that the argument advanced by the Minister regarding the financial situation is purely political.  It is <Col N="2189" /> not my intention to pursue that line except to point out that the increase in the revenue from VAT to nearly £200 million for 1982 gives some indication of the enormous imposition that has resulted from the increase.  This imposition has led, more than anything else in the July budget, to a downturn in activity in many operations in the past month or so.  One need only visit a supermarket or <Col N="2190" /> any shop or public house to realise the accuracy of what I am saying.  This penal imposition will not help anyone in the long run.  It was devised to be used in the interests of long-term political gain and because of that I urge strongly that the amendment be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last day I was replying in detail to various points raised by Deputies.  Deputy Mervyn Taylor made a point in relation to energy costs in his reference to Clondalkin Paper Mills and to the general question of energy costs as this affects particular industries.  Hydrocarbon tax has been reduced by the Government from 7p a gallon to 4½p a gallon and that has made some contribution towards industry and energy costs in this area. Electricity costs are fairly high and these necessarily reflect production costs because we import oil.  In reviewing our general industrial strategy, the Government will have to look at energy costs to industry.  That point was raised and is a matter worthy of very detailed examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley made a number of <Col N="2193" /> very severe strictures on the individual contributions of companies on the question of State assistance.  He was critical of the extent to which individual managers had managed to stave off closures, liquidations and receiverships.  He was also critical of the calibre of management and of marketing.  I share the severity with which his comments were made in that regard.  He made a very valid point.  In relation to Fóir Teoranta, Deputy O'Malley made an outstanding contribution during his term in office to this work.  He was not a man who went in for soft options in terms of industrial rescue efforts and was not beyond telling companies the truth when that was needed. He raised the question of Fóir Teoranta being left short of necessary resources in 1982.  I assure him and other Deputies that there will be no shortage whatever of basic funds for their operations during the next 12 months.  That goes without saying.  Money will be made available and that being made available by this Bill will be of considerable assistance to the industrial sector.</P>
    <P>Participation by the banks in financing Fóir Teoranta's operations was suggested in the report of the Joint Committee. This was a sensible operation.  I was a member of that committee and we formulated that approach when we made our report to the House.  This has been taken up by the Department of Finance with the company and will prove helpful in the future.  I do not have any developments on which to formally report but the proposition was a worthy one and was a unanimous recommendation by all members.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke raised the question of sectoral development committees.  There is such a committee in existence.  It was a useful innovation arising out of the national understanding.  I hope it will continue in existence.  It has been warmly supported by the trade union movement and is generally seen as an advance in industrial development.  Fóir Teoranta are represented on it and on other consultative committees which have been established for marketing, the electronics industry, the building and construction <Col N="2194" /> industry and the beef industry.  These are the areas where sectoral work is being done at present with the full support of the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald raised the question of responsible Ministers.  They are the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Energy.  There was an area of emphasis raised by Deputy Colley.  In 1975 when we were debating a similar Bill he stressed the importance of management expertise.  Fóir Teoranta will provide assistance at managerial level where necessary.  We debated this at length with senior executives of Fóir Teoranta in the Joint Committee.  I recall our report discussing the desirable linkage between Fóir Teoranta and the IMI to ensure that the lessons to be learned are passed on.  We made a recommendation in that regard.  It is in hands at present.  If they need additional management specialists Fóir Teoranta should receive them.</P>
    <P>There were a number of questions I expected Deputies to raise.  When I was a member of the Joint Committee I raised the fact that there was no trade union representative on the board.  That is a singular omission.  When the Committee asked what the history of trade union representation was in that regad Fóir Teoranta said they had a trade union representative on the board in the past and found his input very helpful.  When one gets down to talking about cases such as that of the Clondalkin Paper Mills it would have been singularly helpful if they had a trade union representative on the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Fóir Teoranta in conjunction with various agencies have tried to devise an early warning system to pinpoint firms running into difficulties so that support and corrective action could be mounted at an early stage.  I do not think that the system has been entirely effective.  We could review it.  Originally Fóir Teoranta endeavoured to devise an <Col N="2198" /> early warning system in consultation with the Department of Industry and Commerce and that was done jointly with the IDA.  In evidence the chairman of Fóir Teoranta told the Joint Committee that the membership of the inter-agency group has now been extended to include representatives of the Department of Labour, the Department of Agriculture and Córas Tráchtála Teo.  He went on to say that a fresh approach was now being made to the major banking groups and discussions have taken place already with one of the main groups.  Our Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas said that efforts were being made to improve the early warning system through the extensions of the inter-agency group and by discussions with the banks.  In the light of comments made here earlier I intend to ask that these discussions be completed and that a report on the current effectiveness of the early warning system be made.  This would be of considerable help.  These are the main points I would make in response to the reservations of Deputies on Second Stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My final comment is that the main reason why companies merge into situations of failure, receivership or liquidation has been commented on by Fóir Teoranta in their reports in 1978 and 1979.  They spoke clearly about the poor calibre of management and the bad industrial relations in firms applying for financial assistance. These are two critical aspects.  A great deal can be done to improve that situation.  I have no doubt that the work of Fóir Teoranta over the years in ensuring that firms do not decline into total bankruptcy has been effective.  The record is reasonably good.  About two out of every three firms assisted by Fóir Teoranta have either gone back into trading profitably or have survived marginally but have not closed down.  It is quite a good record.  About one-third have failed despite all efforts over the years since 1972-73.  The record generally is quite good and the efforts of Fóir Teoranta should not cloud the fact that the IDA have a major rescue activity in operation. Between 1979 and 1980 alone the IDA put together 59 rescue packages and <Col N="2199" /> negotiated 53 takeovers.  Grants of nearly £12 million were approved and these will have the effect of maintaining about 4,250 existing jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, what was the last figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Grants of nearly £12 million approved between 1979 and 1980 will have the effect of maintaining 4,250 existing jobs and creating 3,700 new jobs. The picture which we Deputies tend to have of the IDA being totally pre-occupied with new industrial endeavour should be tempered by the fact that at any one time approximately 250 firms are being assisted by the IDA to get over temporary difficulties.  It is not just Fóir Teoranta.  The IDA are in it as well and the early warning system is a key element in the IDA's rescue activities.  The IDA make a major effort in that regard.  I want to pay tribute to the work done by the IDA in this area.</P>
      <P>I leave it at that.  I have tried to summarise as rapidly as possible some of the points raised here on Second Stage because I am grateful to my colleagues on the Opposition benches for their agreement to take all Stages of this Bill today.  I would be glad if we could do so by 7 o'clock and I would be glad also to deal with any other points raised during the remainder of the discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the nub of the Bill because it concerns the raising of the financial limits within which Fóir Teoranta can operate.  This raises the fundamental principle of the operation of that company, the criteria on which they operate and how they allocate the funds <Col N="2200" /> made available by this House.  A number of Deputies asked about the practical operation of Fóir Teoranta and, as was referred to by the Minister, other State agencies with Fóir Teoranta.</P>
      <P>Let us get down to specifics, because this is something on which the Coalition can be tested.  We must ask if they support basic industries.  I am not talking about a Government through their agencies supporting any and every lame dog industry.  I am asking if the Government are genuine about supporting basic industries. I am talking about a specific industry which has built up a pool of expertise over a number of years, where there are young people, fathers and grandfathers living in this city who have acquired skills. About 500 people are involved in this industry and 1,200 people in allied industries.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not answer the points I raised on Second Stage.  I want to know if the Government are serious about getting involved in basic industries, such as the pulp industry which is related to the Government's forestry programme, and the supply of timber products.  The development of a pulp industry could lead to newsprint production, an industry we do not have at present.  All this is the subject of a report which has not yet been published but which is available to the Government as a result of a joint study by the Forestry Department and the Industrial Development Authority.  This report makes available to the Government the medium and long-term prospects of a profitable venture which would be suitable for joint investment by the State and private industry.</P>
      <P>The Clondalkin Group Limited issued a press release today in which they emphasised that they wanted to ensure &ldquo;a risk-sharing concept&rdquo; on their part and on the part of the State.  They said there was a marked absence of any commitment by the Tánaiste, whom they met, to risk-sharing and that there was no indication that there would be any further State aid forthcoming over and above that offered by the IDA on 21 October 1981.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the Government's financial commitment to Fóir Teoranta.  I submit that the Labour Party are committed to the establishment of the National Development Corporation, the financing of which was estimated by the Tánaiste at £600 million. This sort of money should be spent on a National Development Corporation, which was an excellent idea in many ways.  The whole idea behind the setting up of such a corporation is that it manages <Col N="2202" /> to mobilise existing agencies, make the assessment and then the investment required in particular circumstances. That means agencies such as the IDA, FT and the ICC.  All that requires to be done is not to set up a National Development Corporation, not to talk in imaginary figures like £600 million but simply to implement the legislation that is here in this section for dealing with companies in difficulties that could be rescued and managed through the efforts of a combination of the agencies I have mentioned who have financial and managerial skills.</P>
      <P>Why is this not being done in regard to the case we are now discussing and which we must regard as a test case?  I am not talking about small industries in other fields.  Here we are concerned with a basic company involved in the whole structure of Irish industry.  It has been there for a long time and it is bound to have built up a pool of skills.  It is concerned in some but not all of its operations with the processing of Irish timber products and it is part of a group of public companies that have a standing in the economy.  Will the Government take a risk equity investment in that operation or not?  I am asking the Minister to answer me now.  I asked him during the Second Stage but he glossed over it.  He did not choose to answer a single point I had made.  We have had this statement in the press today after consultations between the unions and the management.  This evening Deputy Haughey and other Fianna Fáil Deputies, including me, met the union representatives of the workers in the Clondalkin company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>He might inform us what is happening.  It will be very interesting because at 5.30 p.m. the people concerned, the workers, the trade unions representing them in the factory, were not aware of any appointment with the Tánaiste.  I am glad to hear now that he has seen fit to meet them following the meeting with Deputy Haughey.  At last, some reality is being brought into it.  We are not talking about small details.  Here there are jobs at risk, a basic industry is at risk.  We want to know whether there is to be a real commitment by the Government towards risk sharing in this <Col N="2204" /> industry because of its fundamental place in the whole structure of Irish industry. It is the processing sector of the country's timber resources.  We want to know if Fóir Teoranta will play a part in it.</P>
      <P>I have referred to a report prepared by the IDA and the Department of Forestry when I was in charge of the Department. That report recommended that in the medium and long-term there was a tremendous future for such an industry based on national raw materials, provided that there was reorganisation, that the State took a part in it.  Of course many aspects of the State agencies have to be considered in this respect.  The ESB play an important part because of their power input.  We must remember also the forestry input.</P>
      <P>Unless there is a lead by the Government this industry will go to the wall and there will not be any processing plant for pulp in Ireland.  The skills that have been built up in that company will be lost.  It has been set out in the report published by the IDA and the Department of Forestry. Has the Minister read that report?</P>

      <P>I happened to be a very helpful contributor to that report, unlike Coalition Ministers who come in here and make recommendations and talk as if they were not Ministers.  I happened to be a participant in the preparation of that report.  I did not sit back to wait for the civil servants to come up with recommendations. It is clear the Minister is not aware of what is happening, of what is germane to this question.  If he wants to hide behind the backs of the public service that is his business.  I took a very personal interest in this not only from a constituency point of view but from the national point of view as the Minister responsible for Forestry at a time when it was necessary for that industry to survive. I did that on my own basis.  I met trade union representatives, workers and <Col N="2205" /> management and made that political decision because I was a member of a Government who made political decisions. We did not hide behind civil servants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We were involved in being interested in people and taking political decisions.  This is a test of the real interests of the Labour Party.  Are they interested in ideological verbiage? Are they interested in ideological nonsense when talking about a national development corporation, funded to the tune of £600 million, to do what?  If the Labour Party ideology and philosophy is right this is what a national development co-operation should be at.  They should be taking over this firm and doing something about it.  In this case the management, the trade unions and the workers are willing to go along with it.  The whole basis of the press release issued by the management, supported by the trade unions and the workers, is that the State should come in on a risk-bearing basis. That is precisely what was intended by seemingly genuine socialists that they should go in, bear the risk and take an equity investment.  I am not asking that the State do that in every investment.  We do not want that.  We do not want what happened in Britain so often but here is a basic industry germane to the whole structure of industry here because it is concerned with a basic product such as timber and concerned with newsprint.  It is what could be described as a vertical type industry, not a horizontal one that could be hived off or dismissed.  It is the only one of its type left here with a pool of skills and the management.  All that it needs is an undertaking from the State that it will move in and agree to take part in the action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State should take the risk involved and it must be remembered that the risk is only temporary.  If the Minister rereads the report he said he read recently he will see that the medium and long-term prospects in regard to the pulp processing <Col N="2206" /> industry are good.  The situation at present is a temporary phenomenon.  The workers and the trade unions put it to us today that if the liquidator is backed by the Government he can carry that industry over the next nine months or one year.  All that is required is breathing space, for the Government to step in and say that these State agencies mean something, that Fóir Teoranta means something, that the IDA and the ICC mean something.  This is a glorious opportunity to do that because the company want this.  In so many cases companies do not want this help.  The company, trade unions and workers want this to be done and the State agencies, if they were given the necessary directive, could do this. However, the Government are unwilling by reason by lack of political will to implement a basic part of urban social-philosophy, to maintain something that is worth maintaining, investing in something that has a future, to do anything about this problem.  That amounts to gross dereliction of duty on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>I am long enough in and out of Government to recognise the signs and this had all the smells of a Government that are not paying attention to their job.  The Government are supposed to have a philosophical commitment to step in and share risks but they are not doing that.  It is a sad and wrong situation which shows up the whole credibility of the Labour Party.  It appears that the Labour Party have lost all interest in maintaining any credibility.</P>

      <P>I should like to deal in some detail with the points raised in relation to Clondalkin Paper Mills.  My reluctance to enter the debate on this issue relates to one matter, the hope and expectation that even at this stage the company, in serious negotiations with the IDA and Fóir Teoranta, will put together an agreed package to save the jobs of the 470 workers concerned.  There is a major question as to whether the company are serious about this proposition.</P>

      <P>I should like to explain the facts of the situation.  It is of vital importance that there be a commitment on the part of the Clondalkin Group &mdash; here I should advisedly choose my words &mdash; or possibly on the part of additional shareholders or new shareholders, to invest some funds and their management expertise to save the firm.  There is a commitment on the part of the State which involves substantial risks, equity involvement in the firm and in terms of grants being made available and so on.  I do not believe in going into great detail on the fortunes of particular firms.  This is not generally done in the House in relation to Bills of this nature but the matter has been raised and the group managing director has seen fit to make four or five major statements relating to this firm.  It is for that reason that I feel it necessary to put the record right.  The managing director made a statement that he had requested £5 million.  Some days later, according to <i>The Irish Press,</i> he requested £10 million.</P>

      <P>There are perhaps two other facts which should be known in relation to this matter.  It is true that the board of Clondalkin offered the former Minister, my colleague, Deputy John Kelly, when he was Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, totality of the shares of this company for an entirely nominal sum on the basis that the State would take over all debts, all future losses, all future investment costs and, of course, any redundancy costs.  I am quite sure that my colleagues here would agree &mdash; and particularly Deputy O'Malley &mdash; that when companies walk into a Minister and say: &ldquo;There it is, take the whole lot for a purely nominal figure. You can have it for a couple of quid, we will give you all the shares,&rdquo; that at that stage one does not regard that kind of approach as being serious, more particularly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Minister of State says that I was offered this company for nothing and the implication is that I declined it.  I recall having one meeting in, I think, early May of this year with the company and they certainly <Col N="2215" /> did not offer me the company either for nothing or for any specific amount. Would the Minister of State tell me on what date I was offered the company for nothing and refused it?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>It is of critical importance to note that after the Minister of State strongly urged the company at the meeting on Friday, 6 November, to go back into discussions with the IDA and with Fóir Teoranta within a matter of hours a liquidator was appointed by the company.  In the light of the discussions <Col N="2218" /> which had been continuing that came as a considerable surprise to the IDA, to Fóir Teoranta and to the Department of Industry and Energy.  Therefore, the fundamental question arises as to whether or not the company have a basic commitment to maintaining their continuation. The Tánaiste has been involved in a number of meetings.  I personally met two of the officers of the trade union group concerned. In fact I met them last week and discussed the matter at great length long before the former Taoiseach got himself involved, or any other Deputies, in that regard.  I personally know the trade union officers concerned.  I have a considerable interest in doing my best to assist this company.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that the Minister for Industry and Energy is now doing his utmost &mdash; as we have been doing for the past three or four weeks &mdash; to ascertain what can be done to bring about a balanced package which is one that the IDA can stand over.

I can say here that Fóir Teoranta are still willing, are able and do have the financial resources to assist this company but there must be a commitment, particularly on the part of the managing director of the group, to try to keep the company going.  There must be some such commitment because &mdash; I can finish with a figure quoted here &mdash; the consultancy report said the company required a £2 million injection in capital equipment.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the extent and level of crime, violence and lawlessness in this country at present amounts to a serious emergency and calls on the Government to undertake immediately, a comprehensive national campaign to deal with the situation as a matter of extreme urgency and for the purpose of this campaign to: (1) involve local authorities, voluntary organisations and education authorities, (2) provide all the equipment and resources necessary, and (3) recruit adequate numbers of Gardaí and other personnel.</P>
      <P>This motion in my name and in that of the Chief Whip of my party is, very probably, one of the most important Private Members' motions that will be discussed in the lifetime of this Dáil.  I am certain that there is a great measure of agreement with and acceptance of the fact that the extent and level of crime, violence and lawlessness in this country at present amounts to a serious emergency situation and that some new approach, some new thinking and some new methods must be introduced and got under way immediately if we are successfully to protect society from the criminal.  Crime, violence and lawlessness, and now drug abuse, have reached crisis proportions and unfortunately all the indications are that the situation will get much worse in the years ahead unless we go to the very root of the problem at this stage and launch an all-out attack on everything and anything in society that contributes to the creation of a criminal.</P>

    <P>During the past decade substantial changes have occurred here in the nature of known crime as well as its quantity. Over all crime has increased from 30,756 in 1970 to over 70,000 in 1980, a massive increase of about 140 per cent.  We have no option but to think of new ways of approaching this situation.  We never had all the State agencies or State supported <Col N="2220" /> bodies working together at any given time in dealing with crime.  We were incorrect in leaving all the burden of the fight against crime on the shoulders of the Garda Síochána.  Despite their best efforts the Garda Síochána could not hope to do more than contain the crime level, for reasons outside their own control. Indeed, I am sure every Member of this House is proud of our police force. Ever since they were established they have worked well; they have been noted for their integrity and efficiency and their superhuman efforts to protect people and their property.  Indeed, they are asked to perform duties for which they are not properly organised from the point of view of equipment.  We have had evidence of that in recent months.  I say this at this stage because the last Government gave a firm commitment of acceptance to the Garda of the recommendations of the Commissioner's report to me as Minister for Justice in August 1980 on the review of plans dealing with prevention of and protection against armed robberies and more serious crimes.  I would hope that there would be no backing away from this commitment.  The moneys must be found to give the Garda the facilities which are needed urgently to do the work which is expected of them.  I will not develop this point now.  I merely mention it to give ample warning to the Minister of where we, on this side of the House, stand on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner's report on crime for 1980 was published earlier this year and was presented to my successor. It makes frightening and disturbing reading. It shows another dramatic increase in indictable offences, almost 13 per cent over the previous year.  There was an increase of over 5,000 offences in the larcenies group over the previous year and there were 73,000 indictable offences recorded for the year.  I understand that the unofficial figures for 1981 show another huge increase in this area.  It will be freely admitted in this House that the accuracy of the figures contained in the Garda Commissioner's report is often questioned because many crimes are not reported to the Garda.</P>
    <P>There is obviously a crisis situation <Col N="2221" /> here that urgently requires our attention. In his report the Garda Commissioner is ringing the warning bells for all of us to see for ourselves the magnitude of the task facing the Garda Síochána.  He emphasises that the Garda Síochána are but one agency with responsibility for the maintenance of public standards of behaviour as exemplified by the law and says that only a determined effort by all those with such responsibilities will stem the increasing degree of disrespect for good order in our society.  He warns of the urgent necessity of having the full weight of public opinion and action turned against criminals of all classes. These are the words of the Garda Commissioner in his introductory remarks to the crime report of 1980.</P>
    <P>This report shows that 57 per cent of all indictable crimes recorded &mdash; and that is a total of almost 42,000 offences &mdash; takes place in the Dublin Metropolitan area.  The report goes on to show that 70 per cent of all indictable crimes &mdash; and that is 70 per cent of 73,000 &mdash; were recorded in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford city areas.  This pinpoints the difficulties that we must pay attention to.  On deeper study of crime reports for the different years it is shown that certain areas have higher crime rates than others.  It is also shown by other studies that persons convicted of crimes have similar backgrounds.  Unfortunately there are many families living in most dreadful housing conditions.</P>
    <P>There are large families with up to eight or ten children living in a few rooms, perhaps one or two, without basic amenities such as bathrooms and toilets and, tragically, the father and mother are unemployed and have no hope whatsoever of employment for themselves and they despair for the future of their children. Many of the children in these areas cannot read or write at school leaving age.  There are not many amenities provided for these children.  Admittedly some progress has been made but far too little.  Some amenities have been provided but what was provided came too late.  It is a fair criticism of our society to say that the minimum is being done for people in areas where the maximum help <Col N="2222" /> is urgently required.  Unfortunately, they are nobody's children and have no hope for the future.  It is inevitable that many of these people drift into crime.  Surely their environment is a breeding ground for young criminals?</P>
    <P>There is information available to show that many people living in areas such as I have described believe that stealing is quite permissible, providing one is not caught.  They readily admit this.  They also believe that, in a case of necessity, it is permissible to steal, but they decide what a case of necessity is and when it would arise.  It is also fair to say that these socially deprived people are what society has made them.  They are the products of their environment and the predictability of their entry into crime is as sure as night follows day.</P>
    <P>I am talking about crisis areas which merit emergency attention of the sort I am advocating in the Private Members' motion.  These areas are readily identified from the Commissioner's report. They can be identified from newspaper reports on crime and every Deputy can readily identify areas I am talking about. These areas deserve a different type of attention than they have got up to now. A new approach and a more fundamental view should and must be taken of the difficulties in existence.  I am strongly advocating a preventative approach to crime at this stage.  I am advocating a comprehensive national campaign involving local authorities, because of their planning, development and housing responsibilities to people in the areas.  I am advocating the involvement of educational authorities because of the very special needs of the people in these areas which are not being catered for at present in the way they should be.  I am advocating also the involvement of the industrial promotional and training authorities because of their responsibilities to provide and train people for employment. The health and welfare agencies should also be involved because of the enormous role which they have to play.</P>
    <P>The voluntary organisations must also be involved.  It is fair to say they are already involved, doing tremendous work for the deprived of the areas.  At a <Col N="2223" /> later stage I hope to detail the type of involvement with voluntary organisations and make a case for greater involvement by them and greater financing of them from the Exchequer, so that their work may be carried out on a greater scale than at present.</P>
    <P>The national campaign which I am calling for would surely be the basis from which all Government Departments and agencies, working together with the voluntary organisations, could, for the first time, work together in trying to deal with the root problem of crime as we know it today.  By doing it as I have suggested, we would be tackling all the reasons which help to make criminals.  This can only be done and the success of this approach can only be assured if it has the full backing and active support of the Government.  The underprivileged of those areas only make national headlines normally as a result of their criminal actions.  By then it is almost too late to help them because the majority of people in our prisons are habitual returnees.  If ten or 15 years ago, we had had the foresight, wisdom, courage and interest to do what I am now advocating, we would not have the crime rate which exists today.  The Garda Síochána have a tremendous input in this area, in crime prevention and crime detection.  They are fighting a lone battle on our behalf.  Society is deeply indebted to them for waging a constant war on crime on our behalf.</P>
    <P>This year, during my Ministry, improvements in Garda services to the community were introduced.  One of these improvements, the increasing of street patrols and Garda surveillance, has been extremely successful and greatly welcomed by all.  Every Member of the House will agree that more gardaí on patrol has a deterrent effect on criminals. I know that is the considered opinion of the Garda Commissioner.  I presume it was still his opinion when he requested permission to recruit an additional 2,000 members so that this type of Garda and other service which would help defeat criminal activity could be given.  We are at present recruiting 1,000 new members to the Garda Síochána.  There is a recruiting <Col N="2224" /> campaign going on and anxiety is being felt on this side of the House &mdash; and on the Government side &mdash; at the slow way in which the campaign is moving. When the present 1,000 recruits are trained, there is a further commitment to an additional 1,000 new recruits.  This figure would bring us to the maximum allowed by law to the Garda Commissioner as a result of the existing ranks order which we passed in the House about 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with existing methods of recruiting which I consider to be painfully slow.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister for Justice that there is urgent need for reorganisation of recruiting methods which must be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  I said to the Minister last week in the course of the debate on the Estimate that we will have to recruit and train the people that the Commissioner has requested and which he has been given permission to recruit as quickly as possible.  From what the Minister said last week, it appears that, even with the best will in the world, only 300 recruits will complete their training in Templemore in 1982.  Can we afford the luxury of such delays in recruiting new members to the Garda force &mdash; new members who are so urgently required &mdash; that at the end of 1982 the Garda Commissioner will have only an additional 300 newly-trained members?  If this is so we must recognise the fact that those 300 members would also have to provide personnel to cover positions vacated by retiring members of the force or members lost through wastage, which would amount to 150 for 1982.  Therefore, the commissioner would have only an additional 150 extra members at the end of 1982 to help him with the serious problem which exists in the curtailment of crime.</P>
    <P>Even the additional net increase of 150 must be broken down to see what real strength the commissioner would get from that figure in having people available for work.  Because of organisational practices in operation within the force, the net increase of 150 new members can mean that only approximately 35 would be available for full-time duty at any given time.  Any Deputy from an urban <Col N="2225" /> constituency could honestly and justly request a full number for any Garda station in his own constituency and make a proper case for it.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat thrown aback at the mention by the Minister that only 300 gardaí would complete their training in Templemore in 1982.  I had plans, resulting from discussions with the Garda Commissioner and officials of the Department at that time, for the training of upwards of 900 recruits in 1982 and that all of these would work in the metropolitan areas.  Circumstances have pushed that aim aside.  With the crime rate soaring as it is, a very special and determined effort must be made immediately to give the Garda Commissioner the manpower he so urgently requires. This necessary manpower should be given to him immediately and not in annual instalments of 150 gardaí or twice that number.  New thinking is required here as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In Government the Minister for Justice must be able to overrule the crippling, petty restrictions which are being imposed on him by the Minister for the Public Service and which are preventing officer posts in the Garda Síochána from being filled, posts which urgently require filling and which have been vacant since 21 July last.  It is very easy for someone in the Department of the Public Service to say that 20 or 30 vacancies at sergeant level should not be filled, but that does immense harm and damage to the morale of the Garda force.  We know from the newspapers that the Minister for Justice had to meet the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors recently to hear their grievances on the effect which this embargo has on the morale of their members. It was reported that the Minister gave this deputation a courteous hearing, but said that he would not have an answer for them for a week or two afterwards. In not filling these posts he is probably saving about £4 per post per week, because the difference between the maximum of the garda grade and the minimum of the sergeant's is not great. Indeed, it has always been a bone of contention between the sergeant members <Col N="2226" /> and the gardaí that the differential between the two ranks is small.</P>
    <P>The sergeants who were promoted 18 months or so ago knew what to expect &mdash; service on the Border.  Having completed their service, there was a gentleman's agreement between the commissioner and the association that they would return to the areas from whence they were promoted, but that has not been done.  This is a petty restriction which I would encourage the Minister for Justice to meet head on in Government with his colleague, the Minister for the Public Service, telling him that in the interests of security, of good police work, of having a force which will be on its toes, ever vigilant and knowing the right method for combating the criminal, there is no room for the petty thinking of the Minister for the Public Service in this area.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner could well do with an additional 5,000 members in the Garda Síochána if he is to give the services to our community which are being demanded of him.  The taxpayers are prepared to pay for these services.  I assure my successor in office of my support for him any time he comes to this House seeking money to pay these additional gardaí.</P>
    <P>The motion which we propose here, if implemented, will be the start of a major breakthrough against the criminal elements in this country.  The present Minister and every member of his party could tell this House, if they wished, the position in regard to crime in the areas which they represent.  We learn the situation when we read the papers, not just the evening papers, which cover the Dublin scene, but the front pages of today's <i>Cork Examiner</i>, where the president of Cork Chamber of Commerce, Mr. McHenry, calls for support for the Gardaí in their ever-demanding task of maintaining law and order in Cork.  He mentions the recent spate of malicious and stupid damage caused by hooligans in Cork city centre and says that that is a warning which the public can only ignore at their peril.  He asks if Cork city is to join the growing number of urban jungles in which it is not safe to walk or to leave <Col N="2227" /> property unprotected.  According to the president of the Cork Chamber of Commerce, that situation exists in Cork today.</P>
    <P>Around last April, street patrols were introduced, on the suggestion of the Garda Representative Association, as a method to be tried in an attempt to defeat the street criminal and the vandal, to protect old people, particularly in their homes, but also to protect their homes when they leave to do their shopping.  It should be recorded in the Department of Justice that the Garda Commissioner was urged to instruct his chief superintendents to take on as many men and women as possible to patrol the areas where there was a need for it.  When the first suggestions came in as to the manpower which would be required, having listened to Deputies in this House and to deputations &mdash; which was one of the more enjoyable tasks of my work as Minister for Justice &mdash; I decided that not enough was being done, that they were being overcautious in not making enough demands on me as Minister for Justice.  I suggested that they should have a further look at the situation and make sure that every superintendent and chief superintendent knew that he was being told by the Minister of the day to put the manpower on the street to protect the citizens and their property and see to it that people could go about their normal business.  I believe that this was a success.  However, if it was a success then, according to the president of the Cork Chamber of Commerce, it was not at all a success in Cork city.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister, when he has an opportunity, tell the House whether or not demands for increased street patrols were made by the chief superintendent of Cork city?  If there were, were they refused?  If the chief superintendent did not look for these extra patrols, why have we a situation, as reported in today's <i>Cork Examiner</i>, in which the Garda Commissioner told his chiefs in the different divisions that the manpower required by them to protect the people would be given to them on application? That being the situation, there is something radically wrong in the city of Cork. <Col N="2228" /> If the demand was not made, why was it not made?  It surely could be an indictment on the Garda chiefs in that city that they were not in touch with the situation as outlined by the president of the Cork Chamber of Commerce who calls for support for the Garda.  Of course everybody will support the Garda but unless there are sufficient numbers of men on the ground pious statements asking the people to support the force are no more than wishful thinking.  In the sort of situation we are talking about what the Garda need is the support of their fellow members in terms of numbers.</P>
    <P>Within the ambit of the Department of the Environment there are a working group who have been dealing with the problems of the inner city but I fear that this group have not been as active as they should have been.  If their work was activated to a feverish pitch, activated with persons who would be dedicated to dealing with the problems in this area, they could do tremendous work.  I am aware that other bodies are involved in different projects in the city-centre area.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle in his capacity as Minister of State in the Department of Education in the last Government did tremendous work by way of the provision of moneys under the Youth Employment Scheme.  During that time the inner city projects were allotted funds to the extent of £30,000 in 1977 and that amount was almost doubled in 1978.  The figure was doubled again in 1979 when it was £122,000 and for the earlier part of 1980 the amount was well up on average in terms of what was being done.  There were many worth-while projects being undertaken in this area by voluntary groups.  Such groups in the context of the type of national campaign we are calling for can do tremendous work and offer much help to those families who are most in need and also in keeping young people out of trouble.</P>
    <P>Is it not a shame that within 100 yards of O'Connell Street, in a street that is no longer than 400 or 500 yards, there are approximately 5,000 people who have no such facilities as a shop, cinema, playground or anything of that kind?  From now on at least this Parliament and those <Col N="2229" /> with responsibility for the planning and development of such areas must make it their business to ensure that such a situation will never be repeated.  It is not right to expect the children of the poor and the deprived to keep out of trouble when the only pastimes they have are stealing cars and snatching handbags.  I was taken aback sometime ago when, on speaking with some people and children in an area of this city, they admitted readily that it was as natural for them to steal cars for joyrides or to snatch handbags as it was for children in other areas to go to swimming pools or to play football or tennis.  This is a very sad reflection on society.  There is no point in placing the blame in any one place.  Society as a whole have a lot to answer for in this regard.  I am calling on the Minister to convince the Government that something must be done about the problem.  If we take the necessary steps the role of the Garda in crime prevention and detection will be strengthened considerably.  As of now there is no light at the end of the tunnel for the Garda.  The commissioner in his report for 1980 sounds that warning bell loud and clear.  Apart from that the figure of 73,000 reported indictable crimes for 1980 as against about 24,000 in 1970 is proof that we are not winning the battle against the ordinary criminal.</P>
    <P>I have talked about crime prevention. I know that the Garda will deal with the area of crime.  They are to be complimented on their successes in this area and in particular on the major successes they have had in dealing with the more serious type of crime &mdash; armed robberies.  To that extent the period from about May 1980 up to the middle of this year was good but I would urge the Minister to impress on the Garda the fact that they must be constantly on the alert against the armed criminal and that we must not again have the sort of situation that existed in the seventies regarding the number of bank robberies that took place in those years. In 1980 and early 1981 we made a major breakthrough in dealing with this type of crime particularly in the Dublin area where the majority of them took place. I am sure that the Minister is as alarmed as I am that in the past four or five months <Col N="2230" /> there seems to be an upsurge in this area of crime.  The Garda can deal best with this situation by being ever-vigilant and alert.</P>
    <P>I was very upset on reading the report of an interview given by the Minister for Justice in the magazine <i>Horizon</i>, the publication of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.  I envied the Minister that fine interview.  He could hardly have written better himself.  I was never given the opportunity by any association to come across so well as was the case of the Minister in that instance.  In the interview the Minister is reported as having made particular reference to the aerial wing which was part of the requirement of the Garda Commissioner.  The Minister said that no proper evaluation had been conducted prior to the commitment having been entered into by the previous Government and he said that he had asked for this evaluation to take place for the purpose of ascertaining whether the case for an aerial wing had been made and whether it would be more appropriate to make helicopters available to the Garda through the Air Corps.  He went on to say that consideration must be given to the enormous expense of building new hangars and to the provision of new maintenance facilities, pilot training and so on.  The Minister said that his concern was to give to the Garda the most realistic and effective way of operating.  There is nobody in the Department capable of evaluating the proposal of the commmssioner on the question of whether the Garda should have fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters.  In saying that I include the Minister.  It is because we did not have any expertise available to us in this area that the commissioner together with some of his most senior men, senior officials of the Department, a representative from the Air Corps and myself visited police forces in other countries to discuss the matter with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We were convinced that the Garda should have their own aerial wing.  There were strong and definite indicators from all the police forces <Col N="2231" /> we met &mdash; and they are the only evaluating bodies on whom we can depend &mdash; that this was the course we should follow. The Garda are in the business of finding the criminal.  The Garda Commissioner is the only professional in this area and he has requested that he be given an aerial wing.  I trust that the Minister will take the same personal interest in this question as I took.  If he is genuine in saying that he will give the Garda whatever means they require to deal with the criminal, he should do so immediately. There is no question of providing additional hangars or airports.  There is no reason for the unit not to be contained in a separate section at Baldonnel Airport. If the Garda consider that this aerial wing is what they should have, they should have it in their own right, operating it themselves rather than being dependent on any other agency to provide them with the service.</P>
      <P>I sincerely hope that the Minister will accept this motion.  The House would be united behind him in trying out new ways to deal with the criminal and to help defenceless persons in their homes.  I am thinking of old people who are living in a state of mortal fear that if they leave their homes they will be ransacked.  It has been proved that the number of criminals is on the increase and this party will give every help to the Minister to protect our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this very timely motion because the level of crime, violence and lawlessness is such as to cause the Government the most grevious concern. However, the reference in the motion to a serious emergency needs some clarification because it is not clear whether the Opposition are proposing to the Dáil that an emergency be declared.  The Government would only resort to the declaration of an emergency if the tide of events were such as to leave them no alternative course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion must be dealt with under two headings, namely, subversive crime, violence and lawlessness and non-subversive crime, violence and lawlessness. <Col N="2232" /> Both categories are linked in that much of non-subversive crime is of the copycat variety, based on the outrageous violence of subversives.</P>
    <P>To deal with subversive crime without reference to the funeral which took place in Dundonald earlier today would be unthinkable.  This was but one of over 2,000 such funerals in the North since 1969 and was one of several such funerals today.  The body interred was that of a democratically elected member of parliament which makes his murder that much more horrific and the potential consequences that much more explosive.  To the widow, family, colleagues and friends of the late Robert Bradford our sympathy may not mean much but nonetheless we express it with sincere and heavy hearts. His murder took place outside our jurisdiction but it is yet another event in a wave of subversive violence common to North and South alike.  This terrible event, when coupled with the attempted assassination almost simultaneously of the British Attorney General in London, indicates a very serious escalation of violence by subversive organisations.  No Government in any State can be expected to sit back and allow this trend to continue. No Government want to be provoked into a counter escalation of security measures but no Government worth their salt will baulk at whatever measures are deemed necessary to defeat this new attack on democracy.  However, if we in the South have anything to learn from the terrible experience in the North it is that no extra numbers of police or soldiers will defeat crime, violence and lawlessness without the total support of the community they serve.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the matter of recruiting more and more gardaí and I want to take up a point made by Deputy Collins when he indicated that he had plans to recruit 900 people in one year.  There is no record in my Department of the existence of any such plans.  The maximum number of gardaí which can be recruited in any one year is 600 by virtue of the fact that Templemore training centre cannot take more than 300 at a time and the course length is almost six months.  Even that number could be take <Col N="2233" /> expense of all refresher courses.  Allowing for normal refresher courses, there is a maximum provision in Templemore for 240 recruits at a time or 480 in a year. Allowing for the fact that 150 gardaí will leave the force or die or retire, the maximum number by which the Garda can be increased is about 300.  This is what we intend to do.  For Deputy Collins to talk about an extra 900 recruits is absolute effrontry because he did not even provide the money for wages for November and December at levels pertaining in January of this year.  I have had to provide that money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins also mentioned that his Government had decided to increase the level of the force by 2,000.  When was that decision taken?  It was signed by the then Taoiseach on 19 June 1981 in the interregnum between the election and the change of Government.  The incoming Government were to pay for it as well as the wages which had not been provided for existing gardaí.  They did not say that it would take seven years to increase Garda strength by 2,000, given the recruiting capacity of Templemore.  It was dishonest.</P>
    <P>We have decided that Templemore will be filled to the brim with recruits as early as possible in the new year.  The recruiting process is going on and the interviews will not be over until January.  This is a matter for the Civil Service Commission, not the Department of Justice.  In addition to these extra recruits, I have provided, with the authority of the Government, an extra 75 per cent for Garda overtime over and above what was provided by Deputy Collins in the 1981 Estimates.</P>
    <P>The lesson we must learn from the North is that extra gardaí and soldiers on the streets will not be successful unless they have the total support of the community. The total dependence on the recruiting of more and more gardaí is the soft option of a society which has opted out of its own responsibilities.  That is why this Government are determined to set up a police authority and community &mdash; Garda liaison councils so as to involve the community at large in the drive to defeat crime.  These, together with an <Col N="2234" /> independent complaints tribunal, should provide scope for the maximum interaction and trust between the Garda and the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>To establish a sound basis for this debate I propose to give the House some crime statistics.  The latest published report of the Garda Commissioner for the year 1980 shows that the number of indictable offences was 72,782.  This represented a 13.6 per cent increase on the corresponding figures for 1979.  A total of 29,017 indictable offences were detected in 1980 and this was a detection rate of 39.9 per cent which represented a slight decrease on the previous year.  In the Dublin metropolitan area 41,778 indictable crimes, or 57.4 per cent of the total, were recorded.  In the rest of the State the figure was 31,004 or 42.6 per cent. The corresponding figures for 1979 were 36,156 or 56.4 per cent in the case of the DMA and 27,101 or 43.6 per cent in the case of the rest of the State.  The detection rate in 1980 for the DMA was 34.1 per cent and for the rest of the State 47.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>These figures show the disturbing demensions of crime in our community and illustrate the magnitude of the task facing the Garda Síochána.  It would be wrong for the idea to go forth that we have a crisis on our hands in regard to crime.  This would be tantamount to saying that law and order have broken down in this country.  Thankfully we are not in that situation or anywhere approaching it.  The vast majority of our people are law abiding citizens who adhere to our traditional standards of respect and decency.  It is only a small minority who are contributing to the violence and vandalism. In making these remarks I am not in any way trying to play down the seriousness of the crime problem.  Any deterioration in the crime situation is a matter of deep concern to me, as Minister for Justice, and to the Government.</P>
    <P>We are living in a world of rapid economic and social changes and it has been the experience the world over that these changes are accompanied by criminal activity.  Moreover, not only has crime increased in numerical terms but in some respects the types of crime have changed. <Col N="2235" /> Violence has become increasingly prevalent and has aggravated other kinds of offences.  Although the misuse of drugs has been a criminal offence in all countries for many years, there is no comparison between the drug situation which faced the previous generation and that facing young people today.  The development of air transport facilities in particular and the easing of frontier formalities have facilitated the development of organised crime and drug trafficking on an international level.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána clearly are facing a growing challenge.  However, I have every confidence that with the support of the Government, which I assure them they have in full, and with a harnessing of the evident goodwill towards the force of the general public, the Garda will meet the challenge with success.  The public can make an extremely important contribution by helping the Garda in their task of preventing and detecting crime.  It is important that the public should become aware that crime prevention is in everybody's interest and is everybody's responsibility and that the overall solution to criminality is one for society as a whole.  I want to underline and reiterate that every citizen, young or old, has a role in crime prevention and in crime detection.  This is particularly true of parents when it comes to their offspring. Considerable lack of parental control is responsible for a lot of juvenile crime.  I do not want to say that every juvenile criminal has bad parents because I know many children who have strayed off the mark through no fault of their parents, but there are many parents whose negligence has directly led to the crimes of their offspring.  Many parents appear to have abdicated their responsibility in this respect, whether it be through fear of their children or simply through negligence.</P>
    <P>There is now more property available to the criminals and it is quite clear that the public take little care of their property. For example, one area where the public can very easily help is in regard to larceny from unattended vehicles.  This type of crime accounted for no less than <Col N="2236" /> 20 per cent of the total crime in the country in 1980.  The crime statistics would certainly look a lot better if the public took common-sense precautions with their property.</P>
    <P>Another area of great concern, to which I have already referred briefly, is the question of drugs.  I know the commissioner shares my concern about this problem and that the matter is receiving a great deal of Garda attention.  An important aspect of the Garda approach to the problem is to liaise with all statutory and voluntary bodies in countering the evil of drug abuse.  In particular, selected members are glad to avail of requests to give lectures to various organisations on the problem.  These groups include doctors, students, pharmacists, custom officers, prison officers, junior chambers, religious groups, scouting organisations, Irish Countrywomen's Association branches, ladies' clubs and residents associations.  To date this year 150 such lectures have been given in Dublin alone.  It is the aim of the Garda that no effort will be spared to eliminate this grave threat to society.</P>
    <P>As I announced recently, the strength of the permanent Drug Squad in Dublin, Cork and Limerick has been substantially increased.  The commissioner has also made important organisational changes by establishing an administrative unit on drugs at Garda headquarters and also a special investigation unit for international drug trafficking.  This special unit has developed close working ties with international agencies involved in combating drug trafficking.  Great emphasis has been placed on training members of the force in the prevention and detection of drug offences.  I feel these training courses are very valuable. Apart from the basic training in drug investigation which every new member receives &mdash; I want to emphasise that every new member of the Garda Síochána receives this &mdash; advanced training courses are also provided at Garda headquarters. The objective of the advanced courses is to provide in each Garda division a substantial number of members trained in the latest techniques.  It is, therefore, important to emphasise that the Drug <Col N="2237" /> Squad are not facing this problem alone but that their good work is ably augmented by other members with advanced training and by the force generally.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this will continue to result in very effective action being taken against drug trafficking.  The Drug Squad have built up excellent relations with all sections of the community and there is excellent information forthcoming from the public.  Parents are continually calling to the Drug Squad offices at Dublin Castle for help and advice, which is willingly given.  It is my fervent wish that pushers and traffickers will receive the full rigours of the law.</P>
    <P>Two further points I would like to emphasise in relation to the problem of drugs are, firstly, that the problem of drug abuse is primarily a social problem and in the long term it cannot adequately be met by other than a community response.  Police action is necessarily directed at activities such as drug pushing. It is important that the community be conscious of the growing incidence of drug abuse in our society.  Secondly, I do not want to give the impression that the Garda Síochána are the only agency involved in making detection.  The custom authorities are very much to the fore in dealing with this problem.  My information is that they have staff who are both highly trained and very committed in this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to say before I leave the drug problem, which is at the root of so much crime today and at the root of so much human misery, that in no other area are the Garda so equipped to be helpful to the public than in this area.  I urge all parents, brothers, sisters, teachers, relatives or friends of those who are hooked on drugs or in danger of being hooked on drugs, to go to the Drug Squad who will be as helpful as possible.  Their attitude will be one of trying to help the person concerned to get away from drugs and get off drugs rather than prosecuting the person concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific measures mentioned in the motion, I would refer the Deputies, first of all, to the Government's policy document which was published shortly before the Government <Col N="2238" /> took office.  As indicated in that document, one of the measures which the Government intend to introduce in order to tackle the problem of crime and vandalism is to establish Garda community relations councils in order to secure greater community involvement in crime prevention.  As long ago as 1976 a start was made on improving Garda relations with the public.  At that time an inspector was appointed in each district in the Dublin Metropolitan Area to act as community liaison officers on a part-time basis.  A further step towards improving Garda community relations was taken in 1978 when a community relations section was set up at Garda headquarters.  In December last as Deputy Collins will be aware &mdash; and it is only right I should acknowledge that this was during the term of office of the previous Government &mdash; a sergeant was assigned full-time to crime prevention and community relations work in each Garda division outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area.</P>
    <P>Since taking office I have been in touch with the Garda Commissioner about the need for greater crime prevention measures, and specifically about the establishment of Garda community relations councils.  I have been informed that reports from the Crime Prevention Community Relations Officers show that they are increasingly involved with the statutory and voluntary local bodies as well as giving advice and assistance to individual members of the public.  It is generally accepted they are making an important contribution to crime prevention and to fostering better relations with the public.</P>
    <P>The specific proposal to establish Garda community relations councils is at present being examined by the Garda authorities in the light of the operation and experience of similar bodies elsewhere. Deputies will appreciate that the specific structure in terms of reference of the proposed councils will have to be researched and carefully considered before they are established but the initial research is under way and as soon as I get recommendations on the matter I will make specific proposals to the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2239" /> It may be that different types of community councils will be needed for the various communities.  For instance, in highly urbanised areas the approach may have to be different from that adopted in the case of rural areas.  In developing the councils we will have to take cognisance of the distinct characteristics of each area and it may be that we shall at first deal with pilot schemes to see which type is the more likely to succeed.</P>
    <P>With regard to equipping the force, I am aware that the Garda Síochána must be fully equipped to enable them to do their job efficiently and effectively.  I will be looking at the needs of the force to ensure that we have the most effective police service our resources will allow. Deputies will know that earlier this month I got the approval of this House to make substantial additional funds available for the Garda Síochána.  The extra moneys voted included additional funds for clothing and for protective equipment over and above the funds available in the original Garda Estimate this year.</P>
    <P>With regard to recruiting adequate numbers of gardaí, I informed the House earlier this month and also in this debate that recruitment of additional gardaí is at present taking place.  In the debate on the Supplementary Estimate I indicated that 6,512 applications were received from young men and women who were interested in joining the Garda Síochána.  Of that number, 2,663 were exempt from the Garda entrance examination because they had the requisite leaving certificate. The number of applicants who applied for the Garda entrance examination which was held on 30 July was 3,849 and of that number 1,568 passed the examination. This means that 4,231 candidates had to be interviewed.  Because of the large number of applicants and the fact that the drop-out rate in those coming forward for interview was low, the Civil Service Commission have informed me that all interviews will not be completed before the middle of January.  This means that actual appointments to the force will commence in February.  As I have announced already, a total of 300 new <Col N="2240" /> gardaí will be appointed.  In other words, the training centre will be filled to the brim as soon as possible.  Recruitment will continue during 1982.  To further help the gardaí, we have decided to recruit additional traffic wardens so that gardaí who are currently doing such work can be relieved.  New traffic wardens will be appointed in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The policy document published by this Government commits the Government to tackling crime and vandalism through a number of measures, including the more extended use of modern technology to assist the gardaí in coping with the many difficult problems confronting them.  I wish to emphasise that the Government intend fully to honour that commitment. The technological services that spring most readily to mind are communications and computer facilities.  I acknowledge that the previous Government took positive steps to provide these things for the gardaí and that, due to the necessity for careful and detailed planning, they are not items that can be provided overnight or at short notice.  It so happens, however, that while the previous Government put the planning process in train, the vast bulk of the money needed to pay for the Garda computer and radio systems will have to be found by this Government.  Despite the serious financial, situation we inherited, my Government will do their utmost to see that the gardaí are not left without the modern technological aids that are essential to them.</P>
    <P>The national Garda radio network which is being provided will be as up-to-date and as sophisticated as any police system in Europe.  When fully operational it will mean that all gardaí on duty throughout the country, whether on foot or in patrol cars, will be in immediate radio contact with their control centres. I am confident this will have a major beneficial effect on the efficiency of the force.  It will mean that officers in charge of operations will have greater control than at present over the Garda resources at their disposal and it will mean that as the investigation of a crime proceeds the most up-to-date information can be passed instantly to other members of the <Col N="2241" /> investigating team, to patrolling cars and to men operating checkpoints.  Not the least benefit of the new radio system will be that the garda on patrol need no longer feel isolated.  His link with his control centre should be always there so that he can seek advice or, if necessary, some assistance.  I am conscious of the part the system will play in reassuring gardaí in situations of potential danger and in ensuring their safety.</P>
    <P>The computer facilities that have been provided for the gardaí will mean that information required in Garda files will be much more quickly made available to officers engaged on criminal investigation. The speed with which information can be located and transmitted to investigating officers can often be a major factor in solving or preventing a crime. The computer facilities, combined with the new radio communications system, will produce significant results.  On the question of the computer facilities, I wish to state that there is nothing sinister or secretive about what has been done.  The Garda, like all police forces, have always kept various records.  Basically what the computer does is to store the information that has always been kept in conventional manual records.  The great benefit of the computer is the relative ease and speed with which required information can be obtained.  Among the items that will be kept on computer are the stolen and suspect vehicle system, a firearms system, a crime reporting system, a missing persons system and a national vehicles registrations system.</P>
    <P>Time does not allow me to deal with all matters.  However, I should like to answer a number of questions raised by Deputy Collins.  He raised the question of the meeting I had with the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors relating to sergeants on the Border.  Not only was the meeting very satisfactory but the problem they thought they had was not a problem when they came to see me.</P>
    <P>With regard to the aerial wing, the amount of money involved is so great that a proper evaluation has to be made. Deputy Collins mentioned he had not the necessary qualifications &mdash; and neither have I &mdash; to evaluate expenditure of the <Col N="2242" /> sums involved and neither was there the necessary qualifications in the Department to evaluate the expenditure involved.  I consider we should carry out a very comprehensive evaluation.  If we have to train pilots and maintenance people and have spare parts and so on for the Garda and duplicate them in the air corps we are not using scarce national resources in the optimum way.  The public have to pay taxes to meet these bills and we should seek the most effective way of putting these aids at the disposal of the Garda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone wishes the Minister well in his position.  I have always considered the position of Minister for Justice as one of the most strenuous, particularly over the last ten years. Having cleared that piece of <i>bonhomie</i> I return to the Minister's point about not making a political issue of this motion.  I do not want to make any political points but should like to put the record straight in relation to the Minister's suggestion that there was a proposal to recruit 2,000 new gardaí by the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government in the period between the time of their defeat and the time they left Government.  The Minister said his information, where-ever he gets it from, was that recruitment of 2,000 gardaí would take over seven years.  I doubt that the Minister will be there for seven years but, for the record, the former Minister, Deputy Collins, was in the Department for four years and recruited 2,000 gardaí. That is a matter of ascertainable fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <P>The Minister made an ambiguous statement which could be taken in a number of ways.  I am putting the record right.  The Minister also spoke in ambiguous terms about the recent supplementary estimate and said the reason for its introduction was that the kitty had run dry in the Department and that gardaí wage packets would be empty at the end of a particular day if the estimate was not introduced.  I have the privilege of being a long-standing member of the House and I remember that Deputy Cooney as Minister for Justice introduced a Supplementary Estimate to my certain knowledge and may have introduced a second one.  In Deputy Collin's time as Minister he introduced a supplementary estimate in 1979 and again in 1980.  To come in and try to pretend this is something new and that the money has run dry is false and could be interpreted incorrectly. The reason for the introduction of the supplementary estimate, which has almost become a traditional practice, is to supplement Garda pay and expenditure. There is nothing new in it.  I am sure the Minister did not intend to mislead the House in relation to the two matters which I hope I have corrected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important motion and does not fall into the pit of a pious expression of fatuity but rather states a reality and calls on the Government to recognise that an emergency exists and to take action in relation to it.  The Minister mentioned in his wide-ranging speech, as did Deputy Collins, the community role in relation to the prevention of crime.  It is necessary to have a strengthened Garda force by way of adequate members but the greatest custodian of any locality is its community. <Col N="2244" /> The voluntary organisation and the individual can assist in many ways. The voluntary group, representative of its locality, can help to curtail crime whether by way of prevention or cure. Two of the greatest social diseases which have become endemic in recent years for some reason better known to psychiatrists and psychologists, vandalism and assault, appear to be part of the daily business of living.</P>
    <P>How often have we seen mindless slogans written on prominent vantage points in various areas?  We can only marvel at how long they remain on a wall which may be indicative of an uncaring attitude of the people of that area.  I have the honour of representing the Dún Laoghaire constituency and have done so for some time.  In this area there is a car ferry and an important entry and exit port for British visitors.  We were regularly treated, although happily not in the recent past, to an outbreak of &ldquo;Brits Out&rdquo; slogans of one less than sophisticated kind or another.  Here is an immediate role for the community: prevent the slogan writer at his work by calling the Garda or, if it is the work of a midnight artist, call the local authority the next day to clean the wall or roadway so vandalised. Where a vandal is caught the courts should punish him or her by having the person remove their handiwork, or where common property is smashed, for example, trees on an estate or a phone booth, repay the community by way of replacing the cost of the damage done.  If the offender is a young person the means of the parents might be worth examining. These are some immediate solutions.  If a child vandalises public property and is apprehended instead of sending him to the juvenile court where district justices are overworked and where if he is found guilty he cannot be committed anywhere, he should correct the damage he has done.  He should clean up the walls he has vandalised with mindless slogans.  If he knows carpentry and has ability there is no reason why he should not be sent along to help in the reconstruction of a telephone booth.  There is no reason why he could not be brought to a State forest and asked to transport a tree or trees to <Col N="2245" /> the area where he has mindlessly destroyed a tree or trees.  Nothing in the law prevents that type of action being taken against this increase in social crime. No law whatever is in existence which prevents the courts giving a sanction of that nature.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in vigilante groups. Sometimes they may be tempted to become law enforcement groups in their own right, and that would be singularly evil.  In the Garda Síochána we have one of the ablest law enforcement agencies in the world, and they should be allowed get on with their job in respect of their role as custodians of the community. Through local organisations such as residents' associations and local authorities the community might consider setting up in areas where such is not operating already an additional committee to monitor local security and to ensure the protection of the population and the environment. These committees could liaise with the local Garda and would be in ease and aid of that force for the welfare of the community.  There is a community relations section in the Garda Síochána and this practice should be extended and the roles of the community and the community relations section of the Garda Síochána should coalesce.</P>
    <P>Another area which has not been mentioned during this debate is the protection of the elderly living alone.  The Department of Health recently announced details of a scheme to improve the living conditions of our senior citizens living alone.  The money, £409,000, is being provided by the Employment Guarantee Fund and is being shared out among eight health boards with a bias in favour of sparsely populated areas where large numbers of people are living isolated. The community task force will implement the scheme which does not apply to local authority houses or houses eligible for existing house improvement grants.  This scheme should be expanded to provide our solitary elderly with an emergency alert system by which they could press a button to call for help in a crisis, whether it be burglary, attempted assault or illness. If this scheme cannot carry the cost <Col N="2246" /> of the introduction of an alarm system as suggested, the Minister for the Environment should provide moneys to the local authorities to enable them to install the systems free where telephones are not easily accessible.</P>
    <P>I come to another area which is manmade and can be man-cured, but for some reason we seem to fall down between so many sections and divisions of a particular local authority that we are sent on a bureaucratic merry-go-round. In suburban Ireland street lighting throughout the many housing estates is necessary to prevent crime such as attacks on private house property and assault, particularly on our young children and the adult young.  An example of the type of serious problem that exists is an emergency which has struck a housing estate in my constituency, namely, the Carrickbrennan housing estate, Monkstown Co. Dublin.  My information is that this estate is two years in existence and since it was completed 30 houses have been broken into within those two years. The majority view on the estate is that the lack of street lighting has been the primary cause of the attraction of the undesirable elements in that area.  Surely this can be cured by the action requested by the harassed residents.  The solution there is that the ESB contact the local authority, as no doubt has been done, but for some known or unknown reason the lights remain to be turned on.  My belief is that as soon as those lights are turned on the problem in that area &mdash; which I use as an example of areas throughout surburban Ireland &mdash; will be solved.</P>
    <P>There is also a role for the education authorities.  If I were not so committed to the abolition of the death penalty I would say that one area where it might be applied would be the drug pushers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>For the third time, if I were not so committed to the abolition of the death penalty, one area where it might be applied would be to the drug pushers or traffickers.  They come in all shapes and sizes, but the vilest surely is the criminal who sells to the young men and women attending various second and third level institutions.  The education authorities have a very important role to play in advising our young people of the effect of drugs on their young minds and physiques.  Those schools do a good job in this regard, but the danger signs must be recognised and challenged constantly. The young person just left school and without a job is so open to the drug risk and other criminal opportunities that it is incumbent on the Government of the day to monitor the progress of such a person until he or she is in full-time employment. This is a case for the appointment of a full-time jobs officer in every large school in the land.  Maybe the past pupils unions in contact with the school authorities and the local authorities have a role to play here.  After-school care service is required and salaries should be paid to trained personnel to ensure that the young at risk are protected against this unnecessary threat until they find a job, preferably one of their choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government might take note regarding this whole question of unemployment and the tragedy of unemployment that may afflict a young person who has just left secondary school with or without honours or third level entrance qualifications and is looking for a job.  In the view of social scientists and psychologists one of the greatest areas of risk for young people is from the time they leave school until they get a job.  It is a matter of national emergency and importance that a person leaving school gets a job, preferably a job of that person's choice. Young people coming out of school who are put into dead-end jobs end up as frustrated as if they were unemployed. <Col N="2248" /> That is one of the greatest evils of unemployment which should be recognised and eradicated particularly in relation to our young people.  We are sowing the seeds of discontent if we do not give young people the employment opportunities which are their constitutional right. The generation after my own and the generation after my children's generation must be allowed their constitutional right to work, otherwise there is a threat of gradual breakdown of our society and all the institutions that derive thereunder.</P>
    <P>In the short time remaining to me I would like to raise a question that I have raised previously, that of a police authority. No such proposal should be even remotely considered until the Garda authorities, their representative association and all other parties interested have been consulted.  I do not suggest that by having a police authority the position of the commissioner should be eroded in any respect.  The commissioner has a predominant role to play in his relationships with the totality of the Garda Síochána force.  I would like to clear the air in that regard.  The relationship between the commissioner and the Garda Síochána force is sacrosanct and cannot be touched.  I have raised the proposal for a police authority here in the past and surely the time has come now to arrive at a conclusion in regard to its practicality. A number of criteria which might be met in the formation of such an authority might be kept in mind by the Minister: (1) The police authority should be there to assist the Garda Síochána in the exercise of their important role, (2) they should improve the confidence and trust of the public in the Garda Síochána; (3) they should involve the various representative associations within the Garda Síochána in their working.  It is important that such a police authority be seen as in aid of the Garda and not as another layer of bureaucratic control which leads sometimes to obstructionism and onwards and ever upwards to obscurantism.</P>

      <P>I regret having to drag the Minister for Finance into this House tonight.  I appreciate he has had an extremely difficult and busy day.  Honourable man that he is, unfortunately he is the sufferer in this mad crazy tax package Fine Gael initiated in May last year. No doubt the Minister may have been one of those who contributed to the preparation of that outlandish document, but I have no doubt that being more sensible than many others, he would not have been the person who would push that type of proposal furthest.</P>
      <P>Last Thursday I put down a question asking &ldquo;the Minister for Finance the total cost of the £9.60 tax allowance for women in the home as promised in the Fine Gael Election Programme; when it will be introduced; and the groups of women who will benefit&rdquo;.  The Minister's reply was linked with a question put down by Deputy Blaney.  He said:</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 24 Together.</P>
      <P>The essential principle underlying the proposed payment is that it is tax linked and involves a transfer of half the married tax credit to the spouse at home.  The figure of £9.60 corresponds to one-half of the full credit.  If this payment were increased, then the credit entitlement of the working spouse should logically be reduced <i>pro rata.</i> This, I consider, would be inappropriate.</P>
      <P>Not one word in that reply answered my question; one would say it replied to Deputy Blaney's question.  Will members of this Government continue to insult Deputies with that type of reply?  The last sentence of the reply could be taken as making some effort to answer my question. The Minister said:</P>
      <P>Details of the scheme are being finalised and I intend to make an announcement in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2250" /> I said I was sure the advertisements would appear shortly in the newspapers but the Minister did not comment.  Last Sunday the advertisements appeared in the papers.

I heard a number of Ministers but cannot say if the Minister for Finance contributed to that programme or appeared on television later that evening.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave more information to RTE last Sunday than he was prepared to give to a Member of this House last Thursday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask a number of questions and I expect the Minister to give honest replies because Government backbenchers would also like to have this information. I know one Government backbencher who is being very badly criticised by his constituents because nobody can establish who will benefit from this £9.60 allowance.  Certain amendments were made to the proposal when it reached the <Col N="2251" /> floor of the Gaiety on that famous occasion of the Sunday frolics.  Those amendments were welcomed because they made a mad tax package less mad.  I refer particularly to the wife of the lower paid worker who may not have been entitled to the £9.60.  If I understood the tax package correctly &mdash; and very few people did &mdash; she benefited from the frolics at the Gaiety.</P>
    <P>Not long ago I had experience of the Finance portfolio.  Is it not true that the Minister for Finance is under a great deal of pressure from the Revenue Commissioners and the trade unions because of accommodation, inadequate staff numbers and other pressures?  Yet last Sunday he decided that all interested wives could apply for the £9.60 allowance.  He is asking very searching questions in the circular, questions Deputy Sheehan's constituents might not like to answer.  These people may be very concerned when they realise the hidden threats and implications in the advertisement.</P>

      <P>I sincerely hope no party would so dishonour their commitments as not to pay these allowances. If these allowances are paid, they will cost the Deputy's constituents and mine an enormous amount of money next year and in the following years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>They still have not surfaced.  From the advertisement it appears that already one decision has been taken.  It is in regard to the 25 per cent tax band, although today the Taoiseach refused to be drawn on it when questioned by Deputy Haughey.  It seems clear that that decision has been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is the case, would the Minister tell the House honestly what this move will cost?  When I was Minister I pursued the question of inadequate office accommodation in the Revenue Commissioners. I must confess it was of great concern to me while I was there.  Some progress <Col N="2252" /> was made, and I hope it has been continued. However, how can the Minister reconcile the present position with the attitude adopted by some of the unions concerned?  I believe they have adopted this attitude because they are feeling the enormous work-load this will mean in an already overtaxed system.</P>
    <P>All Deputies are aware of how overworked the income tax area generally is. We have had deputations in our constituencies, and I am not saying that was not the case before the change of Government. There were problems then but at the moment tax offices are inundated with requests and representations.  I want the Minister to tell us if he is prepared to give extra staff even in face of the embargo imposed on civil service recruitment since the change of Government. In a critical speech on the civil service, and the public service generally, Deputy Kelly, Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, referred to non-productive staff.  I want the Minister now to spell out clearly what that means.  I want him to tell us if, where they are needed, extra staff will be made available.  If he agrees to do that, how does he reconcile it with the decision that recruitment will be stopped?</P>
    <P>Commentators have stated quite clearly that this £9.60 will not benefit any family.  They have also stated that the cost of the package will be enormous. How does the Minister propose to finance it?  Will it be by indirect taxation? I will quote a person who should be a supporter of the Minister and of Government policy, Mr. Brendan Halligan, former Deputy and Senator, former General Secretary of the Labour Party.  He said that his only regret was that in the campaign leading up to the general election he did not say what he believed to be the implications of this package in money terms because he believed it would have harmed the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us if this will increase the CPI by 8 per cent?  Will he say what the cost of the scheme will be and where the money will come from? Last Thursday I asked him who the beneficiaries will be.  What about the wives of the self-employed?  I understood the Minister <Col N="2253" /> to say on television that the wives of farmers whose valuations are less than £40 will not benefit because such farmers are not in the tax net.  Wives of farmers with valuations of more than £40 will benefit if they are in the tax net.  There is an anomaly: the wives of poor small farmers will not benefit but those of wealthy farmers will.  What about social welfare recipients?  They will be entitled to the usual increases in benefits but the wives will lose this £9.60.  Is that not class discrimination?</P>
    <P>These are all serious problems created by the architects of the Fine Gael pre-election document.  A commentator recently pointed out that the euphoria immediately after the election because of all these packages has turned to serious problems for the Government and the country.  We were told this afternoon that in another Finance Bill we could discuss all details of these proposals before Christmas.  Now we know this cannot be done, that we will have to wait until after Christmas.</P>
    <P>This morning, the newspaper which Deputy Sheehan respects as much as I, the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, had a leading article headed &ldquo;Divisive Legislation&rdquo;.  The article explains in detail why the proposals are divisive.</P>

      <P>I could quote many other newspapers but the time available to me is short.  This leading article states among other things that discussions are to be initiated as a matter of urgency between the Revenue Commissioners and the civil service unions who have indicated that they would not cooperate with proposed income tax reforms.  It goes on:</P>
      <P>The present impasse is related to the Fine Gael election promise to give a weekly stipend of £9.60 to wives working at home &mdash; a vote-pulling benevolence considerably at variance with the reality now presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, the most the Minister can say <Col N="2254" /> about the scheme is that under it wives would be getting their share of the allowances obtained on their behalf and which, in the Government's view, they had always been entitled to.</P>

      <P>I have referred to a paper which I believe the Deputy has some respect for also.  I sympathise with the Minister because he is carrying the can for the economic madness of a package introduced by some whiz kid with no experience of the difficulties involved or appreciation or realisation of the cost. The people and the Opposition are entitled to some frank answers now because it appears that this will be the only occasion that the House will have an opportunity of debating this matter before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am not in a position to agree with much of what Deputy Fitzgerald said, I appreciate the courteous manner in which he introduced his comments.  I wish to acknowledge that.  The Deputy referred to the fact that I did not give in the Dáil the cost of the programme as far as the £9.60 scheme is concerned.  I should like to quote what I said on that occasion and it may prove helpful to the Deputy in recalling what I said:</P>
      <P>The tax credit as such, in so far as it involves simply a conversion into a cash payment to the wife of a tax credit which would otherwise be available to the working spouse, would have no net cost whatever.  However, as the Deputy will also be aware, there is a proposal to extend it to people who are not in the tax net.  That has a net cost and I will be announcing, in the relatively near future, the decision the Government will take in the matter.</P>
      <P>I stated later:</P>
      <P>However, I assure the House that the net cost, given the total tax collected, will be relatively modest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And so it is.  The net cost arises from the <Col N="2255" /> fact that the Government programme includes a commitment to introduce marginal relief to ensure that all married workers in full-time employment will have an increase in family income of at least £4 a week even where current income is below the tax threshold.  Where current income is above the tax threshold there is no net cost, because all that is happening is that there is a transfer of half a credit against the husband's tax into a payment to the wife.  The net cost arises in respect of the implementation of the part of the programme which, as Deputy Fitzgerald correctly pointed out, was negotiated after the election in the course of discussions between the Labour Party and my party.</P>
    <P>At the time the Deputy tabled the question here a formal announcement had not been made by the Government and I was not in a position to give the exact answer as to the precise cost of that part of the programme.  That part of the programme was announced in the advertisement in Sunday's newspapers.  I should like to draw the Deputy's attention to the first part of that advertisement which states:</P>
    <P>In addition the legislation will provide that, where the family taxable income is £2,000 or more and below £4,000, one-half of the married personal tax credit (£9.60 a week) will be paid in full to the wife working in the family home notwithstanding the fact that the husband will not be liable to pay an equivalent amount in tax.  There will be marginal relief where the income is not greatly in excess of £4,000.</P>
    <P>That is where the net cost arises.  As I said on television, the net cost of that part of the £9.60 scheme is as follows: the family income supplement and the marginal relief will cost approximately £17 million in 1982 and £24 million in a full year.  The reason it is not the same cost in 1982 as in a full year arises from the fact that it will be introduced only from 1 April and, therefore, the cost is diminished by not applying the first three months of the year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2256" /> I should like to say something generally about the £9.60 payment.  The introduction of the £9.60 scheme to home-working wives is, in my view, a major innovation in our tax system.  For the first time wives working at home will have their contribution to national welfare directly recognised by the State.  Hitherto their contribution has always been indirectly recognised either through their husbands in the form of increased tax allowances for the husband or, if he is on social welfare, through giving him, not her, an increase in his social welfare benefit or, indeed, through their children in the form of childrens' allowances; but never until now has the contribution of the wife working at home been directly recognised by a direct payment to the wife in her own right by the State.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme will also help in difficult cases where husbands simply do not look after the financial needs of their wives.  I received a letter yesterday from a woman whose husband has an income of £15,000 a year and who, she claimed in the letter, made no cash contribution whatever towards her upkeep. He did buy some of the groceries but he made no direct cash contribution.  Most Members will find it hard to believe that such cases exist because, obviously, if that is happening, people do not go out in the streets and start boasting about it. They do not write letters to the newspapers, signing their name, and stating that this is the situation but the fact is that such family situations exist.  The £9.60 payment will make a small &mdash; let us be honest, inadequate &mdash; response to such situations but it will be something that has never been done before.  The Opposition do not seem to be able to make up their minds about the scheme. Do they believe that cases such as the one I mentioned do not exist?  Do they believe that a wife is not entitled to at least have the option of her share &mdash; I repeat, her share, &mdash; of the family credit <Col N="2257" /> paid directly to her?  It is only an option and if she does not want to claim it she does not have to do so, but do the Opposition contend that she should not even have the option of getting half of her husband's tax credit paid directly to her? It is time we asked the Opposition a few questions.  Are they for or against the scheme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the Opposition against the scheme?  Obviously, any new scheme involving as this one does as radical a departure from previous practices will have teething troubles.  Tax officials must get used to the operation of a new scheme and the Government must work out the exact method of operating a new scheme.  There may be difficulties with it now and I am sure that in the future there will be more; but there are always difficulties with any major innovation in the tax system.  In every Finance Bill introduced here we have a section correcting something that was done the previous year or closing a loophole that was opened the previous year.  There will always be difficulties with any tax scheme, but the important thing is to be moving in the right direction with a clear sense of purpose.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt, notwithstanding the attempts by others to find fault with individual aspects of the scheme, that we are moving in the right direction with a clear purpose in introducing a scheme, which is nationally acceptable.  Deputy Fitzgerald quoted from <i>The Cork Examiner</i> and I should like to quote for him from a paper which is perhaps even closer to his heart, namely, <i>The Irish Press</i> which, after acknowledging that there were many valid criticisms of the scheme, stated that the proposal, whatever its merits, had widespread public support among the country's housewives and was unquestionably one of the factors that helped bring Fine Gael to power.  The newspaper stated that, now that the Cabinet had decided to implement the plan from</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2258" /> April, that should be the end of the debate at least until the next election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with the questions raised by Deputy Fitzgerald. In regard to accommodation, I have authorised the Revenue Commissioners to enter into discussions with the tax officials with a view to providing additional staff, if that is necessary.  I will have a sympathetic review of any such claim. Obviously, where a completely new scheme such as this is being introduced, if extra staff are necessary to implement the Government's decision, extra staff will be provided, but that has to be discussed in detail in a friendly way with the tax officials concerned.  We will ensure that that is the case.  Unfortunately in the first six months of this year a number of vacancies in the Revenue Commissioners were not filled and that left the Revenue Commissioners in a difficult situation when the embargo on the filling of vacant posts was introduced.  We will do all we can to overcome whatever difficulties there are in order to get what we believe to be a widely supported scheme into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked about the position of the person who is self-employed.  The wife of a person who is self-employed will, like any other housewife, be eligible for this payment if she does not have an income in excess of £1,040 and the family taxable income is £2,000 or more.  There will be no restriction on the self-employed. In regard to full-time farmers with a valuation of more than £40, as they are in the tax net their wives will, if they meet the general criteria of the scheme, have the option of applying for this £9.60. In respect of wives whose husbands' valuation is less than £40 they are obviously not in the tax net and, as this is a tax <Col N="2259" /> credit, it would not be appropriate in my view&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As ownership of the house in question was vested in the occupier in 1970, Cork County Council are now precluded from carrying out any repairs or other works to the house.  Works carried out by the council at the time of vesting were determined by the then Minister to have been adequate to put the house into good structural condition as required under the Housing Act, 1966.  In any event work, such as the provision of bathroom facilities, would not be undertaken in putting the house into good structural condition in advance of vesting it in the tenant.  In these circumstances there are no grounds for an investigation by my Department on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
