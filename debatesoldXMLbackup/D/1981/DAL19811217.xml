      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a suggestion to the Taoiseach.  He need not give me an answer now, but perhaps we could discuss it later.  It seems that there are not many amendments down to the Housing Finance Agency Bill, although the amendments which are down are of some importance.  Perhaps we could consider giving more time to the Appropriation Bill towards the end of the day at the expense of the Committee Stage of the Housing Finance Agency Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That suggestion should be discussed by the Whips.  We had anticipated from the sound and fury from the Opposition benches yesterday that the Housing Finance Agency Bill would involve more discussion, but as there are not many amendments down it would be much better to have a debate on the Appropriation Bill, which is always given too little time.  It is only right that we should give extra time to this Bill if we have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should resist the temptation of point-scoring. The reason there are so few amendments down is because we had so little time. The Second Stage finished last night at 10.30 p.m.  If we can agree to give more time to the Appropriation Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">

      <P>In a reply given yesterday to a question I put down relating to the number of man hours in overtime worked each week in the Department of Social Welfare from 1 July to 30 November, the figure given was 7,324 man hours per week.</P>
      <P>Everyone will recognise that this represents over 200 additional jobs, and possibly 250 jobs.  Would the Taoiseach consider asking the Minister for Finance to lift the embargo on the appointment of young people to these posts?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the report in today's <i>Irish Times</i> could the <Col N="2345" /> Taoiseach confirm or deny whether the table on page 8 is an accurate account of deliberations by Government Ministers in recent days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot confirm that. I have seen the table and have instituted inquiries as to its origin and authenticity. I have not seen a similar official table but the precision of the figures suggest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The precision of the figures made me inquire whether it is an actual table coming from an official source, but I have not established the position yet.  If it is an official document, it is a leakage and is a very serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach to confirm or deny that it is an accurate account of proceedings.  He said that it was not.  Is it an accurate document from an official source?  The Taoiseach should be able to tell the House whether there is such a document in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not seen the document except in this newspaper.  I have instituted inquiries as to whether that is a leak of an official document.  On the face of it, it appears to be; but, as I have not seen the original document or any similar set of figures, I cannot give an answer.  As I said, it has the look of an official document and I am having inquiries made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is avoiding answering my question.  There is a table in <i>The Irish Times</i> which sets out very clearly and factually deliberations by the Government of demands by various Departments, cuts sought by the Minister for Finance, decisions taken as to what those cuts should be, and ending with the allocation for the public capital programme.  There are two serious aspects that have to be cleared immediately. First, is it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <P>The Taoiseach has answered your question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He has not.  This is a very serious matter.  There appears to be a leak of an official Government document and the Taoiseach has admitted that.  This is something which should be discussed in the House.  Are the figures quoted in the newspaper accurate?  Are they correct?  Have they been discussed by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, apparently, refuses to state whether those figures are accurate or not and, perhaps, we do not entirely blame him for that, because if they were my figures I would be very reluctant to admit that they were accurate.  As the Taoiseach has indicated that he has instituted an inquiry into the matter, I should like to know if he will undertake to let us know at the earliest possible moment &mdash; perhaps later today &mdash; the outcome of that inquiry or at least let us know before the Dail rises for the Christmas Recess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am serious about this because it is a serious matter &mdash; I am sure the Taoiseach agrees &mdash; if this is an official <Col N="2347" /> document that it should appear in this way.  We would appreciate if the Taoiseach would conduct the inquiry as expeditiously as possible and inform the House of the outcome of that inquiry at the earliest possible date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps a contributory factor here might be &mdash; and this is something which the Taoiseach should also investigate &mdash; the appointment of the huge number of non-civil service people to the various Departments.  That should be looked at.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This section states:</P>
      <P>1.&mdash;In this Act&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Agency&rdquo; means the Housing Finance Agency;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;borrower&rdquo; means a person to whom a loan described in section 5 (3) of this Act is made and includes the successor in title of the person to whom such a loan is made;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Companies Acts&rdquo; means the Companies Acts, 1963 and 1977;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;house&rdquo; includes any building or part of a building used or suitable for use as a dwelling and any outoffice, yard, garden or other land appurtenant thereto or usually enjoyed therewith;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;housing authority&rdquo; means a housing authority within the meaning of the Housing Act, 1966;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2348" />&ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>This section is important when one considers what is defined in it.  My first question is: why is there a need for such an agency?  Yesterday Members on this side in the course of some very good contributions expressed concern about the area of housing.  As a party we decided not to oppose the Second Stage and we did so not because we saw great merit in the new agency but because we viewed the agency as irrelevant.  Our view is that an injection of funds to help the construction industry is needed at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for interrupting the Deputy but he must confine his remarks to section 1, the definition section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am attempting to do that.  I am dealing with the definition and why we need the agency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy is saying would be more appropriate to section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to set the record straight with regard to our decision not to oppose the Second Stage. Last night, when concluding, the Minister seemed to cast reflections on our decision in relation to that.  The Bill is not the vehicle that will provide much-needed funds for the construction industry or house loans.  If the Government were serious they could provide the extra money rather than setting up this agency. I will make my points about the agency on later sections.  I am anxious to point out that our decision to agree to the passing of the Second Stage was to highlight the irrelevancy of the agency rather than an enthusiastic welcome for its establishment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that existing urban councils are considered to be &ldquo;housing authorities&rdquo; as defined in the section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I should not have last night, and I do not do so now, question the reasons why any party vote for or against any measure in this House.  That is entirely a matter for the party concerned. I merely put an interpretation on what I thought were the Opposition's reasons for not opposing the Second Stage.  I fully accept the point made by the Deputy and I acknowledged last night &mdash; I am not sure if Deputy Burke was present at the time &mdash; the value of yesterday's debate.  I am not sure that everything was entirely relevant to the Bill but I valued the contributions and I made an offer, which I hope will be taken up by the Opposition, that when the White Paper on housing is published in the spring we could arrange between the Whips a one-day debate on housing problems generally.  I learned a lot yesterday and I am sure that many more Members would have liked to contribute to the debate.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Calleary I should like to state that the reference to &ldquo;housing authority&rdquo; in the section is to the 41 authorities which operate a house purchase loan scheme under section 19 of the Housing Act, 1966 &mdash; that is, county councils, county borough corporations, borough corporations and three urban district councils, Athlone, Dundalk and Bray.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that under the Bill an urban council such as Ballina Urban District Council which has been operating a loan scheme will not be able to operate a similar scheme under the new agency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If they had been operating such a scheme, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>They did operate such a scheme and carried out all the investigations. May I take it that they will still be in a position to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If they operated an SDA loan scheme then the answer is yes.  I am not sure if that council operated such a scheme.</P>

    <Col N="2350" />
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his speech yesterday the Minister said that it was envisaged that at full operation the new scheme would replace the local authority loan scheme.  A very important part of housing finance here has been the existence of the SDA loans scheme.  Most young people if they had first choice would go for such loans because they borrow at a fixed rate of interest, make fixed repayments and they know from the outset the amount of their repayments until the mortgage is paid off.</P>
      <P>Contrast that with the type of loan that it is envisaged this agency will provide. The loan the agency will provide is fixed as a proportion of a person's income, going up year after year.  I gave an example yesterday from a table produced by an eminent economic journalist in the <i>Irish Independent,</i> Mr. Rapple, in which he showed that, using the system that is envisaged, on a 25-year loan, taking a man on a salary of £5,700 per annum at this stage and taking inflation in the third year down to 10 per cent which, with the policies of this Government, is unlikely although they will not be in office in the third year, the repayments over the 25-year life of the loan would amount to £140,000 on a £20,000 loan.  Contrast that with the loan that is provided at present under the SDA scheme which has been a central feature of housing finance for so many years.  That is the scheme that this Minister and this Government now intend to scrap.  The Minister in his speech yesterday said:</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that, at full operation, this new scheme will replace the local authority loan scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The SDA loan provides the ideal situation for a couple or for a single person starting off.  It means that one knows from the very first day exactly what one's repayments and one's interest rate will be for the life of the loan.  Twenty two per cent of all house buyers are single people and we can judge this Government's commitment to the provision of funds for housing by their actions last July.  On 23 July Deputy Barry, the Minister for the Environment, came into this House.  It was the week of the three budgets. <Col N="2351" /> We had a budget on the Tuesday which raised the level of inflation to figures that we had not seen for a considerable number of years and which was contrary to everything that had been included in the Fine Gael policy document, the Labour policy document and the infamous Gaiety Theatre document. In the Tuesday budget VAT was increased from 10 to 15 per cent.  From midnight on 21 July there was a price increase of 2p on spirits, 2p on beer, 4p on cigarettes.  There was an increase in the price of wine.  The unfortunate motorist was savaged once again with an increase of 4p per gallon on petrol, 4p on road diesel, 8p on LPG.  Excise duty on cars and motor cycles was increased from 40 to 50 per cent.  Road tax was reintroduced. There were stamp duty changes, bank levies, price increases consequent on the tax increases, increased Post Office charges.  On the Wednesday of that week there were further increases in respect of the ESB and so on.  Then on the Thursday the Minister for the Environment came in here with a measure which was the greatest act of discrimination by any administration for many years.  It was going back to the Victorian mentality.  When every administration had been introducing legislation to remove discrimination against women in the workplace and from as many aspects of Irish society as possible this Minister announced that he was removing the entitlement to mortgage subsidy from single people.  The Minister himself said in his speech that 22 per cent of house buyers were single people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister wear a badge?  Single people need housing too.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is that the Minister on 23 July removed entitlement to mortgage subsidy and to SDA loans from single people.  That is a measure of this Government's commitment to housing.  Now we have this Bill being rushed through this House.  The <Col N="2352" /> first time I saw the Bill was towards the end of the week before last.  The normal procedure in the House is that after Second Stage debate the Committee Stage, on foot of agreement being reached between the Whips, is taken a week or two later, thus allowing time to reflect on the measure.  In the short period available on this occasion we have a number of amendments tabled for today.</P>
      <P>We may well ask what is this Bill?  It is merely a flag-waving operation on behalf of the Government in an effort to show concern for the construction industry and for young married couples trying to buy a house.  It is a matter of shadow but not of substance.  The nub of the legislation is the raising of funds from the private sector but that can be done anyway under the existing Board of Works legislation. So far as the provision of funds for the construction industry is concerned I would question the Government's commitment just as I question their commitment in so many other areas.  I am concerned about that part of the Minister's speech in which he says it is envisaged that in full operation the new scheme will replace the local authorities loans scheme.  While we are still at the definition stage I would like the Minister to clarify for the House exactly what his intentions are in this respect.  Does he really intend to dismantle this centre-piece of housing finance of which we have had the benefit down through the years? Are the Government so blind as not to appreciate the advantages and the benefit that the SDA loans scheme has bestowed?  Is he prepared to destroy something so precious by the setting up of this scheme and providing for the repayment of mortgages by way of a percentage of income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy Burke tells us that the Bill was accepted by the Opposition last evening on the basis that it is irrelevant anyway.  To say that is to miss the whole point of the setting up of this agency.  The Bill is a very good measure.  It responds to a real need.  Any Member of the House or of a local authority will know that a certain <Col N="2353" /> section of the community are not in a position to get loans to build houses in the present circumstances.  They do not qualify for local authority loans at a certain level of income and their incomes are not sufficient to enable them to negotiate building society loans.  I am talking about the people in the £8,000 to £9,000 bracket.</P>
      <P>It is in response to that need that the Government have introduced this Bill. The scheme is by no means an irrelevancy. The need for it has existed for a long time.  That is why the Bill has the support of everyone here despite the charade of opposition put forward yesterday.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke has challenged the proposed repayments scheme and to support his argument he has quoted figures arrived at by a well-known journalist. However, that journalist was predicting a rate of inflation during a 25-year period and none of us knows what will happen in the future.  If one takes the present situation and thinks back to 12 years ago he will find that houses bought then at £3,000 are selling now at £30,000.  This is a factor of ten anyway so that if one is working on a factor of ten and talking about a house worth £30,000 one is into very high figures in terms of 12 years hence.  Therefore, even taking Mr. Rapple's enormous figures, one is talking about people having an asset worth twice the amount at the end of 25 years.  I do not know who will be around to pay £300,000 for a house but that is the sort of figure we are talking of if we base our assumptions on the situation during the past ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in trying to frighten people by quoting such enormous figures. Inflation will not proceed at that pace because one of the factors in inflation in the past number of years has been that too many people had a built-in vested interested in it.  One of those sectors was young couples who had taken on big mortgages.  If one took on a mortagage that was very high, one knew that inflation would ease the situation.  Young couples had an interest in inflation and the greater the better, provided one could recoup one's losses by way of <Col N="2354" /> national pay agreements.  That is what has been happening down through the years.  People who bought houses ten years ago are paying back very little now. Indeed, many of those people are the ones who are buying second houses and renting them to people in the £8,000 to £9,000 income bracket who are not in a position to buy houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to go into the details of the scheme.  We are talking about a very important measure.  As the Minister said, this legislation is not a replacement for SDA loans but rather, an alternative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I refer the Minister to the second definition of borrower?  It means a person to whom a loan described in section 5 (3) of the Act is made.  Am I right in thinking that the use of the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; normally implies either an individual, a company or a co-operative? If so, is it envisaged that loans might be given to housing co-operatives or companies, entities other than individuals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I explained that last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It refers to the person to whom a loan described in section 5 (3) is made.  If the Minister looks at that section he will see that it sets out numerous terms and conditions which apply to a loan made to persons other than a housing authority.  Is there laid down anywhere in the Bill the terms and conditions on which loans may be made to a housing authority that would parallel those kinds of provisions in regard to a loan to an individual?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5(1) covers that point.  It says that the agency may, subject to such conditions as for the time being stand approved of under this section by both the Minister and the Minister for Finance, make a loan to a person to acquire or construct a house and advance moneys to a housing authority to enable loans to be made by the authority for the acquisition and construction of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree that those conditions to which he refers apply both to an advance to a housing authority or to a loan made to an individual.  Yet, as shown in the definition section, reference was made to section 5(3) where from (a) to (k) conditions are set out applying to a loan to an individual but there seems to be no such reference applying to a lona to a housing authority.  From the point of view of the agency, the loans will either be to individuals or to housing authorities&mdash;most of them will be to housing authorities &mdash;directly from the agency.  It is strange that there should be such concern to set <Col N="2356" /> out all the conditions which will apply to a loan to an individual and no equal concern in regard to what will be the major function of the agency, loans to housing authorities.  There is an imbalance and I wonder if the Minister can tell us why this is so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The agency will lend to individuals under conditions which will be laid down by the Minister as a matter of policy.  The agency will lend to housing authorities and the conditions under which they will lend to authorities will be a subject for consultation between the two, because the authorities already lend to individuals money that is borrowed from the Local Loans Fund, and this money would have to be lent under a different set of conditions.  In practice, I feel the conditions laid down for individuals and under which the authority can lend to individuals will be the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The housing authority, in most cases, will be acting as the servant of the agency and lending the money.  I envisage this agency using existing SDA offices to manage the scheme.  The agency would lend money to the housing authorities which would, in turn, lend it to individuals and the terms and conditions under which they would lend to individuals would have to be reflected in the terms on which the housing authority would get the money from the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from drawing attention to the apparent imbalance&mdash;I say apparent, it may not be when it is analysed&mdash;I am somewhat concerned because I thought the position would be as I think the Minister has now described it that, in substance, the SDA machinery would be used for the purpose of operating this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The SDA loans are not the same as the agency loans but the <Col N="2357" /> personnel and the offices, which have experience of handling loans and of dealing with people applying for loans, will be the same.  They will be operating two schemes side by side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that the existing machinery will be used.  The various conditions and terms applying both to loans from the local authority from the local Loans Fund and to individual borrowers from the SDA are well known and established.  If that system were to be used there would not be need for all these conditions in this section.  On the other hand, these loans will be operated through different machinery with different conditions and I can understand why one would have to set out in considerable detail the terms applying to loans to individuals.  That being so, I do not understand why it is necessary to specify the new machinery that will operate for advances to housing authorities.  My reason for raising this is that the definition of &ldquo;borrower&rdquo; refers to section 5(3), but the definition of &ldquo;housing authority&rdquo; does not.  If what I am saying is correct, there ought to be a corresponding provision in the definition section of &ldquo;housing authority&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>My officals got the point much more clearly than I.  Exactly the same machinery will be operating these loans and the SDA loans.  Both will be lent to individuals but the housing authorities are part of the State machinery and therefore the terms and conditions must be laid down in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley has made a valid point.  Perhaps the confusion arises from the tenor of section 5(3) which indicates that the direction of the scheme to be operated by the agency would be the making of loans directly by the agency itself.  The whole of paragraphs (a) to (k) are directed to that end. These paragraphs refer to &ldquo;conditions of loans made to persons&rdquo;.  Those paragraphs apply to a person going to the agency to get loans, whereas it appears that that physical action is unlikely to <Col N="2358" /> arise because these loans will be processed through the local authorities.  That has not been made clear.  I assume that it is intended that the same qualifications, categories and so on will apply to loans being made by the local authorities and under this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 5 there is an allowance for the possibility that the agency might make loans to individuals. If the agency do so, the terms must be set out and the conditions laid down in which such loans would be made.  In all of the cases, however, the finance for the loans will be made to local authorities, <i>en bloc,</i> by the agency, and the local authorities in effect will be the agents of the agency.</P>

      <P>I would presume that the terms of the loan, as between the agency and the local authority, would involve fairly strict fixed repayments to be made by the local authority, on the due dates, to the agency because the agency, having to be self-financing, have their obligations to meet to the bond holders from whom their finance came.  Therefore the situation could arise, as was envisaged in the Minister's speech yesterday, whereby deferral is provided for under certain circumstances by the mortgage holder.

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt but perhaps the Deputy <Col N="2364" /> would agree that the point he is now pursuing would be more appropriate to section 4 or section 10 which deal specifically with these matters.  What we are dealing with here is the setting up of the agency.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the setting up of the agency.  It is clear to me that it may be fairly cumbersome to administer because the situation could arise in which local authorities would be dealing now with three types of loans &mdash; loans under the agency, and possibly for a while, existing loans in regard to the SDA scheme on new housing and SDA loans for the carrying out of repairs to houses.  I should like to know if there have been consultations with the staffs and unions involved in this.  I think I am in order on this because this is the section dealing with the setting up of the agency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We may be in a grey area, if you like, but still one relevant to the section.  I think we must persue it somewhat more to ascertain exactly what it all amounts to.  I think the Chair will agree with me on that.</P>

      <P>I was not going into the financial aspects; I was dealing with the administrative aspect which arises on this section.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister if there have been discussions with the unions in this respect.  It is not for me to pre-empt what the situation will be but, in other fields, situations have arisen in which personnel in some Departments have declined to operate &mdash; or perhaps the appropriate phrase is &ldquo;shall not operate&rdquo;&mdash; certain proposed new measures.  Therefore it is relevant to the question of personnel.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of this Bill there is entailed the setting up of the necessary machinery and recruitment of personnel. I should like to know therefore if the Minister has been given the &ldquo;all clear&rdquo; from the unions involved.  I am open to correction on this but, if my memory serves me correctly, there may be three unions involved.</P>

So long as the Deputy, and other Deputies, do not have sore heads later on when sections arise which deal more specifically with the matters now being raised, the Chair does not mind.

      <P>Unfortunately I did not hear the Minister's summing up last evening. This section deals with the formation and registration of the agency.  At this stage I presume the Minister has some idea as to how many members there will be on the board of the agency.  Has he any idea as to what staff, technical or administrative, will be recruited by the agency, particularly as it would appear now that the agency will give loans to individuals as well as to local authorities who will act as agents on their behalf?  He said earlier that he did not presume to know when the Bill would be passed but I understand it has to be passed this evening and will be passed by the Seanad tomorrow.  Because the Bill will be passed by the Dáil and Seanad before the weekend I presume the Minister expects applications for loans to be made within six weeks.  At this stage the Minister must have some idea of the size of the agency, the number of board members to be appointed, what staff will be recruited and what premises they will have.  Perhaps the Minister could let us know what is the position in relation to that.</P>

      <P>To take the point raised by Deputy Connolly first, the managers got a copy of the Bill last night plus my Second Reading speech.  I do not think it would have been correct to have given it to them beforehand but, of course, they could have obtained a copy of the Bill from the General Office.  Those to whom I have spoken are enthusiastic about being given the opportunity of operating this scheme.  I do not know whether that applies to all of them.  A conference has <Col N="2367" /> been arranged for early January to brief them on it, so that they in turn can brief their staffs, when all the matters raised by Deputy Connolly will be gone into.  I have not yet decided but the articles of association will say: between three and nine members.  The staff will be as small as possible and the overheads of operating the agency will be equally small.</P>

      <P>The debate so far has indicated how rapidly this legislation has been produced.  In other circumstances one might say it was induced rather than produced.  Since it is the Minister's intention to have this agency in operation very quickly he must know whether they will have technical staff to deal with people who apply directly to the agency rather than to the local authorities.  Who will process these applications and adjudicate on the value of the houses?  Has the Minister made any arrangements?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This company will be involved in raising millions of pounds and lending very substantial sums to local authorities and borrowers and a capitalisation of £100 is entirely inadequate.  The company will have initial expenses because they will have to employ staff and obtain stationery, telephones and all the machinery necessary to get the company off the ground.  It may take some time before the bonds are floated and before any moneys start to come from that source.  That is the only source of funds the company will have.  It seems to me, having regard to the size of what is involved here, that a more substantial capitalisation by the Minister would be appropriate to enable the company to set up and to meet the initial expenditures the company will have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have thought that a capitalisation of perhaps £1 million would not have been entirely inappropriate, having regard to the extent of the money transactions in which this agency will be involved.  If the agency had such a capitalisation it would have the big advantage of an initial supply of funds from which the agency could commence straight away to make advances and to get the scheme rolling very quickly without having to wait for all the legal delays and <Col N="2371" /> formalities involved in raising the bonds, issuing them, obtaining subscribers and so on.  This is, after all, put forward as a commercial transaction which has to be self-financing.  It would be laughable to have a company set up to deal with several million pounds with a capitalisation of only £100.  I would like the Minister to have some further consideration of the capitalisation of the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an open mind on what Deputy Taylor has said.  I believe the Minister is going on the standard rules laid down for any ordinary company. That is the general criteria under which companies operate.  I have some reservations in regard to company law but that cannot be dealt with under this Bill.  It could be said that the formation of a limited company today should be looked at again in the overall context.</P>

      <P>I share Deputy Connolly's concern about the operation of company law.  I consider that it is at least odd that a person can go into a solicitor's office or through a box number in a paper and set up a limited company.  The articles of association are so wide that one can do anything one likes.  One can rear elephants, engage in commerce, distil whiskey and anything one likes.  This is the normal standard way for setting up a company by the State.  I have no views about whether it is enough.  I am advised by the Attorney General's office, the <Col N="2372" /> State Solicitor's office and by the Department of Finance that these are the normal provisions and this is the normal type of company.  They are happy that this will cover everything we want to do and that it is the correct thing to do.  Normally, in a case like this, when a company start up, they operate on an overdraft until cash starts to flow.  I have the Telecommunications Investment Bill 1981 before me and this has exactly the same type of company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> I agree with Deputy Mervyn Taylor with regard to the capitalisation of this company.  The figure of £100 seems to be a very small amount in relation to the amount of money the company will be dealing with which will run into millions of pounds.  The Department and the Minister should at least have looked at this in a different light.  I know they are perfectly right with regard to the formation of this company.  I see advertisements in the paper every day in the week with regard to £100 capitalisation.  The Minister, in order to instil more confidence into this agency, should look at a figure more in the region of the amount Deputy Taylor mentioned.  There are bound to be expenses at the initial stage when the company is formed.  Personnel have to be employed and there is the usual setting up of offices and so forth which will require a certain amount of capital.  I believe, by and large, more resilience would be given to the company if there was a capitalisation of a larger amount because the company can run into trouble from time to time and may require something to fall back on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we are starting from a very weak base in relation to a company which we require the people to have great confidence in.  I believe the investors would like to see a company with larger capitalisation. I would like the Minister to have a look at this section to see if the capital should be increased for the benefit and resilence of this agency.  I am quite convinced if he did this the image of the company would be improved particularly in relation to people the company will be looking to borrow money from and also <Col N="2373" /> for setting up the company.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2374" />&ldquo;(4)  The memorandum of association and the articles of association of the Agency shall be laid by the Minister before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after the requirements of <i>section 2</i> of this Act have been complied with.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I accept the principle of the amendment tabled by Deputies Raphael Burke and Connolly in relation to the memorandum and articles of association.  I wish, however, to substitute the amendment which I have moved on the basis of legal advice which I have obtained.  The changes I have made in the text prepared by the Opposition are merely of a drafting nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister sees the wisdom of what we put down in our amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 not moved.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a key section of the Bill: Subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>The objects of the Agency stated in the memorandum of association shall include the following:</P>
      <P>(a)  to provide, by way of mortgage or charge, loans for the acquisition or construction of houses,</P>
      <P>(b)  to provide moneys to enable such loans to be made by housing authorities, and</P>
      <P>(c)  to borrow money for the aforesaid purposes.</P>
      <P>I would like to contrast the objects of the agency as set out in this Bill with what was included in the Fine Gael policy document. The Fine Gael policy document said:</P>
      <P>3.  For House Purchasers Through Existing Agencies who have Deposit Problems: Top-Up Loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2375" /> The pay-related mortgage will operate in conjunction with other sources of funding for house purchase.  Fine Gael will arrange with building societies that a new pay-related top-up loan will bear far less heavily in the first few years than any other source of borrowing used to fund deposits shortfall.</P>
    <P>This is an enabling Bill.  The real meat is the regulations and directions to be given to the agency by the Minister, including this top-up amendment.  Nowhere in this section is there provision for providing building societies with funds.</P>
    <P>One of the big difficulties facing building societies down the years has been the availability of funds so that loans can be provided on request.  In the Fine Gael policy document&mdash;and this was also included in the housing finance document issued by Fine Gael in October 1980&mdash;the clear impression was given that the housing agency, as well as making available money for loans to individuals, would also provide funds to help building societies with their cash flow problems and to eliminate the restriction of the six month-12 month period deposit regulation. That is not included in the objects of the agency, and it should be.</P>
    <P>Perhaps on reflection the Minister will include it as one of the objects of the agency.  One of the heartbreaks facing a potential house-purchaser, whether single or married, is the difficulty in getting a mortgage from a building society.  A person opens a deposit account in a building society and is assured that if the money is left on deposit for six months he will get a loan.  At the end of six months he applies for his loan but is told that because the in-flow situation is bad the rules have been changed and he must leave his deposit for 12 months or 18 months.  This is a very undesirable procedure and should be stopped.  When a society take a deposit and give a clear indication, if the money is left on deposit for six months a person will then get a loan, that should be the law of the land.</P>
    <P>Before I go any further, perhaps the Minister would like to clear up the point <Col N="2376" /> whether the agency will provide building societies with a new pay-related top-up mortgage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is exactly what the Deputy said.  The Deputy said it was an attack on the public service.  It is my duty <Col N="2377" /> as Minister, as it was Deputy Burke's duty when he was Minister, to spend carefully taxpayers' money when it is entrusted to us, and I intend to do that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the number of staff necessary throughout the country, that is a matter for negotiation.  As I told Deputy Connolly, the county and city managers will be in Dublin in the first week in January to discuss this matter with officials of my Department, but numbers in individual offices have not been identified yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I said was that the Minister's policy as a Minister has been an attack on the public service, in particular with regard to the staffing of local authorities.  If the Minister wishes to go back into that matter and the embargo of last July on employment of staff in local authorities, I will do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I said there was an attack on the public service but not in relation to this.  It is irrelevant, as the Minister knows.  The real question is how will the Minister get over the embargo that exists with regard to employing additional staff in the housing offices of local authorities.  There is no doubt that the staff in those offices will have to be increased substantially because of the complexity of the type of mortgage envisaged by the regulations and directions to be given by the Minister to the agency with regard to P.60s, application forms, annual checks on P.60s, or alterations in <Col N="2378" /> repayments that will be necessary annually.  Has the Minister thought about this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this is beyond the competence of local authorities who are accustomed to dealing with people who borrow money under the SDA loan scheme and to the collection of moneys under pay-related schemes, because about 100,000 tenants are pay-related. The number of staff will, of course, be increased but I do not know by how many or where.  If the extra staff are necessary they will be provided and that is not included in the embargo of the Minister for Finance announced in July.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It keeps changing. In the various documents that have been produced it has changed from 17 to 20 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be a little more.  Of course, a figure as low as 14 per cent was also mentioned.  If a man gets a loan his repayments will be based on 18 per cent of this year's income.</P>

      <P>His repayments will be based on 18 per cent of his income for the first year but he may have to wait for some time to get his P.60 in the second year.  The local authority must wait before they can alter their records and <Col N="2379" /> give him the percentage he will be liable for the following year.  What happens when there are delays in the production of documents by the tax authorities?  Will a demand be made immediately on the borrower for any shortfall in the first few weeks in the event of a delay in the provision of documents?  How will this area be tackled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities are competent to deal with this situation. They meet such situations frequently. Employers throughout the country meet such situations frequently where PRSI forms are delayed or where for some reason documents do not come through on time.  I presume that where there is a delay the borrower will make an approximate payment pending the presentation of the documents and then make the full payment at the end of the period to make up the difference or carry it forward and make it up over a longer period.  They are normal administrative practices that are met daily by all lending institutions, including banks, local authorities, hire purchase companies and building societies. Such a problem is settled in a reasonable and practical manner and it will be done in the same way by the agency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted last night to hear the Minister say that the scheme envisaged will be run parallel with the SDA loan scheme and not in substitution for it.  It seems that a keynote factor in the work of the agency should be the issue which was touched on earlier, the provision of a second mortgage.  The Minister was correct when he stated that it is referred to in section 5 (4).  I would be happier if the words &ldquo;second mortgage&rdquo; were spelled out in the objects of the agency.  The most valuable service the agency could fulfil would be to help those who are on local authority waiting lists and are eligible for a loan of £18,000 under the SDA scheme.  If such people can get £4,000 or £5,000 from the agency they will be able to buy a house.  The objects clause should include the words I have suggested, and I regard that as most important.  It will seem strange to <Col N="2380" /> many people who approach local authorities, the bodies who will have the unfortunate and difficult task of operating the new scheme as a parallel with the existing SDA scheme, when officials point out that there are two schemes operating, the SDA scheme at 12½ per cent and the new scheme at an interest rate of between 18 and 20 per cent.  There will be the added complication if, as I trust will happen, the second mortgage scheme is available. Those schemes will have to operate simultaneously.  A borrower may seek a loan of £18,000 under the SDA scheme at 12½ per cent and the remainder he requires for his house from the new agency at an interest rate of between 18 and 20 per cent on a second mortgage. That will give rise to technical problems that the legal people will have to work out.  I do not know if one can have a first and second mortgage from the same lender, but I have no doubt that the legal people will be able to get over that complication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the point made by Deputy Taylor.  I think the second mortgage is the point he wants to bring across.  A second mortgage house will probably give rise to legal problems but I have great confidence in the legal people to solve the problem.  I am sure Deputy Taylor would be extremely good at it.  I do not have any lack of faith in the competence of the local authority officers to administer two schemes side by side.</P>

With regard to Deputy Noonan's point, the revenue commissioners are at present examining how that will be done.  Of course, it is a problem.  One does not bring in anything new without some problems.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> What I envisage happening is something similar to what has happened in the banking institutions over the past ten years.  In the old days one could go into a bank and get an overdraft for a considerable time at a given amount but nowadays one is diverted to the merchant banks and given term loans, the reason being that there is more profit in that section.  The will be plenty of money available from this agency and the Minister's problem will be who to borrow from.  In four or five years' time money will become scarce for SDA loans and at that stage applicants will be forced into taking loans from the agency.  This is an easy way for the Government to withdraw money from local authorities.  They can always say here is plenty of money to be got from the agency but the house purchaser will pay much more than he would to the local authority.  People will be advised that if they want loans in the near future they should go to the agency rather than wait for an SDA loan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am getting confused as time goes on.  When the Minister moved the Bill he said:</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that, at full operation, this new scheme will replace the local authority loan scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that last night he changed that and said that both schemes would work in tandem.  I would agree that you cannot expect the present staff of local <Col N="2383" /> authorities to cope with two schemes at different interest rates.  I think the philosophy behind the Bill originally was that the finance for SDA loans, which now comes directly from the Exchequer to local authorities, was to be raised instead from private financial institutions. I wonder if the Minister would have a figure for 1980 and up to now in 1981 of the amount which was provided from the Exchequer for all the local authorities for SDA loans.</P>
    <P>The Minister should remove the two-tier situation that local authorities are now being asked to operate.  At present the most popular loan is the SDA loan because one knows at the beginning what one will pay at the end.  Naturally people will opt for the lower interest rate when they are told that there are two schemes in operation.  Various Governments in the past have asked the building societies to devote a certain percentage of their loan finance to new houses as opposed to second-hand houses.  Does the Minister intend to impose the same condition on this new agency?  I think it is a very good thing from the point of view of the construction industry to devote a higher percentage of money to new houses as opposed to second-hand houses.  Has the Minister any views on this?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that local authorities have operated two parallel schemes in the past so that in that sense this is not a new matter.  As well as the SDA loans scheme they have operated the low-rise mortgage scheme which operated on considerations different from those on which the SDA loans scheme operated.  Therefore, local authority officials have experience of operating two parallel schemes but we have here a different situation because the two may be tied together, one on a first mortgage and the other on a second mortgage.  However, there is one aspect of the repayments proposal that causes me concern and I should like the Minister to clarify the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take the basic principle, that is, that the scheme must be self-financing, it follows that the agency raising its funds <Col N="2384" /> from the life offices will be committed to pay them a certain rate of interest on an index-linked scheme.  The agency, not having funds from any other source, will have to nominate their rate of interest on the moneys lent to local authorities for intending mortgagors.  At least in year one that will be fixed and obviously it will have to be somewhat in excess of the rate of interest that they will have to pay to the life offices because, in addition to having to cover their charges to the life offices, they will have to bear the cost of the administration of the scheme.  That is all very well but it leaves a local authority in a situation in which they are committed to paying back the agency at a certain rate of interest, index-linked.  Let us put that figure at 18 per cent.  When the local authority lend money to a house buyer they will have to nominate a rate of interest that will enable them to recoup from the borrowers at least sufficient to enable them to pay back the agency.  Otherwise there would be a fiscal drag on the local authorities and I do not think anybody is suggesting that that should be the case.</P>
    <P>We turn then to the proviso that the mortgagor may repay the loan during a 25-year period on the basis of 18 per cent of his gross income for the previous tax year.  This imposes an artificial element into the repayments.  It may well be that any person availing of that proviso will be paying back to the local authority appreciably less than the local authority are obliged to pay to the agency.  There fore, there is a gap and a shortfall and I should like the Minister to tell us where and when that shortfall will be made up and by whom, always bearing in mind the key basic fact that the agency must be self-financing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Deputy Leyden the Minister said, in regard to the assessment of farmers, that there is a criteria for them in respect of social welfare entitlement.  That is so but the assessment is made either on the notional or on the factual situation.  Which of these two means of assessment will be used in this case?  Will every small farmer have to be assessed on the basis of factual income thus involving a social welfare officer visiting <Col N="2385" /> the farmer for the purpose of getting details of income?</P>
      <P>My second question relates to the same matter as that raised by Deputy Taylor. I, too, would like to know who is to pay the local authority if they are at a loss as a result of an interest rate being fixed for a number of years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authority will not be at a loss because the agency will be lending block funds to the local authorities who will collect the repayments and pass them back to the agency. It is envisaged that the agency will borrow money every year.  They will not be repaying the money they borrow until the end of the term for which the money was borrowed.  Therefore, they will have a very strong cash flow situation all the time and that will apply, too, to the local authorities who will be merely collecting the money and passing it back to the agency.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question about farmers, their income would have to be assessed each year because the scheme is income-related.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Callanan can <Col N="2386" /> suggest a scheme that would be fair to every farmer it could be examined either by the agency or by the Department.  So far as I know, it is not possible for a central Government authority to lay down a rule about a matter in which there are so many variables.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, the figure she requested is about £101 million but included in that is a figure for home improvements.  That is the only gross figure we have, but the figure for 1981 was somewhat less.  Only those people earning less than £7,000 per year will have an option because those earning more than that do not qualify for an SDA loan.  But they have a choice between borrowing from the agency and borrowing from a building society or an insurance company. I think that what will happen in this case is that a potential borrower will be presented with the details of both schemes and that staffs in SDA offices will become so expert in both schemes that they will be able to advise people as to which system would suit their circumstances best.  There will be no question of trying to influence people one way or the other.  They will look at each application individually and decide which scheme is suitable for that person.  The type of person in the SDA bracket, whom the Housing Finance Agency would be suitable for would be young and in a job which may be poorly paid at present but which has good prospects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the percentage of money to be allocated <Col N="2387" /> for new houses as opposed to second-hand houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be giving no directions at all; we will wait to see how it operates for a few years and whether there are any snags.  I was inclined to agree that a greater proportion should be given to new houses but people have said that you cannot seperate one unit of the housing market from another.  A person in a secondhand house can buy a new house so they are all interlinked.  If there are a large number of unsold new houses on the market and the price of second-hand houses is rising because the money is available to buy them, then I, or the Minister of the day, will step in to balance the situation.  The idea at present is to leave the agency as free as possible and that it should have as beneficial an effect as possible on the housing market, while, at the same time, providing a different type of funds to people, which are not now available, whereby the repayments in the initial periods compared to repayments under existing housing finances, are very much easier and the deposit very much smaller.  Under the SDA scheme you would have to find a deposit of £9,000 or £10,000 because the maximum loan is fixed at £14,000 for most people.  Some people can get a loan of up to £18,000 but it is £14,000 for the majority.  If they get a loan from a building society, the payment in the first year of the mortgage is going to be 45 per cent or 50 per cent depending on the type of house, which is an enormous slice out of anyone's income.  This is not practical for most couples in the smaller income group. People are tending to marry younger nowadays and they must get a deposit together sooner than was the case some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this agency, we are offering them a chance to purchase a house with a reasonably small deposit.  At one stage we were thinking in terms of no deposit but I have accepted the advice given by my Department that anybody buying a house should get together a sum of money first.  They will have quite small repayments in the initial years, 18 per <Col N="2388" /> cent of their incomes, so somebody earning £8,000 a year would be paying £1,500 a year, £30 per week, as against £80.  Of course there is a price to be paid.  Nobody is going to be forced to take money under these conditions, the fact that you are repaying much smaller sums of money than if you had borrowed from other agencies means that the shortfall in repayments are brought forward and added to your debt but the amount you pay each year is related to your income and not fixed as it is under building society and SDA loans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because the couple will come to a stage where they will be paying more, the amount of capital will drop very sharply and the debt will be wiped out after 25 years.  The repayments are related to your income and as your income goes up you repay more every year.</P>

      <P>Yes, as his wages go up the repayments go up but the percentage of his income does not vary.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The longer the debate goes on the more complicated it gets. With regard to the farming community, there is nothing in the Bill to say that income will depend on poor law valuation. It states £9,000 or under.  In the £40 to £60 valuation or over, most of the farming and business community receive <Col N="2389" /> an assessment from the Inspector of Taxes.  A return of income has to be made at the end of March every year and this is where I see vast paper work involved with the local authority offices.  The Inspector of Taxes can send out a demand for £12,000, it is up to you to take up this with your accountant and it is open then to returns and accounts.  There will be controversy because there is a slowing down in income tax offices because of the embargo on staff which was placed on them by the Government.  They have not sufficient personnel to deal with the returns promptly.  Deputy Callanan hit the nail on the head in regard to people with under £40 valuation.  How will this be done?  In cases of SDA applications, an assistance officer of the health board went around to ascertain the incomes of applicants.  This has been a complicated problem over the years.  In this case those who are not on PAYE will present difficulties involving tremendous paperwork. I do not know if I took the Minister up properly but I think he said that those on incomes of less than £7,000 can borrow under the SDA system, but suppose such a person needs bridging of £8,000.  Will he be able to go to the agency to get them to top it up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have that cleared up.  There is no reference to it in the Bill.  Repayments will be easy in the first few years but from then on they will get heavier.  When rents of local authority houses are increased to keep pace with inflation there is a great hue and cry.  The same will happen in regard to repayments of these loans.  It has been said, and there is a difference of opinion about it, that total repayments on a loan of £20,000 over 25 years could amount to between £135,000 and £150,000.  That is a possibility, depending on inflation.  After the first few years borrowers will have growing families and they will have to provide for their education, and that will be at a time when the repayments will be heaviest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course there is the position that the <Col N="2390" /> borrowers will have to pay for the establishment costs of this scheme, technical and legal fees.  The agency funds will come from financial institutions and of course they will lend in the knowledge that they will be on a gilt-edged investment at, I understand, something like 18 per cent.  Such institutions will be protected all the way and the borrowers will have to carry this.  I think the Bill is shifting the emphasis of providing housing finance from the Government to the financial institutions in an indirect way and the borrowers will be paying through the nose.</P>
    <P>I referred to the paperwork that will be necessary.  At the moment there are delays of between eight weeks and three months in the processing of SDA loans. Now local authorities will be saddled with this new scheme and I suggest that the delays will be increased.  I understood the Minister to say that he has had negotiations with local authority managers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Not formally, just casually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister also said that there is enthusiasm for the scheme among the officials.  I hope he is right. We have had a different story about other State organisations.  I hope I am wrong on this occasion.  I hope any financial arrangement that is made will work well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before, this Bill is being rushed through with little consultation. The people who will operate it have not been consulted yet.  It is all right to consult with managers, but managers have to consult with the personnel in their offices.  The staff may say they will operate the scheme if they get additional personnel. The Minister said there would be no embargo in regard to the agency.  If I am right there will be no embargo on the personnel needed for the agency at national level, the personnel who will accompany the directors.  Will the embargo on the personnel at local authority level remain?  That is a valid question which needs clarification.  We will have the agency personnel who will back up the chairman and the directors <Col N="2391" /> of the finance agency.  This will involve extra administrative work for the local authority staffs.  I am not suggesting that the local authorities will be looking for extra personnel immediately, but this has happened in other areas over many years even when we were in office.  I do not deny that.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the agency will want to know what the income was in each year. After a lot of research work, paper work and correspondence, they may get the income right for the first year.  What about the self-employed person?  There may be a lot of correspondence to be handled and this could be cumbersome and cause delays.  There may be delays and disputes over income.  There could be a dispute after 5 April between the Revenue Commissioners and the accountants acting on behalf of their client who may be a farmer.  It may eventually have to go to a hearing.  Will the repayments be on the income for the previous year until clarification is arrived at, or will the person have to pay the difference?  I hope I am making this clear.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that local authorities will be looking for extra personnel. Whoever is at fault, over the years there has been a big upsurge in the level of office personnel, but the figure is a diminishing one for road workers.  That is open to interpretation.  Perhaps the office staff had more muscle.  I do not know.  When I was a member of a county council the manager told us that if he had the personnel he would handle any problem we put before him.  Whether we like it or not, the staffs of the local authorities will want to talk about extra personnel.  The Minister for Finance placed an embargo on further appointments and therefore the local authorities cannot employ more personnel to administer this scheme.  I hope they will work this scheme with the loyalty and dedication they have shown over the years.</P>

      <P>I should like clarification on a point raised by Deputy Mervyn Taylor and the reply the Minister gave.  Do I take it now that the Minister envisages that local authorities will act only as agents?  Let us say a local authority get a lump sum then all that local authority has to do is to repay the interest on the <Col N="2393" /> money they have borrowed Is that it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave the impression &mdash; and I wrote down his answer &mdash; that local authorities would just pass on the repayments they got from their borrowers to the agency and that, because of that, there would be no, to use Deputy Mervyn Taylor's words, fiscal bond on them.  I would hope that local authorities would not be in a position of having to go on overdraft to pay this back, that they just pay back the repayments. Perhaps the Minister would clarify the position with regard to the question of choice also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I just explain, to make it quite clear, what is involved here. The local authorities will be paid for their services.  At present, as the Deputy knows, they are charged ½ per cent under the Local Loans Fund.  They will now be paid by the agency for operating this scheme but the financial liabilities of the scheme will be for the agency, not for local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  The Minister spoke about choice.  I might suggest there is one way people could be given a real choice.  Reading the Minister's remarks, seeing that the income limit will be £9,000 and that the maximum loan in the vast majority of cases will be £22,500, if the SDA income limit is raised to £7,500 and if the amount of loan to be obtained on that is raised to three times, the same maximum loan applies as in this case.  In essence, even though the income limit is £9,000, it would appear to me that the maximum income a person can have to get the loan is £7,500 for a loan three times the income, £22,500.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2394" />
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Or 90 per cent of the value of the house excluding the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, an applicant cannot get more than 90 per cent of the grant.  If they did, they would get more than £22,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>That means then that the maximum income an applicant can have is £7,500.  To give people a real choice local authorities should be able to say to any person comming into them: Here are your choices.  You can take an SDA loan.  You can take a loan under the Housing Finance Agency scheme.  Or you can go to a building society.  That would give people a real option.  That can be done quite easily by raising the income to £7,500 and by raising the amount of the loan from twice the income, as obtains now, to three times.</P>
      <P>Part of the thinking behind this Bill appears to be the transfer of the whole question of mortgage from the Government to this new Housing Finance Agency.  In other words the Government will not be involved at all, except that the Minister for Finance guarantees the loans borrowed.  I feel that is what is entailed, that at the end of the day central government will have money to spare as a result and that that money will be able to be put into local authority housing.</P>
      <P>Again I apologise for not having been here last evening to hear the Minister's reply.  Do I take it now that the Minister has changed his mind and that the SDA loans will continue for all time?

      <P>May I seek clarification on a few points?  What worries me is that some items in the Bill are so dangerously vague.  We all know that people who want money rarely scrutinise the small print. When one is in the position of needing a house and must get the money from some agency or other, one is so jolly glad to get it one rarely scrutinises the small print.  I would be afraid that borrowers would fall into this pitfall.  I so not think prospective borrowers will realise the never-ending burden they are taking on themselves because the period is not set.  The period is set only in so far as there is a 25 year period mentioned, but not set.</P>
      <P>It appears that prospective loans could continue for ever, at least that is my reading of it.  For instance, if a borrower becomes ill and goes on social welfare, what rule of thumb or what income is used then?  What repayment must such a person then make?  Also why is the loan calculated on gross and not net income? Why does the 18 per cent rate of interest remain over the 25, 30 and 40 year period?  Why does that not go down?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2396" /> Another matter is this.  If people surrender their house to a local authority they can now, without any question, get up to £27,000.  Heretofore they have lived in a local authority house greatly subsidised by the State.  They are now handing that back and do not seem to be getting much except the £27,000.  I do not think they will ever be able to see the daylight under 25 years.  The Irish mentality is such that when one borrows one likes to know exactly the duration of the loan, the period involved.  We are not great borrowers but we like to plan.  For instance, people who buy a car like to know whether the repayments period is, say, three years or five years.  With regard to the purchase of a house we like to be able to say: &ldquo;I have only three years left to repay on my loan, which is reassuring as I am getting older&rdquo;.  It appears to me that prospective borrowers will never know when their mortgage will be repaid, because all this is so dangerously vague. This is what worries me.  I would hate to think of a borrower taking this on in good faith, when in need of a house, and being so glad to get the money.  As a member of a local authority I would hate to think I had put a noose around their necks, for which they would never forgive me.</P>

If I might cite the example of the new schemes in Cork at present with which the Minister will be familiar &mdash; I am referring to the Model Farm Road and Blackrock schemes &mdash; I must assume that if those people are to purchase their houses they will do so through the Housing Finance Agency?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This scheme is aimed at helping people who find difficulty in saving a deposit or in getting a loan.  One of the great difficulties, especially for those constructing a house, is the length of time during which they may be on bridging finance.  A house costing £25,000 to build would involve an interest payment of from £4,500 to £5,000 on bridging finance.  It always strikes me as peculiar that in the case of an SDA loan a person can go to a bank with a letter signed by the county manager and use this as security for bridging finance. I fail to see why the money could not be given in the first instance by the local authority.  I should like to see this new agency getting away from the difficulties of bridging finance.  Some local authorities will make phased payments at present but others will not.  It should be written into the conditions governing loans that payments will be made at intervals during the construction of a house, thus doing away with the necessity of bridging finance.  This is one of the factors inhibiting people from building their own houses.</P>

      <P>The agency should be regularly accountable to the Dáil for their activities and I would ask the Minister to make provision for regular reporting to this House, either directly or through the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.</P>
      <P>Problems are caused in local authority housing schemes because of unnecessary delays in structural inspections and I hope the Minister will instruct local authorities acting as agents of the agency not to allow these unnecessary delays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Deputy Acheson on her maiden speech, a significant contribution which augurs well for the future of what I know will be a long, honourable and distinguished presence in this Chamber.  It is also appropriate that as a member of a local authority she should contribute to a debate on legislation which has significant implications for local authority structures.</P>
      <P>The last speaker said the Minister was explicit in his introductory speech.  Part of that speech was as follows:</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that, at full operation, this new scheme will replace the local authority loan scheme.</P>
      <P>The Minister has now done a complete U-turn on that.  He has told us that it could be misinterpreted to signify the demise of the SDA loan scheme, but I do not think there is room for misinterpretation. It is a specific and explicit statement that the local authority loan scheme will go.  The SDA scheme is sacrosanct. It represents involvement by the State in the encouragement of house purchase and should not be interfered with.  Under this scheme a house purchaser would know from the first day that he had a fixed rate of interest and that his repayments would not change during the time of the mortgage.  That must be contrasted with the situation which will exist for those borrowing under this new agency where repayments will be assessed as a percentage of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has given an assurance that there will be no question of difficulties <Col N="2399" /> regarding the employment of additional staff necessary for the local authorities to operate this scheme.  This is another U-turn in relation to the embargo on recruitment to local authorities but in this case I welcome it and wish it were carried through to the fire services and other sections.  The Minister said that he has spoken to a number of county managers and that they have welcomed the idea.  Has there been any discussion with staff representative bodies regarding the implementation of this scheme?  It appears that considerable discussion would be necessary and productivity and other questions would have to be considered. If he had not said earlier that this scheme would be operating by the end of January or early February the Minister could say that this question was somewhat irrelevant.  Perhaps he will tell us now whether there have been any approaches or negotiations with staff associations?</P>
    <P>Are we to see ourselves in a similar situation to that which we have at the moment in relation to the £9.60 transfer from husband to wife, where a scheme was publicised and introduced but now, except for the small number who are applying, would be inoperable because of staff difficulties within the service?  I understand that the staff associations representing the officials who will be dealing with the implementation of the £9.60 have refused to co-operate in the pending additional employment of staff and productivity questions being clarified.  Will we find ourselves in a similar situation with regard to this particular scheme and the extra burden it will impose on the local authority SDA loans sections?</P>
    <P>We are discussing this Bill in a rushed manner without having the opportunity to reflect at length on it and without providing the Minister with the opportunity to put down amendments.  I would like, for the benefit of the House, to remind the Minister that in another Bill he produced, up to 3.30 and 4 o'clock on Tuesday, amendments on the Rent Restrictions Bill which was guillotined through that night at 10.30.  At that stage he had the opportunity to reflect on the <Col N="2400" /> amendments which would be required and the amendments that would improve the Bill.  The problem in relation to this Bill is that it is being guillotined through and we have no time for contemplation of amendments.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister had the time to reflect on the staffing implication in relation to the operation of the agency?  We were told by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach on Tuesday that this Bill was needed to inject extra funds into housing immediately to tackle a major social problem.  There could be an even further social problem created because of a lack of co-operation by the staff of local authorities.  I do not intend to be irresponsible on this.  I am merely setting this down as a marker.  There could be a situation where the existing loans being provided by the SDA loans staff will also be unavailable because of lack of co-operation on the basis of the additional workload being created for them by the implementation of this particular new scheme which is being put forward.  We should hear something from the Minister on this.  Will he give us some indication on the staffing?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get back to the points I made earlier and the Minister's reply when I spoke about the difficulty of working the two schemes, the SDA scheme as it is at the moment and the new scheme, by the local authorities in tandem and the problems that will be created.  In my county the SDA loans scheme is virtually non-existent because single people are barred unless they can produce evidence that they are getting married.  On production of that evidence the income of the spouse to be is taken into account with the result that when the two incomes are added together they are over the limit so they cannot qualify at the moment for an SDA loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Calleary spoke about giving a real choice to a couple who go into a local authority.  One of the ways he mentioned, with which I agree, is that if you increase the income limit for the SDA loan and if you also increase the amount of the loans to make them comparable, this <Col N="2401" /> would get over the problem.  Young people normally want to budget ahead. If they want to buy X amount of things for their house next year they have to be able to budget ahead and know how much money they can spend.  Under this new scheme they cannot do that.  Every time a person's income is increased the repayments are also increased so it is virtually impossible to decide this year what one can do next year.  First of all, one does not know what income increase one will get and, as a result, one does not know what mortgage repayments one will be making.  I understand that under the moneys available from the Housing Finance Agency single people are not barred.  Is that correct?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an anomaly the Minister will have to do something about if he is going to offer a real choice to somebody who goes into a local authority.  In the case of the redemption of a loan is there a penalty, as there is in the other lending agencies at the moment?  It is fair to say the greatest difficulty young couples have at the moment is that in the first three or four years of any mortgage the repayments are very high and it is far more difficult to be able to make those repayments. The way to tackle that is the way it was being tackled with the mortgage subsidy which gave the relief in the very important early years of a mortgage.  It is also fair to say at that particular time couples have least commitments familywise.  Perhaps they have no family at all or the family are very young.  It is as the family get older the expenses become greater. The educational expenses, the medical expenses and other expenses get greater. Once the repayments level off, as happens at the moment, people can cope with the increased expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new scheme people will not be able to do that because they cannot know this year what their repayments will be next year.  If the Minister is serious about giving a fair option to people, as they go to local authorities, he will have to increase the income limit for the SDA <Col N="2402" /> loan and the amount of the loan that is available and he will also have to get rid of the anomaly about single people.  This is virtually non-existent in my county at the moment because of the adherence to barring single people from loans.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister will find at the end of the day that he would have been better off if the SDA loans scheme was not tampered with and if we did not have the situation we will now have with the two things running in tandem and people being totally confused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no dispute about what local authority officials think about the SDA loan.  It served a great purpose and built many a house.  What is the position today?  If a person's income is in excess of £7,000 that person is denied an SDA loan.  If a person earns less than £7,000 he can get £14,000.  People are getting married very young nowadays. Many of them are getting married under 21 years of age.  A house costs at least £22,000.  What do those people do?  They get £14,000 and they have £8,000 to make up.  Where do they go?  We have heard talk about bridging loans but even at the cost they were not available last year and people had to stop in midstream because the contractors walked out.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that the Opposition have withdrawn their opposition to the Bill and are concentrating on the staffing and the services needed in local authorities. Not very long ago local authorities were faced with meeting repayments of reconstruction loans, group scheme loans, supplementary loans and they had to deal with the collection of domestic rates.  We have now decided to abolish the agricultural rates so I cannot see any problem about local authorities being able to handle this.  There has been a lot of emphasis on staffing and the trouble which might arise.  Last year the offices of the Revenue Commissioners throughout the country were closed for eight months.  Public representatives could not contact them.  As a result the people went on strike.  We had to get over that at great inconvenicence to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, this is a wonderful Bill. Mention was made of the repayment <Col N="2403" /> period being indefinite.  The period of repayment is only indefinite where the person cannot meet his commitments because of unemployment or sickness. Over the past few years it has not been unusual to see people who borrowed under the SDA loan scheme being taken to court.  That is not casting any aspersions on the managers of the county councils, but the money had to be paid and nothing could be done under these Acts.  This Bill will protect the people who might run into this difficulty and for that reason I welcome it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view that should be changed because in this day and age to say that somebody under 21 cannot enter into a contract is an anachronism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If persons are old enough to vote and marry they should be allowed to enter into a contract.  Here we are not talking about a contract which is binding all their lives; it is only binding for the period until they reach 21 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not realise Deputy Acheson was making her maiden speech.  I join with Deputy Burke in congratulating and welcoming her to this House.  She was right when she said people who borrow money do not look at the small print because they are so anxious to get into their houses.  The only cure for that situation is when the supply of houses exceeds <Col N="2404" /> demand.  When there is competition for houses among prospective customers the result is that house prices increase. Young people, because they are in too much of a hurry or are badly advised, do not always fully appreciate what they are getting into.  This is an area we must all keep an eye on and try to correct by having so many houses that the customer has a choice.</P>
    <P>When somebody goes to a local authority to borrow money to buy a house I hope the officer dealing with him will tell him the best type of loan for his situation and will not try to shove him into one or other category.  He should present fairly to the applicant the benefits and drawbacks of both schemes and then the applicant can made his choice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Acheson asked what would happen if somebody died.  This situation arises all the time, no matter what method of financing is involved.  Usually most responsible people take out a mortgage protection policy.  Of course, there are some cases where such a policy is not taken out and a person may be killed in a car accident.  In that case the widow would be better off if she had an SDA loan or a building society loan while a person who gets sick would be better off under this scheme.  If a person is sick and has an SDA or building society loan his weekly repayments remain the same, but if he has an agency loan his repayments will drop to 18 per cent of his new income. There is a measure of protection there but it is the type of protection nobody would want to use because it would mean the breadwinner was sick or unemployed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan asked about stage payments.  They can and will be arranged because this will help applicants avoid bridging finance.  Deputies asked if they would have an opportunity of discussing the operation of this agency later.  The annual reports of the agency will have to be laid before the House and then a Deputy may ask for a debate on the agency.  Under section 6 if I give a direction to the agency as to how they should operate, I must lay that before both Houses.  On that occasion, either House <Col N="2405" /> can have discussion on the operation of the agency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell raised the point about the average price of new houses and asked about the combination of payments under this agency.  The average price of new houses bought under the SDA loans scheme in the September quarter was £24,760.  Under the agency's scheme a borrower earning £7,500 per annum could buy a house costing £25,750, get the £1,000 grant, pay a deposit of £2,250 and borrow £22,500. Under the SDA loan scheme he would have to pay between £9,000 and £10,000 deposit and under this scheme he would pay £2,250 deposit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke raised the question of the manning of the agency.  This is something which the city and county managers will decide.  I will be surprised if it is not part of the discussions that will take place between the officials of my Department and the County Managers' Association when they meet in January. A whole range of questions will be asked and many assurances sought.  It is a normal thing for this to happen and it occurs frequently between the various Departments and the agencies they control.  In my case it is the local authorities.  I am sure that something will be worked out.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn is satisfied with the answer I gave about new and second-hand houses.  The same Deputy asked if there is a penalty for a person who redeems a loan.  There will not be but they will be liable to repay the balance of the capital and the accumulated interest.  There will be a shortfall in their repayments in the early years and that shortfall will be carried forward and added to their debt which will have to be cleared but there will be no other penalty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They do not pay in the beginning.  The perfect way to buy a house where there will be no penalty is only available to the rich because they can pay cash.  The cheapest way to buy a <Col N="2406" /> house is to pay cash.  The rest of us must pay a penalty when buying a house either through a mortgage interest rate or a local authority interest rate.  In this case purchasers are relieved of the burden of a heavy deposit, and of having to meet heavy repayments in the early years.  The penalty for that is that the money that is owed is carried forward and becomes part of the amount of money that is owed to the agency.  Therefore, if one wants to redeem the loan one must clear off that debt.  It depends on the stage in the term of the loan that one clears off the debt.</P>

A young couple intending to get married must continue to work for a set number of years after they get married in order to be able to meet the repayments. It is very vague to say that officials can define the difference between permanent employment and a job that a wife will only hold for a number of years.

      <P>It calls for personal interpretation on behalf of a manager.  A <Col N="2408" /> manager must make an interpretation in each case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>He should not have to; it should be laid down by the Minister.  A manager should not be put into the position of having to make his own personal interpretation.  The Minister has highlighted one of the most damning areas in regard to the type of loans to be provided by the agency.  I am referring to the whole area of redemption.  According to Mr. Rapple in the article I referred to in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of September 27 a man who gets a loan of £20,000 today to buy a house valued at £25,000 and decides to sell ten years later to move up the market or out of the area because of his job, using the system to be operated by the agency, he will owe on that £20,000 mortgage a total of £46,982.  He could not afford to sell because he will not be able to redeem the loan.  The Minister may assume that there will be an increase in the value of the property in the ten years because of inflation and other reasons but the calculation I referred to was made on the basis of inflation at 10 per cent.  Under the SDA loan scheme there is a reduction annually in the amount still outstanding on the loan but how can the Minister justify the situation I have just outlined? The Minister has told us that the new scheme will be the same as the SDA loan scheme and those operated by building societies, in that there will be no penalty but surely the fact that a borrower will have to pay back that type of sum is a major penalty.  It will make it almost impossible for people to sell the property they have with this type of loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme will not be the same as the SDA loan scheme.  It is a different scheme and there is a different way of funding it.  The way of repaying the loans is different and there are different penalties attached to it.  When I bought my first house over 20 years ago it cost £1,900.  I had an SDA loan from Cork County Council and I was repaying £56 twice a year.  Precisely the same house in the same park sold within the last three months for £47,000.  The repayments now on a similar house in a similar <Col N="2409" /> park would be in the region of £60 a week.  Those figures would have been incomprehensible to me 20 years ago. The repayments will remain at 18 per cent of the man's income.  If his income goes up, his repayments will go up.  If his income goes up in the same ratio as my income, my standard of living and the value of my house went up over the past 23 years, then the sums will be precisely the same in 25 years time in relation to his income then as 18 per cent is to his present income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that his repayments will go up according as his income goes up, which is one of the major defects in the whole scheme.  I accept that the value of property increases.  But if a man takes a loan of £20,000 today and wants to sell his property in ten years time &mdash; Mr. Rapple's figures may be a little high or a little low but let us just use them for example purposes &mdash; he ends up in ten years' time owing £46,982.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I must be very bad at explaining things.  I thought that point <Col N="2410" /> had been covered umpteen times. Nobody has to purchase a house this way unless he chooses to do so.  The benefit of choosing this system is that the deposit is relatively low, very low in comparison with an SDA loan.  In addition, the repayments in the first years are extremely low in comparison with repayments on a building society loan.  One is not getting these things for nothing.  If one does not pay now the debt is picked up and put forward on to the amount one owes in the future.  If one does not sell the house that shortfall, because the amount one is paying each year will increase as one's income increases, will be gradually wiped out and one will come back to a very much lower percentage of one's income later on in the time.  If one wants to sell the house in ten years' time, then one owes the amount of money on the books of the local authority or the agency as being the amount due for the house.  If one buys a house now at £25,000 and in ten years' time it does not make £46,982 then, yes, one has to make up the difference because that is the debt one owes. You cannot expect somebody to run a line through your debt and say: &ldquo;That is all right, Mr. Burke.  You are a nice man. I will not take it from you at all.&rdquo; One goes into this with one's eyes open.</P>
      <P>There are penalties attached to using this system but there are also advantages and it is up to an individual to weigh one against the other and see what suits him. If one goes back ten years and looks at a house that was then worth £25,000, it would now fetch more than £46,000.  Of course under this system one would not be getting the same &ldquo;profit&rdquo; in inflation terms as the person who used the SDA or building society loans.  The applicant makes his choice.  We are presenting him with a fourth, fifth or sixth option; but for the vast majority of people it is the SDA loan, the building societies and now this additional method of financing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>What we have heard from the Minister is an admission of major defects in this scheme.  We were told that the reason for the guillotine motion was that this was to meet a major social need.  We are having a good debate <Col N="2411" /> and so far we have elicited a lot of information. However, this legislation needs time to be considered and we should have had an opportunity to consider it over Christmas.  The Minister is now admitting major defects in the regulations to be set down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I did not admit major defects in the operation of this.  I pointed out that anybody who wants to buy his house under this scheme will have certain penalties that are different from the penalties one has under the Local Loans Fund scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>What we have here is not the Santa Claus we were told about on Second Stage.  What we are getting now are the warts in the scheme or, to put it another way, we are at the Saint Stephen's Day rather than the Christmas Day stage.  There is a major responsibility on the Government to explain to potential house purchasers exactly what the implications are of choosing the type of loan that will be available under this scheme.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke earlier about inflation and about increases in house prices and he implied that in the event of a sale, inflation would probably pick up the difference between the loan now and what it would be later.  Based on the calculations I have been using, the position will be that if a person gets a loan under the system envisaged of, say, 20 years but if after ten years he wishes to sell he will find that instead of having to pay back £20,000 the amount due will be £46,982. This would be the position although a person had been paying on his house loan for ten years.  People often find it necessary to sell one house and buy another because of being transferred to another area or for some other reason.  The position I have quoted is the same up to the seventeenth year by which time instead of owing £20,000 a person would owe £58,013.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation purports to be the salvation of the construction industry as well as of young people wishing to buy houses. I suggest that instead of talking about a <Col N="2412" /> weekly payment of £9.60 or of a 25 per cent tax rate, the Government might engage themselves in advertising this scheme and highlighting not only the position regarding the early years of the mortgage but the penalties that will apply to anyone wishing to sell his house in the first 17 years.</P>

      <P>This section has wide implications.  One can imagine the shock to a person on finding after ten years that he owes the sort of money Deputy Burke has been talking of.  In my constituency I could visualise such a person presenting himself at Portlaoise hospital for psychiatric treatment.  There is no point in anyone talking about what the value of a house would be after such a period.  The position is that the buyer decides the market value.  Let us assume that at the time of going on the market the amount due on a house is £80,000 but that it fetches only £60,000.  There is a very serious problem in this regard.  I do not know whether it would be open to the seller in such circumstances to declare himself bankrupt but he would be in a serious dilemma.  While I was in the Department I explored the possibility of other means of helping to finance housing. I consulted with my colleagues, including the Minister, on the matter.  A draft was prepared but I discovered that in what I was proposing I would be taking funds away from other areas in which they were very necessary.</P>
      <P>This new financial arrangement may cause a big upheaval in the whole area of finance.  However, the big problem I see is in regard to somebody who during the period of the loan may, for whatever reason, wish to sell but cannot get for his house a price sufficient to cover the amount that would have to be paid back to the agency.  I shall be expecting either the Minister or the local authorities to explain to the people what are the issues involved in taking out this loan and the effect it will have on them?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister take steps immediately to ensure that a grave injustice will not continue to be done to this student?  Would the Minister agree she is being deprived of grants which are available to enable her to attend a post-graduate course on the grounds that an entrance qualification for the post-graduate course required that she would attend the first year of the LL.B. course in UCG?  Because of the attendance at a one-year course, one year of which was an LL.B. course, to gain entrance to the other course, she was deprived of the university grant which would have been <Col N="2414" /> applicable to her?  To move to Dublin to attend a course would involve this girl and her widowed mother in expense which they could not afford.  The Minister knows the details of the case.  A serious injustice is being done which requires an amendment to the regulations.  I appeal to the Minister to take steps to change the regulations, to remove this anomaly and to allow this student the benefit of the university grants system which was set up to assist people in her circumstances?</P>

      <P>This question is of a general nature relating to all students who might be in similar circumstances in Galway. Then it refers to the specific instance of the question of 11 November.  The Deputy has spoken to me in relation to this case and I have a great deal of sympathy with the young lady in question. However, the terms of the scheme are such as to debar people from obtaining grants to pursue two or more non-simultaneous post-graduate courses with grant aid or more than one primary non-simultaneous degree course.  The reason for this is that at present persons as grant holders are eligible only to obtain grant aid for a primary degree and one post-graduate course.  As the young lady in question had completed a primary degree in Galway and was grant-aided for a year's post-primary course in that university, the rules as framed would debar her from obtaining a grant to pursue a further course in Dublin.  I have great sympathy for students who are in this situation in Galway and I am examining all aspects of the higher education grants scheme with a view to seeing if further improvements can be effected.  If possible, I am anxious to provide relief for this student and similar students who may wish to pursue the <Col N="2415" /> course in the Incorporated Law Society, without at the same time, opening the scheme so wide as to have very far-reaching implications.  As soon as I have completed that review, I shall be in touch with the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Since 1968 local authorities are paid the money which they have expended in relation to higher education grants one year afterwards.  While that might cause a problem in the first year of operation, the payment of the grant in the second year ought to help to fund the payment of moneys during the second year.  In the past it has not been as big a problem for local authorities as it seems to be this year.  Galway County Council seems to have been in particularly difficult circumstances.  I understand it may well have been because the Government decided to improve maintenance grants by two-thirds on the amount which was paid by the previous Government and the local authorities, naturally, had not budgeted for that in their estimates for the year.  They had to carry the additional moneys because of that improvement.  I accept that it is not a satisfactory arrangement form the point of view of local authorities and I have made proposals to the Department of Finance with regard to making a change in the payment machinery.  I understand it would be 1983 before the local authorities could benefit from that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Appointments to teaching posts in vocational schools are made by the vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>My Department operates a system of allocation of posts as woodwork and metalwork teachers to ensure a fair distribution of the available teachers.  An application was made by County Kildare Vocational Education Committee for an allocation of a woodwork teacher to its scheme in 1981/82, but priority had to be given to other committees where it was considered there was greater need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is always a shortage of teachers of practical subjects?  This has existed for <Col N="2417" /> many years and it is no nearer a solution now than it was when it first came to my notice 15 years ago.  Kildare Vocational Education Committee indicated in May that they wanted three teachers for practical subjects.  Their forecast proved to be correct but, in July, they were notified by the Department that no teacher of practical subjects would be allocated to Kildare this year.  I think it is the policy of the Department to supply replacements only and that no new teachers will be made available, even in an area like Kildare where the vocational school population has increased by 16.7 per cent.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister feel that it is within the compass of his Department to provide sufficient teachers of practical subjects? We have an embarrassment of BAs, we have hundreds of national teachers who cannot get jobs, and surely the Department could go the whole hog and provide enough teachers of practical subjects, particularly now when there is a recession in the building industry which should mean there are qualified people available to undergo training to equip them to teach these subjects in our vocational schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in pointing out that there is an acute shortage of teachers of practical subjects.  The situation can only be described as deplorable. However, the Deputy will be aware that there is a long period of training.  In the case of most teachers of practical subjects there is a four-year period of training and therefore any change I hope to make in the intake of teachers of metalwork and woodwork during 1982 cannot have an improved effect on the system until four years hence.  That is very regrettabe.  The Deputy suggested that the situation has not improved in any way.  I am afraid the situation will be worse in 1982 because of the change-over in the training system from the colleges in Wexford and elsewhere to Thomond College and because of the manner in which that was implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1982 there will be no output of teachers in metalwork and woodwork. That will have an even greater adverse <Col N="2418" /> effect on the system because there will not be an output of teachers to meet even the normal vacancies through retirement. As the Deputy will be aware, every year all of the trained metalwork and woodwork teachers get employment because there are far more places than trained personnel.  I have been examining the position in County Kildare in particular and I can only indicate to the House that there is a possibility that a woodwork and building construction post will be made available there because of a particular situation.  If that can be effected I will communicate with the Deputy to let him know.  I hope the House will understand that this is a difficulty that exists because of the shortage of teachers and it will be compounded because in 1982 there will be no output whatsoever of trained teachers of these subjects.</P>

      <P>In 1982 there will be a short-fall of 53 woodwork teachers and 255 metalwork teachers.  That is by the autumn of 1982.  The output of metalwork teachers from Thomond College in 1982 will be nil and the output of woodwork teachers will be nil.  The output of woodwork teachers and metalwork teachers in 1983 will be 22 and 28, respectively. In 1984 the output will be 25 and 32, respectively.

However, would he try to get it home to the Department of Education that they have an academic bias, which is quite obvious, and that they have never succeeded in providing enough teachers of practical subjects.  This has not been happening for only four years: it has been going on for 20, 30 or 40 years and it has not been solved.  Surely the Department should apply themselves to this.  Ministers for Education are migrant birds of passage and the Minister now there will find that is so, but the big machine will go on.  It is high time somebody impressed on the Department that they have a duty to provide teachers of these practical subjects.</P>

It has now been impressed upon them very clearly, and from now on I hope there will be a realistic attempt to put sufficient people in training to meet the real needs in this area.  In the second level curriculum, unless and until we have a wide range of practical subjects throughout the schools and an appreciation of the needs of technology in modern society, we as a nation will be lost and I do not intend to allow that situation to develop.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the decision to extend the period of training was a good one, welcomed by the teachers and the trade unions, and <Col N="2420" /> will he reassure me that the policy decision in regard to the intake to Thomond College &mdash; it was not easy to get recruits in the early seventies when there was plenty of employment around &mdash; will result in recruiting enough trainees to cater for all our schools?  Most of the post-primary schools are demanding that we provide teachers for such practical courses.  Does the Minister agree that the facilities in Thomond College for such training are among the best in Europe?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and they will have a beneficial effect, I think that at the time that decision was arrived at the difficulties brought about by the change-over should have been dealt with so that the change could have been phased in a different way.  It is my intention to encourage and facilitate the ending of sufficient young and adult people to training so that our needs will be met.  We must be realistic about this.  As I said in 1983 and 1984, 28 and 32 people will come out as trained metalwork teachers to cater for a shortage of 255 posts.  I appreciate the short-fall and the difficulty and what needs to be done.  I will say no more than that.  It is regrettable that others did not have the same appreciation four, three and two years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there is a shortage of these teachers, would the Minister consider allowing holders of full technological certificates, who are able to teach at third level but are not accepted as teachers at second level, to be eligible particularly during 1982 when the college will not be turning out trained teachers?  There are many people who have full technological certificates who can teach apprentices but cannot teach at second level.  This is an area in which we could easily fill the gap created by the lack of trained teachers.</P>

      <P>It is my policy that Irish goods and services be used to the greatest extent possible in second and third level educational institutions for which funding is provided by my Department.  This would apply to drawing boards in common with other items of furniture for schools.  In briefing sessions and otherwise the Department remind the appropriate authorities for secondary and vocational schools of the importance of support for Irish manufactured goods.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a firm in County Monaghan, which may be the firm the Deputy has in mind, have become involved in this area.  I understand that some of their products have been tested in community schools since October.  The firm were in communication with officials of my Department quite recently in this regard.  As soon as we get some indication of the evaluation of the equipment, the Department will be in a position to say whether it is suitable or otherwise.</P>

      <P>I cannot really say at present. It is interesting to realise that at least 95 per cent of the furniture needs in educational institutions are met by Irish manufacturers.  My Department are working in close association with the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards.  That co-operation has been significant in helping to develop the school furniture side of the furniture industry.  If there is any further way in which the Deputy feels my Department could be of assistance in helping this firm to develop their product, if he cares to contact me I will be only too pleased to assist him, if possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking in the Seanad recently on a motion regarding the establishment of the Independent Curriculum and Examinations Board, I said I believed it was necessary that all aspects of the curriculum for second level should be examined now to see how relevant they are to the requirements of modern life and to the training and employment needs of young people. Recently I arranged to have copies of that speech sent to the schools throughout the country and to those interested in educational development.  I invited their comments.  The establishment of this Independent Curriculum and Examinations <Col N="2429" /> Board is a very important step. The re-examination of the second level curriculum to establish its relevance to the world of work and the world of today, is a very important step indeed. Obviously, all of the areas, including those mentioned in the Deputies' question, will be examined in the context of the establishment of that board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, over the years, the curriculum has been much too restrictive and protective and that this has resulted in the conservative type of society we have today? As a politician, on our behalf would he declare that as Minister, and presumably with a representative on this board, he will recommend that these two subjects, particularly comparative political systems and ideally comparative religions, should be provided for young people at this stage of their lives to try to develop and enlightened and politically literate electorate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a recognition on the part of everyone involved in education, and especially in second level education, that there is a need to examine the relevance of the second level curriculum. I said in the Seanad:</P>
      <P>I should like to see the Curriculum and Examinations Board explore ways in which the leaving certificate examination could be extended in scope.  I should like to see a way found in which credit can be given for courses followed in the area of general education alongside the existing syllabi.  I think, for example, of courses in media education, health education, consumer education, even political education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Civics has been a subject which has been treated less than seriously in too many cases.  It is a subject which should offer great scope to the teacher to help young people become more aware of the many influences within society which affect them and of the way in which State and political institutions exist to serve the needs of the people. I should like to see a much greater <Col N="2430" /> emphasis placed on the development of this subject.  I do not understand why it has been largely restricted to junior cycle classes.  It seems to me that students at an older age will appreciate more readily the significance of many of the issues which can be included.</P>
    <P>Consequently the Deputy can rest assured I am very much aware of the need to examine and broaden the curriculum and to examine its relevance for the needs, not just of today but of coming decades.</P>

      <P>Actually, it has not been totalled.  In the current year a provision of £11.6 million was made originally for vocational schools capital projects. During the year an additional £4.355 million, arising from savings in the primary sector, were allocated to vocational schools.  The sum of £13.005.65 million has been expended to 30 November and the balance of £3.427 million will be expended during the month of December.

My recollection is that the final outturn for primary school <Col N="2433" /> building purposes was £20.5 million, or £21 million.  Certainly it is in that region if that is helpful to the Deputy.

      <P>The reason is that the Departments of Finance and Education put the dead hand on primary school building in the autumn of 1980.  They did it so effectively that, having tried to start the primary school building programme again, they discovered it took them longer than expected to get it under way. The £30 million they had included in the Estimates for 1981 they were unable to spend because the Office of Public Works took such a length of time to get the programme under way.  Because of a Government decision having so effectively dead-handed it in the autumn of the previous year, it became necessary at intervals during the 1981 financial year to transfer sums from the primary Vote into the post-primary area, which had been seriously underprovided for.  The moneys which the Office of Public Works were unable to expend on primary education were transferred and used for post-primary building purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the primary building sector in the Department of Education received a strict instruction as early as January of this year that £30 million were being provided?  Is he aware that there are large lists of schools involved?  There are 12 questions on the Order Paper about primary schools.  Is the Minister telling the House <Col N="2434" /> that, despite the fact that the Government stated they were giving priority to primary education, despite the fact that all social scientists say that that is where the priority should be given, he has welched on this and is spending £10 million less on primary school building than he should have spent?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which carried right through the autumn of 1980 until the beginning of this financial year, the Office of Public Works found difficulty in launching a comprehensive building programme in the primary sector until belatedly in 1981.  Now, because of quite a number of starts which I and the Minister of State have authorised, there is a widescale building programme in the primary sector.  As the House will know, because of the nature of construction and the lead-in time involved, the bulk of the demand for payment on foot of that ongoing work will fall to be met during the 1982 financial year.  Really what happened here was that the previous Government dead-handed primary school building in 1980 &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no shortfall in expenditure on the primary capital Vote. I endeavoured some weeks ago to explain the financial facts of life to the House and in particular to Deputy Wilson but unfortunately he did not take in what I was pointing out.  There was a necessity to transfer capital moneys which could not be expended due to mismanagement on the part of the previous Government in October 1980.  I assure him and the House that there will not be bias in any direction shown by me in relation to any aspect of education.  On the contrary, I intend as Minister to treat all aspects of education equally and equitably.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that there is no student representative on the board of the NCEA since the dismissal of the President of the Students Union at the NIHE, Limerick in July 1981; and if he will take steps to appoint a student to the board without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The President of the Students' Union, NIHE, Limerick, was appointed a member of the National Council for Educational Awards for the period of one year ending on 29 July 1981.  There was, therefore, no question of dismissal involved in his ceasing to be a member on that date.  The President of the Students' Union, NIHE Limerick, did not attend meetings of the NCEA during his period of office because of a decision of the USI that the student movement nationally should have representation on the council.  The National Council for Educational Awards Act, 1979, does not confer any such right on the USI.  The reference in section 5 (1) (g) is to persons who `are students at any institution to which this Act applies'.  I am at present considering representations made to me at a recent meeting with a delegation from the USI during the course of which this matter was discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is desirable that there should be student representation on this board, particularly in view of the fact that the students involved were not aware until some weeks ago of the decision of the board of the NCEA to increase examination fees by over 200 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would agree with the Deputy that it is desirable that there should be student representation on the board of the NCEA.  The 1979 Act provides <Col N="2440" /> for the appointment of persons who are students at any of the institutions which the Act covers, but I understand from correspondence over a period and from a recent meeting with the USI that they, the USI, seek to be represented on a national basis.  I understand that the intention of the previous Government was that the student representation on the NCEA should be on a yearly basis and that it should rotate between the various institutions covered by the NCEA Act.  When the President of the Students' Union, NIHE, Limerick was appointed last year he did not attend at the NCEA because the USI disagreed with the approach in the Act.  Since July the USI have been in touch with me and I have had discussions with them.  I am considering their suggestions regarding changes in regard to student representation on the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I was given no such indication. The information given to me was that the USI had arranged that their members should not serve on the board of the NCEA because of their dispute on the manner in which it had been decided in 1979 to have student representation on the NCEA board.  If the President of the Students' Union of the NIHE, Limerick is prepared to attend meetings of the <Col N="2441" /> NCEA I will be very anxious to hear from him to that effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Two proposals were put forward by the City of Limerick Vocational Education Committee in the autumn.  Both of the people involved received their qualifications outside the country and it is necessary for the Department <Col N="2443" /> to investigate those qualifications before the appointments can be sanctioned. I expect that one of the appointments will be finalised within about a week but it will take some further time to carry out a detailed assessment of the qualifications of the second person.  I should also mention that two posts were sanctioned by my Department on 29 October and 9 November but the appointees have not yet taken up duty. In relation to a further two posts the VEC have made appointments but have not submitted the proposals to my Department as yet, and in relation to a further two posts, the VEC have not yet advertised them.</P>

The question of the provision of equipment is normally a matter for the vocational committee. <Col N="2445" /> They purchase equipment from the budget allocated to them in each financial year.  The VEC have discretion in relation to equipment purchased, so the people in the engineering school might take that matter up directly with the VEC.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a comprehensive statement on the apparent breach of confidentiality in relation to highly secret Government budgetary documents and who has access to these documents.</P>

      <P>I have investigated the circumstances in which a document containing preliminary and interim data on capital spending proposals for 1982 came to appear in this morning's <i>Irish Times.</i> I have established that, owing to an error in distribution by my Department, this document was circulated without the customary stringent precautions.  As part of this circulation process it was handed to a secretarial assistant dealing with press matters who assumed that it was a published document, of which he would be entitled to give a copy to a journalist.</P>
      <P>I have given instructions for an immediate review of Cabinet procedures with a view to ensuring that such a serious breach of confidentiality will not recur.</P>

      <P>In view of the seriousness of this admission, can the Taoiseach say if this person was one of the many non-established civil servants appointed by this administration?  What disciplinary action, if any, is being taken? Can he confirm if these figures are accurate?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem arose because in the distribution process a copy was handed in error to a secretarial assistant dealing with press matters, who assumed it was a published document of which a copy could be given to a journalist.

      <P>Does the Taoiseach appreciate that this is one of the most serious admissions ever made on an item of such confidentiality?  The Taoiseach refused to answer my third supplementary, but he must appreciate that a certain amount of confusion may have been created in the public mind because of the revelations in this confidential Government document.  In view of that, does he not appreciate that there is an obligation on him and his Government to confirm immediately whether the figures mentioned are correct?</P>

      <P>How can the Taoiseach stand over such a statement? The Taoiseach admitted that this document contained information of cuts sought by the Minister for Finance and in another column the agreed cuts. Obviously, such figures could only be agreed around the Cabinet table by Government Ministers.  Surely that means it is more than preliminary and, as a result, we are now satisfied it has some official status.  For that reason we demand a statement from the Taoiseach whether the figures are accurate.  Obviously, they are more than preliminary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 5, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;(1) The number of the directors of the Agency shall be fifteen including the chairman.</P>
      <P>(2) The directors of the Agency including the chairman shall be appointed by the Minister.</P>

    <P>(10) One of the directors of the Agency (other than the chairman) shall be nominated for appointment as such director by the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There has been a lengthy debate in the House on youth employment over the last ten days and we have also devoted a considerable amount of time to the setting up of other State agencies.  Our amendment to this section is specific with regard to the number of directors of the agency, their qualifications and the area they represent.  For the record I should like to quote what the amendment states:</P>
    <P>In page 4, before section 5, to insert the following section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;(1) The number of the directors of the Agency shall be fifteen including the chairman.</P>
    <P>In that we differ from the proposal of the Minister who intends having between three and nine directors.  Our amendment further states:</P>
    <P>(2) The directors of the Agency including the chairman shall be appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>We do not have any difference with the Minister on that issue.  Our amendment continues:</P>
    <P>(3) One of the directors (other than the chairman) of the Agency shall be nominated for the appointment as such director by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>(4) Four of the directors of the Agency (other than the chairman) shall <Col N="2694" /> be nominated for appointment as such directors by such body or bodies representative of the elected members of local authorities as the Minister may determine.</P>
    <P>(5) Two of the directors of the Agency (other than the chairman) shall be nominated or appointed as such directors by such body or bodies representative of pension funds and life offices as the Minister may determine.</P>
    <P>(6) One of the directors of the Agency (other than the chairman) shall be nominated or appointed as such director by the Association of City and County Managers as the Minister may determine.</P>
    <P>(7) One of the directors of the agency (other than the chairman) shall be nominaterd for appointment as such director by the Construction Industry Federation.</P>
    <P>(8) Two of the directors (other than the chairman) shall be appointed as such directors by the Minister from persons who are members of a committee of a co-operative housing society.</P>
    <P>(9) One of the directors of the Agency (other than the chairman) shall be nominated for appointment as such director by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>(10) One of the directors of the Agency (other than the chairman) shall be nominated for appointment as such director by the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister accepts this amendment because it will improve the Bill and correct a major defect in it because the format of the board has not been outlined as it was, for example, in the Youth Employment Agency Bill.  The suggested membership is 15.  First of all, why not a representative of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions?  The Fianna Fáil Government from 1977 to 1981, like other Fianna Fáil administrations, had very close contact and consultation with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  As normal procedure, on practically a weekly basis there were meetings with the congress by various Ministers.  The Taoiseach at the <Col N="2695" /> time, Deputy Haughey, met the Irish Congress of Trade Unions probably on more occasions than any other Taoiseach in the history of the State.  He recognised and respected the importance of the trade union movement not only in regard to the industrial life of the country but also the general well-being of the country.  I recall, as Minister for the Environment, being present at a meeting with the congress where the Taoiseach had six or eight of his Ministers present and one by one we outlined our proposals for the advancement of this nation and for job creation.  When unemployment is running at 133,000 job creation is a very important issue.  There should be this relationship between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Government.  It is sad that there is this lack of co-operation between a Government, of which the Labour Party is a part, and in which the Tánaiste is a Member of the Labour Party and the congress.  We recognise and admire the role of the trade union movement. This was evident from our commitment not just to national wage agreements but to national understandings. Our record in this regard is something of which we can be duly proud.</P>
    <P>One of the main planks of this Government's election programme was that a body would be set up to decide on wage norms.  The figure that eventually came out of the deliberations of the three wise men was 6½ per cent.  As a result of discussions between the Government, the employers and the trade union movement this figure was brought up to a level of 12 per cent.  We understand from newspaper leaks that the figure is now up to around 15 per cent for the public service sector.  We were committed to the concept of national understandings.  A part of this Government, the Labour Party, are now reneging on the idea of national understandings.  We could have had a national understanding, we were close to it, but because of the intransigence of the Government we have not.  If they had compromised, if they had taken the broad and long-term view we would have had a national understanding.  All we are talking about now are national wage <Col N="2696" /> agreements, agreement first for the public service and then sector by sector throughout the economy.  A national understanding goes much further than this.  An understanding includes social concepts, social advancement, commitment to employment.  We have not got such a national understanding.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil appreciate the importance of the role of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  We want to see it strong, vibrant and involved in the life of this country.  We propose in this amendment the representation of the congress of trade unions on the board of the housing finance agency.  I hope the Minister will accept our good faith.</P>
    <P>We also propose in this amendment the inclusion of four directors who:</P>
    <P>shall be nominated for appointment as such directors by such body or bodies representative of the elected members of local authorities as the Minister may determine.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends operating the loans through the 41 local authorities.  They are entitled, if they are to operate the Bill, to membership of this board.  They are the ones who will be doing the work.  The agency will be sitting in some hotel room having an auction as to which favoured financial institution is to get these very special bonds that will be paid for by the unfortunate borrowers in the long run. The parties that form this Government, together with their two pet Independents, have cried many crocodile tears about the importance of local democracy. We are putting it to the test.  If the Minister is to charge the 41 local authorities with the administration of a hare brained scheme like this, a scheme which will result in people having to pay back £140,000 in respect of a £20,000 loan, he should include these local authorities in the operation of the agency.</P>
    <P>In this amendment we propose also that two of the directors, apart from the chairman, shall be nominated or appointed by bodies representing pension funds and life offices.  I welcome the idea of the involvement of life offices in this way.  While I was in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy I <Col N="2697" /> encouraged the use of life offices and pension funds in this way as a means of making money available for housing.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the proposal of the Minister to fireproof these financial institutions against the effects of inflation and disregarding also the totally right-wing approach of that proposal, if we are to secure, as the Minister intends, funds from both the pension funds and the life offices, these bodies should be represented as of right on the board of directors of the agency.  This morning we argued at length about how the agency would succeed in achieving co-operation from both the management and the staffs of the local authorities.  Without that goodwill the agency cannot work.</P>
    <P>The Minister has decided that the agency will perform their lending functions through the existing structure of the 41 local authorities who are operating the SDA loans scheme.  We suggest that one of the directors of the agency other than the chairman, be nominated or appointed by the Association of City and County Managers as the Minister may determine. We do not want this done at the behest of the Minister but rather that it be written into the legislation.  The whole operation of the directive setting out regulations as to this new form of loans depends on the co-operation of the city and county managers and their staffs.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have a civil service and local authority structure of which we can be very proud.  The loyalty and commitment of the employees have never been in question.  From January 1978 until October 1980 I served as Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism as it is now.  Apart from considering it a privilege to have held such office, I was privileged and reassured also to be in the presence of such committed and loyal servants.  This situation is something we should be very proud of, something that we should treasure. In October 1980 I was appointed Minister at the Department of the Environment and again I found among the staff there the same level of dedication and commitment to Government and to State.  I do not know whether the Minister <Col N="2698" /> ever served in a junior ministry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>A junior ministry is a fascinating position.  However, as a result of the vagaries of PR coupled with the support for the Government of the two pet Independents, I ceased to be Minister in July.  During my time in office I had occasion to meet many people from the private sector.  This is a sector, too, of which we can be very proud.  Most of the people involved are first generation entrepreneurs who have done a superb job on behalf of the people.  However, I found in the public sector a level of commitment that could very well be a lesson to any private sector employee.  Right down the line in Departments, in local authorities and in semi-State bodies &mdash; from managers down to the people sweeping the streets &mdash; there is a tremendous level of commitment.  I found during my time in office that there was never any question of staff not wanting to work late when they were required to do so in order to prepare legislation or answers to questions.  It was not unusual for them to work until midnight on behalf of the people.  I take this opportunity of paying tribute to the Secretary, the Assistant Secretary and every other member of the staff of the Department of the Environment and to thank them for the loyalty and co-operation that I found in the Department during my time here.  The same is true of the city and county managers and their staffs around the country.  When we are passing legislation imposing extra duties on local authority staffs, they deserve recognition. It is in recognition of their role and their importance in the operation of this Bill that Deputy Connolly and I, on behalf of Fianna Fáil, propose that one of the directors of the agency, other than the chairman, shall be nominated or appointed by the Association of City and County Managers as the Minister may determine.  The Minister may have the intention to appoint a city or county manager but a city or county manager should not be appointed at the whim of the Minister. <Col N="2699" /> He should be appointed and included in this Bill as of right.</P>
      <P>In our democratic system Ministers change from time to time so no one Minister should be allowed to decide whether a representative of the Association of City and County Managers should be appointed.  It should be written into this legislation in the manner in which we have suggested.  There are many aspects of society which are important.  Depending on your commitment to health, social welfare, industry and so on, you will have varying degrees of priority as to their importance.  But in the day to day life of the individual the local authority manager is more important than anybody else.  Without his efficiency, loyalty and commitment, our lives would be a scourge, even more so than they are under the present administration.  The city and county managers working with democratically-elected public representatives, provide all the services which make life comfortable for us.  Roads are maintained, we have street lights, water and sewerage schemes, dustbins are collected, if our roads are flooded in a storm someone will come along and ease the situation.  All these services, which we take for granted, are provided through the co-operation and loyalty of the county manager.  We feel strongly that the Minister should accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>In proposing the guillotine motion, in which this legislation was included, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach talked at great length about social needs, the importance of the injection of extra funds into the housing industry and the importance of that industry.  We have always recognised the importance of the construction industry generally.  The dead hand of Coalition Governments down through the years has been the curse of the construction industry.  When they have been in power the construction industry has been brought to its knees and in the last six months it is in a worse state than ever.</P>

      <P>I always attempt to be relevant to the point under discussion. The importance of the Construction Industry Federation and the construction industry generally to the well-being of our economy is well known.  It is unfortunate, but true, that on every occasion the Coalition Government were in power there have been increases in the level of unemployment in that industry, not only the industry itself but in its related industries. Ask any builders' provider, any manufacturer directly associated with the construction industry, any building company or any building worker how things are at present.  After Christmas things will begin to look very grim indeed &mdash; I could use stronger words but I will not &mdash; for the building and related trades. But this agency will not be the saviour the Minister suggests they will be.  They will be only another bureaucratic body.</P>
      <P>In the amendment we propose that a representative of the Construction Industry Federation be appointed to the board of the agency.  The Minister may say that it is his intention to have such a representative, but we in Fianna Fáil recognise the importance of that industry to the life of the country.  Indeed, there is a saying to the effect that the construction industry is the barometer of the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>In our amendment we give that recognition to the construction industry.  In his speech the Minister <Col N="2701" /> referred to the co-operative housing movement and in our amendment we propose that one of the agency directors should be nominated from among the members of that movement.  We accept the Minister's bona fides in relation to the co-operative housing movement and therefore we expect him to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Our amendment suggests that the Minister for Finance should nominate a director. It is through the possible generosity of the financial institutions that the agency's funds will be provided.  Here we have an extraordinary situation.  Every day the Government have been acting as Santa Claus to the financial institutions whom they are fire-proofing to the tune of 1 per cent to 2 per cent above the inflation rate.  Here they will be given an investment opportunity in what are known as gilts.  This is being done at the expense of prospective borrowers.  I will speak latter on the effect of that on the money market.  So let us add a representative of the Minister for Finance to the board.</P>
      <P>We also suggest that the Minister for the Environment should have a representative on the board and I hope that when he is making that appointment he will take advantage of the wealth of experience of personnel in the Department. It would be invidious to mention particular officials, but among them is a wealth of experience of housing finance and it would be inappropriate if he had not on the board of an agency of this kind a person of such experience, a representative of the superb staff in the Department of the Environment.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the amendment.  It would be undesirable and unusual to write into this or any legislation a provision that the board of a company should be comprised of representatives of certain associations or bodies. I have no objection to most of the people listed in the amendment, they would all be worthy of consideration except one, but the suggested board of 15 is far too big.  I have in mind a board of between three and nine members and I would be thinking of the middle point rather than <Col N="2702" /> the lower or the higher end.  It will be a specialised board which will have very important work to do, but not a great deal of administrative work because the local authorities will be distributing the funds the agency collect.</P>
      <P>The Deputies made a strong plea about the necessity for including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the trade union movement on the board.  If I propose a board of seven or eight and if I include a member of the trade union movement, he will be one of eight, whereas under the amendment he would be one of 15, and he would have a considerably weaker voice.  His voice would be half as strong.  Many people could mention worthy organisations who should be represented on the board which the Deputies have not listed.  I jotted down a few which occurred to me and I am sure other people could think of many more who would be worthy of inclusion on the list.</P>
      <P>Why not include a representative of the building societies?  What about the Royal Institute of Architects?  What about the Auctioneers and Valuers Association? As I pointed out, this agency will be dealing with second-hand houses and it could be suggested that somebody on the board should be familiar with that matter.  Why not include ACRA, the combined residents association?  Would they not have something to say because they are living in the houses the agency will be helping to fund?  What about the Town Clerks' Association who are very close to the operation of the SDA loans scheme?  What about NATO?  We could make a case for including them because local authority tenants will be entitled to get the more beneficial type of loans. What about the Institute of Chartered Surveyors?  Those are seven I thought of off the top of my head.  Deputies opposite thought of another seven.  If we publish a list like that, we would have telephone calls and letters, &ldquo;me-too&rdquo; letters.  It is undesirable that a Bill should list organisations which should be represented on the board of a company which is being set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that Deputy Burke and Deputy Connolly suggested that a representative <Col N="2703" /> of the pensions funds should be on the list.  It would be undesirable to have a representative of the pensions funds on the board.  There would be a conflict of interest because this board will be negotiating with the pensions funds to get money from them at the cheapest possible rate.  To have somebody representing the pensions funds on the other side of the table would be a negation of what the board is supposed to do, that is, the directors are expected to act in the <Col N="2704" /> best interests of the company.  One member of the board would have a conflicting interest because it would not be in his interest as a representative of the pensions funds for the pensions funds to part with the money at the lowest possible rate.  He would not be able to act in the best interests of either of the companies he was representing.  I have to reject this amendment.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The Agency as regards loans made to persons other than a housing authority shall in relation to the combined amount paid in principle and interest by such persons ensure that such amount shall not exceed the total amount which would have been paid on the same loan for the same period under the traditional type of house purchase loan scheme at the average rate of interest obtaining for the period of the loan.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a very important amendment, striking as it does at the very heart of the regulations being laid down by the Minister. This is merely a skeleton Bill enabling the setting up of an agency.  The key to the matter is the proposals the Minister will make in his directives to the agency in their operation.  Consequently it is very difficult to propose amendments to the Bill because we are not discussing the heart of the matter, the Ministers' regulations.</P>
      <P>We feel that this amendment would considerably improve the lot of the less well-off whom this Bill purports to assist. I would remind the House of the superb assessment of this legislation by Mr. Colm Rapple in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 27 September this year in which he stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a great wonder that Margaret Thatcher did not come up with the idea of a housing finance agency on the lines now being proposed by the Government. <Col N="2707" /> But perhaps it is even too right-wing conservative and anti-welfare state even for her.  The proposed scheme clearly aims at shifting the burden of housing the less-well-off away from the State and onto the shoulders of the less-well-off themselves.  And it does so in a slick way which gives an initial impression that the scheme is devised for the benefit of the poor.  It isn't and could not possibly claim to be.</P>
    <P>It will impose on them far more onerous terms for borrowing money than are available to their better-off neighbours.</P>
    <P>In this amendment we are attempting to tackle that right-wing approach which is so evident in the directives the Minister has indicated he will give.  The amendment is a considerable improvement to the section.  Let us remember what the intended directive will mean to the mortgage holder.  There has been no attempt by the Minister to refute Mr. Rapple's article and the figures contained in it.  He states that a £20,000 loan over 25 years will involve repayments of £140,000.  This will not achieve the aim stated by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach in proposing the guillotine motion when he said that what was needed was an injection of funds and a Bill to tackle a social need.  Far from eliminating a social need, it creates one. Not only is there the problem of repaying £140,000 over 25 years but there is the further problem that up to year 17 it is financially impossible to sell your house, buy another house and move to another district because of the amount of money you will owe.  On a loan of £20,000 in year 17, paying back for 16 years, you will still owe £58,013.  What sort of attempt to tackle a social need is that? What sort of benefit is that to the less well-off?  What sort of assistance to the first-time house purchaser or second-time house purchaser is that?</P>
    <P>A person who gets a job and moves to another part of the country for a number of years will have to tackle the problem not only of buying a new house in the town he goes to but of trying to sell off <Col N="2708" /> his existing house and of getting enough money for it to pay off the loan.  In the amendment we are trying to make sure that the traditional type of mortgage situation will continue.  Those lucky enough to start off life buying a house with a SDA loan will know from day one exactly what they will be paying for the remaining years of the loan.  They will pay a fixed interest rate and fixed repayments. Those people will know where they are going and how much they are eating into the original loan.  They will be able to say from year to year that there is a reduction in the original size of the loan.</P>
    <P>We are worried about the Minister's statement yesterday that this new scheme will replace the local authority loans scheme. Last night, resulting from pressure from his own backbenchers and concern within the Labour Party, he came in to the House and said: &ldquo;Sorry about that.  That could have been misunderstood. The local authority loan scheme will continue&rdquo;.  One cannot at 11.30 a.m. make a statement saying that it is envisaged that at full operation this new scheme will replace the local authority loan scheme and at 10.30 p.m. make a statement saying &ldquo;Sorry about that. The local authority loan scheme will continue&rdquo;. One cannot say those things within that number of hours without having one's credibility questioned.  It has become more obvious today, in relation to the response of the Minister to points made, that this Bill has not been thought out.  The Government and the Minister have not thought out the full implications of this Bill.  This is obvious to anybody who has listened to this debate and can read the Minister's statement at 11.30 yesterday morning and his other statement at 10.30 p.m. last night.  There has to be serious concern about the consideration given to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I suggest that our amendment would be acceptable to any fair-minded person who knows even the slightest thing about the housing finance market either at SDA level, building society level or any other level.  The amendment is reasonable.  It tackles the problem and, at least, it gives the necessary guarantees to mortgage <Col N="2709" /> holders and potential house buyers that they will not be faced with the dilemma of having to repay £140,000 on a £20,000 loan or will not find themselves in a situation, if they have to sell their houses, of being unable to sell them in the early years of the mortgage because of the regulations envisaged in the Minister's directive.</P>
    <P>The Minister had a lot to say about a person who finds himself unemployed or ill.  His repayments will go down and he will not find himself having to face eviction. It is laudable that the threat of eviction should be removed from people.  But let us consider the matter a little further. The Bill is meaningless in regard to the difficulties which have been envisaged.  If a person is unemployed or ill, his repayments will go down.  But the reality is, as the Minister has laid it down, that the person's repayments will be calculated on the basis of his P60 for the previous year. If you are ill or unemployed in September or October, what is the situation with regard to repayments?  Do you still operate on a P60?  Even if you have the repayments reduced, what is the situation at the end of the period?  The Minister said yesterday that extra years would be added to the term of the loan.  I suggest that under this directive we will have second and third generation mortgages.  Grandchildren will be paying off the loans of their grandparents and still not owning their homes.  That is the reality of this directive.  We are into the second and third generation mortgage if this is continued. Only very questionable benefit is available at the early stages for the first-time buyer.  If this money is raised from the pension funds and insurance companies, I suggest it be put into the SDA loan schemes, that the income and eligibility limits be increased and that the mortgage subsidy scheme be further improved, even above the level we introduced last April.  The Minister is on a slippery slope. I strongly question how deeply this measure has been researched and if the Minister is aware of the implications here for the house purchaser.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this <Col N="2710" /> amendment.  Public representatives who have experience of the present local authority loans scheme accept that it works very well, that local authority officials understand the position and that there is a flexibility in the administration of the present scheme which is of tremendous assistance to borrowers.  The borrower knows from day one what his position will be.  He will be making his repayments at a fixed rate.  Under this legislation the borrower will not know what his position will be.  Granted his repayments will be related to a percentage of his income, but one must consider that a worker's wage increases are generally related to the cost of living.  Wage increases are usually given to help a worker meet his overheads, which arise as a result of increases in the cost of living.  In other words, if a man gets an agency loan he will find it impossible to make his repayments in years to come.</P>
      <P>The investor has gilt-edge security.  He is protected in every way, while the borrower has no protection.  What happened to the people in the Labour Party who are not here to examine this Bill in detail? They are the so-called representatives of the workers.  I am amazed that the Labour Party have not come in to support our amendments and I find it hard to see how they can vote against them.  Where are Deputy Kemmy and Deputy Browne?</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Burke that we should have more time for a detailed examination of this Bill.  We all understand the importance of housing.  We all know a certain pool of money is available, but will this agency make more money available for housing?  I think it is questionable.  We hear pious platitudes from the Fine Gael Party about setting up all party committees to discuss various aspects of legislation, but here is an area on which there is general agreement and they could have set up such a committee to discuss this agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view the Government are trying to justify themselves.  They are rushing this and other legislation through to give the impression that they are doing something and to satisfy their backbenchers who go back to their constituencies week <Col N="2711" /> after week and hear nothing but complaints about the way the Government are conducting the business of the country. We should have been given more time to discuss this Bill.  Again, I ask the Labour Party and the socialist Independents, as they describe themselves, to consider their position when voting on this amendment and to support us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a remarkable amendment.  I do not think it could be seriously considered by the House for various reasons.  First, it refers to loans intended to be made by the agency, whereas the Minister has made it clear that the scheme will be operated through the local authorities and loans will be made by the local authorities.  Whoever drafted this amendment did not take that fact into account, because the amendment does not refer to loans to be made by the local authorities but only to loans to be made by the agency.</P>
      <P>The wording of the amendment is untenable and I do not know how it would be capable of operation.  It uses such vague expressions as the &ldquo;traditional type of house purchase loan&rdquo;&mdash; that would have to be defined &mdash; and &ldquo;the average rate of interest obtaining for the period of the loan&rdquo;&mdash; I do not know how one could calculate the average rate of interest for a loan for 20 or 25 years.  I do not think too much thought has gone into the drafting of that amendment.</P>
      <P>I realise that the general tenor of the amendment would be if it was applied to loans made by the housing agency, but in that context it goes counter to the purpose of the Bill.  If that idea were to be implemented it would negative the effect of the Bill in its entirety.  I assume that is what the Opposition intended when they tabled this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key factor here and the chief benefit to be had from the agency is that a new, and vital source of funds becomes available for a new purpose.  It becomes available from a new source for commercial reasons.  The people putting up the money will be gaining a far higher rate of interest and a better investment for themselves than they would under any comparable <Col N="2712" /> form of investment.  They will be getting an index-linked intestment guaranteed by the Minister for Finance, which is a very attractive proposition.  It makes that money available for the topping-up procedure which will bring in, by means of a second mortgage, people who could not buy a house with the constraints of the SDA loan.  Much of this debate has been on the basis that the mortgager would be borrowing the entire purchase money under this scheme.  I must admit that, if that were so, it would in most cases put the mortgager into financial difficulties with his repayments.  It is a mistake to think that the entire purchase price of the house will be coming through the agency scheme.  I would like to think that those funds will be used as the top up element, which would be a smaller part of the cost of the house.  If that is so, the bulk of the cost comes from the SDA scheme at the subsidised rate.  This is right and proper and it is absolutely essential that it should continue.  The Minister indicated yesterday that it will continue and that the high interest element, which I regret too, will be confined to the top-up element in the mortgage. Were it otherwise I confess I would foresee difficulties in the medium and long term operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>For the life of me I fail to see how the agency could be self-financing as a long-term proposition if its borrowing powers were limited to the £200 million and if the bulk of the people were borrowing their full mortgages through the agency. If that were so, the bulk of the mortgagers would have little choice but to avail of the hive-off element, the proviso that enables a person, instead of paying the full interest, to rely on the 18 per cent of his income from the previous year.  Will the Minister confirm, when he is replying, that there will be a clause written into each of these mortgages that, at any time, that will be adequate and there will be the option for the mortgager to limit his repayments, in each and every year that the mortgage continues, to this 18 per cent?  That is an essential protection for the mortgager and a key aspect of the whole scheme.</P>
    <P>If the position developed that the bulk <Col N="2713" /> of the people were relying on that 18 per cent cut-off proviso it would mean that the moneys flowing into the local authorities and through them back to the agency would be considerably less than the interest which would be payable by the agency to the life offices on the index-linked basis.  There is bound to be a substantial shortfall.  Of course, that can be made up for a time by further borrowings but there is a limit to the length of time that can go on and eventually the point will be reached where the borrowing capacity of the agency will be exhausted, either by its having reached its limit or by having reached its other important limit, namely, the availability of funds from the life offices with which to fund it.  There should be a provision to enable the scheme to be subsidised if necessary because it is a good scheme and it has a valuable and important role to play.  Its role is to fill a gap that has never been filled before.  The scheme should be maintained and I would be in favour, if the necessity arose, of an appropriate measure of subsidy being put into it.  That may not arise for some years.  Perhaps it will not arise at all.  It depends on variable factors such as how the rate of inflation, interest rates, wages and the cost price of houses will develop.  If it is a worthwhile scheme it is worthwhile subsidising it if the necessity arises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Deputy Taylor mentioned the wording of the amendment.  Perhaps it is not completely correct.  Local authorities are not mentioned, but there is no doubt that they are intended.  As Deputy Taylor said, if a person falls on bad times the period will have to be extended.  I will not be around in 26 years' time but when the public representatives who are around meet the grandchildren of the people who get these loans they will want to know what kind of an assembly agreed to loans like these.  There is no maximum. It depends on inflation.  Nobody can say what they will have to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one who got a local authority loan at an interest rate of 4 per cent about 26 years ago I can speak with some authority on this subject.  I am still paying at the <Col N="2714" /> rate of 4 per cent.  This new scheme will be attractive to young people but they will not realise what they are taking on themselves.  It will make the provision of a home easier for them within the first few years than would be the case under any other loan system but in their enthusiasm about going into a house they may not think ahead to ten or 15 years when they are likely to have a family who are at an expensive stage of education.  It is all very well to talk about salary increases but we are talking here about people in the £7,000 to £9,000 income bracket, people who will need whatever increases in income they get merely in order to keep pace with cost-of-living increases in the ordinary way without ever having to pay increased repayments on their houses.  Incidentally, I might mention here that I detest the idea of percentage increases in incomes because what they mean is that the lower one's income is, the less one gets.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how this scheme will work if we do not impose some maximum in terms of repayments.  As Deputy Taylor has said, it will be difficult enough for the legislature to have the money to continue the scheme but the borrower must be protected in some way.  If we provide a scheme that is open-ended we will be creating all sorts of difficulties for our now young people in the years ahead, people whose children and grandchildren may curse such a scheme.  It is ludicrous to provide a scheme which will involve the repayment of about £120,000 on a £20,000 loan.  We cannot be exact about the figure since we do not know what the level of inflation will be but we can be sure that it will be very high.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed that we did not have more time in which to consider amendments.  If, after Second Reading, each Deputy had been in a position to go to his constituency and discuss the pros and cons of the legislation, we would all come back much better equipped to deal with Committee Stage.  I say this because there are many smart people who are not in this House and who know a good deal about borrowing and lending.  We could well have done with a period of three weeks or more in which to consider the <Col N="2715" /> Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to have some regard to the situation in which people will find themselves in the years ahead if this Bill goes through as intended.  There is no point in talking about certain people having options.  The group we are talking of will have no option but to borrow from this agency.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I wish to indicate my strong opposition to this amendment. There are a couple of points that both Deputies Burke and Callanan overlooked in tabling the amendment.  We must bear in mind that nobody will be obliged to obtain a loan from the new agency.  People will have the option of doing so.  The other point is that anybody borrowing from the agency will be able to decide some time later, if he so wishes, to terminate the contract and to switch to a building society or to some other lending agency.</P>

      <P>This scheme will be open to a couple where the principal earner has an income of between £7,000 and £9,000 but if, as is frequently the case, the spouse of that person is earning about £7,000, their joint income is about £16,000.  Such a couple will be entitled to a loan from the agency.  Are the Opposition seriously suggesting that a couple in such circumstances should be subsidised to a greater extent than that to which we subsidise people who are in receipt of SDA loans?  Is that not precisely the purpose of the amendment? What Fianna Fáil are saying in this amendment is that we should give millions of pounds more by way of subsidy to house buyers.  That is a laudable aspiration and while we all appreciate that this is an area in which we should give as much as possible, we do not have the finances to afford the type of scheme that Fianna Fáil are proposing.  In the four years before this Government were returned to office, Fianna Fáil had the opportunity of pumping that sort of <Col N="2716" /> money into housing but they did not do so.  They had the opportunity in Government of providing millions of pounds for housing but they now oppose a scheme the effect of which will be to help people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, Deputy Molony is not very familiar with the Bill because he talks in the first instance about people withdrawing from a legal undertaking into which they have entered. Does he think that people would be able to do that having regard to the enormous penalty it would involve?  The Deputy must know that that is not a possibility. The purpose of our amendment is to ensure that the borrower will know exactly what he will have to pay.  We are living in the age of inflation and since we do not know what the level of inflation will be at any time in the future, we cannot say how much a borrower will have to pay for a house within the terms of this scheme but on the basis on which we have been working, we know that the repayments will be many times greater than the actual loan.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molony talked about the loans scheme that successive Governments have been operating.  The success of the SDA loans scheme was borne out last year when under that scheme almost 28,000 new houses were completed. After the previous election we improved the scheme and the limits with regard to incomes and the maximum loan.  We raised that substantially and the people who were getting those loans from the local authorities knew exactly what they were going to pay over a fixed period. Earlier in the year we brought in a subsidy to cover the first crucial three-year repayment period which was a very substantial help to the borrower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case the borrower does not know what he or she will have to pay.  A lot of figures have been bandied about as to what repayments will be.  It may be an enormous sum, depending on the rate of inflation, but the financial institutions have gilt-edged security under this Bill. They know where to get the best return for their money and they will get a very good return here because it is index-linked to inflation.  After eight or ten <Col N="2717" /> years, when a couple are rearing a family, repayments will go up and up.  At that stage the children will be at a very expensive age and there will be great expenditure involved.  That is why we are putting down this amendment.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that the agency should be self-financing.  That means that there will be no aid given to the borrower.  The borrower will pay the full going rate at the time.  No one has said whether this will mean any additional funds for housing. The Minister stated that he did not know but hoped additional funds will be provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has spent the last ten minutes saying it is a very good investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean it is a very good investment for the borrower? It is money available for housing at a price.  It is index-linked to inflation. A borrower who takes out a contract this year will not know in 1983 or 1984 what he or she will have to pay.  When a person got an SDA loan which we granted and substantially improved over the years, he knew exactly the term of years and the interest which would have to be repaid. This is not the situation now, it is a whole new ball game in financing.  It opens up the housing finance situation and digs into possibly the whole structure of financing, both on the gilt market and otherwise.  It is open to question whether it can be controlled or not.  We must not get away from the fact that the borrower will pay according to the money market of the day.  It is fine provided the person has the income to meet it but with a change of employment or redundancy, the borrower may have to dispose of the house and will still owe a lot of money. On the open market the house may not fetch a high enough price to meet all that is owed.  I would like to know how this problem can be solved.  A leading financial correspondent dealt with this in great detail&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying he provided it but the Minister has not contradicted him.  He said that on a loan of £20,000 over 25 years the borrower would pay about £130,000.  If a person has to dispose of that house after about 12 years it will have to fetch about £80,000 to pay what he still owes.  Depending on the supply of finance and demand, much will depend on what the value of that house will be.  In any line of property it depends on the finance available and how many people are interested in buying it.  If it does not fetch a good price a serious situation arises.</P>
      <P>I have had the pleasure of working in close association with Department of the Environment officials, who are highly-qualified and efficient.  They gave me good advice on many matters and I am most grateful to them.  When the agency come into operation many people will find themselves in a dilemma about loans and repayments and I suggest that they will need advice on the possible consequences of taking out loans.  Things may look lovely for the first year or two, but then difficulties will begin to arise.  That is why we have put down this amendment to the effect that the repayments shall not exceed those operating in regard to loans in other areas.  It has been interesting in the past couple of days to notice that the great socialist upholders of the rights of the people, Deputies Kemmy and Browne, have not been here.</P>

Here we are getting into a new arena in the matter of interest rates.  The Minister said he does not know how exactly it will work.  I accept that, but we all know it will mean that the borrower will have to pay on the due day the full rate of interest.  The scheme will deal only <Col N="2720" /> with the purchase of new houses and there is no provision for renewal or improvements.  There is no money for such work.</P>

      <P>From now on borrowers will be paying the full market rate.  The Government could not get away from their responsibility to provide housing finance and they have changed emphasis: they are going to the financial institutions and offering them a gilt-edged investment. The borrower will carry the whole bag and baggage.  I asked earlier will any more money be available under this new arrangement.  There will not.  It is a change of emphasis.  The Government are asking the financial institutions to make money available to the borrowers. They will have to pay it all back.  The Government have no obligation to make the necessary money available, as we did when we were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that we did not make money available and that when I and my colleagues were leaving the Department money was not available.  Over the years, Supplementary Estimates were introduced to meet additional expenditure. We would have made the extra money available.  Government speakers should not say we left no money in the till. <Col N="2721" /> Where did the money come from to pay for the additional appointments made by the Government?  They brought people from outside into their Departments.  We found out only yesterday that they are making more of those appointments.  We completed almost 28,000 new houses last year.  Nobody can deny that.  It was an all-time record.  The package we introduced in the spring of this year was aimed at helping people in need of housing, and giving them the necessary help to meet their repayments in the first three years.</P>
    <P>We are now having a shift of emphasis and a shift of finances from one purse to another.  The borrowers will have to carry all of the burden.  We are told the agency will be self-financing.  That means they cannot go to the Government for money. If the Government want to make a change in that, a new Bill will have to be introduced.  The Government are changing money from one direction to another, but will there be any more money for housing?  We have heard &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;buts&rdquo; but nobody has said there will be more money for housing.  I do not believe there will be.  The implications of this must be spelled out to the borrowers.  I hope the borrowers will realise the burden which may be placed on their shoulders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> An impression is being created that this agency loan will be of benefit to the poorer sections of our community.  I agree that it makes it easier for some people to get a house.  The only reason people will resort to this agency is that their financial position does not make it appropriate for them to go to the other institutions like the building societies. Over a period of 25 years a person who borrows from this agency will have to pay more for his house.  There are many implications in it.  The repayments will be smaller in the initial stages.  Repayments to the building societies are substantial, but repayments to this agency will be in the region of 18 per cent of the person's income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is to operate side by side with the SDA loans, but I believe it is the Government's intention to phase out the <Col N="2722" /> SDA loans eventually.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that, if the Government try to replace the SDA loans with agency loans, the interest will be kept at a reasonable rate.  Repayments to the agency will be in the region of 18 to 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out several times that the agency will have to be self-financing. They will get money from the various pensions funds and they will be index-linked. Therefore, plenty of money will be available for the agency.  Money will flow into the agency from many of the financial institutions.  The fact that the funds will be index-linked will make them far more attractive than anything the financial institutions could get on the commercial market.  There will be a queue at the Minister's door of financial institutions wanting to lend money to the Minister for this agency.</P>
    <P>As it is to be operated by the local authorities side by side with the SDA loans scheme, it will be attractive for the local authorities to divert applicants to the agency.  At times there is a scarcity of SDA loans.  The danger is that the Minister intends to phase out that scheme and many applicants will be automatically diverted to the agency loan which will be far more expensive than an SDA loan.  Will the same criteria apply with regard to interest?  At the moment applicants to the building societies can offset their interest against their income.  I hope the Minister will indicate that the same concessions are to be given in regard to interest paid on this loan as to interest paid to building societies where the interest is offset against income.</P>
    <P>I suuport this amendment.  I do not know how repayments of 18 per cent are to be defined over a long period.  I presume when loans are made of £25,000 or £30,000, or whatever the case may be, that is all that will be required back by the agency, plus the interest.  How does the Minister arrive at exactly how the capital will be paid back in a given time? We are talking about 18 per cent of the person's salary.  If the interest rates came down to 4 per cent or 5 per cent that could cause a big fluctuation in incomes <Col N="2723" /> and the figure of 18 per cent could go up to 20 per cent or 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>I was hoping we would be told exactly how the capital will be repaid, for instance, whether there would be an adjustment made at some time during the period to ensure that the person who has taken out the loan will not have paid more in capital than he should.  In other words I was hoping the same principle would apply as to an SDA or building society loan.  The intention of the Bill I am sure is that no more capital will be repaid than in the case of an SDA or building society loan.</P>
    <P>I would have no objection if this agency operated absolutely independently.  But given that funds are being channelled through local authorities I fear there will be an inclination on the part of local authorities to encourage applicants to take up loans from the agency.  As I have said already, there is no doubt but that they will have an ample supply of money. But that will be it, there will be no money available for SDA loans.  That will certainly render the price of houses much dearer.  There is no use in contending that this money is intended to help the poorer sections of our community.  I agree it may help those people who cannot now obtain a loan on a house from any source.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the second mortgage.  I wonder who will be entitled to such mortgages?  For example, will it be confined to people within the £7,000 income bracket, or will other people qualify?  For instance, would people who might apply for building society loans be eligible?  Is it envisaged that the second mortgage would replace a bridging loan? Bearing in mind the way house prices have increased it is practically impossible for the average householder to get a deposit together.  I wonder if such an applicant could apply to this agency for a second loan on his house because, if that were possible, it would be very helpful. We are all aware of the enormous strain placed on house buyers today especially those who must resort to bridging loans which are confined to a very short repayment period.  It must be said <Col N="2724" /> that an applicant to a building society knows what will be the amount of his repayment from the very beginning but even that person may have to resort to a bridging loan to be repaid over a period of three or four years.</P>
    <P>I feel this scheme will make houses dearer for those who cannot afford them. I am convinced that anybody with a sufficient deposit will go to a building society in preference in the certain knowledge that after an initial period of four or five years there will be a substantial reduction effected in their repayments when salary and wage increases are taken into account.  There is no doubt that the terms of building society loans are preferable, whereas couples availing of this scheme in 20 years' time will still be paying 18 per cent and it is difficult to hazard a guess as to what salaries might be at the end of that time.  However, 18 per cent over a 20-year term can amount to an enormous amount of money.  On the other hand, a person operating on a building society loan will have his house practically for buttons in 20 years' time.  There is no point in contending that this scheme favours or will help the poorer sections of our community.  The only way in which it may help them is in the initial purchase of a house but in the longer term it will not benefit them.  This means that such people will pay more dearly for their houses than the people who have the initial deposit.  Even if the person with the necessary deposit were eligible for this scheme I do not believe he would make application.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of people in need of housing.  It is not a question of what type of housing they can get at what price. It is a question of their having no housing whatsoever.  Yet nothing has been done about it.  In very many cases the alternative to the provision of houses under this scheme is to leave people in very bad housing accommodation or in a situation in which they must pay exorbitant rents for totally unsuitable accommodation, which amounts to money down the drain. If one takes into consideration the amount of money such people will spend on exorbitant rents and the discounted cash flow which will arise on account of inflation it will be seen immediately that this proposal is a very good one.  It will place people in the position of acquiring an asset which is increasing in value.  For that reason anybody, business-people or those with a business sense who compare the alternatives will view this proposal as being not alone worthwhile, constituting a facility which will improve the quality of their lives but one which will also improve their financial situation in so far as they will then become people possessing some sort of asset growing in value. In business terms, leaving aside the social factors, that makes sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope Deputy Fitzpatrick is correct, that a lot of people will invest in this fund.  What the Minister is endeavouring to do is to inject into the total funds available additional funds, diverting them from speculative areas and putting them to use for the many needy cases at present on our waiting lists, some of whom may be living with parents or parents-in-law, a very large number of whom suffer not just social deprivation but in many cases from illness and, in particular, mental health problems.  It is not uncommon for such people to be on valium.  Regularly at constituency clinics I discover that people with housing problems <Col N="2726" /> breakdown because of being in a hopeless situation.</P>
    <P>This Bill will give people some hope and is aimed at the most needy.  It has been said by a previous speaker that in the last year of the Fianna Fáil administration 28,000 houses were built.  I am not sure how many were built, but it probably left the national stock about 10,000 short for that year.  It is a question of whether the aims were assessed and an attempt made to meet them.  Instead of opposing this measure, the Opposition should be congratulating the Minister for doing what they failed to do by providing funds for people to enable them to buy their own houses.  We are all aware that the local authorities are not in a position to provide them.  When we were last in Government we increased the housing budget for Dublin Corporation by 87 per cent, whereas in 1979 the increase under the Fianna Fáil Minister for the Environment was 5.26 per cent.</P>

However, there is not much point in having a less expensive scheme which is of no use to a person earning less than £7,000 who cannot possibly buy a house for £14,000 or £18,000.

      <P>Many of the people he has been talking about will not benefit under this Bill and their only hope is for rehousing under the public capital programme. Deputy Mitchell is probably better heeled than many of us on this side, as are his colleagues.</P>
      <P>In part of his speech the Minister expressed a sentiment which seemed to be in line with the proposals contained in his amendment when he stated:</P>
      <P>In any event, of course, repayments will cease when the total amount required to cover the agency's costs have been repaid, even if this is long before the originally envisaged maturity date.</P>
      <P>What is the position of a person who has a maximum mortgage of £22,500 and wants to move from the house after ten years?  An answer to that question might take some of the heat out of this debate.</P>

      <P>The Minister should accept this amendment.  Under the SDA loan scheme there is a formula by which people who are moving house can pay an extra instalment and pay off their loan. That is what we would like to see in this scheme.  If the Minister will answer this point, we will judge what what to do.</P>

      <P>Those of us who have been involved in local authorities, particularly in Dublin where one third of the population reside, are acutely aware of <Col N="2728" /> the difficulties confronting the 6,500 famlies at present on the housing waiting list. A set of circumstances have arisen since 1976 which have made it impossible for many people who were willing to provide their own homes to do so.  The escalating cost of housing and the large deposit required have excluded them from the possibility of ever being able to achieve their aim.</P>
      <P>As an example I will give some rough figures.  In 1966-77 we in the local authority tendered for a housing contract and the price per unit was £14,000; today the same house is costing approximately £24,000.  Increases of this kind in the private sector have meant that many who would have bought their own houses have been unable to do so and are now on the corporation's waiting list.  I have personal experience of tradesmen earning good money who wanted to pay their own way but were precluded from buying houses because they could not raise a deposit of perhaps £7,000 or £8,000.  A deposit of £2,000 was an attainable goal but the higher amounts were totally beyond their capacity.</P>
      <P>During the weekend of the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis there were show houses which were to be on view.  No doubt with a pending election in mind, the Minister made a magnanimous announcement on the Friday night increasing the SDA loan by £2,000 and offering the marvellous £18,000, of which very few people have been able to avail.  The show houses which were to be opened on the Saturday closed for the weekend and opened the following weekend £2,000 dearer.</P>

If Deputy Burke opened his clinic I am sure he would have people coming to him saying the same thing.  The people want to be housed.  They are glad of an opportunity to be able to pay their way and do not want to be prohibited from buying homes because they cannot get the exorbitant deposits necessary.  I believe that Deputy Burke played no small part in escalating the price of houses to the degree that he put them out of the market for the average worker. Those people wanted to buy their houses and the Deputy prevented them.  The Deputy should keep that in mind when he comes to vote on this Bill and redress the wrong he perpetrated on those people.  Let the Bill go through and give those people an opportunity to buy their homes.</P>

The building industry was extremely depressed for the last six months Fianna Fáil were in Government, so it is possible that a builder would have a CRV for £27,000 and be selling those houses for £25,000 and then they went up to £27,000, when Deputy Burke was Minister.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have gone over this ground three or four times today and twice yesterday.  This scheme is not a substitute for any other scheme.  It will attract different people from those attracted by the SDA loan or the building mortgage scheme, and people will be attracted for the very reasons stated by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  Under this scheme we are catering for people who cannot <Col N="2735" /> put together the £9,000 or the £10,000 necessary to bridge the gap between the £14,000 available under the SDA loan scheme and the price of the house &mdash; £24,000 or £25,000.</P>
      <P>Another category of people catered for are those who get loans from building societies.  A person earning £7,000 or £8,000 a year cannot make repayments of £70 a week.  In this Bill we are removing the burden of saving a very big deposit.  There is no mystery about it; there is no sleight of hand.  There are disadvantages which will be explained to everybody who wants a loan from the agency.  A person earning £7,000 a year has a choice of three ways of buying a house: he can go to a building society and get a mortgage &mdash; and he will be repaying £160 or £180 a month; he can apply for an SDA loan &mdash; but he will have to get a deposit of £8,000, £9,000 or £10,000 which, for people under £7,000, is extremely difficult unless they are well beyond the age at which most people get married; or they can opt to get money under the new Housing Finance Agency, which means the deposit will be £2,500, and the repayments in the initial years instead of being 40 per cent to 45 per cent of their income will be 18 per cent.</P>
      <P>The shortfall in their repayments during the early years is moved forward and becomes part of the debt they owe the Housing Finance Agency.  As wages increase, through inflation or promotion, the borrowers reach the point where they are quickly wiping out the debt they built up.  This is an alternative source for people who want to buy their houses but cannot save the deposit or afford the mortgage repayments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor was right when he said the drafting of this amendment would prohibit me from accepting it, because it cuts across the basis of the agency, which is that it should be self-financing.  Deputy Taylor also said the 18 per cent would be constant throughout the lifetime of the loan.  That depends on each individual, but if a person got a promotion his salary could increase from £7,000 to £10,000 and the 18 per cent repayments would be much higher.  At some stage he would <Col N="2736" /> have a choice of repaying the loan at 18 per cent or he could cut down and repay at 12 per cent or 14 per cent, whatever would be the appropriate percentage to wipe out the loan after 25 years.</P>
    <P>I realise I am repeating myself but the same points seem to be worrying many Deputies.  Deputy Connolly for the last few days was referring to the gnomes of Zurich and the moguls of the banking world who would be latching on to the backs of the unfortunate working class people of Ireland and sucking their blood dry through this new housing scheme.  I admit that language is a bit purple but that was the kind of thing he was saying.</P>

      <P>I believe pension funds will be anxious to invest in this agency because this is a gilt-edged investment. In my view, it is the duty of pension funds to invest in gilt-edged securities.

It is impossible to say exactly how much money will be invested, but it is thought about £300 million of pension fund money is available in any one year and about 10 per cent or 15 per cent of that is invested abroad.  If we do no more than have that money invested here, and at the same time can provide houses for our people, this Bill will be worthwhile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it could be depending on what happens to inflation in the next number of years.  Most of us were Members of this House in 1973.  The price of an SDA loan-type house then was £5,000.  What is it worth today?  The Deputy can answer that and that gives him the information.</P>

We will have to explain to people what the options are and we will not be able to do that.  I can say to a person in respect of an SDA loan: &ldquo;You will pay so much for ever more&rdquo;.

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had made it quite clear.  The Deputy points out that there are advantages and disadvantages in this scheme.  If the person goes for the SDA loan he has a deposit to make but his repayments are fixed over the period of the loan.  If he goes for the building society mortgage the repayments are fixed but they are an extremely high percentage of his salary for the first few <Col N="2738" /> years.  If he gets pay increases then, as a percentage of his salary, they diminish. If he goes to the Housing Finance Agency the percentage of his salary is fixed and as his salary goes up he pays an increasing amount of money until his debt is wiped out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is considered normal, prudent practice for a person to take out a mortgage protection policy which is provided by the insurance companies. That is based on the fixed repayments on the mortgage.  There could be difficulties in obtaining a mortgage protection policy on this type of mortgage. This would leave the family in an exposed situation.  Would the Minister consider this aspect and make arrangements with the very insurance companies who are to be part and parcel of this scheme to ensure that facilities will be made available in every case where they are required for a mortgage protection policy. If this is not done a family could be left with no means of ever paying off their debt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if it is legally possible.  I think a lot of building societies insist on it.  I would strongly recommend to anybody who has a mortgage to take out such a policy.  I think one is being negligent if one does not do that.  I would ask the agency to insist, and if they cannot insist, at least to recommend to everybody who is borrowing money under this scheme to take out a mortgage protection policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a specified period over which the loan will be repaid? I should like to put another point to the Minister.  This Bill is to make finance available for housing.  At present people who are deemed to be eligible for local authority housing and who are on an approved housing list are being disallowed the £18,000 special category SDA loan because they are not deemed to be living in unfit or overcrowded housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations read:</P>
      <P>(c) a person&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  who, not later than one year prior to the application for the loan, had applied to a housing authority for tenancy of a house provided by them, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  whose family at the time of the application for a tenancy comprised that person and at least two other persons or one child, and</P>
      <P>(iii)  who had satisfied the authority that he was in need of rehousing by reason of the dangerous, structurally unfit or overcrowded conditions of his existing house and that because his financial circumstances were such he could not reasonably be expected to secure adequate housing accommodation from his own resources, and</P>
      <P>(iv)  whose family is in need of rehousing.</P>
      <P>All of those conditions must be satisfied, not just three of them, in order to qualify for the £18,000 special category allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>But the people to whom I refer are on an approved housing list and will have to be rehoused by the local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>People may be on a local authority housing list but, as well as that, they must qualify under these, I admit, rather rigid terms before they can get the £18,000 loan.  I am not sure whether they can be loosened a little but I will certainly look into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I read Colm Rapple's article on this and I have been working on a few figures.  At present if a person borrows £20,000 at 12½ per cent over 25 years from a local authority and particularly from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, he pays back over £90,000.  It is important to get that across.</P>
      <P>We have heard people on the other side say that the new scheme will represent a costly type of housing finance.  I do not agree and would like to hear from the Minister what his idea of the costings will be.  From what I can ascertain this sort of financing will not be any more costly than are normal borrowings.  For instance, if we take an ACC loan of £30,000 at current rates we find that it is as costly as will be a loan under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Connaughton's figures are correct.  I am informed that the repayments on a building society loan of £20,000 for 20 years amount to £83,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The Agency in performing its functions shall ensure that its operations and activities will not in any way interefere with or limit the provision of loans by housing authorities under the Small Dwellings Acquisitions Acts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>From the Fianna Fáil point of view this is the crunch element in the Bill.  The Minister has said that he intends to scrap the SDA system and the amendment states:</P>
      <P>The Agency in performing its functions shall ensure that its operations and activities wil not in any way interfere with or limit the provision of loans by housing authorities under the Small Dwellings Acquisitions Acts.</P>
      <P>Among other things which he said with which we disagree, the Minister said yesterday when introducing the Bill that it is envisaged that at full operation the new scheme will replace the local authority loans scheme.  We have debated at great length the importance to the house purchase market and potential home owners of the SDA scheme and it is to prevent its scrapping that we have put down our amendment.  Whatever other damage the Minister will do, the one thing we do not want him to do is to dismantle the SDA scheme, which is a fundamental part of house purchase arrangements because it enabled people not only to purchase their houses but to know when they were entering into mortgage agreements that they would be on a fixed rate of interest and that the repayments would be stable for the life of the loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not have the time to go into this at great length, but I would ask the Minister to give us a guarantee that he does not intend to interfere with the operations <Col N="2745" /> of the SDA scheme.  Yesterday and last night he said he would scrap it.  As I said, this is a crunch point as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to give the Deputy the clarification he seeks.  I have given it already about half a dozen times. I said last night that I thought it is possible that this scheme would prove so attractive that the SDA loans scheme would wither away by itself.  If that does not happen, I will not remove it.  I cannot accept the amendment because its effect would be to differentiate between loans made to individuals and to housing authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is just a matter of wording, I am quite prepared to arrange for a redrafting of the relevant words in the amendment.  Yesterday the Minister said he would scrap the SDA scheme and he repeated that last night. Now that we have put down an amendment he says he is not prepared to accept it and that, to my mind, means that he intends to scrap the SDA scheme.  Could the Minister not submit a suitably worded amendment when the Bill goes before the Seanad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not.  I have explained a number of times that this scheme is different from the SDA one and from the building society schemes.  If I were to do what the Deputy has asked me to do, I would have to extend the subsection to include people who borrow under the building society schemes.  That would be illogical.  I have already told the House of my attitude to the SDA loans. I said on a number of occasions today that this scheme is designed for people who would not be able to put together the necessary deposits of £8,000 or £9,000 or £10,000 to buy houses under the building society schemes.  This will afford such people a chance to get houses at a small deposit and it will allow them to pay only a small proportion of their incomes in the initial years of repayment.  This Bill is different from either the SDA scheme or <Col N="2746" /> the building society schemes.  Different rules apply to it.</P>

Of its nature it deserved time for reflection and consideration of amendments.  Yesterday we had the Second Stage debate and today we have had Committee Stage and this was not appropriate.  It was totally out of order to guillotine this measure in this manner.  The Government have refused to accept legitimate amendments which would have been an improvement and would have provided guarantees with regard to the traditional forms of mortgages available in the housing market.

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is, first of all, to appropriate to the particular services the various sums which this House has voted, by way of original and Supplementary Estimates, over the past year. Secondly, the Bill provides a basis for calculation of the &ldquo;four-fifths&rdquo; issues which the Minister for Finance is authorised to make from the Exchequer towards meeting the cost of next year's services during the period before the Dáil gets a chance to consider and vote on the various services individually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years, when this House has come to deal with the annual Appropriation Bill, there have been complaints from both sides &mdash; and justifiably so &mdash; about the inadequacy of the time devoted to discussion of the various Estimates and Supplementary Estimates which form the basis for the Bill.  In my financial statement in July, I indicated that the Government would be putting forward proposals for financial reforms which would, among other things, improve existing procedures in relation to the discussion of Estimates in the House and would in <Col N="2756" /> particular provide for a far more comprehensive examination in the House of all the Government's spending programmes.</P>
    <P>I remember on many occasions in this House that there has been no discussion of the Appropriation Bill, and I am glad it has been possible this year to discuss it.  It is being discussed this year at greater length than for many years, if ever.  I am happy to say that the Government's proposals for reform have been advanced at unusual speed and, as Deputies are aware, there is now before the House a discussion paper entitled &ldquo;A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It was decided to publish the proposals in the form of a discussion paper because the Government are anxious to encourage the widest possible consideration of and comment on the proposals before proceeding with their detailed implementation. We are especially anxious to receive the views of Deputies on all sides of the House concerned with the procedures and practices used in the consideration of public finances.  I would hope the Deputies will not be slow to make their views known in this area.</P>
    <P>Initial reaction to the proposals for reform has been positive and constructive and I look forward to receiving detailed submissions from a broad spectrum of opinion in both the public and private sectors in the coming weeks.  I have also placed a &ldquo;take note&rdquo; motion on the Order Paper of this House and time will be provided for the taking of this motion when Deputies have had an opportunity to consider the proposals in detail.</P>
    <P>It is my sincere hope that these proposals will be considered, not just from the standpoint of party political advantage, but from the concern which I know is shared on all sides of the House to achieve better control of the public finances.  My commitment to these reforms arises from my concern to preserve and improve on the procedures of this House.  The improvements aimed at will serve all Members and I hope that this will be reflected in the quality of the response to the discussion paper.</P>
    <P>The most important of all the measures contained in the document I have been <Col N="2757" /> describing is the proposal that the Estimates for any year be discussed and decided in this House before the year begins and before any of the money is spent.  That will lead to a much more rational type of discussion.  In failing to discuss Estimates before the money is spent, we in this House, who are concerned with the largest single expenditure of money in this State, the Government's own budget, are adopting procedures which no private business, co-operative or trade union would adopt.  Clearly any of those bodies would decide in advance how much they were going to spend, whereas we decide how much to spend when most of the money has already been spent.  This makes little sense and gives very bad example.  As a result of this, in future years, it will be expected that a better appreciation of the need to match expenditure to tax possibilities would arise from the new timetable for discussing the various spending proposals that come before this House in the form of Estimates for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>The continuing and growing crisis in the public finances, as reflected in the level of the Exchequer borrowing requirement and the current budget deficit, has been a matter of serious concern for a number of years now.  We have had a budget deficit in every year since 1972 and the public debt has grown enormously. Successive Ministers for Finance have set themselves the objective of bringing stability back to the public finances.  Performance, however, has fallen far short of objectives.  Instead the problem has become greater, so great in fact that when this Government came into office immediate remedial action was necessary, within scarcely three weeks of the assumption of office.</P>
    <P>The position we faced in framing the July budget is by now familiar to most, but the main facts bear repeating.  In the January budget the overall Exchequer borrowing requirement was set at £1,296 million, or 13 per cent of GNP, of which £515 million, or 5¼ per cent of GNP, was to finance the current budget deficit.  The position as we found it in July was that, in the absence of corrective action, the borrowing requirement would reach <Col N="2758" /> £1,973 million, or 20 per cent of GNP, as against 13 per cent, of which the current budget deficit represented nearly £950 million, equivalent to 9½ per cent of GNP. At that time, the likely position in 1982 looked even worse.</P>
    <P>Decisive action was clearly called for and taken.  The broad targets set in the July budget were to bring the current budget deficit down to 8 per cent of GNP and to reduce the overall Exchequer borrowing requirement to 16½ per cent. While the reductions achieved in 1981 represent considerable progress, the level of the budget deficit will still be the highest recorded for this country and will remain seriously out of line with those of our EEC partners.</P>
    <P>One of the aspects of the public finances which particularly concerns me is the extent to which in recent years initial budget estimates of public expenditure and current deficits have been considerably below the eventual outturn.  In 1979, the budget deficit was targeted at £289 million.  The outturn, what actually happened, was a deficit of £522 million &mdash; an overshoot of £233 million, or 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>The budget for 1980 set the budget deficit for the year at £353 million.  In the event, the actual deficit was £547 million which was £194 million or 55 per cent above the original estimate.</P>
    <P>Last January the forecast for the budget deficit this year was £515 million. Over the first half of the year, however, the deficit was £457 million, a bare £60 million or so less than the estimate for the full year.  Moreover, as I have said, it was clear that, if trends had been allowed go unchecked, the deficit for the year as a whole would have been almost £950 million &mdash; £435 million or 84 per cent greater than the original estimate.</P>
    <P>Over the last three years, therefore, the previous Government underestimated the difference between Government revenue and expenditure by more than 70 per cent, a record with testifies eloquently to their competence, or rather, their lack of it, in managing the nation's finances.</P>
    <P>While one must accept that changing economic circumstances can affect patterns <Col N="2759" /> of expenditure and revenue during the course of the year, I pledge that there will be no deliberate underestimation in any Estimates or budget which I produce.</P>
    <P>I will now make some brief comments on the employment situation since a very high proportion of the moneys provided for in the Bill which is now before the House is directly or indirectly designed to maintain and create employment, to retrain people who must change employment or to support those who are without employment.</P>
    <P>In 1980, unemployment rose by almost 34,000 reflecting both a substantial decline in employment and a continued high rate of increase in the labour force. Available indicators suggest that this year total employment will remain unchanged and that unemployment will increase by about half as much as last year.  In the past year or so, unemployment in the EEC has increased by double the rate here, indicating the widespread and severe nature of the problem now confronting the industrialised world as a whole.</P>
    <P>A disturbing feature of the increase which has occurred in registered unemployment in Ireland during the past two years has been the growth in the numbers aged less than 25 years on the live register; when one recalls that very many first time job seekers do not appear on the live register, then clearly there is a serious problem of joblessness among today's young people.  In deciding to establish a Youth Employment Agency, which will provide work experience and training for up to 20,000 young people, the Government have resolved to tackle the problem. In addition, the establishment of the proposed National Development Corporation, which will have as its objective the provision of productive, sustainable employment in the industrial and commercial public sector, should lead to an improvement in the labour market situation. I do not believe we can be in any way complacent even about the measures that have been announced so far by the Government in regard to combating unemployment.  Having regard to the rate at which we are producing new <Col N="2760" /> jobs, even at our very best performance, in the very best years of industrial job creation &mdash; and there are many who would argue that those years are past because the amount of mobile international investment which we, through the IDA can attract has diminished worldwide and therefore, we are looking for a share of a much smaller available pool of international investment to create new jobs&mdash;at the best of times we would not be able to create new jobs on the scale that would be necessary to meet what we know will be the increase in the labour force over the next five years.  At our best we reached a rate of net new job creation of around 8,000 whereas we know that the labour force will grow at a rate of about 15,000 over the next five years.  We have fallen well short of what we must do to provide jobs for young people.  I believe the key to success here lies certainly in measures such as the Youth Employment Agency and the National Development Corporation.  We would welcome constructive suggestions from all sides of this House as to how these new instruments should be used to create employment.  There is no monopoly of good ideas on this side of the House in matters of this sort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The key is to make ourselves competitive.  We must bring down the rate of growth in costs in our economy.  When I refer to costs I do not solely mean labour costs in the firm itself. I mean costs in other firms which are providing services to that firm, costs in the public sector which is either levying taxes or levying charges on any business which is trying to export.  All of these costs are growing faster here than they are growing in our competitor countries. In the great wide world in which we must export no one will buy our goods unless they are competitive in price and in quality. Sentimental attachment to the old sod, to the shamrock and to the grand country this is will not carry us any distance in the hard export markets of the world.  In that context it is essential that <Col N="2761" /> we make ourselves more competitive, that we set aside current profits in order to invest in improved marketing and in advanced technology.  The trouble at present is that many firms are only able to hold on to existing markets because of the tight cost structure at the expense of setting aside money for further technological investment and for investment in marketing.  They are hanging on by the skin of their teeth at present but in four or five years' time in the absence of having done that market development, in the absence of having invested in the technological adaptation which is continually necessary in the industrial process, they will find themselves losing out.  The committee of economists pointed out that every 1 per cent increase in real wages over a four-year period means the loss of 7,000 jobs.  There is a direct connection there identified and quantified between increases in costs and actual jobs lost. That is a message from which we must all draw a lesson.  If we do not, we will not be able to provide the jobs on the scale which we must do if we are to prevent the unemployment problem becoming really acute.  We know the number of new jobs that will be required.  This is our biggest challenge in the economic area and it is one that none of us can be complacent about.  The more we think about it and discuss it the better.  Without a united national will we will not get over that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Important though the measures which I have mentioned are, it would be foolish to assert that these measures, or any other action open to the Government, will of themselves quickly reverse the rise in unemployment.  Internationally, commentators remain pessimistic about the prospect for unemployment during 1982. The modest economic recovery forecast may at best stabilise the level of unemployment in the industrialised world next year.  Against this background, Ireland, being highly dependent on increasing its level of exports, cannot reasonably expect to run against the tide.  A considerable commitment of employment related public expenditure will continue to be required, therefore, for the foreseeable <Col N="2762" /> future.</P>
    <P>Throughout the past decade, including the periods of the oil price induced recessions, a remarkable level of job creation was maintained in Ireland.  Unfortunately however, there was at the same time a very high incidence of job loss; for instance, in the period 1972-80, more than 50,000 notified redundancies were recorded in manufacturing industry alone.  When account is taken of the fact that notifed redundancies considerably understate the level of gross job loss, it is clear that job loss is a major obstacle to improving the employment situation.</P>
    <P>Some job loss is a normal concomitant of economic development and, indeed, in post-industrial societies, a decrease in the share of total employment represented by manufacturing industry is quite normal.  We in Ireland, however, are far from that stage of development and we cannot afford to have the industrialisation programme of the IDA continually offset by job loss in existing industries.  The stark reality must be faced that a significant proportion of our job loss is attributable to the inability of firms to remain competitive on both domestic and export markets.  For instance, increased import penetration is clearly illustrated by the growth in the share of competing imports in home consumption of manufactured goods from 26 per cent in 1977 to about 32 per cent in 1980.  This overall increase masks much more marked increases in particular sectors of industry where redundancies were also proportionately more severe.</P>
    <P>In particular we have been losing out to imports in the area of manufacturing activity where labour intensity is high. The exports we have been gaining have been almost exclusively in capital intensive industries where we have recently, at considerable cost, established new technological industries.  They have an initial advantage on the foreign markets but as other countries set up similar industries our new industries will find that their initial technological headstart will be eaten away.  Once that happens they will have to get back and compete on price with the other producers.  If we have allowed our competitiveness to diminish <Col N="2763" /> we will not be able to do that.</P>
    <P>The previous Government launched a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  The idea was that 3p in every £ over the period of four years in which the Government were in office would be transferred from imported products to domestically produced products.  The campaign itself was a perfectly good and valid one and I make no criticism of it but what happened during that period was that 3p in every £ was transferred from home produced goods to imports, exactly the opposite to what is desirable.  This reflects our declining competitiveness.</P>
    <P>In relation to agriculture, may I say how encouraged I am to see that the decline in agricultural income has at last been halted.  Farmers say, and rightly so, that remaining at the 1980 level of income is hardly satisfactory, but at least the downward spiral has been halted and real progress can now begin to be made.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy for helping agriculture operates on two levels.  First, there is the series of special reliefs to help farmers over the crisis.  The Government have already introduced some of these measures.  They have provided an increased ewe subsidy in disadvantaged areas and a reduction to 3 per cent in the rate of VAT on certain agricultural contractors. They have finally abolished the resource tax for 1980-81 and arranged for the repayment of amounts already paid by farmers.  They have increased the flat rate addition for VAT for unregistered farmers from 1 per cent to 1½ per cent.  A 5 per cent interest subsidy for development farmers has been introduced and by carrying the exchange risk, the State has enabled ACC to provide cheap loans to farmers for capital expenditure arising from additions to the basic herd-flock of cows, sows, and ewes and to assist young farmers to develop farms taken over from their parents.  It should also be remembered that since last year the ACC and the banks operate a productive investment scheme whereby foreign currency is onlent to farmers at current rates of 14¼ and 16½ per cent with the Exchequer bearing the residual exchange risk.  The Exchequer also bears the exchange risk <Col N="2764" /> on EIB loans onlent by ACC to the small and medium-sized agri-business sector.</P>
    <P>A second Supplementary Estimate for Agriculture, for £38 million, was provided recently.  It is hoped to finalise arrangements shortly for a scheme, to be financed jointly with the banks, to help farmers with loan repayment difficulties. A special interest subsidy scheme to encourage the expansion of breeding stock is also in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>In addition to these short-term measures, the Government's longer-term strategy to defeat inflation is specially important to farmers.  The cost-price squeeze of the last few years has severely reduced their incomes.  Prices have to be brought under control and the Government are determined to do this.  This will be of benefit to farmers in slowing down the rate of increase in their costs.  Also, in reassessing their farm input programmes, farmers will have every assistance from the State agencies, ACOT and AFT, in devising programmes which will maximise their returns.</P>
    <P>In industry, the State has also become involved in a multiplicity of ways over the years, through public expenditure programmes and tax concessions, in attempting to stimulate investment and ensure maximum output and employment.  This incidentally is something which some industrialists find it easy to forget when they criticise the level of public expenditure or budget deficits.  Members will be aware that major aspects of current industrial support and development policies are under active review.  In this process, one of my principal objectives will be to ensure that an adequate balance is struck between the perceived needs of industrialists both domestic and foreign, the state promotional bodies' assessment of what State investment is required to maximise privately generated investment and employment, and my responsibility as Minister for Finance to ensure that I get value for every pound of taxpayers' money and every pound borrowed on behalf of the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Bill now before the House provides for the appropriation of moneys not only for current <Col N="2765" /> but also for Exchequer capital spending.</P>
    <P>During the past decade expenditure on the entire Public Capital Programme increased from about 11½ per cent to nearly 18 per cent of GNP.  This sharp increase reflects the importance attached to developing the economy and providing employment.  My experience since coming to office has confirmed my belief that we must look afresh at the basis on which Government investment decisions are taken.  Down through the years the tendency has been to emphasise the employment and general development content of capital spending and to be much less concerned about whether the investment was likely to generate an adequate financial return, either to the Exchequer or to other identifiable bodies.  Now that scarcity of resources is a hard fact of life, we must place far greater emphasis on the financial return concept, wherever it is appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is worth drawing the attention of the House to the fact that in relation to capital expenditure by the State in general there has been a dramatic increase in volume terms but the number of jobs created as a result of this increased volume has been no greater than the number created ten years ago.  That is a matter of concern in the context of considering whether we are getting value for money in terms of capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>The way in which we allocate our capital resources must be guided by good judgement and discrimination between what are palliatives for our problems and what provides a lasting basis for prosperity. It is essential that we ensure that money borrowed for investment is spent effectively enough to generate sufficient increase in output to service directly or indirectly and to repay the borrowing involved.  Otherwise the long-term effects of the spending are negative rather than positive.  Where the benefit accrues directly to identifiable individuals &mdash; or bodies as does a substantial proportion of capital spending on industrial development and arterial drainage, for instance &mdash; we must also consider to what extent they should be asked to make a <Col N="2766" /> direct contribution to its cost.  I have said before and I stress again that I do not intend to cut back on capital expenditure that generates adequate income to remunerate it.  This concept is particularly relevant in the case of State companies.  In a number of cases their capital investment programmes have been undertaken at a level which did not have sufficient regard to their capacity to remunerate the borrowing involved, with the result that when this Government came to office there was a long queue of State bodies knocking at my door for Exchequer finance to restore order to their balance sheets.  This is a matter of great concern to me and I have asked my Department to see whether the rates of return on investment by State bodies can be improved and how generally their consciousness of their commercial responsibilities can be enhanced and maintained at a heightened level.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that injection of equity capital by the State should be seen by any State company as the answer to any problems they may have got into in the matter of borrowing or because they are not simply making enough money to pay the interest on their borrowings.  No company in the private sector are in a position to go to their shareholders seeking cash injections and using new equity, which is intended to be a permanent injection of capital, by way of overcoming current and immediate difficulties in the borrowing field.  State companies must apply commercial criteria in their approach to this sort of matter.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the more general issue of public finance planning.  The Government are committed to drawing up and presenting to the House as early as practicable in 1982 a comprehensive economic and social plan.  An important objective of this document will be to provide a medium-term framework for the Government's spending programmes.  It will also cover economic growth, overall budgetary policy in the medium-term, incomes, prices, employment, taxation and social expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any indication of when we may have that plan?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In putting policy elements under these heads into a coherent and consistent overall strategy, one of the main concerns of the plan will be to set the scene for a regime of ordered management of the public sector and of the public finances in pursuit of higher employment, greater economic efficiency, greater social equity, and, ultimately, higher living standards.</P>
      <P>On the question of economic planning generally we need, as a community, to ask ourselves what we are trying to achieve.  It is not good enough simply to produce plans every so often simply in order to be able to have a press conference and for the Government to be able to issue a document and say that they have a plan.  Such plans are usually ignored by the Government in the drawing up of their budgetary strategy.</P>
      <P>This has been the experience to a great extent with economic planning in recent times.  Indeed, it was institutionalised when economic planning was put into a separate Department from the Department of Finance.  This was a cloud cuckoo-land approach to planning.  That situation continued for a few years.  It is my intention to avail of the fact that the planning section is now in the Department of Finance and to bring much closer together planning generally in the economy and the financial decisions being taken by the Government in the context of the budget.  One must be totally interlocked with the other because it is only in that way that planning can play its proper role of being a real discipline and not simply a cosmetic exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second important concern of planning is that of providing some medium-term perspective for our people, telling them frankly what are the choices they must make, not merely that the Government must make but that the people generally must make.  We need to put very stark and honest choices before the people in the matter of employment because, unless we radically alter the <Col N="2768" /> whole structure of our economy, we will not be able to provide the jobs for the young people which will be needed in the next five to ten years.  People in Government and outside should address this problem honestly.  We must frame the economic planning documents against that background, which I am anxious to see produced as early as possible.  There are elements of logic and reason which have, for too long, been absent from public finance decisions.  If this year's Appropriation Bil sums up the results of the Government's emergency attempt to rein in the runaway public finances, it is my firm intention that all subsequent such Bills for which I am responsible will be explicable in terms of the measured and planned approach to public expenditure which will set this Government apart from its predecessor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing that has been said tonight on the Appropriation Bill differs from much of what we have heard from the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and other members of the Government over recent months.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech tonight contains probably more pious platitudes, hopes and dreams than any other Minister for Finance expounded in this House.  He expressed some of those dreams back in mid-summer, in the early days of this new regime, and set aims and targets at that time which were not achieved.  We had a speech which concluded by discussing the position of State companies and State boards.  I agree with some of the points made by the Minister.  But, on one hand, he talked about a National Development Corporation pledged to create and provide jobs for our young people and, on the other hand, he said we must take a hard look at all our State boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does that mean that, when companies run into difficulties and jobs are threatened, the cold hand of the Bruton-FitzGerald regime will descend and close them down?  Will this Government take into consideration that transport companies find it extremely difficult, even in countries which are far more highly developed and thickly populated than ours, to run on a commercial basis?  These <Col N="2769" /> are the facts of life that no amount of lecturing, either in the House or outside it, will change.  I am glad that the Minister is at least aware that there are many young people unemployed, that our population is growing fast and that the percentage of young people in the total workforce is so high that it bears no relationship to that of our EEC partners.  He now realises how important the whole issue of employment is.</P>
    <P>We are told about costs and competitiveness and why the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign did not make the progress it should have made.  I suggest it was a tremendously successful campaign, although I do not deny that competitiveness is extremely important.  It is also very important to continue to develop our exports.  Apart from prices, there are other factors which contribute and the Minister must be aware of this.  The import of foodstuffs at present is to a large extent unwarranted and unnecessary, yet their presentation on supermarket shelves or display counters is inclined, in an affluent society, to make them that little bit more attractive to people and thus place some of our own workers' jobs in jeopardy.  The campaign may not have been as successful as one would have liked&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a good idea which just did not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amazed to hear the Tánaiste, the leader of a once proud Labour Party, say that he had ideas about scrapping the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign. There was a commitment to it by the people involved who made tremendous progress and the Government who gave them support enjoyed tremendous success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to inflation, we remember the heady days of May and June when a package was presented to the people which, as the days turned to November and December, proved not to have been researched in any significant way.  I am sure everyone had sympathy with the Minister for Finance last Sunday when he spoke on radio and admitted that the researchers of that document had made <Col N="2770" /> a grave mistake.  The Minister for Finance was saying that all we had said during the election campaign was correct and that he and his colleagues and supporters over-sold &mdash; I am afraid at times somewhat dishonestly &mdash; this tax package which has now blown up in their faces.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that we are talking about an Appropriation Bill which devotes so much money to employment in the public sector.  Inflation is extremely important, yet the Minister at no stage referred to a pay settlement or to why inflation is so high.  Last July we forecast, at the time when inflation &mdash; at an annual rate of 17.1 per cent &mdash; was under control, that the direct impact of the budget would mean an increase in inflation of at least 5 per cent.  We were scoffed at then, but in mid-December we are told that the annual rate of inflation to mid-November was 23.3 per cent, or 5.8 per cent for the quarter.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the pay settlement. How much easier it would have been, how much cheaper it would have been, to have got a pay settlement with inflation running at 17.1 per cent rather than 23.3 per cent.  That is the position.  We have heard why that budget was necessary but this month <i>Magill</i> magazine, a paper I do not often read from&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Only when it suits the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;had an article contributed by none other than Dr. Brendan Dowling, the economist and reputed architect of the Fine Gael tax package, which has succeeded in disrobing the Government of all credibility.  In that article Dr. Dowling said that the budget was the financial component of the Fine Gael tax policy.  That tax packet added 5 per cent or 6 per cent to our inflation rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite what Dr. Dowling stated in that article, the Minister for Finance now realises the lunacy of that package.  If ever a Government was ridiculed by newspaper after newspaper it is this one. <i>The Irish Times</i> last Friday referred to it. The <i>Cork Examiner</i> on 10 December gave us the heading &ldquo;No Joy in this Package&rdquo;, <Col N="2771" /> the <i>Sunday Tribune:</i>&ldquo;Where are all the Promises to Women Gone?&rdquo; I could go on and on with newspaper after newspaper.  Little or no reference was made in the Minister's speech tonight to inflation, but it was the central theme of Fine Gael's manifesto package: &ldquo;We will control inflation&rdquo; they told us.  That package now looks like a non-runner with inflation running at 23.3 per cent.  Unemployment is growing and there is an embargo on recruitment in the public service.  School leavers are without hope of employment.</P>
    <P>Not long ago in the House we passed the Youth Employment Agency Bill in which there was not a single new idea. The Government said they hoped the agency would create new employment opportunities, but up to now the agency has been only co-ordinating and extending and developing existing schemes.  Let us not run away with the idea that this empty agency will solve all our problems. It may have helped to train some people but it has not gone any distance towards solving unemployment among our young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I specifically said I did not think it would solve unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, headings are ten a penny in the newspapers. Another example of the dishonesty of the Government was given when Deputy Wilson and Deputy Haughey tried to push for the holding of the Cavan-Monaghan by-election.  On that occasion, 21 October, on the motion for the issuing of the writ, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This programme includes, first of all, Finance Bill No. 2 implementing the provisions of the budget and which has to include, I am advised, Finance Bill No. 3 to implement the major tax reforms which the Government are introducing.  This is because of the radical nature of this tax reform, changing over, as it does, from the old system of tax allowances to tax credits, a very important reform indeed.  The tax allowance system, of course, gives a <Col N="2772" /> special advantage to people in higher tax brackets who may receive up to 60 per cent remission in respect of any allowance, whereas the tax credit system operates equitably.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Taoiseach made a big play about why the by-election should not be held but of course the real reason was that the message from the ground to the Government was that they could not have won that by-election.  When interrupted on that occasion the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>I was asked to give my reasons and I would like to give them.  The changeover to tax credits instead of tax allowances for the personal allowance aspect of the income tax code is very fundamental. Accordingly the implementation of that and of the associated payment of £9.60p to non-working housewives I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners could only be undertaken if legislation goes through in this Session.</P>
    <P>That legislation was circulated this morning in the form of the Finance (No. 3) Bill.  We cannot accept from day-to-day what we are being told by the Government. We think we have a pay settlement but we do not know because all we are told is through the media.  This is the best Government in modern times to slant stories to their own advantage.  Never have so many people been employed by a Government to do that.  The cost in a year of the special advisers, the press officers and information people, the clerical assistants, is somewhere in the region of half-a-million pounds, but when I asked a question I elicited the information that another £40,000 will be added.  What is it all leading to?  The Taoiseach told us that information on page 8 of <i>The Irish Times</i> today was as a result of a leak.  In an ungentlemanly way the Taoiseach tried to step aside from the blame, tried to put it on a secretarial assistant, of which rank I do not know.  His or her rank is neither here nor there &mdash; the responsibility lies with the Taoiseach, the Minister concerned. In other governments resignations <Col N="2773" /> have taken place for lesser breaches than that.</P>
    <P>This is another reason for lack of credibility in the Government.  I am sorry to have to talk in that vein.  As a community we have many problems to face.  I hope that in our short time in opposition we will assist the Government in a constructive way to introduce the measures necessary to deal above all with the greatest problem which exists, the problem of providing employment.</P>
    <P>We had pessimistic forecasts by the Tánaiste when the responsibility is his now.  He is running away from it.  The reason is that he wants to say to his right-wing colleagues and friends when the time comes: &ldquo;I told you so.  It was the fault of the Conservative Party that our unemployment figures grew.  It was because of a hard-line Minister for Finance and a hard-line Taoiseach that the Labour Party failed to deliver the jobs.&rdquo; Today we saw the appointment by the Labour Party of watchdogs in Departments where only Fine Gael Ministers operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>There are only bones left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>These are watchdogs to preserve a separate identity for a party who know the serious problems they are facing.  With his usual aplomb the Tánaiste announces the setting up of a group of people to act as watchdogs over the Fine Gael Ministers in case any measures are taken of which the Labour Party are not aware.  Their performance in the House today was disappointing. People realise now that the object of this Government is publicity, such as a leaked public capital programme for whatever purpose.  I do not blame any official in any Government Department.  They are all aware of the desire of every Minister for maximum beneficial publicity in order to project an image which is not a true one.</P>
      <P>Budget time is coming close to us.  The Minister promised the House in July that we would have Estimate debates during this term.  He did not achieve that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not blame him because at the time we pointed out that we must be realistic.  His position is consistent in that area with his position when he was in opposition.  There is no consistency in anything else.  He produced a discussion document which he said is of great urgency.  It is meaningless unless some of the better features can be implemented to the advantage of all of us.  I look forward to an opportunity to discuss this document and to consider seriously and favourably the better recommendations in it.  I warn him that many of the recommendations will lead to serious pitfalls and could be as harmful when introduced as they may appear helpful when made.</P>
      <P>During the week I said that in extremely difficult conditions the Minister for Labour and the Public Service worked hard to achieve agreement in the public sector.  I accept the point that it has not yet been finalised.  My understanding is that it has not yet been ratified. He worked hard to negotiate it, despite very serious difficulties.  The Taoiseach conveyed to me that I was a fine fellow to pay a compliment to the Minister for Labour.  I would compliment any man who was doing his best, and particularly in the type of situation in which the Minister found himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance knows, and he knows that I know, the difficulty the Minister for Labour had to face, not from the group of people with whom he had discussions, but among his colleagues, and particularly his Fine Gael friends at the Government table.  That is why I paid him a compliment.  The Taoiseach need not think the compliment was meant for himself or his Government.  It was paid to a man who had succeeded in resisting the efforts and the unrealistic dreamland ideals and objectives of some of the <Col N="2775" /> right-wing Ministers including the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances the Minister for Labour and the Public Service succeeded. The question must be asked: how far could he have gone towards achieving a national wage agreement some weeks ago?  I tried to get an opinion from the Government yesterday but I was refused.  The Government have a duty to tell us.  It seems that every original intention of the Government has been changed.  We had as the central theme of the Fine Gael election manifesto a downturn in inflation, and control of inflation.  Tonight inflation is at 23.3 per cent, the highest since the winter of 1975 when we also had a Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>We were told that middle-income groups would be restrained in their wage demands.  We were almost led to believe a wage reduction rather than a wage increase was coming.  When the committee on costs and competitiveness failed to get across a realistic figure, realism prevailed through the efforts of the Minister for Labour and the Public Service.</P>
    <P>I could go on and on.  The tax package was probably the greatest trick ever perpetrated on the Irish people.  It has already been seen to be that.  I was not surprised when I heard there were only 18,700 applicants for the £9.60 payment, despite intensive Fine Gael canvassing in many constituencies in the intervening weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is up to 30,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>And if the estimate of 350,000 who would qualify was there obviously there would be many more than 350,000 who would apply.  Therefore if there are 30,000 applicants after almost six weeks, beyond the first deadline set, that demonstrates how those reluctant housewives have now seen <Col N="2776" /> through the promises of June as being empty and insincere and they have thrown them back in the Government's face.  That is the position with regard to that tax package &mdash; it can be forgotten; it was a joke from the beginning, as the Minister himself was forced to admit. Indeed I felt sorry for him on radio on Sunday last, as would anybody listening to him, because basically he is a decent man.  It is terrible that there were architects of that package for whom he had to take the responsibility and the stick on Sunday last, people who did not do their homework or necessary research.  I remember the present Taoiseach on the radio news at 1.30 p.m. on the day that package was launched when he conveyed that there was no cost to the Exchequer at all.  He was being asked about the entire tax package but he was trying to divert his reply and say that in regard to the housewives £9.60, there was no cost involved, that there was merely a question of tax credit from one spouse to the other.  Of course, he was not being honest, if for no other reason than that there is a substantial administrative cost factor involved.  However, these are details we shall have an opportunity of discussing in great depth after the recess.  I do not wish to delay the House further because there are other Members wishing to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's contribution this evening was significant for its omissions of references, of worthwhile references, to some of the most serious problems facing us.  Yes, he referred to unemployment in a somewhat cavalier way.  On youth employment, let us say, he is at last realising that it constitutes a very serious problem for us.  Then there is the Government-fuelled inflation which, if there is to be a swing from direct to indirect taxation in the forthcoming budget, will only fuel it further.  I remember the words of a former Member of this House, a former General Secretary of the Labour Party, Mr. Brendan Halligan, who on election night said his only regret was that, during the election campaign, he had not said what he believed would be the effect of the Fine Gael tax package, that he did not give his honest opinion on television; in other words, a Government <Col N="2777" /> have come to power on a dishonest package.  Either they knew it could never be implemented, or they were misled by so called experts, one or the other; that was the explanation.  That is how they govern this country at present and our people are suffering in consequence.</P>
    <P>This evening the Minister mentioned agriculture.  We have heard of the impact of inflation on farmers' incomes.  There is no doubt that inflation has had a very severe impact on agriculture.  May I mention very quickly that this week's <i>Farmers Journal</i> carries a story about Government Ministers being prevented, because of pairs not being available to them, from going to Brussels and other places in Europe to fight for our farming community. Who sold that story?  Of course it was the people on the far side of the House.  You, sir, and everybody here knows that that is absolutely untrue, that if it is a question of Government business, Ireland's interest, of course they get pairs.  But such a story is sold deliberately to convey that the Government's problems are caused by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to dwell for some time on the expenditure on education, remark on some aspects of it and aspects of the attitude of the Minister for Education to his various Votes and to the expenditure in his Department.  The Minister is anxious to tell the House and the country that we are spending too much money and expects to be lauded when he says that.  The next speech tells us that Fianna Fáil did not spend enough money and he expects to be lauded for that.  He brought in Supplementary Estimates for expenditure on education and he decried Supplementary Estimates out of the other corner of his mouth, incidentally, Supplementary Estimates over the whole range of expenditure on education which amounted to less than 5 per cent of the total expenditure on education.  This lack of logic has not drawn comment from anybody, which surprised me.  The Fianna Fáil Government, in office, regarded expenditure on education as the prime, social expenditure.  It needed no apology; it was the only vehicle for social <Col N="2778" /> mobility for the disadvantaged; it was to be the life-blood of our economy.  We were convinced that, without a solid foundation and a solid super-structure, this country would not have the skilled personnel available for the future development of our economy.</P>
      <P>There is a good deal of confusion in the thinking of the present Government. I believe there are aspects of monetarism detectable in the statements of the Minister for Finance.  I know that this philosophy drove a Minister of Education, as he is called there, out of office in Britain when he fought it.  I would hope that the Government would take into account the very important, social aspects of education when deciding on expenditure for these Votes.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, when speaking about industrial expansion &mdash; I was not in the House when he commenced his speech &mdash; indicated that he was worried that expenditure on industrial development was not as productive of jobs as he would have liked.  Indeed, he mentioned that though much more money was being spent on industrial development&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the capital programme as a whole, not just the industrial part of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then, the capital programme as a whole &mdash; of course industrial development would constitute a substantial part of that &mdash; was not producing a commensurate increase in charges.  This is quite logical in the industrial field.  It is no longer a question of a few cheap sewing machines and lasts, as there used to be, say, in a shoe factory.  We are now in a position in which very sophisticated equipment must be bought for most industries in which we have made great progress in the last ten years, particularly in the chemical and electronics branch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I do not see why we should be applying criteria to a modern type of industry like that, criteria which obtained when we were dealing with labour-intensive industries in our industrial development in the past.  Put simply, the outgoing Government decided that, in view of the <Col N="2779" /> international recession, it was necessary to have a substantial capital programme, to have substantial capital expenditure so that we could not spend our way out of the recession but rather emerge with the least possible damage to our economy.  I do not think we should apologise to anybody for that because it means that our philosophy was to put people before book-keeping.  I know that one must keep an eye on expenditure and on inputs but if it comes to making a decision as between people and tidy, neatly balanced books, then the Government who come down on the side of people are the Government who in the end will command the respect of the community.</P>
    <P>I remember attending a meeting in the Royal Marine Hotel in Dun Laoghaire at a time when savage financial remedies were being applied to our economy by a predecessor of Deputy Bruton.  Coming from a part of the country which was bled by emigration from the middle of the last century I could not but have a feeling of helplessness as I saw the queues collecting and shuffling forward to the mail boat.  In saying this I am not being sentimental. Thanks to increased sophistication and better education, we have moved into a position where people expect development here and expect to live in this country enjoying a decent standard of living.  I know that our whole strategy has received some very sarcastic criticism from the Minister for Finance but in the end it will be seen that we followed the right strategy.  From straws in the wind, I think that the Minister for Finance and his colleagues are coming to the conclusion that some of their original schemes cannot be put into effect.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education believes that if you tell something which is at variance with the facts often enough some one will believe it.  He mentioned that he had made provision for 300 extra teachers in the 1981-82 academic year. Every year during the period of office of the Fianna Fáil Government we had extra teachers to improve the teacher-pupil ration and to provide remedial teachers. This was the first point in our programme for the general election of 1977 and we <Col N="2780" /> saw to it that we recruited enough teachers, trained here or in Britain or brought back into the teaching force, to have 300 extra teachers when all those who retired or decided to give up teaching had been replaced.</P>
    <P>A matter which has been the subject of questions in this House is expenditure on primary education.  Both the Fine Gael and Labour election documents indicated that they regarded this area as very important and social scientists had been saying for some time that if any extra money were to be allocated it should be to the primary sector.  From a reply I have received from the Minister for Finance, I find that as of November this year £17,324,000 was spent on primary school building.  If the Minister for Finance looks in the Book of Estimates he will see that £30 million was allocated by the previous Government for primary school building.  This was a very substantial budget allocation which was seen to be needed for the provision of new schools in developing urban areas, to replace 19th century schools in various parts of the country and for the repair and extension of existing schools.  In many of the former cases we built the schools ahead of actual requirements and I opened a number of schools on the outskirts of Dublin city which had 16 classrooms but only enough pupils to fill three.  We were dealing with the situation before a crisis developed.</P>
    <P>We knew in January 1981 that this budget would require very careful monitoring if we were to achieve what we set out to do and I asked my officers to put forward principles which would enable us to get the maximum benefit from this expenditure and to see that there would not be any unnecessary delay.  The first principle was the avoidance of all possible administrative delay.  There is a problem there because both the Department of Education and the Department of Finance have an input to primary school building.  I requested that pressure be brought on the Office of Public Works to handle cases faster and to communicate a sense of urgency to architects employed not by the OPW but by school managers. I also asked them to find a way of expediting <Col N="2781" /> cases at an early stage of planning. At that time there were 52 cases in the hands of the OPW.  Working drawings were in course of preparation for 24 of those and sketch plans for 28.  Today in the House the Minister for Education pretended that at that time we were somehow or other slowing the process but I do not think he has very much credibility because the man would say anything that came into his head.  I am simply indicating the steps we took to utilise fully the £30 million allocated for primary school building.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested in January this year that the assistant secretary in the Department should handle tenders and supply notes to me on each case.  I would have already approved the invitation of these tenders and it was arranged that the list of approved tenders would come to me without delay.  Approval of projects at working drawing stage was also to be speeded up and it was decided to ask the OPW to keep an eye on costs of small projects so that there would be no unnecessary delay.</P>
    <P>We had planned to spend the £30 million this year and we were asking the OPW to investigate the possibility of placing the completion of the work with external agencies if necessary in order to complete our programme.  I enlarge on that slightly because the Minister had the effrontery to come into the House today and to say at the end of 1980 my Department were far from interested in the provision of primary schools but were slowing things down.  The figures of expenditure for November were £1.9 million, for October £1.9 million, September £1.6 million and August, which is not a good month for building, £1.04 million. I am interested to know how the Minister will spend approximately £13 million in the month of December.  He did not address himself to this at all.  He simply started blaming his predecessor who had, with a sense of urgency, set about the programme of primary school building for 1981 last January &mdash; the right time to start.</P>
    <P>I do not know about the leaked document. I do not know what status it has <Col N="2782" /> and consequently the best thing for me to do is to ignore it.  If I am to believe the figures that will be made available to the Minister for Education for capital purposes, they will fall very far short, when 23.6 per cent inflation is taken into account, of the amount allocated for building purposes over all the range of services for 1981.  Perhaps the most scandalous, the most shameful act of the Minister for Education was to accept the proposal to forbid the primary schools to children at four years of age.  It was cleverly done in the sense that the new regulations did not come into effect until 1 October so that the children who were brought to the schools at the beginning of the academic year in September were not affected and the full effect of what was done would not be apparent to their parents and to the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>In fact, at the Government table the Minister has let down the primary school sector.  He has weakened the foundations of the whole educational edifice by his act.  Of course, the political consideration, the pay-off for the votes of two Independents, was to promise the provision of pre-school education.  In fact, it was &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; Kemmy and &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; Browne who announced the expenditure of £1 million on pre-schools, not the Minister for Education, the Minister for Finance, the spokesman for the Government, and not even the person who gave out the leaked document to <i>The Irish Times.</i> Deputy Kemmy and Deputy Browne mentioned this.</P>
    <P>The people who are interested in pre-school education reckon that it will take £4.5 million to provide the service for the four year olds which had been provided already in buildings built under supervision and with teachers who were trained professionally and trained with a view to teaching the first two-year module in primary schools.  I believe the Government will find that this was a false economy, that it was educationally harmful, socially harmful and that it will damage, in particular, the children from what are called the disadvantaged areas.  I would like to mention here that most of the talk is about disadvantaged areas in urban Ireland.  They exist.  In any instance I was <Col N="2783" /> asked, when Minister for Education, to allow teachers to remain in those schools because of the particular problems in them &mdash; I was asked this by many Deputies &mdash; I did so, fully conscious that the lessons from the Van Leer research indicated that this would benefit the children in those areas.</P>
    <P>We have had that debate in the House. The points were made that where the area was disadvantaged the extra stimulus is needed early on.  The research showed that the response to that stimulus was good: it improved the awareness and improved the quality of the education for the children involved.  There are also areas of disadvantage in rural Ireland.  If the transport system is damaged, as it will be, unless the rules are changed by 24/81, then there will be a need for pre-schools in rural Ireland.  I do not have to tell the House how difficult that will be.  I have not been able to get out of the Minister for Education or out of anybody else any straight statement whether such schools will be provided for rural Ireland and if they will be provided with school transport. If the schools are provided and school transport is not available, then they are no good and the system will not work.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the House to the problems of parents when both have to go out to work.  It was generally agreed that there were more of these for one reason or another, whether it was ideological &mdash; most of the people who can afford ideology will be able to look after themselves economically &mdash; whether it was of necessity or because of deliberate Government action in increasing the cost of living by 5.6 per cent in the budget of last July, the withdrawal of subsidies to mortagages or the general increase in the cost of living since the Coalition Government took over.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in some detail the Vote for capital expenditure on primary education. Will the Minister for Finance tell me what is the position with regard to the overall capital allocation for 1981 in all the Votes?  I have a reply from the Minster for Finance which indicates that, when the Fianna Fáil Government left <Col N="2784" /> office on 30 June last, of the £79.3 million allocated for capital purposes £35,267,140 had been spent.  Since then only about £27 million has been spent and the total spent at the end of November is £62,592,190.  I would like to know from the Minister for Finance, because the Office of Public Works covers part of this expenditure, if in fact there is a saving, and was it by his direction, in the capital budget.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to some of my pet projects, which I hope to see sustained. The Minister decided to continue my scheme for the provision of micro-computers for second level schools.  He will provide in his budget figures money for summer courses in 1982 to enable teachers to get the best use of these micro-computers, which were provided in accordance with the decision made by me as Minister and with the backing of the Government.</P>
    <P>There is a natural tendency for a Minister who takes over in the middle of the year to try to arrogate to himself all the credit for schemes already under way.  I am not in the childish games of claiming credit, but I think I have a right to set myself up as a monitor of the progress to be made in this area.  The Minister for Finance should look kindly on the Minister for Education when he comes looking for micro-computers for schools, seeing to it that the teachers are trained to use them and that they will be able to teach computer science at various levels. In primitive societies it is said that fear is the initial reaction to all significant change.  If our young people are familiar with computers and their uses early enough, they will have nothing to fear, even though we know socio-economic problems will arise from their use in the future.  We have had that at all stages in development since the Industrial Revolution.</P>
    <P>I am a little perturbed about the adult education programme.  The House will know I was responsible for a considerable advance in this area by providing 50 adult education organisers throughout the country.  Their job was to develop adult education, mainly through the agency of the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2785" /> Three of those people had special responsibility for the development of the Arts in Ireland.  I am basically suspicious about setting up committees to examine what is needed.  I regard that as a ploy.  Enough research about the need for adult education in Ireland has been done.  We know what has to be done and we are calling for action now.  The Minister set up a commission under the chairmanship of Mr. Ivor Kenny, a very competent man, but I have the suspicion that the Minister is long-fingering adult education.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the project for distance learning.  I had been in consultation with the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, RTE and the Open University in Northern Ireland to develop a foundation course in computer science to be followed, using the foundation course as a qualification, by a properly certified two-year course, ending in the award of a national certificate by the National Council for Educational Awards.  If it is a question of finance &mdash; and it is not a large expenditure &mdash; I urge the Minister for Finance to look kindly on proposals from the Minister for Education in this regard.</P>
    <P>The development of regional technical colleges was also a favourite project of mine.  Each one had been extended while I was Minister for Education.  I had made some purchases for the development of Kevin Street before I left office and had finally made a deal for Carriglea Park in order to provide a regional technical college on the east side of the city.  Tallaght, Blanchardstown and an area north of the river were on the stocks and negotiations were going on.  I trust the money will be available for this development, too.</P>
    <P>The School of Engineering at UCD also took up a great deal of time.  We seldom pause to realise that our universities produce technologists, unlike some continental universities where there are specific technological universities and some old universities do not allow technologists inside their doors.  That is their loss.  Our universities have been supplying technologists and the School of Engineering at UCD will be an engineering showpiece in western Europe.  I am convinced <Col N="2786" /> that no Minister for Finance would neglect funding this.  I intended to talk about the development of the National Institute for Higher Education and other third level organisations, but my colleagues want to contribute to this debate and I do not want to take up their time.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance mentioned agriculture.  I want to make a plea for what is known as the west &mdash; the 12 western counties.  We are not given to the béal bocht.  We have every right to ask that all those areas should be included under the severely disadvantaged areas scheme for the benefit of EEC grants. We know farm development schemes have been cut, the special western package negotiated by Deputy MacSharry when he was Minister for Agriculture has been slowed down since the change of Government and, for the purpose of reckoning grants, there has been a change in the counting of sheep and cattle to the disadvantage people in that area.</P>
    <P>We know the disadvantages from which we suffer.  We have a poorish soil which needs warming with lime and stimulation by artificial fertiliser.  We believe we have a very strong case for being included in the severely disadvantaged areas.  So far as the Minister for Finance is responsible, to back up what will be coming from the EEC, I would make a plea to him to push our case in the Council of Ministers as well.  I am afraid that some of the people in Government who talk about farming are thinking of points further east where the land is better and the farms are larger.  It is more difficult to see the smaller farms and the land of poorer quality.</P>
    <P>There is much more I would like to say on the Appropriation Bill but several other people wish to speak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard Deputy Wilson speak about shortcomings in this Department and in that.  It is well known that Fianna Fáil put the country on a course where £740 million was needed to fund commitments made in their January budget.  It is a pity the former Minister for Finance did not take his commitments into consideration when drawing up his <Col N="2787" /> budget.  It is amazing that he could be £740 million off target.  Perhaps, with the new electronic computer that is now installed in their headquarters, if they ever get a chance of drawing up another budget, they will not make the same mistake.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare were short £77 million to meet their commitments up to 31 December this year. Other Departments were short as follows: Department of Health, £47 million; the Department of Justice, £16 million; the Department of Defence, £11 million; the Department of the Environment, £35 million; the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, £14 million; the Department of Agriculture, £45 million; the Department of Transport and Energy, £87 million; the Department of Education, £10 million; the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, £19 million. That is a total shortfall of £740 million.</P>
      <P>The 1979 budget showed a deficit of £522 million which was over-shot by £233 million.  The 1980 budget showed a deficit of £547 million which was over-shot by £194 million.  The 1981 budget showed a deficit of £515 million which was almost completely absorbed in the first six months of this year.</P>
      <P>It is amazing that any Government who had a majority of 20 Members and were in a position to take unpopular measures allowed the country to drift to the verge of bankruptcy and to the verge of losing its financial credibility in the world.  In the last three years there has been no money for roads.  In Cork County Council we were working on a hairshirt budget.  We could not even get enough money to keep pace with inflation.  At the second last general election Fianna Fáil said that if they could not get work for Irish labourers on the county council roads they would dig holes in the roads and fill them again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The holes are there but we cannot fill them because the money is <Col N="2788" /> not available.  The money for housing was severely curtailed.</P>
      <P>We have had tenders lying for the last two and a half years in the Office of the Minister for Health for an additional ten bedrooms to Castletownbere Hospital and ten bedrooms to Bantry Hospital. The problem of geriatric patients is a major one throughout the country and it will have to be tackled.  In many cases old people would be adequately cared for at home if there was some contribution made towards their maintenance instead of admitting them to county or district hospitals.  The amount it takes to maintain geriatric patients in hospitals is outlandish and it would be much better if people could be compensated for looking after them at home.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Social Welfare has given a generous increase in the fuel allowance this year.  It is now £120 which is a one hundred per cent increase.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson spoke about the previous Government's policy on education. It is not so long since a Fianna Fáil Government adopted a policy of closing every one-teacher school in the country. Indeed some of the two-teacher schools were threatened with closure.  The children were conveyed to larger schools in buses and mini-buses.  Some of those buses are now a menace on the road and are not fit to be on the road.  There was a lot to be said for the small local schools. They produced good scholars and good people.  That Fianna Fáil policy was a very bad one.  However the Coalition Government reversed that decision and the one and two-teacher schools have now been saved.  Some of those school buses are now ten, 11 and 12 years old and no provision has been made for their replacement.  This is something that will now have to be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago the county health boards were abolished and regional boards established.  It is accepted widely now that that was not a wise move.  I oppose regionalisation strongly because it is a move away from the human element and in addition regionalisation results in a situation that is unwieldly and <Col N="2789" /> unworkable.  We must ask ourselves whether we are getting value from the colossal sums of money being spent by the health boards.  Are the boards providing for the people the service that should be provided?  The cost of being transported to hospital by ambulance is now extremely high.  If, say, someone from Schull or Berehaven had to be taken to hospital in Cork, a return distance of 100 miles, his bill at 55p per mile would be more than £100.  This is a very severe imposition on anyone but that is the sort of bill that such a person would have to meet if he were not the holder of a medical card.  In such circumstances can we be said to have streamlined the service or that we are providing a better service for the people?  This situation needs to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear previous speakers say that the farm schemes suffered some cuts.  We all know why there had to be cuts.  There was a shortfall of £45 million last June in the Department of Agriculture and this money had to come from somewhere.  The position was so bad that had it not been for the change of Government there would have been a collapse of the TB eradication scheme and of the many other schemes operated by the Department while An Foras Talúntais would probably have been forced to close.  However, the new Minister for Finance launched a rescue mission on his coming into office.  At long last we have a Government who are prepared to face up to their responsibilities and who are putting the country back on its feet.  Our economy at that stage could have been likened to a ship listing but it was rescued by the Minister who restored it to safety.  We all know that everything cannot be put right overnight.  In this case the patient, being the national economy, is very sick.  It is still in the intensive care unit.  Some time will be needed to get it out of that danger and in that context we must have foresight and proper planning in addition to what I would regard as genuine leadership.  Those of us who live on the south western seaboard know only too well how difficult it is to attract industry to the area.</P>

I was very interested in what Deputy Sheehan had to say about the ship listing during the term of office of the previous Government. My way of conceiving what has happened now is that the ship has been taken out into deep water and scuttled and is about to sink without trace.  Anything I have witnessed so far has indicated that to be the situation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sheehan referred, too, to capital investment but I would remind him that in this year alone capital investment was increased by 36½ per cent to £1,700 million principally for productive purposes.</P>

      <P>Deputy G. Mitchell also helped me considerably today.  The Minister for Finance talked about deliberate under-estimation. Since I am referring here to social welfare I will give the reply that the Minister for Social Welfare gave to Deputy G. Mitchell today.  That was that the January 1981 Estimates for the Department did not under-provide for charges known to have existed at the time of the approval of the Estimates by the then Government.  On the question of the social policies of the Government, we are talking of Scrooge-like policies.  We know that the Government were reluctant to give to social welfare beneficiaries the double week's pay which is provided for in this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste said here that these people had got an increase in October to offset inflation and he asked was that not sufficient.  We did not interrupt the Minister while he was speaking so perhaps he would continue reading his book.  He is bound to find these remarks unpalatable.</P>
      <P>They also gave no extension and no improvement in the autumn double week.  Those who are on unemployment assistance for over a year deserve consideration. There is a genuine problem here which should be faced and tackled.  I appreciate different groups might have to be segregated, but it should have been tackled this year.</P>
      <P>The evidence of this is also in the breakdown in the Eastern Health Board of the footwear scheme.  It is the first Christmas for generations that children will go barefoot in Dublin.  I checked today on the emergency measures taken since we raised this matter last week and, despite them, there will still be children who will go barefoot.  I thought we might have to see a re-introduction of the Herald Boot Fund.</P>

      <P>It is under the administration of the Government.  They have the power and the money.  It does not matter where the slip-up is.  There are 4,000 applications which were affected by the embargo, there was an administrative mix-up and the scheme just did not work. There was a great effort made to try to get some shoes out before Christmas &mdash; and I appreciate that effort &mdash; but the Government should not have allowed this situation to develop.  There is a 50 per cent increase in demand this year and a 50 per cent increase in eligibility.  Let that sink in.  It means that there are more people below the poverty line.  It is reminiscent of the old days when the shilling was taken from the old age pensioners. The Minister should read Paddy Crosbie's book.  He would find it very interesting in relation to the poverty which existed here previously.  We face another terrible problem of an increase in unemployment to 134,000, and that figure is growing.  The Tánaiste says he has no optimism in that regard.</P>
      <P>I heard an ordinary housewife say that there was always a catch with the Coalition Government.  It is a very interesting phrase.  One must read the fine print when dealing with the Coalition, and read it very carefully.  The advertisement said that nine out of ten housewifes would benefit from the payment of the £9.60. The catch in this case is that the husband pays for its administration.  There are very few housewives applying for this benefit.  The latest figure is 16,000 to 19,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to speak about children's allowances. This is one of the most scandalous steps taken by this Government.  In the last two years, and it is included in this Appropriation Bill, Fianna Fáil increased children's allowance by 30 per cent, the <Col N="2793" /> same was promised for 1982 and the £195 child tax allowance is there.  Fine Gael and various people who are associated with them promised an augmented child benefit scheme of £3 per child per week. We now know very clearly that those families will lose the children's allowance and the child tax allowance.  This will be a disaster for middle income families.  It was foretold by the Taoiseach; he did not try to hide that fact.</P>
    <P>If we compare the 30 per cent for next year, which Fianna Fáil would have given, with the Coalition promise for 1 July next, which will be included in the coming budget, it is clear that all, except those on either minimal tax or those with one child on 25 per cent tax, will lose. This means that the middle income group will lose very substantially.  The bigger the family, the more you lose.  That can be clearly seen in many instances.  There are approximately 40,000 children over 18 years of age in respect of whom the child tax allowance will be lost.  The bulk of these are in third level education.  The figure of 40,000 was given to me in reply to Question No. 684 by the Minister for Finance on 16 December 1981.  That is a very interesting figure, and not many people realise the extent of the problem. The parents of children over 18 will lose the £195 while they are in full-time education. Taking all children into account, the total clawback on the £195 will be about £50 million, which is a very useful figure for the Exchequer.  I hope Deputy Sherlock recognises what is going on subtly under the surface.  This is a shameful attack on families, and I ask the Minister for Finance to leave the £195 allowance for those in third level education.  The Exchequer will gain from this development.</P>
    <P>Question No. 745 was answered on 15 December.  This told us that, assuming you get an increase in children's allowances from 1 July, the first six months of next year would be the same under the Fianna Fáil scheme or the augmented child benefit scheme.  The second six months would differ because Fianna Fáil would have allowed £73 million for the second six months and the augmented child benefit scheme would cost £94 million. <Col N="2794" /> Under the Fianna Fáil arrangement the tax allowance would be there for those working and that would be £50 million.  There would be £12 million of that left, because presumably it would not go until after July.  That means the total cost to the Minister for Finance for children's allowances would be £179 million under the Fianna Fáil schemes and £162 million under the Fine Gael scheme &mdash; a direct Exchequer gain of £17 million. That is in a year when some of the tax allowance is still there for half the year. In a full year that tax allowance would be gone and there would be a bigger gain to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I am concerned whether, in view of recent statements by the Taoiseach and some of his Ministers, the pattern established by Fianna Fáil of real improvements in social welfare benefits will be maintained.  It has become clear that a 25 per cent increase in social welfare benefits will be necessary in the coming budget.  I have read that the ICTU have said that in the circumstances at least that percentage increase will be necessary with inflation running at slightly more than 23 per cent.</P>
    <P>The cost of that kind of increase from 1 April next &mdash; I have the information from a written reply given to Question No. 677 would be £203 million, and if we take an additional £17 million for the same increase in children's allowances, we get a total of £220 million.  Without an increase in unemployment, which would throw more on social welfare benefits, the Minister must find £220 million extra next year, without including about an additional £50 million to cater for more unemployment.</P>
    <P>Where will this money come from? Will it be from general taxation, direct or indirect?  We have been told that the direct taxes are to be reduced, by how much remains to be seen.  Indirect taxes already have been increased substantially and we assume they will be increased further.  Let us look at the PRSI.  The PRSI contribution currently is 4.75 per cent up to a maximum of £8,500, without a charge above that income.  If we put together the different proposals of the Minister, we find that for next year the <Col N="2795" /> contribution will be 7.25 per cent on all incomes.  This is getting through to the workers now.  If we add the probable increase of 25 per cent in social welfare benefits, the extra contributions from workers which would be required to meet the cost &mdash; the information was given in a written reply to Question No. 743 on 15 December &mdash; it would mean a 3 per cent increase in PRSI, presumably to be divided between the employer and employee.  That brings us to a position in which already we have a contribution of 7.25 per cent and we are talking in terms of another 1 per cent for all employees, making the contribution 8.25 of all incomes.  Therefore, the Minister for Finance will have a considerable headache because of the problems which to a great extent he has created for himself.</P>
    <P>A book has been published called <i>One Million Poor.</i> It indicates that early in 1981 that was the situation in Ireland, and there is not much doubt that there will be as many as 1½ million poor before this Government complete their policy. The Taoiseach agrees with this, because recently he said the middle income group must bear the burden of the increases. The Fine Gael policy is one based on levies and indirect taxes like VAT.  The sufferer will be the single breadwinner with a family.  Such families are the heaviest consumers.  They have to pay transport costs and to buy food and clothes and all the other things.  That is the kind of economy the Government have created and it will bear particularly heavily on single income families.</P>
    <P>Today we have seen that the CPI has gone up considerably.  I know the Government do not like to be told these things.  They have lost their way in the maze of their policies.  They are not sure of where they are going.  They miscalculated the effects of their policy, and the middle income group are their sacrificial lamb.  The poor also will be poorer. Fianna Fáil protected the social welfare section and the poorer families during the recession.  Now those people are exposed to the full impact of right-wing Fine Gael policy.  We will oppose vigorously all these policies.  It was a mistake <Col N="2796" /> on the part of the Government not to have allowed for a proper Adjournment Debate.  It has deprived backbenchers of an opportunity to speak.  It is a bad precedent.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I wish all the Members of both Houses and the staff a happy and enjoyable Christmas.  Although I said such things about the Minister, I hope he will enjoy his Christmas and relax over the break.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make three points only.  Number one relates to pensions. Though I am aware some change has been made in the system of pension payments to CIE workers, I want to point to the injustice of paying £14 a week to a person who had given 40 years' service. That must be changed radically.</P>
      <P>My number two point refers to health. Is it right that when hospitals are understaffed, institutions catering for the sick and the aged, doctors under the GMS can appropriate for themselves incomes of between £35,000 and £40,000?  The fact that fewer than 40 per cent of the people have full eligibility means that there is widespread abuse of the scheme.</P>
      <P>My third point relates to agriculture. People are beginning to talk very loudly about the massive capital injections in agriculture in all forms, subsidies and grants-in-aid.  It is a shocking indictment of our whole agricultural policy that in a country which is supposed to be agricultural we spend £638 million annually on food imports, all of which could be produced at home.  It is not being produced because the land is not being worked. This trend needs to be changed.  From discussions with the farming community I know that farmers have been badly advised by our agricultural advisers.  We must have a proper agricultural policy. With the large number of people unemployed a situation will arise whereby farmers working up to 40 acres must be grant-aided.  It is the producer who should be subsidised and not the product.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that it has taken so long to have this question raised.  I understand the Ceann Comhairle's problem with regard to the number of questions which have been raised on the Adjournment in the past few weeks.  I also regret having to bring in the Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to debate the subject matter of Questions Nos. 50 and 51 of 8 December 1981.  In Question No. 50 I asked the Minister if his Department would provide auto-manual services at Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim, when the area became automatic.  That was coupled with another question I put down asking the Minister the plans his Department have for the deployment of staff when Carrick-on-Shannon exchange goes automatic. I felt that the two questions should not have been taken together, but the Minister had the privilege of doing that. In his reply the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Operator services will be retained at Carrick-on-Shannon on an interim <Col N="2798" /> basis after automatic service is introduced in the area.  The volume of operator-assisted traffic there will, however, be greatly reduced under automatic conditions and there will, therefore, be a substantial reduction in the number of staff.</P>
    <P>Day staff who become surplus to requirements when the exchange is converted will have the option of transferring to another exchange or resigning. Staff who opt to resign will be paid compensation and transferred staff will be paid a resettlement allowance. Night staff are recruited locally for specific exchanges and are mainly part-time. It may be possible to offer a small number of them employment elsewhere. Other night staff will be paid compensation.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the exchange is scheduled to have digital equipment we are told a number of those telephonists will be retained at Carrick-on-Shannon. I should like the Minister to explain to those telephonists how many that number will be.  How many of the present 77 day-operator staff will be retained at Carrick-on-Shannon?  With day staff of 77 and night staff of approximately 25, the post office in Carrick-on-Shannon is one of the town's main employers.  The withdrawal of the manual exchange will mean a loss in income to that area in the region of £12,000 per week.</P>
    <P>We all appreciate the efforts being made by the Minister, and especially the efforts made by his predecessors, to provide automatic telephone services.  For an area such as this a loss of 100 jobs at one time is a severe blow.  Could the Department relocate some section in Carrick-on-Shannon to employ some of the staff who will become redundant? The number to be retained at Carrick-on-Shannon may be as low as ten or even five.  It is unfair to expect the staff of that exchange to live in a wonderland until it becomes automatic, which is scheduled to happen in about 18 months' time, in the expectation that they will retain their jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised a deputation from the staff and the local chamber of <Col N="2799" /> commerce that he would consider their position favourably.  I wish he had the courage to tell them what the position is: how many will be retained and what he intends to do with the balance?  The balance of the staff will face grave problems. If they have to move away from Carrick-on-Shannon this will create even greater social problems in one of the most underdeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister might consider decentralising one section of his Department which might be in a position to employ those people.  Would his Department consider making available a training programme for the people who will become redundant?  Most of the girls in exchanges went to work direct from school.  Their only training is in the operation of a switch board.  When, due to redundancy, they are forced to seek other employment in their mid-twenties or early thirties, they are faced with grave problems.  Possibly they will be classed as unemployable due to the fact that they have only the one skill.  The Minister might consider providing a special type of clerical course which would be suitable for them and give them a better chance of being reemployed in the area.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said those who become redundant will receive redundancy pay.  Does the Minister realise how much that is?  Possibly he was shocked when I told him the rate of pay negotiated for redundancy will be on the basis of six weeks' pay for every year of service. Some of these people are married and depend on their income to pay their mortgages. We heard a great deal about mortgage repayments in the House during the past week.  The redundancy pay being offered is totally unrealistic.  The Minister should consider giving them redundancy payment at the rate of at least 15 weeks per year of service.  Most of them will be forced to seek employment elsewhere which will be much less lucrative than the work they were trained to do.</P>
    <P>The Minister said some of the staff will be deployed to other exchanges.  Does he realise what the resettlement allowance is for those who are forced to move from one exchange to another?  Perhaps he <Col N="2800" /> intends to send some of them to Bantry where there is to be an auto-manual exchange.  The rate of compensation for movement such as that is £610.  That is totally unrealistic compared with what people in this city got for moving down the street from one office to much better accommodation.  He should offer them a realistic rate of redundancy and resettlement allowance.  The Minister also said he told the deputation that if it were physically possible to retain a local exchange in Carrick-on-Shannon, as an interim measure, to facilitate the people in the locality, that would be looked at. He did not say how long he hoped to be in a position to keep them in employment. This contributes £11,000 to £12,000 per week in salaries and wages in the Carrick-on-Shannon area.  The Minister should examine the possibility of making available some other type of employment there within his Department to cater for those who will become redundant.</P>
    <P>Another thing that worries me is the fact that some of the engineering staff at present employed will become redundant or will be forced to move away from the area.  I say that because it is digital equipment which will be used in the new automatic exchange in Carrick-on-Shannon which, when something goes wrong, may necessitate only the substitution of a piece as small as a Lego brick.  That type of replacement will not merit the employment of a large number of engineering staff.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell us now what are his intentions with regard to the staff. He should not make any vain promises or offer unrealistic redundancy payments or relocation allowances.  Many of the female staff there are married with heavy financial and family commitments.  If they are made redundant, the type of redundancy payment being offered will not in any way meet their commitments whether they be mortgage payments or whatever.  A large number of the staff there are unemployable.  The Minister well understands that problem.  I hope he is prepared to take the necessary action to alleviate the hardship that will be imposed on them.  I am led to believe that <Col N="2801" /> the maximum redundancy that can be paid would be the equivalent of two years' full service pay.  Perhaps the Minister could enlighten me on that aspect. If that is the case, let us take the case of somebody who started as a telephonist at the age of 17, who perhaps now has reached the age of 32, such person will merit the maximum redundancy payment. If the Minister considers that to be fair, then I think he should reconsider the position.  I contend that such people should be granted at least 15 weeks' salary per year of service, with no limit up to five full years' pay.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell us truthfully what are his intentions with regard to the Carrick-on-Shannon exchange.  He should tell us how many of the staff there will be retained when the exchange becomes automatic.  He should tell us howlong the Department intend to maintain an auto-manual exchange in Carrick-on-Shannon, whether he is prepared to examine the possibility of increasing the rate of redundancy pay and re-settlement allowance.  It would indeed be a sad day for Carrick-on-Shannon if such a large number of their work-force were forced to move from the area. I have made a number of suggestions to the Minister, including the possibility of examining a retraining programme for those people who may become unemployed.</P>
    <P>If the Department do retain an auto-manual service at Carrick-on-Shannon what facilities will be available to the users of that system?  No doubt the Minister will be in a position to tell us what will happen to the type of auto-manual exchange that may remain in Carrick-on-Shannon, if any.  I say &ldquo;if any&rdquo; because the Minister has said he would give sympathetic consideration to the position of the telephonists in Carrick-on-Shannon. However, I believe it is the Minister's intention to leave no auto-manual exchange there.  If he does intend to leave an auto-manual exchange there, then he should tell us for how long he proposes to do so and the number of people who will be employed on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2802" /> On the day the questions were raised in this House the Minister did not tell us what were his intentions.  He said he would give the position of the employees sympathetic consideration.  He said also that transfers would be provided for of a number of staff to Sligo.  He should tell us this evening how many staff could be accommodated in Sligo.  It is not fair to leave people not knowing what the future holds for them.  Rather we should be frank and honest, tell the people of Carrick-on-Shannon what is in store for the future of the telephone exchange there.  The Minister must tell us what he intends doing <i>vis-à-vis</i> the future of this exchange because I have already stressed the importance of that telephone exchange to employment in the area.  For example, we should be told whether the Minister or the Department have any proposals for the provision of employment of the same nature, perhaps through the decentralisation of some small part of the Department to Carrick-on-Shannon.  Here I have a number of suggestions to make.  For example, consideration could be given to the relocation of the accounts section for telephones to Carrick-on-Shannon, a proposal which would enable the deployment of the total staff that may become redundant in Carrick-on-Shannon. I hope the Minister has sufficient foresight to ensure that this area does not lose anything more with regard to employment.</P>
    <P>Therefore the Minister must tell us frankly what are his intentions with regard to the exchange at Carrick-on-Shannon, how many staff will be employed there in the years 1984, 1985 and 1986.  Equally he must tell us how many of the staff may become redundant and who may be offered accommodation in Sligo.  He should tell us as well whether he will consider the relocation of a section of the Department to Carrick-on-Shannon to provide employment for the people who will be unable to find alternative employment if and when they are made redundant.  The Minister has within his power the relocation of even the accounts section with regard to telephones, at present situated in the GPO, <Col N="2803" /> and which would be sufficiently large to deploy the number of people who may become redundant.  Those people can be trained to carry on the work necessitated by the operation of that section from Carrick-on-Shannon.  I am asking the Minister to tell us what he intends to do about the staff.</P>

      <P>I agree with anybody who thinks that a special case should be made for a town like Carrick-on-Shannon and I only wish that Fianna Fáil could have matched in government the concern they are showing in opposition.  All the questions now being asked were asked of this Minister's predecessor and the answers then given were most unsatisfactory and very few.  I brought a deputation of people from Carrick-on-Shannon to the present Minister and they stated clearly that he was the first Minister to give them truthful, straight and clear answers.  They expressed satisfaction with his attitude and were convinced that he knew their problems and was concerned about them.</P>
      <P>I also accompanied deputations to the Minister's predecessor about alternative employment and opportunities in Carrick-on-Shannon but Fianna Fáil did not seem to have the sort of care in government that they are showing now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Harte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would clear up one point first.  It seems that the Department are being played up as the big bad wolf in this matter and nothing could be further from the truth. Every community throughout the country which has a manual telephone service has been strongly pressing the Department to provide them with an automatic service and to do so quickly.  None of <Col N="2804" /> them, to judge from the pressure on the Department, can get automatic service quickly enough and, having had a manual service in my own area until quite recently, I can understand that pressure. I feel the pressure every day of the week from places in Donegal that have not been converted.</P>
      <P>Carrick-on-Shannon has not been an exception in this respect.  There has been pressure over a long period to provide automatic service there.  Now that it is in sight, the pressure is being exerted by Deputy Ellis to keep operators there.  I say to him that he had better make up his mind in purporting to speak for the people of Carrick-on-Shannon whether they want an automatic service or not.</P>

      <P>I have held the position of Minister of State for almost six months and Deputy Ellis has not once spoken to me about Carrick-on-Shannon, although he has written to me.  Deputy McCartin, Deputy John Connor, Senator Reynolds, the Minister of State in the constituency <Col N="2805" /> and the Minister himself have concerned themselves about this and we have been in contact almost daily with people in Carrick-on-Shannon.  Until this week Deputy Ellis has not shown any interest. I know that during the general election campaign he made a promise to the telephonists in Carrick-on-Shannon that if elected he would guarantee their jobs, and the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Reynolds, refused to guarantee this.  Where is Deputy Reynolds tonight?  He has been very vocal during the past few weeks on everything dealing with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Unfortunately the former Minister of State, Deputy Killilea, is in hospital and cannot be here but where is Deputy Reynolds?  He is missing because he could not support Deputy Ellis.</P>
      <P>We have taken a decision to give an automatic service in Carrick-on-Suir, something which the previous Government refused to do.  As the automatic service is extended throughout the country we must pay the price for this progress and unfortunately this means redundancies, whether Fianna Fáil or this Government are in power.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ellis is the most alarmist young Deputy ever to come into this House.  He has said that engineers will be transferred because of the digital exchange in Carrick-on-Shannon.  Does he want a digital exchange in Carrick-on-Shannon? Is he saying that there should not be a digital exchange there? The most modern and advanced technology for telecommunications is the digital service and I would love to have it in the constituency I represent.  I wonder whether Deputy Coughlan would object to a digital service in Donegal town.  Of course he would not.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ellis is crying crocodile tears.  He did not have the courtesy to come and talk to me about the people about whom he is now crying.  This is the greatest display of hypocrisy I have ever witnessed in the House.  We are not forcing people into redundancy but are giving them options.</P>

      <P>Each telephonist is being given a choice to retire or to stay in the service.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs will tolerate on over-staffing of telephonists to prevent redundancies. If everyone in Carrick-on-Shannon asks to go to Sligo it will be very difficult but by the law of averages that will not happen. I recognise the human dimension of this problem and I met the girls who came here to speak to me.  They wanted to know exactly what the score is and they did not interrupt me as Deputy Ellis has done.  We talked about the matter and they know the situation.  If the Deputy talks to them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>They should listen to their deputation.  Deputy Ellis talks about redundancy payments.  Is he suggesting that he knows more about the affairs of telephonists in Carrick-on-Shannon than their trade union representatives who negotiated the terms of redundancy and transfer allowances?  They did this job very thoroughly over several years and I was very much involved towards the end in this particular settlement and I pay tribute to the way it was handled.  Everything was done by consultation and negotiation and I have not yet heard a telephonist say that she is not satisfied with the redundancy payment offered.  I know they would all wish to stay in their jobs but that is not possible and they recognise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2807" /> Deputy Ellis wants to know if the Department will retrain them but that is not the job of the Department.  However, we have put it on record that if agreement can be reached nationally with all the trade unions involved anyone who wants training for any other aspect of the service will be given very sympathetic consideration and the Department would approve it but there are difficulties which are beyond our power to solve.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that 25 per cent of the operator-assisted calls go to Northern Ireland and Great Britain and approximately half of the calls made through operators are from telephone coin boxes.  We will have pay phones installed in the entire State before 31 March next.  Then we will move into a programme of converting coin boxes in hotels, guest houses and other places like that.  We can see the predicaments in reaching a stage when we can dial automatically to Northern Ireland and Great <Col N="2808" /> Britain, dial automatically on the international circuit and pay phones which take away all that traffic from telephonists but the people want a modern automatic service and I make no apologies to Deputy Ellis for providing this.  I can tell Deputy Ellis, if the people he purports to represent approach me with a reasonable request it will not be pushed away from me without a hearing.</P>

        <Col N="2463" /> My Department has no plans for a place of detention or special school for young offenders in the Cork area.  As far as the Department is aware the existing facilities for boys in the State are adequate. Finglas Children's Centre (a remand and assessment unit and a special school for first offenders); Scoil Ard Mhuire, Lusk, which caters for more serious offenders; St. Josephs Special School, Clonmel, which caters for more long-term committals. In addition the new secure school for boys at a cost of approximately £2,500,000 (building alone) is at present under construction at Lusk to cater for more serious offenders in the 12-17 age range.</P>

      <P>The outdoor education centre has been provided at Gartan Lough with financial assistance from the Department under the national programme for the provision of recreational facilities.  This development <Col N="2464" /> is based on the reconstruction &mdash; renovation of an existing building situated on the shores of Lough Gartan in the Lough Veigh Estate.  The project is sponsored at local level by County Donegal Vocational Education Committee which is responsible for the management and maintenance of the centre.  A grant of £68,500 was allocated towards this project &mdash; £63,500 has been paid to date.  Of the £68,500 made available £51,500 was allocated from Employment Guarantee Fund moneys and the balance of £17,000 was provided from the Department's voted funds, Vote 33, Subhead A. Recently I was happy to allocate a further grant of £22,000 towards equipping the centre.</P>
      <P>The question of the appointment of staff to outdoor education centres, including Gartan Lough, County Donegal, is at present under consideration in my Department and I would hope for progress at an early date.</P>

      <P>The service has been operated with a large CIE bus since 16 November 1981. The Deputy will appreciate that the school transport scheme is operated to facilitate eligible pupils only.  At the commencement of the current school year, it was considered that all the eligible pupils could be carried in the smaller (contractor's) vehicle.  However, having considered all the circumstances of the case, including total benefit conferred and relative costings, I decided to sanction the restoration of the service as it operated up to last summer.</P>

    <P>Children are diagnosed as autistic by health board psychiatric services and their care and treatment are generally provided in a medical setting.  They receive their education in common with other handicapped children in special schools which are recognised as national <Col N="2466" /> schools.  Under the Rules for National Schools handicapped children may continue in attendance until the end of the school year in which they have reached their eighteenth birthday.  Most of the special schools provide appropriate programmes for pupils up to that age.</P>
    <P>My Department are prepared to sanction appropriate programmes for autistic children up to the age of 18 years.  Decisions in regard to the age at which children leave school are, however, made by the boards of management of the school concerned.</P>
    <P>The provision of training services for autistic young persons when they leave school is a responsibility for the health authorities.</P>

      <P>The decision to close the National Library at 9.00 p.m. instead of 10.00 p.m. has been taken by the trustees in consultation with the director.  Regard was had to the considerable falling off in numbers using the library after 9.00 p.m. and to staff representations about difficult city-centre environmental and transport conditions.  The Saturday opening hours remain unchanged.  At present, the numbers using the library after 9.00 p.m. frequently drop below 15.</P>
      <P>I am having the terms of your question brought to the attention of the trustees for their consideration, and would be very desirous of ensuring that the library service was fully adequate.</P>

Due to the restricted nature of the existing school site, a site extension will be necessary.

The pupils in the area reside very close to Castlehackett national school and at a relatively long distance from Belclare.  Having regard to the numbers in question and the considerable cost involved, the Department considered that it was necessary to review the transport routes to Belclare national school from the general area.  However, subsequent to representations from Deputy John Donnellan and the Deputy asking the question today, I decided to restore for the present the particular route to which reference is made in the question: i.e, from Gurrane, Carheens, Caherlea areas, while the question of accommodation at Castlehackett school is under examination.</P>

      <P>Doohamlet is in the Ballybay catchment area for junior cycle pupils and free transport is available to that centre.  Pupils who attend school in another catchment area may as a special concession be allowed free transport from the nearest pick-up point inside the catchment boundary of that area.  The transport service from Doohamlet to Castleblayney encroached on the Ballybay catchment area and it has been necessary to curtail the service to the catchment boundary at McLarney Cross.  Those pupils who have been availing of free transport on the scheduled CIE bus service to Castleblayney are allowed to continue to do so.</P>
      <P>The school authorities in Castleblayney and CIE were advised of this decision on 11 May 1981.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>The position regarding mentally handicapped adults attending vocational training and workshop centres is that their transport is in the first instance a responsibility of the health boards.  This position was clarified in an official letter addressed to the authorities of special schools with training centres and/or workshops and/or day care centres attached, in May 1981.</P>
      <P>These adults are facilitated on school transport services on a concessionary basis by using such spare accommodation as existed on these services after the requirements of the eligible school-going children, who are my responsibility, are met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A delay was caused in the allocation of spare seats to these adults by the necessity to determine precisely the requirements of the eligible school-going children. I am not satisfied that this constitutes a satisfactory basis of service to the mentally handicapped adults involved and I have instituted discussions with the health and other relevant authorities with a view to securing a more satisfactory arrangement.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme, this service fell due to be withdrawn in summer 1980 and the board of management was so advised in July 1980.  As a special concession it was decided to extend the service until the end of the school year 1980-81.  One bus, instead of the two formerly used, was found to be sufficient to operate the special services from east and west of the school.  The service from the east had to be curtailed to some extent as it was encroaching on the area of Ballinderry national school, from which objections had been received.</P>
      <P>As far as my Department are aware, all children eligible for free transport to Cummer national school are being catered for by the revised arrangements.

    <P>As a general rule free transport facilities are not provided for children in the Dublin metropolitan area.  Children attending post-primary schools in this <Col N="2478" /> area are accommodated on ordinary CIE scheduled services and must pay the appropriate fare.  A special subsidy is being paid to CIE which enables the company to keep the fares of school children up to 16 years of age at a lower level than the ordinary half fare.  On reaching 16 years however a pupil availing of CIE scheduled services to and from school is obliged to pay full adult fare.</P>

      <P>In accordance with section 14 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, where gaming is carried on under licence no player may win more than 50p in each game.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Síochána have instructions to take a particular interest in the <Col N="2486" /> enforcement of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, with special attention to the use of gaming machines operating above the legal maximum limits allowed for stakes and payout.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that in the Dublin Metropolitan Area there were 44 prosecutions for breaches of the Acts in 1980 and 22 prosecutions in 1981, up to the end of October.  I should add that a number of prosecutions stand adjourned at present in the District Court awaiting the outcome of a case stated to the High Court.  Over the years there has been a recurring problem of District Court prosecutions being delayed on the basis that decisions in similar cases are pending in a superior court, but it is hoped that the problem may be eased in the future as a result of instructions which have recently been issued by Garda Headquarters to members of the Force about legal steps to be taken to counter applications made by defendants for adjournments in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the Garda have my full support in their efforts to eliminate abuses of the gaming laws.</P>
    <P>I have received various proposals for the amendment of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, some of them concerning the maximum stake and prize money.  I am examining all of these proposals but I am not yet in a position to say what recommendations I will be making in the matter.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that, while there are undoubtedly heavy demands on Garda resources in the Ballymun sub-district, it is not true that the Garda there are having difficulty in responding to requests for assistance in circumstances of the type referred to by the Deputy.  The authorities also say that the Garda at Ballymun have not received any complaints from the public recently of failure to respond to such requests other than a phone call made by the Deputy on behalf of a resident of the area in response to which the Garda promptly contacted the person concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2488" /> As the Deputy will appreciate, the detailed deployment of members of the force is a matter primarily for the Garda authorities.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Government had no proposals to have a 24-hour service at Malahide Garda station.  Indeed no Government make proposals in these matters which are essentially the concern of the Garda Commissioner.</P>
      <P>A Dáil Question on this matter tabled by Deputy John Boland was answered on 8 April 1981.  The following is an extract from the reply given on that date by my predecessor:</P>
      <P>Malahide Garda station closes at 1 a.m. each night, including week-ends. The Garda authorities have indicated that the present opening hours of the station have been so fixed as to enable the station party to carry out the maximum amount of outdoor police duties, while maintaining an adequate office service.  They consider that an extension of the opening hours would not be feasible at present having regard to the current strength of the station party but the matter is being kept under review.</P>
      <P>During the course of the recent general election and only six weeks after Deputy Boland's question a letter from my predecessor issued to Deputy Burke on 20 May 1981, which said, <i>inter alia:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You will be glad to hear that the <Col N="2489" /> matter has been reviewed by the Garda authorities and, taking account of the proposed increase in the strength of the Force which I announced last week, it will be possible to provide for the opening of Malahide station on a 24-hour basis very shortly.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the recruitment is going full steam ahead and in spite of the fact that the present Government have increased expenditure on the Garda by £31.3 million this year, the factual position in relation to Malahide is that the Garda authorities propose to open Malahide Garda station on a 24-hour basis as soon as practicable but it would not be feasible to do so at present having regard to the current strength of the station party.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances the letter issued by the then Minister for Justice to the Deputy during the course of the general election would appear to have been erroneous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the present law could be described in the way the question implicitly describes, it could also be described as a law that gives a privilege to women who are married to Irish citizens which it does not give to men who are married to Irish citizens.  I understand that the history or background of the provision favours this latter perspective.  For instance, the United Nations Convention on the Nationality of Married Women, which was being drafted at the time of the enactment of the 1956 Act and which this country has ratified, provides for specially <Col N="2490" /> favourable procedures for the naturalisation of married women.</P>
      <P>Having said that, my attitude is that I favour equality of statutory rights in this matter and I am having the matter examined on that basis with a view to making recommendations to the Government.  I should, however, make it clear that a number of options other than that implied in the question are possible within the framework of a policy based on equality.  In deciding which of those options I should recommend, account will of course have to be taken of a number of factors, including international norms.  For that reason, and because any proposal to amend the citizenship laws will probably give rise to suggestions for other amendments as well, it is likely to take some more time to deal with the matter than might at first sight seem necessary, but I will give it as much priority as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>I am deeply conscious of the fact that there is concern generally, and especially among parents, about drug abuse.  The Garda authorities share this concern and are giving a great deal of attention to the prevention and control of this problem. Question No. 132 refers specifically to heroin.  The Garda are aware of the growing availability of heroin in this country and take a serious view of this trend.</P>
      <P>I propose to outline some of the measures being taken to deal with the drug problem in so far as the Garda Síochána are concerned.  Permanent drug squads have been established in Dublin and Cork for a number of years and earlier this year a permanent squad was established in Limerick.  As I announced recently, the strength of these squads has been substantially increased and it is reasonable to expect that the increased manpower will bring about a significant improvement in the prevention and detection of drug abuse.  Additionally a special investigation unit drawn from the serious crime squad at the Garda Technical Bureau has been set up to monitor and investigate drug trafficking into the State.</P>
      <P>A unit has also been established at Garda headquarters to co-ordinate efforts for better detection and prevention techniques, to compile information on statistical trends, substances and methods of distribution and to direct action accordingly.  The unit also maintains close links with other agencies, both here and abroad, concerned with the control of drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greater emphasis is being placed on the training of gardaí to deal with drug abuse, and advanced training courses are at present in operation at Garda headquarters. The objective of the courses is to provide in each Garda division substantial numbers of members trained in the latest techniques of detection, prosecution, monitoring, surveillance and <Col N="2493" /> prevention.  I should mention that drug investigation is included as part of the standard induction training of every member of the force.</P>
    <P>The number of break-ins at pharmacies and similar premises is a matter of particular concern.  I was in touch with the commissioner in regard to this matter and he recently circulated instructions to the force aimed at counteracting this problem. Among the measures to be taken are a review of security at such places by crime prevention officers.  The Garda authorities expect that if pharmacists and hospitals carry out recommended security measures this would reduce considerably the availability of drugs on the illicit market.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are, of course, keeping the drug abuse problem constantly under review.  I should make it clear, however, that the problem is not simply a police matter.  The misuse of drugs is, I believe, primarily a social problem and other agencies and, most importantly of all, parents, have perhaps an even greater role to play than the Garda in combatting this problem, which is at the heart of so much human misery.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that my collegue, the Minister for Health, is reviewing the law in relation to penalties for drug-pushers who, in my view, must be seen as &ldquo;lepers&rdquo; even among the criminal community.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether it is his intention to provide a Garda station on the eastern side of Galway city, in view of the three industrial estates and the two banks which are located there and of the Garda concern that such a station be provided as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>A team of officers of the Garda Síochána and the Department of the Public Service are engaged in an examination of how Garda manpower resources throughout the country can best be organised so as to provide the most effective police service possible.  It is proposed that the policing arrangements in Galway and certain other large provincial centres will be examined in the near future and the question of providing a Garda station on the eastern side of Galway city will be considered <Col N="2496" /> in the light of whatever recommendations are made as a result of the proposed examination.  It is hoped that the examination of the position in Galway will be carried out early in 1982 and decisions on whatever recommendations emerge will be made as soon as possible afterwards.</P>

      <P>The White Paper referred to by the Deputy set the 31 August 1981, as the latest date for submitting views to my Department on the proposed community service orders scheme.</P>
      <P>Publication of the White Paper afforded an opportunity to individuals and groups who profess an interest in penal reform to influence the Government's thinking on the question of community service.  Regrettably I have to say that the response to the White Paper, in terms of the number of individuals or groups who responded, was poor.  Only half a dozen groups submitted views.</P>
      <P>A Bill dealing with community service orders is currently being drafted and will be submitted to the Government for approval in due course.</P>

      <P>The answer is in the form of a tabular statement, which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2497" /> Following is the statement:</P>
    <P>First of all I have to explain that a visa is not a permission to take up residence but rather a qualified permission to enter the country either for a single visit or for visits at any time within an expressed period.  Visas are not required by citizens of a large number of countries.  Those countries are listed in the Aliens (Amendment) Order, 1975, (S.I. No. 128 of 1975). Whether or not an alien has a visa he is obliged on arriving in the State from any place other than Northern Ireland or Britain to obtain leave to land from an Immigration Officer.  There is no immigration control on entry to the State from Northern Ireland or Britain.</P>
    <P>Persons born in Northern Ireland or <Col N="2498" /> Britain are exempt from all controls on aliens.</P>
    <P>The available records show that in the last five years</P>
    <P>(a) 22,000 visas were approved but a breakdown by nationality is not available,</P>
    <P>(b) 1.6 million aliens received leave to land in the State,</P>
    <P>(c) 1,029 citizens of EEC countries (other than citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies) were issued with a &ldquo;Resident Permit for a National of a member State of the European Communities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The records also show that at the end of each of the last five calendar years the following were registered as resident aliens (i.e. as residing here for three months or more):&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">Return of Aliens registered as being resident on 31st December 1976 &mdash; 1980.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities than only two incidents of assault on young people in the area were reported to them in 1981.  The incidents, which were not connected, took place in October 1981 and each involved assaults on two youths.  Four persons have been convicted in respect of one of the assaults and the second incident is still under investigation.</P>
      <P>Special crime patrols already operate in the area and the local gardaí are satisfied that the situation does not require the introduction of any additional special Garda measures but the position will be kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the possible decentralisation or regionalisation of the Land Registry is under consideration in my Department at present.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree that there are undue delays in processing applications in the Land Registry.  The main registration work of the Land Registry is in the area of dealings in registered land, where the volume of applications this year is expected to be about 88,000.  The average time taken in processing those cases is now less than two months.</P>
      <P>Delays occur mainly in applications for first registration or where complex legal issues arise which often involve extensive correspondence with solicitors.  However, these applications represent in volume only about 5 per cent of all applications for registration.</P>
      <P>The Land Registry also issues about 135,000 copy maps, copy folios, copy instruments and land certificates annually.  The average time taken for the issue of copy maps is nine days and in the case of copy folios, copy instruments and land certificates, less than one week.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will amend the regulations which provide that a person under 21 years cannot obtain a loan from a local authority; and if he will reduce the qualifying age to 18 years, as all persons of that age are entitled to vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem that arises in relation to the refusal of finance institutions and local authorities to provide loans for persons under the age of 21 years stems from the Infants Relief Act, 1874.  Under that Act a contract for repayment of a loan by a minor is declared void.  This is part of a wider question that is usually referred to as the age of majority.  The Law Reform Commission, in a recent general report, indicated that a draft Bill on that subject is now under preparation and I would assume the Bill will cover the matter referred to by the Deputy.</P>

This station is to be replaced as the accommodation there is <Col N="2505" /> inadequate to meet Garda needs and the station site is too restricted to allow for the necessary expansion.  It is the advice of the Commissioner that the new station which is to be built should be located closer to the South Hill area and, with this advice in mind, the Office of Public Works is at present trying to acquire a suitable site.  Negotations are in fact in progress in relation to a particular site and, if these turn out to be successful, the new station will be considerably closer to South Hill.</P>

      <P>Figures of slaughterings and live exports and the result of the livestock censuses point to the existence of illegal cross-Border movements of cattle, but while the movements appear to have been fairly substantial it is not possible to give any precise estimates of the kind sought.  Following discussions between representatives of the Commission, the UK and my Department, arrangements have been made by the UK to intensify control measures at certain key points in Northern Ireland.  Cattle presented for slaughter will be specifically examined for traces of southern ear tags and Northern Ireland ear tags will be destroyed to prevent them from being re-used.  These developments should help to improve the supply situation for the Carrigans and other meat factories here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under EEC rules it is not possible to impose restrictions on the export of live cattle.  In the case of exports to third countries refunds on live cattle and carcase beef have been equalised for some time.  Efforts are continuing to have refunds on boneless beef set at a similar level so that the Community export refund system will be neutral in its effect on the various forms in which beef is exported.</P>
      <P>As regards intra-Community trade, the monetary compensatory amount system is by and large favourable to trade in carcase beef and even more so to boneless beef exports.  In spite of this the vast bulk of our exports to EEC countries consists of carcase beef.  This suggests that factors such as undue reliance on traditional markets, high overheads in the boning industry and lack of marketing enterprise generally are responsible for the imbalance rather than Community arrangements.</P>
      <P>In the long run, however, the basis for increased employment in the meat industry must be an increase in cattle production. The Government's policy is aimed at affecting such an increase on a significant scale.</P>

      <P>The decision to confine this years compulsory warble fly eradication scheme to certain counties and part counties was taken on the basis of the relatively high level of warble infestation in these areas as revealed in the May 1981 returns of warble incidence in all counties.  This line of approach was agreed in prior discussions with the main farming organisations and was in accordance with advice from the Advisory Council on Animal Health and Disease Eradication.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that, on a similar basis, County Donegal was exempted from compulsory measures last year.  On the basis of reports received from the A.I. stations involved, all the indications are that the scheme has been a success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Exports of seed potatoes have fallen in recent years because of such factors as increased costs of production and competition from new varieties in the traditional export markets.  In the current season exports have also been affected by adverse weather conditions during harvesting and by the high prices obtainable on the ware market.  In an effort to increase seed production Irish Potato Marketing Ltd. have for some years been offering growers higher prices than those available on the export market, the company being enabled to do this with the help of a stabilisation fund built up in earlier years.</P>
      <P>In order to help the development of the industry and particularly the export trade a sum of £¼ million has been provided by the Exchequer this year.  This sum has been allocated between Irish Potato Marketing Ltd and Donegal Potatoes Ltd.  In addition, my Department has been having discussions with representatives of these companies and the growers and will continue with them to explore every practicable possibility of promoting increased production and exports.</P>

      <P>The Government's proposals for restoration of farmers incomes through the reduction of inflation, the expansion of farm output and various aid measures, are set out in detail in the Programme for Government, 1981-1986.  Under the programme sheep headage rates in the disadvantaged areas have already been increased up to the maximum allowable under EEC Directive 75/268, as amended and some 90 per cent of these higher grants have been paid to date.  The total of headage payments to cattle and sheep owners under the disadvantaged areas schemes will amount to £37.5m in 1981 compared to £28.4m in 1980.  This represents an increase of £9.1m or 32 per cent in direct payments of headage grants to farmers in the west and mountain areas in the current year compared to last year.</P>

Less than 1,700 farmers out of the total of 94,000 benefitting from the headage payments will receive less for 1981 than they received for 1980 because of the extension of the maximum limit to include sheep payments. On the other hand, sheep producers generally are benefitting very significantly from the substantial increase which I made in the sheep headage rate. To give an example, a farmer with 100 ewes and 15 adult cattle will receive £1,402 under this year's schemes compared to £952 last year and to £1,102 under the 1981 headage rates announced by the previous Government.</P>

      <P>Recent consultations with the <Col N="2544" /> British authorities have revealed the general position of the transfer of prisoners to Northern Ireland.  This is that persons with Northern Ireland associations, who commit offences in Britain as members, or in support of organisations engaged in terrorism, should not expect to be returned to Northern Ireland to serve their sentences.  However, according to the British authorities, each request for a transfer to a prison in Northern Ireland is carefully examined.</P>

      <P>The decision to close the Border crossing at Letter Bridge on the Pettigo-Belleek road was taken by the British authorities on the basis of security considerations as they saw them and it can only be reopened with their agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully aware of the difficulties caused to local residents in Border areas as a result of road closures.  While the decision whether or not to reopen this border crossing is ultimately a matter for the British authorities, the question of this and other closures of cross-Border roads is kept under constant review and the need to have them reopened as soon <Col N="2548" /> as possible has been frequently impressed upon the British authorities.  In this regard the Deputy's suggestion concerning the possible resiting of the security post at Boa Island in Northern Ireland will be borne in mind.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the cost to the Irish taxpayer of maintaing Border security. The efforts to prevent terrorist acts by organisations such as the Provisional IRA and to ensure that people who carry out such acts in Northern Ireland do not escape into this jurisdiction place a large burden on the Garda Síochána and the Army.  Such efforts must and will continue to be made, and the cost arising will have to be borne by the State.  Considerations of sovereignty obviously preclude the Deputy's suggestion that another power should be in any way concerned in the fulfilment of the duty of the State to maintain security and civil order.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the reason the report on the current Anglo-Irish studies, as presented on 11 November 1981 to both Houses of the Oireachtas, in dealing with citizenship rights, makes no mention of the Prevention of Terrorism Act as applied in Britain and under which close on 5,000 persons have been arrested and detained for up to seven days without any charges being preferred; and if he agrees that, since the Act is being applied in a racialist manner to Irish persons only, it constitutes a source of discrimination against and infringement of the human rights of Irish persons resident in or visiting Britain.</P>

      <P>While the terms of reference of the Citizenship Joint Study Group did not specifically mention the Prevention <Col N="2550" /> of Terrorism Act, aspects of that legislation were discussed in the group and paragraph 49 contains an implicit reference to certain provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>We understand that the purpose of this Act is to deal with terrorism occurring in the United Kingdom and connected with Northern Ireland affairs and the fact of the matter is that the major part of the serious terrorism in Britain today derives from the Northern Ireland problem. Since the enactment of the British legislation in question, successive Irish Governments have been fully conscious of their right and duty to provide consular protection for Irish citizens in Britain.</P>
      <P>Pursuant to their concern in this matter, my Department attaches the highest priority to efforts to ensure that the legislation is applied in an equitable and sympathetic manner consistent with established civil liberties and that abuses are avoided.</P>

      <P>The industrial promotion programmes of the Industrial Development Authority for the cities of Dublin and Cork and of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company for Limerick are geared towards the creation of much needed employment with priority being given to the areas of greatest need.</P>
      <P>Since 1979 the IDA have been pursuing a special programme of industrial development for Dublin inner city which includes the purchase of 34 acres of land and the construction of 430,000 sq. ft. of factory space at various locations.  The aim of this programme is to provide 4,000 new jobs in the inner city over the period 1978-1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1980, the inner city group was established comprising representatives of various Government Departments and Dublin Corporation, to further the development of Dublin inner city.  This group, which has been provided with a budget of £1.25 million is under the aegis of the Minister for the Environment who has primary responsibility for urban renewal. The IDA are considering proposals for the establishment of a craft centre in the Cork Inner City area.  SFADCo has developed a new &ldquo;Workspace&rdquo; concept for Limerick inner city where both services industry and small manufacturing industry are being encouraged to develop their activities in a centralised environment with specialist advice available on <Col N="2555" /> marketing, production techniques and business management provided by SFADCo.

      <P>The initial ten locations were based on the IDA's assessment of their suitability for the location of international service industry projects and the need to ensure the widest possible regional dispersal.  In this regard, Limerick has been chosen as the initial location in the mid-west region.</P>
      <P>I would add that Ennis will benefit from the promotion of the Shannon Industrial Estate as a base for international service industries through the recent extension of the 10 per cent manufacturing tax to new service projects which will contribute to the development of the airport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would think that, given the encouraging results over the past few drilling seasons, the level of interest within the exploration industry at present in the Irish offshore and the number of wells I would expect to see drilled over the next few years, the general prospects for a commercial oil find offshore Ireland are quite good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the most immediate prospect for a commercial discovery would appear to be in the Porcupine Basin off our west coast where significant flows of oil have been tested over the past four drilling seasons.  However, further drilling will be necessary to determine whether an accumulation large enough to <Col N="2557" /> support commercial production is present in the basin.</P>
    <P>Until a detailed exploration and appraisal drilling programme has been completed it is not possible to make a meaningful estimate of the value of any find as this will depend on the size of the discovery, its location, the production system used, the price of oil and the economic situation prevailing at the time. However, any commercial discovery would obviously have the potential to be of very significant benefit to the economy.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 308 and 309 together.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the premises at Oranmore previously occupied by Galway Concrete Limited now in liquidation.  Prior to the appointment of the liquidator in April 1981, the IDA had been endeavouring to have the business of Galway Concrete taken over as a going concern.  On the appointment of the liquidator the IDA in conjunction with the liquidator made further intensive efforts, without success, to secure a take-over that would enable the business to be resumed.</P>
      <P>I understand that because of the failure of the efforts to have the business taken over, the liquidator, who was appointed by the High Court at the instance of the shareholders, is at present disposing of the plant and machinery.  The buildings and site are, however, available for another industrial project and the IDA are endeavouring to secure such a project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the financial burden that connection to the electricity supply may entail for some applicants.  I recently asked the board to review their policy in regard to cost of connection. Accordingly the ESB have adopted a new policy whereby they will now pay 50 per cent of the cost of connection to supply. In addition, a scheme of deferred payments also operates whereby connection costs may be spread over a five-year period.  I believe that the board have gone as far as can reasonably be expected at present in subsidising the cost of connection of electricity supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to rural electrification generally the ESB have informed me that about 99 per cent of all rural householders are now connected to electricity supply. Quotations by the ESB for installation of electricity are directly related to the cost of making supply available.  As costs can vary greatly from location to location and depend to a great extent on <Col N="2562" /> the distance of the house from the nearest supply point, the ESB for some years past have been carrying a significant portion of the cost of connection.  In fact, since 1946 almost £100 million has been spent by the State and the ESB on rural electrification schemes.</P>
    <P>There is also a subsidised electrification scheme under the Programme for Western Development.  In this connection I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his question of 28 October 1981, as reported in Volume 330, Columns 653 and 654 of the Official Report.  Under this scheme, grants of 80 per cent of the capital cost of connection of electricity supply are available to farms in the West of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Under the Housing Regulations, 1980, as amended, house improvement grants under the former scheme are not payable unless all the relevant works were completed and a claim for payment was received in my Department on or before 30 June 1981.  It was also a condition of these grants that, on or before 21 January 1980, the works had commenced, materials had been purchased or a contract had been entered into for the carrying out of the works.  Persons complying in this regard ought to have had sufficient time to have the works completed by 30 June 1981&mdash;a period of over 17 months.

      <P>Block grants are allocated to county councils to supplement the provision made by the councils from their own funds for the improvement, maintenance and management of main roads, other than national roads, for improvement works on county roads and for traffic management works including such works on national roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of factors to be taken into account in determining the annual allocation of block grants.  Regard must be had to the overall levels of road activity in each county, including the financing of major improvement works on the national roads and special grants made available for exceptional works. County Limerick, as well as other counties, has benefited from such grants as occasion demanded.  It is not correct, therefore, to suggest that road mileage is the only criterion in the assessment of grant allocations.  Furthermore, the <Col N="2572" /> Deputy will be aware that in the normal course, each road authority receives in each year a total allocation in road grants commensurate with the overall level of funds made available for these purposes. For my part, I will make annual allocations on the most equitable and practical basis having regard <i>inter alia</i> to the general factors which I have outlined.</P>

    <P>I take it that in referring to &ldquo;bog roads&rdquo; the Deputies are referring to non-public or accommodation roads serving bogs. Subject to the provisions of the Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Act, <Col N="2579" /> 1968, and to general guidelines laid down by my Department, it is open to county councils to construct or improve such roads with the aid of whatever funds may be allocated to them under the local improvements scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the Turf Development Act, 1981, a scheme of grant assistance is being administered by Bord na Móna on behalf of the Minister for Energy under which financial assistance may be provided, <i>inter alia,</i> towards the cost of access roads to privately owned bogs.</P>

When approval issued to the planning of this headworks scheme it was on the understanding that every effort would be made to ensure that the group potential in the area to be served would be developed to the full.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals currently before my Department for a Stage 2 mains extensions scheme.  Such extensions would be proper to be undertaken by group development, aided by the local authority, where necessary, for the provision of increased pipe sizes.</P>

Kerry County Council were subsequently requested to submit the revised documents on 23 June 1981 and these are awaited in my Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if he will ban the export of foxes because of their scarcity for hunting and because of the possibility of this important species becoming extinct; and if any representations have been made to him by concerned bodies, including masters of foxhounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Cavan-Monaghan):</i> There is no scientific evidence available to me to suggest that the fox is in danger of extinction.  Since August 1979 my Department have been monitoring the export trade in fox skins under a licensing system and there are no proposals at present to ban such exports.</P>
      <P>Representations have been received from, on the one hand, bodies, including some masters of foxhounds, concerned about the protection of the fox and, on the other hand, from farming interests who point out that the fox is a pest and should not be protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): No species of flora or fauna which occurs in Ireland could be said to be in danger of extinction.  However, to ensure that native wildlife species would not become so endangered, the Wildlife Act, 1976, and various orders and regulations made under it have protected certain species against exploitation.  Protected species include all wild birds, with the exception of 12 common pest species, 18 species of wild animals and 52 species of flora.</P>
      <P>While there is no formal school involvement in the wildlife conservation programme, some university students from appropriate faculties are employed periodically in connection with the monitoring and other studies of wildlife carried out by my Department according as conservation requirements dictate.</P>

Both the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the ESB continue to take <Col N="2604" /> all available supplies of non-spruce species. However, such supplies are limited, but research to date on the treatment with preservatives of spruce species for use as transmission poles has been quite successful and has resulted in the two agencies mentioned placing orders for spruce poles on a trial basis.</P>
      <P>Research is continuing with a view to establishing comparative production costs for treated spruce poles and traditional non-spruce poles.  This will help to determine the potential for increased use of spruce and resultant higher degree of import substitution.</P>

It has always been the practice that the choice of boatbuilder is a matter for the fisherman concerned. The board, however, encourage, as far as possible, the use of Irish boatyards for fishing vessel construction and repair.</P>
      <P>In the past four years approximately 95 per cent of new vessels financed with assistance from BIM were built in Irish yards.  Only in exceptional circumstances are vessel improvements or repairs carried out in foreign yards.</P>

      <P>The salmon hatcheries have a total annual capacity of over 5 million ova and the brown trout hatcheries can produce over 3 million ova each year.  A large proportion of this production is reared to a more advanced stage before release into our rivers and lakes.  The Electricity Supply Board plan to expand its salmon rearing facilities in coming years so as to produce an additional one-and-a-half million smolts a year for re-stocking.</P>

While the scheme has not yet resulted in a major improvement in the quality of the water in the lake, I am assured that the effects of this slurry removal are becoming apparent and it is hoped that, weather permitting, the lake's water quality will improve considerably in the coming months.</P>
      <P>As to the future of Lough Sheelin, the Central Fisheries Board will continue to develop the lake as a brown trout fishery by means of restocking and predator control. The objective is to restore the lake as one of the premier trout fisheries in Europe.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any restrictions on hip operations or other operations at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranebraher. However because of the increasing demand for hip operations over the past few years waiting lists for this procedure have built up.  These are being dealt with as quickly as possible. To meet the situation two additional orthopaedic surgeons have been. appointed to the hospital over the past few years.  The Southern Health Board have also submitted a proposal to provide a new operating theatre suite at the hospital, which will have four operating theatres, to replace the two existing theatres.  It has not been possible to allow this scheme to proceed in view of the limited resources available, but it will be considered again having regard to the capital funds available in 1982 and the priority the health board attach to it at the time.</P>
      <P>An application for additional back-up staff for the hospital is under consideration, but the question of the appointment of such extra staff would depend on the availability of funds for new posts next year and to the priority the health board attach to these.</P>

      <P>My Department do not allocate funds for specific projects such as this. Assistance for such developments is a matter for the health boards, in this case the Eastern Health Board.  However, the position at present is that the board's capital allocation for 1981 has been fully committed.  The question of whether assistance can be provided for the project in the coming year will depend on the funds available to the board for capital purposes and the priority rating of this particular project in relation to other similar developments in the board's area.</P>

      <P>This nursing home was approved <Col N="2611" /> under section 54 of the Health Act, 1970 from 1 December 1978.  Subventions at the approved rate have been payable since then for not more than 17 persons at any one time in need of regular nursing care.  An application for the approval under section 54 of 33 extra beds in this nursing home was considered in consultation with the South-Eastern Health Board who are responsible for the health services in the area.  However, it was not possible to approve of this application in view of the fact that it appears that health board accommodation together with existing approved accommodation in private nursing homes in the area is adequate for needs.</P>

      <P>I understand from the health board, who are responsible for the health services in the area in which this nursing home is located, that they consider that the 12 beds in this home approved for subvention purposes under section 54 of the Health Act, 1970, together with other long stay accommodation in the area, are sufficient for existing needs.  In fact, the health board indicated that there is now no waiting list for one of their large long-stay institutions in the area.  I would therefore not be justified in approving further beds in this nursing home for subvention purposes.</P>
      <P>In any event, no extra private nursing home accommodation is being approved under section 54 at present owing to the existing financial constraints.</P>

      <P>Private dentists have been participating in substantial numbers and this has brought about a considerable and welcomed improvement in the availability of services.  I would naturally like to see them involved in greater numbers especially in areas where the level of participation has been low.</P>

      <P>At present, cases requiring orthodontic treatment are being accepted by the Dublin Dental Hospital only where the treatment required is of a type suitable for the purpose of training dental students, which is the primary function of the hospital.  In such cases, initial assessment, the taking of impressions and x-rays and the preparation of a diagnosis and a treatment plan takes on average eight to nine months from the date of the patient's referral to the hospital.  After completion of this process there is usually a waiting period of 12 months before treatment commences.</P>
      <P>The hospital also has a number of cases on hands where the treatment required is not suitable for student training purposes. The hospital's consultants deal with a small number of these outside their teaching functions.  Because of the circumstances under which they are dealt with patients in this category may have to spend lengthy periods, of the order of four years, on the waiting list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mrs. E. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason to be dissatisfied with the standard of dental care provided in Ireland generally.  I would however like to see dental services provided by health boards more readily available to all eligible persons.  Substantial improvements in this respect have resulted since the introduction of the arrangements enabling treatment to be provided by private dentists.  An increase in the number of private dentists participating in the arrangement would further improve that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty of recruiting sufficient numbers of dentists to fill health board vacancies has been a major factor affecting the availability of services.  There are however indications of improvements in the recruitment situation and the position should improve further when a new grade structure for health board dentists is fully <Col N="2620" /> implemented.  Considerable improvements will be made in the orthodontic services when five orthodontist posts approved have been filled.  I have also approved of the creation of five posts of oral surgeon and the filling of these will make a significant contribution to raising the level of services.</P>
    <P>The preventive aspects of dental care are of great importance since dental diseases are most amenable to preventive measures.  Fluoridation of water supplies is, of course, the most effective and efficient method of preventing dental caries. This must, however, be accompanied by education of the public in regard to the steps necessary to achieve dental health. Dental health education is an ongoing process which is being carried out by the public dental services, the Dental Health Foundation and the Health Education Bureau.</P>

      <P>The areas in which discrimination against women exist in the social welfare code are in relation to the entitlements of married women.  A lower rate of unemployment benefit, disability benefit, invalidity pension and occupational injuries benefit is payable to married women, other than married women who are living apart from and not being supported by their husbands, than to other beneficiaries.  A further discrimination in the case of the unemployment benefit scheme is that the duration of the payment of benefit to such married women is limited to 312 days as against 390 days generally.  In the case of unemployment assistance the conditions under which married women can qualify are more restrictive than those applied to other categories.  In relation to all benefits the conditions under which married women may qualify for increases in respect of dependants are different from those applying to other claimants.</P>
      <P>An EEC directive adopted by the Council of Ministers on 19 December 1978 provides for the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security.

      <P>County borough councils, urban district councils and town commissioners are empowered to operate free school meal schemes in their areas and 44 of them do so.  Of these 26 supply milk as part of the meal.  In addition, the county councils of Counties Cork, Kerry, Galway, Mayo and Donegal operate schemes in specified Gaeltacht areas of those counties but none of these county councils includes milk in the meal.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for each local authority to decide whether milk should be supplied under the schemes and the arrangements for its supply; 50 per cent of the cost of the food supplied in the meals is recouped to the local authorities out of my Department's vote.  Under an EEC Council Regulation part of the cost of milk up to a maximum of 0.25 litre for each child per schoolday is paid from Community funds.  This subsidy at present is approximately 10p per pint.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of claiming the subsidy the local authorities furnish returns to my Department of milk supplied to the schools and in 1981 the amount recouped from the EEC is expected to be about £250,000.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Minister for Agriculture is at present examining proposals prepared within the dairying industry for the introduction of a milk supply scheme outside the ambit of the school meals schemes.</P>

      <P>The person concerned had been in receipt of disability benefit from 13 September 1978 to 17 October 1981. At that stage payment was stopped as a final certificate was received indicating that he was capable of work.  Subsequent inquiries at the hospital, where he is a patient, have established that the final certificate was in respect of the claimant's brother who was also a patient in the hospital.  The position has now been rectified and the arrears of benefit due from 19 October to 12 December 1981 issued on 3 December.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 13 May 1981 and was paid from 16 May 1981, fourth day of incapacity.  All disability benefit and pay-related benefit due to 11 December 1981, date of the latest medical certificate received, has been issued.</P>
      <P>He was paid disability benefit at the maximum rate appropriate to a married man with four qualified children, to 28 August 1981 and at the rate appropriate to a married man with five qualified children from 29 August 1981 onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statutory position regarding payment of pay-related benefit is that the total weekly amount of flat-rate disability benefit in payment plus pay-related benefit cannot exceed a person's reckonable weekly earnings in the tax year relevant to his claim.  The claimant's reckonable earnings in the income tax year (1979-80) relevant to his claim averaged £88.70 a week.  Initially he was entitled to pay-related benefit at the weekly rate of £24.45 which together with the flat rate payment of £64.25 brought his total weekly benefit to £88.70.  As his weekly rate of flat-rate disability benefit was increased from 29 August 1981 for the additional child and again from 5 October 1981 when the 3 per cent increase in rates became effective the weekly rates of pay-related benefit were reduced by corresponding amounts to comply with the afore-mentioned provision.  At no stage however did the combined total of flat-rate <Col N="2641" /> benefit and pay-related benefit fall below £88.70 a week.</P>
    <P>Payment is made on receipt of medical evidence of incapacity in my Department. The medical certificates, however, are being received from the person concerned at irregular intervals and payment of benefit follows the same pattern.</P>
    <P>If he would arrange to forward the medical certificates immediately on their receipt from the certifier it will be possible to have payment issued more promptly and more regularly.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 547, 548 and 549 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comparable data under the headings sought are not readily available.  Tax statistics do not correspond fully with National Income and Labour Force Survey <Col N="2649" /> statistics.  Moreover the coverage of PAYE statistics is incomplete.  It must also be borne in mind that tax receipts in any year may be distorted by various factors.</P>
    <P>As regards income tax, receipts in respect of farming profits amounted in 1980 to 2.5 per cent of total income tax receipts.  It should be noted that, arising from a change in the due dates for payment of income tax, the income tax paid by farmers in 1980 represented one-and-a-half years' tax.  The corresponding figure for income tax collected through the PAYE mechanism was 86.7 per cent. This figure is not the same as the tax paid on the wage and salary income of employees. In 1978-79, the latest year for which data are available, income tax paid on the wage and salary income of employees accounted for 74 per cent of total income tax receipts whereas PAYE receipts in that period accounted for 87.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>With regard to incomes, incomes from self-employment and other trading income in agriculture in 1980 amounted to almost 10 per cent of national income while wages, salaries and pensions are estimated at 72 per cent of national income.  The CSO figures for income in agriculture include income earned by persons who may not be classified as farmers and on the other hand do not take account of other income earned or received by those classified as farmers. The wages, salaries and pensions figure is based on National Income data as comprehensive information on the wage and salary income of PAYE taxpayers is not available from tax statistics.</P>
    <P>With regard to the workforce, the 1979 Labour Force Survey showed that farmers represented 12.8 per cent of the total labour force and that employees accounted for 69.2 per cent.  As has already been pointed out on a number of occasions, simple comparisons between proportions of national income received, and income tax paid, by different sectors is fraught with difficulties, the main ones being that national income includes income which is not subject to income tax but which may be subject to other taxes such as corporation tax and that PAYE <Col N="2650" /> income tax yield covers more than the tax paid on the wage and salary income of employees.</P>

      <P>Grants from the European Regional Development Fund are paid as a reimbursement of national expenditure incurred on approved projects, and the amounts received are applied to increase the overall level of investment under the Public Capital Programme.  Since the programme is not broken down into sub-regional figures, it is not possible to identify what proportion of receipts were applied to projects in Connacht-Ulster.</P>
      <P>Receipts from the fund amounted to £8.5 million in 1977, £11.1 million in 1978, £25.5 million in 1979 and £46.4 million in 1980.  These amounts represent the following percentages of the Public Capital Programme in each year: 1.28 per cent in 1977, 1.39 per cent in 1978, 2.54 per cent in 1979 and 3.65 per cent in 1980.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service the number of authorised civil service posts in each Government Department or Office on 1 January each year from 1970 to 1981 and the number of posts filled on the same dates in the following grades: (i) higher, (ii) executive, (iii) clerical, (iv) sub-clerical, (v)  professional, technical and scientific and (vi)  industrial (manual).</P>

      <P>The total numbers of certain authorised posts in each Government Department or office are shown in the annual Estimates volume.  They relate to the end of the preceding year.  In the case of some Departments the figures include categories of staff who are not civil servants&mdash;for example, sub-contractors&mdash;and <Col N="2660" /> the figures do not generally include industrial staff.  It would not be possible for these reasons, and also because of the numbers and diversity of grades in the civil service, to furnish the detailed information requested by the Deputy without the expenditure of an inordinate amount of staff time which would not be justified.</P>
      <P>As regards the numbers of posts filled on 1 January each year since 1970, the information sought by the Deputy is set out in a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate.  This statement shows the numbers serving in occupational categories which correspond very closely with those mentioned by the Deputy in his question.</P>
      <P>In addition some figures have recently been extracted for 1 July 1981 which show that the total number of authorised non-industrial posts on that date was 64,564 and the number serving was 60,663.</P>
      <P>Following is the Statement:</P>

      <P>In relation to Waterford Airport, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Deputy Deasy of 22 October 1981.  A licence authorising the operation of domestic air services to and from the airport was granted by my Department on 14 December 1981.  I understand that construction work on Sligo Airport is expected to be <Col N="2664" /> completed by Easter 1982 and that the airport should be operational by summer 1982.</P>
      <P>In order that a service to and from Waterford should be available as soon as the airport opens, an authorisation for a scheduled service between Dublin and Waterford has already been issued on a non-exclusive basis to Avair.  Any other applications to provide services to Waterford, Sligo or any other local airport will be examined on their merits.</P>
      <P>On the question of policy, an Interdepartmental Committee is at present reviewing arrangements for the establishment, equipment and financing of regional or local airports and air services. The committee will make recommendations for future policy.</P>

I am, however, prepared to approve an extension of the existing interim pension scheme, and I have asked CIE to open negotiations to that end.  I hope that such a further interim scheme will substantially improve existing pension arrangements. I have also agreed that negotiations <Col N="2665" /> between CIE and the unions on the definitive scheme may continue on the understanding that such a scheme could not be introduced until such time as financial considerations permit.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport if he is aware that the National Prices Commission stated in its November 1978 report (pages 8 and 9) that an effective ports policy would serve to improve the efficiency of our ports thereby reducing costs and that for balanced development of our ports a national ports policy is urgently required; and the steps being taken to implement a national ports policy as the Dublin Port and Docks Board is proceeding on a piecemeal basis and has applied to reclaim 94 acres of the Inner Dublin Bay opposite Clontarf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the National Prices Commission statement in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of Irish commercial ports is primarily the responsibility of each individual harbour authority which <Col N="2666" /> is statutorily established for this purpose. I am not convinced that there is a need for a national ports policy as such.  In my view, policy must be flexible and capable of adaptation to change.  A national ports policy could be too rigid for our particular circumstances, given the number of smaller ports operating quite effectively to meet local needs.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that harbour authorities should be free to undertake unco-ordinated development without regard to the need for efficiency in the use of facilities and resources.  In that connection, I should explain that harbour development proposals generally require statutory authorisation by my Department &mdash; for example, in the form of a harbour works order &mdash; as well as approval of borrowing or other means of financing the project.  In examining any such proposals my Department would in the normal case take account of the facilities available in other adjacent harbours so as to avoid unnecessary duplication of facilities, while at the same time ensuring that our ports are adequately equipped to meet transportation needs.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Deputy's suggestion that the Dublin Port and Docks Board is proceeding on a &ldquo;piecemeal&rdquo; basis. Development by the Board is on the basis of a published five year plan which is reviewed and updated annually in the light of current and projected demands for port facilities and the development of new port technology.  As part of the five year programme, the board has applied for a Harbour Works Order to reclaim an area of foreshore on the north side of the River Liffey in the vicinity of the British Rail terminal and to construct a deep-water quay on the river side of the reclaimed area.  The board's application is still under consideration.</P>

      <P>(b)  that the board, or their lessees or assignees, would not seek to take advantage of a legal technicality to circumvent the requirements of the planning legislation in the matter of obtaining planning permission for building development or other unexempted forms of development on reclaimed land.</P>
      <P>It would appear from papers on file in my Department that on 13 June 1969, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce informed a meeting at Clontarf, <i>inter alia,</i> that in the meantime an unequivocal assurance had been obtained from the Port and Docks Board to the effect that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the board would not in future commence work requiring the authority of a Harbour Works Order in advance of the making of the relevant Order, and</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): In the case of the Fisheries Estimate for 1981 a reduction of £400,000 was made in the amount sought by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to meet the cost of interest subsidy on fishing boat loans.  The result of this reduction would have been an increase in interest rates payable by fishermen in respect of loans from the board. However, after the budget, the previous administration decided not to apply the increased interest rates and agreed to restore the cut of £400,000 but did not ask the House to vote the necessary finance.  The present Government had to make these funds available by way of Supplementary Estimate.  The reduction did not affect basic pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mrs. E. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The major financing difficulty which arose in the health sector in 1981 was due to the approving of higher levels of expenditure for the main health agencies than was justified by the provision for Exchequer grant made in the Book of Estimates.  On that basis the under-provision by way of grant amounted to £43.8 millions.  The agencies mainly involved were health boards, public voluntary hospitals, homes for the mentally handicapped and the General Medical Services (Payments) Board.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the pay and non-pay breakdown of the subhead provisions in Part III of the Estimate the overall amount of £43.8 could notionally be regarded as representing £28.8 million in respect of pay and £15 million in respect of non-pay.  As the pay costs of the main health agencies cover a wide range of grades (in excess of 300), with varying pay rates, as well as fees, overtime, locum cover, and so on, it will be appreciated that it would not be practicable to express the notional pay content of the under-provision in terms of the number of weeks' basic pay which the shortfall constituted in each area.</P>

      <P>Payment was authorised at the weekly rate of £38.20 being the maximum rate applicable to a smallholder with a valuation of less than £10.00 (£39.25) less means (£1.05) and as he is a postal applicant an order issued to him last week for encashment at his local post office paying all arrears of unemployment assistance due.

      <P>The overall amount allocated to the Department of Labour in the January 1981 Estimates has proved sufficient to finance the various services provided by the Department and its agencies in 1981.</P>
      <P>There will be certain excesses on individual subheads of the Vote occasioned by the undertaking of additional commitments during the year or because certain services proved more costly than anticipated. These excesses are being met from savings elsewhere in the Vote and additional receipts from the European Social Fund which are treated as appropriations-in-aid of the Vote.  The larger excesses involved where covered by the Supplementary Estimate for a nominal £10 approved by Dáil Éireann on 9 December.</P>
      <P>A final excess of about £25,000 is anticipated on the amount &mdash; £6.7 million &mdash; provided in subhead A1 &mdash; Salaries, Wages and Allowances.  This excess represents the cost of a number of pay awards not provided for when the 1981 Estimate was settled, less savings on the subhead, primarily due to non-filling of posts for some or all of the year.</P>

      <P>It had been planned to provide automatic service this year.  This was based on the exchange building being completed in 1979.  The completion of the building was delayed until early 1981. The contractor's equipment installation programme had to be revised as a result of this delay and the current forecast is that automatic service will not be provided until 1983.  However, the possibility of improving on this is being explored and if an improvement can be secured I will advise the Deputy of the outcome.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned in my speech in the Dáil on 26 November 1981 when speaking on a Supplementary Estimate for my Department, there apparently was, on the basis outlined by me, an under-provision of £1 million in respect of the bread and flour and wheatenmeal subsidies.  There were no instances of shortfalls in basic pay provisions; adjustments which subsequently became necessary in pay provisions arose from circumstances which would not ordinarily have been provided for at the time of approval of Estimates by the then Government.</P>

The amounts provided were insufficient to cover the basic pay and allowances of the numbers serving in the Garda Síochána and the Prison Service at the end of 1980.  The figures based on those numbers are as follows:</P>
      <P>(1) Vote for the Garda Síochána: Sub-head A &mdash; Salaries, Wages and Allowances &mdash; under-provided by about £4.3 million, which is the equivalent of about two weeks' basic pay and allowances for the Force.</P>
