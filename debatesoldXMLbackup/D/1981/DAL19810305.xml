      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £67,971,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1981, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of Public Works; for certain domestic expenses; for expenditure in respect of public buildings; for the maintenance of certain parks and public works; for the execution and maintenance of drainage and other engineering works; and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. McEllistrim)</NameTxt>
      <P>A sum of £67,971,000 is the amount being sought for Vote 9, Public Works and Buildings for 1981 under various subheads.</P>
      <P>The administrative expenses of the Office of Public Works and the wages and allowances of the President's household staff are met from subheads A1 to C and an amount of £10,585,000 is required in respect of these.</P>
      <P>An amount of £4.6 million is required under subhead D for the acquisition of sites and premises for various Government services, including the acquisition of the fee simple of some existing leasehold premises.  A sum of £½ million has been included for the purchase of sites for new offices to be built under the programme of decentralisation of Government staff in 12 provincial centres.  I would like to acknowledge the very valuable assistance rendered by the various local authorities in securing sites for this purpose.  In some cases they have made sites available and, where this was not possible, they have been extremely helpful in the search for privately-owned sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subhead also provides for the purchase of land for national parks and for the national monuments and waterways services.  Nowadays, with expanding urbanisation, it is desirable to preserve areas where scenic beauty, natural plant <Col N="930" /> life and wildlife remain undisturbed by development and to make them available for the enjoyment and recreation of our own people and of overseas visitors.  In so far as available resources permit, the commissioners are continuing with their national parks programme, an important part of which is the acquisition of land for the expansion and development of parks in Killarney, Connemara, Glenveagh in County Donegal and the Burren in County Clare.  The provision included in respect of national monuments provides not alone for acquiring monuments but also for the purchase of sites to provide visitor facilities and work depots.  The cost of purchasing sites to provide improved facilities for the Shannon navigation is also met from this subhead.</P>
    <P>The total amount required for works to be carried out under subhead E is £21,830,000, which represents the estimated expenditure on building new offices and providing improved accommodation for Government Departments and improved facilities for the various services which they administer.  The programme is well under way and will be maintained this year.</P>
    <P>Included in this amount is a figure of £1.6 million in respect of the programme for the decentralisation of Government Departments on which it is hoped to make good progress in the current year. As has already been announced, the Government are anxious to encourage involvement by the private sector in the development of this programme.</P>
    <P>Also included is an amount of £304,000 in respect of major and minor new works at our national parks and monuments.  A new access road is being provided at Connemara National Park, which was opened last year, and work on a new centre for visitors will start soon at Glenveagh National Park.  A new sewage treatment plant at Muckross House in Killarney is nearing completion.  Plans for the adaptation of the former Apostolic Nunciature buildings in the Phoenix Park to provide a national heritage centre and park administration-maintenance centre are being prepared and a new information centre and car park at Knockmaroon has been completed and will be opened <Col N="931" /> to the public shortly.  Works are in progress on the provision of visitor facilities at Cahir Castle and the Rock of Cashel and, in co-operation with Bord Fáilte and the Forest and Wildlife Service of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, planning for the provision of a visitor centre and car park at Glendalough is progressing.  A new central depot for the maintenance of monuments in the north west is being established at Dromahair, County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made under the subhead for continued investment in the development of Shannon Navigation. Over the last ten years, the Office of Public Works have co-operated with Bord Fáilte and the local authorities in improving facilities in order to develop the great potential of the waterway for recreational use.  Over £600,000 has been spent on development works including the provision of a new harbour at Portumna, major developments at Mount-shannon and the restoration of the Lough Allen canal as far as Acres Lough. Works in progress include a new harbour at Dromod, dry docks at Rooskey and the provision of additional facilities at Drumsna, Hodson's Bay and Shannon-bridge. It is hoped to commence work this year at other centres including Dromineer harbour which is being transferred to the Commissioners of Public Works by Tipperary (North Riding) County Council.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing new amenities, the commissioners are also responsible for operating and maintaining existing facilities on the Shannon Navigation on which they have spent over £2 million in the last ten years.</P>
    <P>An amount of £1,430,000 is required for works for the Department of Finance. Of this £120,000 is in respect of various improvement works at the Ordnance Survey Office.  It is expected that works on the refurbishment of the north block of Government Buildings will be completed this year and that the long due work of renovating the facade of these buildings will also be carried out.  Construction of a new building for the State Laboratory at Abbotstown, County Dublin is in progress <Col N="932" /> and planning for the provision of alternative accommodation for the Stationery Office at Bishop Street, Dublin, is at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>The sum of £187,000 is being provided for works at various customs posts.  Tenders have been received for a new customs and excise office in Burnfoot and it is hoped to place a contract shortly.</P>
    <P>Tenders are being invited for the provision of a new training centre for the Department of the Public Service and the Institute of Public Administration at Clonskeagh, Dublin and it is hoped to place a contract for this work later this year.</P>
    <P>A total sum of £1,790,000 is required in respect of works which will be undertaken for the Department of Justice and of this an amount of £1,590,000 is in respect of works for the Garda.  This provides for the erection of new Garda stations and residences, for the improvement of existing Garda accommodation and for other works at the Garda Depot and the Templemore Training Centre. The good progress made last year in the replacement of sub-standard accommodation will be maintained in the current year.  While major works were completed last year at 11 centres including Mallow, Manorhamilton, Kildare, Fermoy and Irishtown, Dublin, ten contracts are still in progress and tenders for the erection of new stations at ten other centres are under consideration.  Work is also expected to commence during the year on the erection of a new divisional headquarters at Tralee and a new district headquarters at Carrick-on-Shannon. The planning of buildings at 18 other centres including a divisional headquarters at Monaghan and district headquarters at Oughterard, Tipperary town and Wicklow is at a very advanced stage. Planning is also proceeding for the provision of a new training college for Garda officers of the rank of inspector and upwards at the Templemore Training Centre and for the provision of accommodation for a computer at the Garda Depot, Phoenix Park.  Planning for new and additional court accommodation is also proceeding.</P>
    <P>With regard to accommodation and <Col N="933" /> working facilities for State employees generally, great strides have been made in the past decade to provide a modern environment of a high standard.  Having regard to the expansion of the public service in that period and the additional accommodation that had to be found to cater for those increased staff numbers, the progress made with up-dating and replacing older buildings has been quite good.  The work has been going ahead steadily in accordance with programmes designed to deal with all of the buildings in each category in an orderly way.  In any such programme some buildings must be towards the end of the queue and it is inevitable that the occupants of those buildings seeing the great improvements in others will be disappointed at the necessary lead-in time to a solution to their particular situations.  I understand their disappointment but I say again that the only way to deal with the formidable task of refurbishing and replacing a large number of buildings is by way of orderly programmes of works which must be adhered to and advanced in accordance with the resources available from time to time.</P>
    <P>An amount of £315,000 is required for works for the Department of Education. This is mainly required for the provision of much-needed additional accommodation for the National Library and improvements to the present premises and also improvements to the National Museum.  Tenders are under consideration for the adaptation of premises at 23 Kildare Street to provide additional accommodation for the National Library and it is expected that a contract will be placed shortly.</P>
    <P>An amount of £822,000 is required for various works for the Department of Agriculture.  The grain storage complex at Abbotstown, County Dublin is almost complete.  Tenders will shortly be invited for a new sewerage scheme and a unit for the treatment of rabies, swine fever and poultry disease also at Abbotstown.  The provision of new student accommodation and a new water supply at Ballyhaise is in hands and other projects are at planning stage.  Planning of approved accommodation at the Botanic Gardens to <Col N="934" /> include a new library and herbarium and an extension to the Department's offices at Castlebar is at an advanced stage.  Of the £70,000 required for works for the Department of Transport, £60,000 is in respect of an extension to Valentia Coast Radio Station for which tenders will shortly be invited.</P>
    <P>A total sum of £2,050,000 is required for works for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Building of a new post office at Mullingar is in progress and Longford new post office is nearing completion. In addition to the works covered by this Estimate, the commissioners are undertaking the provision of the buildings required for the telecommunications development programme.  Most of the expenditure on these buildings is met from the telephone capital account.  To give an indication of the massive scale of this programme I might mention that there are at present almost 150 buildings under construction.  These range from small rural automatic exchanges to the large complex at Mervue in Galway.  The expenditure from the telephone capital account in 1980 was in excess of £21 million and it is expected that expenditure in the current year will be more than double that figure.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs when speaking in the Dáil on 18 December 1980 paid a tribute to the dedication and enthusiasm of the Office of Public Works and I am very happy to endorse what he said.</P>
    <P>An amount of £1,600,000 is being provided for embassy building abroad for the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Fitting out works have been completed at the chanceries in Copenhagen and Madrid and work is in progress at the Peking and Nairobi Embassies.  Fitting out of premises at Dar-es-Salaam and Beirut and the improvement of premises at Washington, Lagos and New Delhi will be done this year.  Planning for new Embassies at Canberra and Riyadh is proceeding.</P>
    <P>An amount of £775,000 is required for employment exchange buildings.  Work on the adaptation of premises at Thomas Street, Dublin, and on the erection of a new exchange at Dún Laoghaire is nearing completion while the exchange at <Col N="935" /> Manorhamilton has recently been completed. Planning for exchanges at Limerick and Newcastlewest is in progress.</P>
    <P>An amount of £5,105,000 is required for the erection of new office buildings and the fitting out of premises for occupation by various Government Departments.</P>
    <P>Last year saw the completion of new Government offices in Mullingar and an extension to Tralee custom house.  The construction of Government offices in Athlone and Waterford and the re-furbishment of numbers 14-16 Upper Merrion Street, as well as the second stage of the new Garda Headquarters at the Phoenix Park, will be completed this year.</P>
    <P>Work is proceeding on the second stage of the development of 93-99 Lower Leeson Street to house the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and others. Phase I of the office development at Beggar's Bush to house the Geological Survey Office and the Labour Court is progressing and is due to be completed next year.  Work will commence shortly on the erection of new Government offices at Carrick-on-Shannon, Cork, Navan and Thurles.  Other developments being planned include a new headquarters building for the Department of Defence, further developments at Beggar's Bush, Marlborough Street/Waterford Street, the rehabilitation of areas of Dublin Castle, and new Government offices at Kilkenny, Portlaoise, Sligo and Wexford.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to state that the conversion of the former UCD premises at Earlsfort Terrace into a concert hall is reaching completion and it is expected that the opening concert will be held in May of this year.  This concert hall of international standard will provide a long awaited amenity for music lovers.  A list of the various works has been made available to Deputies and I hope this will be of use.</P>
    <P>A total of £28,763,000 is required in respect of the subheads F.1 to F4.  These subheads provide for the normal day to day maintenance, furnishing, leasing, heating, lighting, and so on, of Government offices, Garda stations, post office <Col N="936" /> buildings, employment exchanges, social welfare offices, agricultural institutions, Irish embassies abroad and other State owned buildings.  They also provide for the maintenance of certain State-owned harbours, the River Shannon navigation and the various national parks.</P>
    <P>While this figure represents an increase of approximately 20 per cent over the amount provided for these subheads, inclusive of the Supplementary Estimate in 1980, the increase is necessary to cover increases in costs, expansion of the various services, increases in rents arising from renewals of leases and review provisions in existing leases and to allow for the leasing of new premises and the replacement of unsuitable accommodation.</P>
    <P>The amount sought under subhead F.5&mdash;£690,000&mdash;is required to meet expenditure on the reconstruction of Waterford courthouse which is being undertaken on behalf of Waterford Corporation who are repaying the cost.</P>
    <P>An amount of £10,470,000 is being sought for subheads G.1 to G.3 in connection with the arterial drainage programme which is being undertaken under the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945.</P>
    <P>While subhead G.1 provides for the carrying out of hydrometric studies and of comprehensive drainage surveys as a necessary preliminary to arterial drainage schemes, subhead G.2 provides for drainage construction works in progress. Work is proceeding on the Boyne, Maigue and Corrib-Mask-Robe schemes and the Boyle and Bonet schemes should commence during the year.  In fact I had hoped that the latter schemes would commence during 1980 but, due to difficulties in completing the statutory requirements of exhibition of the scheme, consideration of observations and so on, received and confirmed, this did not prove possible. Fifty per cent of moneys expended on drainage construction works on the Corrib-Mask-Robe, Boyle and Bonet schemes will be recoverable from the EEC under the programme for the acceleration of drainage works in the western region.  Subhead G.3 covers the cost of maintenance of completed drainage and embankment schemes and the cost of this <Col N="937" /> is recovered from the county councils concerned.</P>
    <P>An amount of £2,678,000 is required in respect of subhead H for the purchase of engineering plant and machinery, the purchase of stores and the payment of wages to the staff of the central engineering workshop.</P>
    <P>An amount of £197,000 is required in respect of subhead I.1 to cover the cost of completing the coast protection scheme at Enniscrone, County Sligo, and also to enable works to commence on a new scheme at Ballyvoile, County Waterford. Included also is an amount to cover the maintenance of the completed schemes at Rosslare and Youghal, the cost of which is recoverable from the county councils involved.</P>
    <P>An amount of £1,643,000 is required in respect of subhead J.1 to meet the cost of maintenance and presentation of the 569 monuments currently in State care, for archaeological excavation and for expenses incurred in connection with the archaeological survey.</P>
    <P>Conservation of monuments in the care of the commissioners is a continuing process.  Last year major works were completed at Abbey Friary and Portumna Castle in County Galway, the Vicar's Choral at the Rock of Cashel, County Tipperary and Castle Carra, County Mayo to mention a few.  Works will continue this year at Abbey Knockmoy and Kilconnell Abbey, County Galway, Ennis Abbey, County Clare, Ferns Castle and Tintern Abbey, County Wexford, Cahir and Grallagh Castles, County Tipperary, Ross Castle and Skellig Michael, County Kerry, Glenquin Castle, County Limerick, Glanworth Castle, French Prison, James and Charles Forts, County Cork, Ballymote Castle, County Sligo and Donegal Castle among others. Work will also continue at the Casino, Marino, Dublin.</P>
    <P>In addition to the monuments in full State care many field monuments are being preserved through the process of listing under the National Monuments Acts.  A total of 297 monuments were listed in 1980.  There are occasions, however, when the commissioners must <Col N="938" /> resort to stronger measures by making preservation orders and during the past year five such orders were made.</P>
    <P>Grants for research archaeological excavations are to be made again this year.  This will enable the investigation of the major site at Knowth to continue as well as the investigations at Carrowmore megalithic cemetery, County Sligo.</P>
    <P>During the past year the staff engaged on the Archaeological Survey has been increased and this will help to speed up the rate of progress of the survey, the purpose of which is to record all the monuments in the country.  This year a start is being made on the preliminary survey of County Carlow.  Consideration of the provision of a modern information storage and retrieval system for the survey is well advanced.</P>
    <P>The commissioners recently held a four-day course at Kilkenny Castle to develop a programme of training for temporary guides who are recruited each season at a number of selected monuments and park properties.  Personnel from Killarney National Park, Kilkenny Castle, Newgrange Tumulus, Clonmacnoise, State Apartments, Dublin Castle, Rock of Cashel, Connemara National Park, Derrynane Historic Park, Muckross House, Cahir Castle and Saint Enda's, Rathfarnham, attended the course which was conducted by CERT &mdash; the Council for Education, Recruitment and Training for the hotel, catering and tourism industries.</P>
    <P>More than 500,000 people visited these sites last year where up to 60 temporary staff were recruited to provide a guide-information service.  The temporary guides employed were generally university students residing in the locality and pursuing a course of studies relevant to the site at which they were employed. The proceeds from the admission charges in operation at a number of the sites is usually sufficient to cover the wages of the temporary guides.</P>
    <P>An amount of £15,000 is required to pay outstanding expenses in respect of the restoration of Holy Cross Abbey.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works carry out a large volume of works for other Departments not covered by this Vote.  I have <Col N="939" /> mentioned already the Department of Posts and Telegraphs but in addition the Department of Education have allocated £30 million to the commissioners for the primary school building programme and similarly the Department of Justice have allocated more than £10 million in respect of prison works and approximately 24 million has been allocated for harbour works.  This means that in 1981 the total gross expenditure for which the office will be responsible will be in the region of £167 million.</P>
    <P>It is clear from this that the activities of the Office of Public Works are far-reaching and varied and that they touch on many aspects of life in all parts of the country.  This will be reflected, I am sure, in Deputies' comments to which I now look forward.  When replying to these comments I will do my best to answer any queries raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of Deputy Donnellan's unavoidable absence from the House this morning, I have had to come in at very short notice to contribute to this debate.  The Estimate before us is comprehensive as well as being of importance to most people.  I compliment the Minister of State for having succeeded in getting his tongue around some of the more difficult words in his brief.  I compliment him also on the increases being provided for, even if inflation has already eroded these increases to a considerable extent.  However, money is being provided for very necessary works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Public Works must be the most impersonal of public Departments. This office deals with everybody but one might be pardoned for asking if they are really committed to anybody. Having said that I must add that the office have been more than helpful to me in the many dealings I have had with them at local level.  Many of the problems associated with the Department are associated with their having to depend on other Departments to furnish documents and to supply details of work to be carried out and so on.  This situation has resulted in a certain amount of unwieldiness down through the years.  Because of this I <Col N="940" /> should like to see the Office of Public Works playing a more positive role in determining what works are to be carried out.  Once a decision has been made they should be free to move in and get on with the job and produce what would be a sort of turn-key product for the Department concerned.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the sort of problems I am speaking of, I might mention a convent at Mallow which was built not so very long ago.  The roof of the building is leaking and despite the fact that the architect has sanctioned the estimate for the necessary repairs, the matter rests with the Department of Education at the moment.  This means that when they have dealt with it, it will be returned to the Office of Public Works who will then carry out the work.  The problem is that in the meantime the roof continues to leak and the rain is going right down through the carpets.  This is the sort of problem that should be dealt with as a matter of urgency but the involvement of different Departments causes delay.</P>
    <P>Up to a point the priorities are right so far as this Estimate is concerned.  We may argue about the question of urgency in relation to the spending of almost £2 million on brightening up an embassy in Jeddah or in Dar-Es-Salaam at a time of recession and of crisis.  I suppose we have to keep up a good front and even if that costs a lot of money we cannot argue too much about it.  But we must concentrate more attention nearer home.  We must consider the many schools, Garda barracks and public buildings urgently in need of attention.  We must look at the serious problem of coast erosion.  I see a figure of a couple of hundred of thousands of pounds provided for coast erosion. That would only buy a few loads of stones nowadays.  We should be serious about coast erosion because the sea will not wait for the recession to end; the tide still comes in relentlessly.  From my experience over the last few years it is doing untold damage and making vast inroads into private and also public property.</P>
    <P>Youghal was mentioned as getting an allocation, but out of £200,000 it cannot be much.  If we were to consider the coast from Youghal to Ballycotton we would <Col N="941" /> be talking of £20 million to be realistic, if we are to save that beautiful coastline and those beaches and protect the town of Youghal and Ballycotton village. There was a time when we were inclined to despair and give in to the sea.  I think it is in the prophecies regarding east Cork that the Round Tower would be a sign used by sea captains on their way to Cork &mdash; in other words, the sea would come in through Cloyne right up to Cork city.  At the present rate of erosion it begins to look as if that might happen.  Unless we tackle the problem now we will have a very serious situation.  The technology is now available and it is not an elaborate one of mass concrete and bulwarks.  All we need in that area &mdash; and it has been proved highly successful &mdash; is loads and loads of limestone rocks.  It is a straightforward, simple operation, but it must be undertaken now.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked for constructive comments and I make mine in the most constructive possible way, that he should look at this problem personally.  I would be prepared to go along with him at any time and show him what is involved, show him where much has been done with little over the past few years.  So much more has to be done.  We have not so many nice beaches on the south coast and in the whole country there is not that much fertile land or many villages as attractive as Ballycotton.  Unless we move now in regard to places like Ballycotton and Youghal the country will face massive expenditure, because if we do not start in time concrete bulwarks will have to be poured costing millions and millions.</P>
    <P>With the advent of larger fishing boats &mdash; it shows the confidence of fishermen that they are still buying fairly substantial boats &mdash; and with the rather free movement of these boats around the coast. and the boats that come from abroad occasionally, our harbours are totally inadequate.  It may sound parochial but it could apply anywhere.  Very recently we had a case in point in Ballycotton when very large vessels visited us to unload and refuel.  They literally pulled the place apart as regards pillars and chains and so on.  We now have a derelict harbour which will cost hundreds of thousands <Col N="942" /> of pounds to put right.  You cannot stop these vessels if they are entitled to come in.  I do not know if you can claim damages from them or, if we did, whether they would have anything to give us.  The basic problem is that the harbour is not equipped to deal with those vessels as it should be.  All these small harbours must be dredged and piers properly constructed.</P>
    <P>I have raised this matter several times in the House and the Minister for Fisheries and myself regularly have exchanges on this issue of proper harbour facilities.  We could devote much more attention to this area because, in spite of all the hassle about EEC fishery rules, I believe Irish fishermen will thrive and prosper and that we will be dealing with bigger and bigger boats.  I believe our fishermen will be more than competitive with bigger fleets anywhere, because we have the best fishing grounds and the best fishermen in the world.  There is nothing to stop us doing our own processing and we have a big advantage in the market place.  This is a profitable area for the Minister to consider.  Much of his activities are not reflected in cash returns.  Such works as archaeology, protecting public buildings, maintaining our castles and monuments do not so easily show a payback, but the area I am talking about would yield an immediate return.  A good harbour is automatically followed by a good fishing fleet and next comes the demand for a processing plant and the creation of jobs.  One of the most important considerations at the moment is to provide employment, albeit not always productive employment.  Here is an area of productive employment which we should certainly be considering today.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of arterial drainage, another really productive area.  Successive Governments&mdash;and we must admit to being as culpable as the next &mdash; have never got down to the importance of arterial drainage.  Only since our accession to the EEC has it come home to farmers with the very substantial grants available for draining their land.  This applies as much to my area as to Deputy Callanan's or anybody else's.  A lot of work has been carried out and the Deputy <Col N="943" /> is fortunate in that regard.  However, what use is all the drainage?  What is the point in digging deep drains if the water has nowhere to go except back up on the land again, making the work pointless? It would be logical to start work at the mouth of the river and clean it all the way up.  With the modern equipment which we see on television, which can stand on the bed of the river and clean a way before it, the task is much easier.  The Estimate is quite substantial&mdash;£7 million is a lot of money, probably borrowed money &mdash; but this is an area where we could double our money with good results.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a recession and about cutting back, but very often cutting back is the worst possible thing to do when done in the wrong area.  No private individual or Government ever got out of a recession by receding.  You get out of a recession by fighting your way out. These works would create a lot of extra jobs and the Minister could see, if he comes down to our area&mdash;and I am sure it is the same in his own&mdash;the volume of excavation equipment lying idle because farmers have suddenly halted this type of work, perhaps for the wrong reasons. The equipment and the men are there. The Minister could make a right good deal now with these people to get a lot of work done and I believe that a lot of work needs to be done.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, last winter when we challenged another Minister on what he intended doing about the flood disasters in Fermoy, Mallow, Kanturk and the whole Blackwater area.  We gave him statistics of the tragedy involved and told him of the people's fear and of the very substantial sums of money lost in property and stock.  We were told that the Minister had no funds in his Department to recompense these people and that there were no EEC funds.  We would have had to put up £10 million of our own money to get £1 million of EEC money. As yet nothing has been forthcoming to these people who have suffered losses. They are in a similar plight to people in the path of an earthquake or a volcano. They have a similar fear about future <Col N="944" /> flooding and disasters.  When we go back to the county council we are told that we are 27th on the list.</P>
    <P>This is a long river which the Minister knows.  It flows through some of the best land in the world&mdash;there is no doubt about that.  It flows through some of the most prosperous industrial towns in Ireland. Yet, we have not got down to cleaning and draining it properly.  I hope the Minister will look again at the situation. I am not saying that he is not putting a lot of money into the Estimate.  He is, but this is certainly one area which has been overlooked.  There is the unique situation in three of our major towns of the likelihood of flooding happening again at any moment, because all you need is the wrong set of circumstances, of tide, wind and rain, combining to cause these frightening floods.</P>
    <P>People woke up one morning and heard the river flowing past an upstairs window or found that the fronts of their houses had collapsed.  The entire parapet of the bridge also collapsed.  Farmers found animals on treetops and were very lucky that they themselves were not drowned in the floodwaters in their efforts to salvage some of their stock. There is a logical case to be made for starting on this work immediately.  I will support the Minister if he comes along tomorrow morning or next week with a Supplementary Estimate for this work.  I did so before and was criticised afterwards around this House in the case of a Supplementary Estimate for the building of a vessel which some Deputies thought was costing the Exchequer too much money.  In this case a Supplementary Estimate is fully justified and would gain recognition for the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>I come now to the thorny subject of the maintenance of these works.  There is very little point in draining the Corrib, the Mask, the Boyne or any of these rivers if they are not maintained.  That is a foregone conclusion.  The Minister is over-optimistic if he thinks that he can recover the maintenance costs of river or coastal erosion works from the relevant county council.  Cork County Council and, indeed, Mayo County Council or <Col N="945" /> any county council, do not have the necessary funds at their disposal to carry out their own work.  I appeal to the Minister, not in any political sense, because of the changed situation where we no longer have rates to any degree, that all this work involving maintenance be funded from a central authority, preferably from the Minister's own Department.  A special allocation could be made to the Minister to ensure that he has the money and gets on with the job.  He is only fooling himself if he thinks he can ask the councils to write cheques for them, because they have not got the money.  The county councils have not even enough money at present to maintain the roadways, much less to pay for arterial drainage and so forth.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note from the Minister's address that agriculture is not forgotten in his Estimate and I note the improvements in the agricultural colleges situation.  I mentioned before to the present Minister that because of longstanding, massive demands in Cork county we have been looking for an agricultural college in our part of the county.  Every year, students try in vain to gain admission to our various colleges around the country. We could not say this a few years ago, but we have now at Fota a university college with a most beautiful farm and buildings.  The Department should have a chat with Dr. Raftery.  There are a lot of third level students doing useful work there at the moment and there will be a wildlife park there, which is to be welcomed. All this is being sponsored by the university.  Fota would be an ideal setting for an agricultural college.  This is a large area where there is a demand.  Agricultural grants for students are limited, but in spite of that there are many interested people in my area.  If we had this type of facility at Fota Island there would be quite a number of day pupils and there would not be any problem of boarding. We could start in a small way and grow with the demand.  There is logic in this.</P>
    <P>Because of the recession some people might think this is not a time to build colleges.  However, if we are to get out of this rut and give the young people who will be going into farming the courage <Col N="946" /> and confidence needed, we will have to tell them that we have confidence in agriculture, that we will build a local college, that we will make them more efficient and that we will instil in them the confidence which is so badly needed.</P>
    <P>As Fine Gael spokesman of tourism I was particularly pleased to note that the Minister and his Department are funding very essential sewerage treatment works at Muckross.  This is not in my constituency but it is still one of the greatest jobs undertaken by the Department.  This proves there is still some hope for us, because I was beginning to despair about the Department of the Environment and other Departments doing something about pollution.  I want to repeat that the Department dealing with pollution are the worst offenders.  I am sure they would be happy to pump raw effluent out of Killarney into a lake if they could get away with it because that is precisely what they are doing with Cork Harbour.</P>
    <P>We do not have any place as beautiful as Killarney but we have a good second, a place called Eastferry&mdash;I will bring the Minister of State down there sometime, probably after the election and show him this most beautiful tropical area.  Cork County Council, with the blessing of the Department of the Environment, proposed to pour raw effluent into that most beautiful part of Cork Harbour.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this scenic area and see if he can find the money to help. The strange thing is it would not cost any more to do what I am asking.  I went to the trouble of getting another team of consultants to look at the situation.  Originally there was to be a two-and-three-quarter mile pipe into that beautiful area, but we proved a treatment plant could be sited near the town for exactly the same money.  Because of mulishness, the Department refused to look at any other set of figures or to listen to anybody else. They forged ahead with their original plans which are, as I said many times, 1,000 years out of date.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to social welfare officers and the work being done in that Department.  I would like him to look at this matter personally, because I have a thing about social welfare officers.  Going <Col N="947" /> to a social welfare officer is like going begging.  I have the greatest sympathy for the people who have to present themselves for medical cards.  If a person visits a social welfare office his business should be discussed in the privacy of an office, not at a counter with everybody listening. I know people who will not go for their medical cards because of this lack of privacy and very often because of the torrent of abuse they get from these officers.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased to notice that the Minister sponsored a special course for tour guides.  This is a much-needed service.  I had the privilege of being a member of the Council of Europe and have visited nearly all 21 member nations.  I saw how these people treated their visitors.  A person would arrive at Athens, Corinth or somewhere else, be met by the tour guide, taken on a conducted tour and pay whatever is needed. He does not think very much about what he is paying because it does not cost very much.  Tourist guides are very skilled people.  Very often they bring 200 to 300 people on tours to study what appears to be the remains of a statue.  They know the history of these places and instruct visitors.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have treasures these people never dreamt of, treasures which go back to pre-historic times.  We have dolmens and cromlechs, cathedrals and round towers, castles and forts.  Last summer in my local town of Cloyne I saw groups of French tourists.  They had a good knowledge of English, otherwise I would not have been able to communicate with them.  They did not know how to get into the cathedral or the round tower because there was not a guide available.  I took this simple job on myself.  The key was in the lodge and I brought them in.  They were thrilled with the cathedral and fascinated by the round tower, wondering how it could have been built and how the stones were carried to the top.  Their day was made by that visit. The cameras were clicking all day and I am sure they are still talking about this one little experience.</P>
    <P>As Fine Gael spokesman for tourism, I have an interest in this area.  The Americans <Col N="948" /> would dearly love to have an ancient cathedral or round tower.  They can only go back as far as Davy Crocket. We have a unique history.  Many people come here not for the sunshine, of which we have a limited amount, and certainly not for the beer which is too expensive, but let us hope they will still come to see what cannot be seen anywhere else in the world, our castles, Clonmacnoise, Cashel and other places of historical interest. This is an ideal job for university students during the summer months.  They have a knowledge of languages and are proud of our treasures.  I should like to see short courses being run which would be of interest to people such as those living in Cloyne.  The scheme could be self-supporting.</P>
    <P>I am sure many other speakers will refer to Garda barracks and courthouses. From my experience the work which has been done on barracks has been worthwhile and is of good quality.  I would suggest, however, that flat accommodation for young gardaí be provided in the vicinity of barracks.  Very often they have difficulty in finding accommodation, especially in small towns.</P>
    <P>In this Year of the Disabled various Government Departments are employing disabled people but they also have accommodation difficulties.  I know of one case concerning a particularly bright young girl who is confined to a wheelchair. She may not be able to continue in employment because she cannot find suitable accommodation and at present she must take a train to the suburbs.  We often talk about facilities for Dáil Deputies, but they can look after themselves. We should ascertain the demand for accommodation for disabled people and make suitable arrangements.  A lot of work is being done in adapting buildings to suit the handicapped.</P>
    <P>In rural areas we should avoid the skycraper-type development.  An example of such an edifice is the county Hall in Cork, which to me is a horrible building. It is very inefficient and very often the lifts do not work.  I believe buildings should be kept as near the ground as possible, especially in areas where there is plenty of space.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="949" /> Like coast erosion work, the conservation of monuments is a matter which cannot wait.  There is a danger of many historic sites and buildings being destroyed and a stock example is the Wood Quay saga.  Fairy forts are being wiped out and ruined buildings destroyed, the significance of which is not appreciated until some item of treasure is discovered in the process.  We must seek out the places which have not yet been taken over by the National Monuments Commission and they should be earmarked immediately.  There are a number of ruined castles in my area which are in a dangerous condition and young children are inclined to play there. Such monuments are very valuable and need immediate attention.  Sceillig Mhicíl is not Inishvickillaune, I suppose.  It is a different one.</P>
    <P>I hope my contribution has been constructive. If I have made demands for additional finance from the Exchequer it is because I believe it would be money well spent.  When it comes to Cairo, Canberra, Copenhagen, Jeddah, Lagos, Nairobi, New Delhi, Ottawa, Peking or Washington D.C., they should be able to wait a little while.  They have pretty comfortable pads and will not suffer too much hardship if we ask them to hold on a little longer.  Perhaps we are overdoing things in the matter of embassies.  Can we afford these very elaborate mansions all over the world?  Perhaps we could do as well with a lesser operation.  I believe we should first look after our own little island and make sure that the Atlantic Ocean does not make it any smaller.  I am particularly concerned about the acre by acre erosion in the Youghal-Ballycotton area. Deputations met the Minister's predecessor on the subject but no action was taken.  There is provision in the Estimate for a sum of £200,000 which would not even pay for a few loads of stones.</P>
    <P>The Government should set up a fund not merely to deal with the existing works and drainage but to continue with maintenance.  Drainage without maintenance is useless and land drainage without river drainage is worse than useless. EEC funds are being poured into farm and river drainage and at the end of <Col N="950" /> the day it will be useless if we do not maintain it properly.  The Department will have to do the job and fund it themselves. If we drained the Blackwater River and did something about coast erosion it would create worthwhile employment. Every acre of land saved means money and jobs.</P>
    <P>In relation to inter-departmental delays, they can be dealt with by the Government as a whole.  The Board of Works should have a clear mandate to rectify problems that come within their ambit without having to deal with the Department of Justice, for instance, and all the officialdom that at the moment enters into a small matter, down to a leaking roof in Mallow Convent.  That is the sort of thing that we as public representatives have to contend with.  The Minister can sort it out; he has the power to sort it out.</P>
    <P>In relation to housing by the department of Defence I am not sure if that comes within the Minister's brief.  But this is a very serious area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the flooding of the Blackwater we have what is called a disaster area and the solution is to drain the river.  The town of Cobh was built a long time ago on a shale hill which has now started to slip away.  Substantial areas have fallen, causing a death last year.  The Minister could look at areas such as Cobh and come up with solutions as the remedy is not within the ambit of the urban district council nor have they the finances to do the work.  We are talking about a massive propping up job that will have to be done to save rows of houses, streets and lives.  Special funding <Col N="951" /> should be provided.  Here, like the Blackwater, we are not talking about an annual bill but about a once-off situation.  The Minister might say that there is already a shortage of funds, but spending on this type of thing would create employment and protect valuable property.  Some of the houses that had to be taken down were valued at £30,000 and £40,000 each and the removal of the rubble and all the rest of it cost nearly as much again.  We have been left with a massive blank area which will have to be rebuilt.  I believe that we have the same sort of problem to a lesser extent in Kinsale but we should try to find solutions to this.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to see that the Minister is doing something for environmental protection, even if it is in his own county. I would like the Department to look at all the treatment works that are at present being ignored by another Department and come to the rescue of these other Departments who do not seem to give a damn about the environment.</P>

      <P>If so, I will support it because they are worthwhile whereever they are.  We have few things going for us here.  We have green grass, tourists and fishing.  Anything the Minister can do to help in any of these areas is welcome. The Department should clean and build up the harbours and make them suitable for fishing fleets.  This would help fishermen, create processing industries and therefore create more employment. If agriculture is built up, it also creates jobs.  We should build up the tourist industry by making Ireland an attractive place.  The Office of Public Works must be complimented for their work over the years.  However our sign-posting for overseas tourists leaves a lot to be desired.

I know that the Minister is interested in ancient monuments and keeping them in good repair.  I met him while he was on a tour in Portumna and he showed a very keen interest in the old castle there and in all the old monuments.  These are of great importance to us and, as Deputy Hegarty said, they cannot be left on the long finger.  If they are allowed to get into too bad a state of repair they cost too much to repair.  A lot of work has been done on monuments.  A good job was done on Portumna Castle and the new Portumna harbour is very nice.  The friary at Abbey in Loughrea, and the Franciscan Abbey, where I hope to be buried, is being done up at present.  There are rumours that the Board of Works do not want people to have graves in these old abbeys.  This would be resented very much by people whose families have been buried in such abbeys.

In the case of schools the Department of Education provide the money and the Board of Works build the school, but there are often long delays in communications between the two Departments. This is also the case as regards Garda barracks where the Department of Justice are involved.  There is a new barracks being built in Meenlough and a school in Gurteen.  The Minister should take note of the need for a barracks in Woodford, County Galway.</P>
      <P>As regards courthouses some of them have no heating.  That is a matter that should be looked into and the Minister should bring them up to standard.</P>

      <P>The position as regards courthouses is very relevant in my county.  Buildings erected by the Board of Works should accommodate disabled people.  Most public buildings are a disgrace as far as that is concerned.  They always have lots of steps so that disabled people or people like myself who suffer from arthritis find it difficult to get into them.  This is an area which is being neglected and something should be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed that more money has not come from the EEC for arterial drainage.  I do not blame the Minister for this.  We hear a lot about the western package infrastructure.  It is all very important, but it is of no avail to <Col N="955" /> fertilise land and drain fields if the major drains are not opened.  A tributary of the Shannon, the Suck, flows through my constituency.  There is an area between Ballinasloe and Portumna which is flooded for six months of the year by the Shannon.  The PLV of that land is £1.50 per acre and that is disgraceful for land which is flooded.  A survey was done on the Shannon and the report stated that the only way to drain the Shannon was to bank it.  If one were to bank that area of the Shannon one would have to go back a hundred yards from the river at summer level.  One would run into problems because this is good land in the summer months, It is only in winter time that it is flooded.  The drainage of the Shannon has been a political football for years.  Is there any new thinking on it?</P>
    <P>The Shannon is very important for tourists but farmers in the area are of the opinion that the sluice gates are not open enough and cause flooding back down the Shannon.  They say there would not be as much flooding if the gates were open.  I do not know how true this is. However, the Minister could check it and, if everything is being done to keep them open, fair enough.</P>
    <P>A big part of Galway and Roscommon is flooded severely by the Suck.  I cannot understand why we are still governed by an old Act of Parliament which allows the Suck Drainage Board, of which I am a member, to maintain the Suck but not to remove any obstacle from it.  We are allowed to get to point X but we cannot pass it.  If we could remove an obstacle 100 yards down from that point there would be less flooding.  If we were allowed to clean the Suck tributaries where we think they need to be cleaned, we could prevent a good deal of flooding. This is a ridiculous law which has been there since the time of Queen Victoria. I would ask the Minister to have a serious look at that matter.  We pass regulations time and time again dealing with cleaning the tributaries of the Suck where we think they need to be cleaned.</P>
    <P>In an election year I suppose we all talk about our hobby horses.  I hope the <Col N="956" /> Minister will be able to tell us something about the cost-benefit survey of the River Dunkellin which floods my constituency from one end to the other.  I suppose the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is fed up hearing me talking about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>You will hear about it again, and the country will hear about it again.  As long as I am alive I will keep talking about it because it is the greatest disaster of all time.  This is a most disadvantaged area but we are not included in the severely handicapped areas.  I go to Galway twice a week and I meet people driving along the road during the winter. They look at me as if to say: &ldquo;You are a public representative and this is what we get.&rdquo; I do not blame them.  I understand that there is a shortage of engineers, but the Office of Public Works should be in a position to pay engineers to enable this work to be done.</P>
      <P>A cost-benefit survey was to be carried out on this river.  I would ask the Minister to forget about the benefit survey, because it is there for anybody to see. The costing was done years ago.  When I was a member of Macra na Feirme we got the costing done privately and it was very much the same as the costing by the Office of Public Works.  The river was to be cleaned but, unfortunately, the question of the cost-benefit survey arose and the work has not been done.  I understand it is No. 1 on the list of small schemes, but I may be wrong.  If I am here next year&mdash;and that depends on the people&mdash;I hope when I am speaking on this Estimate I will not have to ask the Minister to have this costing carried out.</P>
      <P>I do not think enough money came from the EEC for arterial drainage.  I am not blaming the Minister or his Department. I admit I was wrong in saying too much of that money was spent on field drainage.  I understand the sum was £42 million, and £14 million was spent on arterial drainage and £28 million on field drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We tried to carry out schemes under the local improvements scheme and we <Col N="957" /> found that the levels are wrong.  You cannot drain land if the levels are wrong. Hundreds of acres of reasonably good land cannot be developed.  There is no point in manuring it because of the water. That is why drainage is so important.  It is vitally important to any development in the west.  If a man could get five or ten acres drained he could improve his income and his holding might be made viable.  This is why I am talking so much about drainage.  I hope I will not have to mention this matter again.  I am convinced that, if you talk about something for long enough, somebody will listen.  I have been talking for a long time about the Dunkellin and the Suck.</P>
    <P>I understand the position with regard to the Shannon.  It is a complicated job. I also understand that the Suck is a tributary of the Shannon and, until something is done about the Shannon, nothing can be done about the Suck.  I should like to see the law changed to enable us to take the silt out of the tributaries without being confined to point X.  I should like to know if there is any new thinking on the Shannon and if anything can be done about it.  The banking of the Shannon would cause many complications because of the quality of the land in the summer. It is a shame that something is not done about the poor law valuation on that land which is flooded for six months of the year and carries a valuation of about £1.50 in the £.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Hegarty spoke.  I do not think we should try to score points. We are expected to do that.  People know that Deputy Hegarty will speak from the Opposition point of view and they expect me to contradict him.  In no way will I do that.  I will give credit where credit is due, and I will criticise where I think criticism is necessary.  The Minister gave us an excellent account of what the Office of Public Works are doing.  I know the money in the Estimate is needed for other works too, but in an estimate for £67 million only £10 million is set aside for arterial drainage.  Even though the other work is very important, arterial drainage is the most important work to which the money could be put.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty mentioned the <Col N="958" /> maintenance of work done by the Office of Public Works and the local authorities. The local authorities are having difficulty in getting in money.  Rates have been removed from a great deal of land and from houses.  Local authorities have to depend on the percentage they get down from the Department.  This is where the EEC should come in.  I wonder are we making the proper approach to the EEC.</P>
    <P>It is important that drainage maintenance be made part of the western package.  This has been neglected for years.  It is useless draining land if the drains are not maintained afterwards, but county councils cannot afford to do the work because of tightness of money, the source of which has been dwindling.  Naturally, drainage is important in areas other than the west but we have been affected repeatedly by drains filling up with silt and consequent flooding.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his speech on the activities of the Board of Works.  I agree with most of what was included in regard to agriculture, drains, storehouses and so on.  All the works mentioned are essential.  I compliment the Minister particularly on his interest in national monuments, very important as a tourist attraction.  At home in Kil-connel we have an old abbey on my wife's land.  The road to it was inaccessible for tourists but work on it has been done. The Board of Works are doing excellent work in that connection but I would ask that they would consider, in this Year of the Disabled, providing access for people in wheelchairs.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by returning to drainage which is a serious problem in the west. We are disappointed and annoyed by stories about scarcity of engineers.  People will not accept it any longer.  The Irish electorate are much younger and more educated these days and we will not any longer get away with trying to cod them.</P>
    <P>I could go on all day and repeat all Deputy Hegarty said but that would not be of much benefit to the people in the Press Gallery or to the people taking notes.  They do not want to hear repetition. When I was growing up I was taught to say as much as possible in as short a time as possible, but since I came in here <Col N="959" /> I have learned that the idea is to say as little as possible in as long a time as possible.  I will wind up by again asking the Minister to do a good job of drainage under the western package.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his comprehensive statement, but I shall open my contribution by referring to something not included in his speech. The Minister should be aware that by decision of the EEC Commission on 5 December 1980, a sum of £400,000 was allocated for the purpose of a Shannon drainage study.  That decision was addressed to the Department of Finance in Dublin and the purpose of the allocation was to carry out a final study of the Shannon flooding problem.  The problem has been talked about since 1956 and I am worried and concerned lest the Government would let this opportunity slip. If they do, it will be an example of outrageous discrimination against the people of the Shannon catchment area, Counties Cavan, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Roscommon, Galway, Westmeath, Offaly and Tipperary.  Those people made their views known about flooding many a long day ago.  They have tried to overcome major difficulties in this respect and they have the full support of all the farming organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that there will be fierce agitation throughout the Shannon basin if work is not done to relieve flooding there.  I have been asking questions in the House and the Minister's replies have referred to staff shortages. That is not sufficient reason and I reject it.  I do not think it is correct.  A conference in Athlone in 1976 was attended by a senior Board of Works representative who said he was strongly in favour of comprehensive Shannon drainage. Under the auspices of the surrounding county committees of agriculture a meeting was held in the courthouse in Tullamore on 24 April last year and that, too, was attended by senior officials from the Department.  They stated they hoped investigations would commence before the end of 1980.  On 15 November 1979 the then Minister for Economic <Col N="960" /> Planning and Development, Deputy O'Donoghue, met a deputation from the Shannon catchment area and accepted the need for the setting up of a team to carry out investigations.</P>
    <P>At that time there appeared to be approval to do this.  However, I cannot see any allocation for this survey in the Estimate or in the speech of the Minister of State.  It will be necessary for the Office of Public Works to provide £600,000 in order to get an allocation of £400,000 from the EEC but there does not appear to be any allocation made for this work by the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me a question about this matter recently. I told him that when we were preparing our Estimate we had not been notified by the EEC at that time that the 40 per cent grant was available to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not as familiar with what is happening in Brussels as are the Department.  I became aware of this matter in January but the Commission's decision was made on 5 December.

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Minister stated that there were consultations between the Departments of Agriculture, Economic Planning and Development, Finance, the ESB and An Foras Talúntais and that such consultations were likely to continue.  I am aware of this because as a representative from the area in question I have been trying to co-ordinate these efforts with those of the local committee of agriculture and the local authority.  We have been hearing about these consultations for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came here today specifically to ask <Col N="961" /> the Minister when money will be provided for the survey.  In his written reply to me he stated &ldquo;No staff has yet been specially recruited for the investigation and no funds for the project have yet been received from the EEC&rdquo;.  It saddens me that this is the case.  The project will cost £1 million and it must be completed in a two-year period.  The application was made to the EEC on 14 May 1980.  They decided to give us the money but we have not allocated staff to carry out the work. It is the duty of the Government to provide the necessary back-up services for projects.  The money has been allocated to us by Brussels but we have not collected one penny of it.  This is a serious matter and I want the Minister to let us know when he intends recruiting staff to carry out an investigation.</P>
    <P>It might be of benefit to the House to outline the situation.  What is involved here is a very considerable area &mdash; approximately one-fifth of the country. There are 12 counties involved and there are approximately 470,000 people living in the areas concerned.  Along the Shannon there are about 40 towns and each town has a population in excess of 700 persons.  The land acreage involved is approximately 250,000 acres.  I live in one of the areas and I see roads, farmyards and private dwellings flooded every winter. Bord na Móna carry out work in the catchment area and any drainage work carried out would also help them.</P>
    <P>It worries me that this matter has become a political football and Deputy Callanan admitted this some time ago. This matter was raised in the House last Wednesday and even though a sum of £400,000 from the EEC is available for the work the subject did not merit much publicity in the national papers on the following day.  On the contrary, it is nearly regarded as a laugh.  I do not blame the political commentators but the matter is serious and should not be treated in a light-hearted way.</P>
    <P>The drainage of the Shannon area is a major problem for the country.  Every Government shied away from it.  I imagine that in the Department of Finance there is a considerable amount of hesitation about accepting this money <Col N="962" /> from Brussels and going ahead with the survey because once the survey is done and a study made there will be heavy pressure on the Government of the day to see that the work is carried out.  The people in the Department of Finance are far-seeing.  They will be in the Department irrespective of the government in office and they will be put under pressure to provide additional finances to meet the work, even though I hope Brussels will help in giving a major contribution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan said that drainage work on the river Suck has been held up pending work on the Shannon.  The same applies to work on the river Brosna in my area.  I am sure it is affecting other areas also.  There is goodwill on all sides of this House to carry out this major study.  This will be the final study on this matter. After that it will be up to whatever Government are in power to have this major work carried out.  The net result of the survey will be that a comprehensive job will be recommended.  I hope the Government will do it like that rather than on a piecemeal basis.  Senior officials in the Board of Works have constantly emphasised that the drainage of the Shannon can be carried out only on a comprehensive basis.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters which will be affected if the recommended study is carried out.  The drainage of the Shannon will affect water supplies.  Fishing will have to be included in this study because it is very important for our tourism. Fish farming, boating and cruising will also be affected.  The reopening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal is part of this work and it will make the Shannon the finest river in Europe.  It will lead to the north and south being united and will have a great effect on tourism.</P>
    <P>It is important that we know what way we plan big industries coming into the country and the amount of water we allocate to them.  The matters I have mentioned will have to be looked into in this proposed study.  I am concerned about the absence of any reference in the Minister's speech to the £400,000 EEC allocation. I hope he will be able to tell us that the Government intend to take up this £400,000 and that the Government <Col N="963" /> allocation of £600,000 will be provided. I hope he will also be able to tell us that he intends to take on consultants, engineers, architects and any other people necessary to help his Department to carry out this work.</P>

I want a definite Government commitment about when the investigations will start and when the EEC money will be taken up.  This is of great importance to the people in the Shannon catchment area but it also extends to other rivers joining the Shannon, which cannot be drained until the Shannon is done.

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer particularly to national schools.  When a national school is being erected the main building is provided but no shelter is provided for the children who arrive by bus in the morning.  I have had a number of letters from different school managers about this matter.  One manager told me about a new school which was officially opened in 1980 but no shelter was provided for the children when they get off the buses. <Col N="964" /> Those schools cost very large sums of money.  It is a mistake not to provide a shelter.  The school, for insurance purposes, is not opened until the teacher arrives at the official opening time.  They do not allow the children into the school and as a result many of them are obliged to wait in the rain outside for between 30 minutes and one hour.  Special shelters should be provided so that the children when they arrive at the school can stand in out of the rain.  The provision of such shelters would not cost much money. Saint Joseph's national school, Tullamore, a comparatively new school, has been looking for such a shelter for sometime. A shelter is badly needed there. Another relatively new school also in need of such a shelter is the Shinrone national school.  I have been in touch with the Department of Education about that problem.  I do not know whether that is a matter for the Minister of state or the Department of Education but the Minister should have discussions with the Department of Education and prepare a general policy on this matter.  Those children travel in a warm bus from their homes but must hang around for a considerable time before the school opens and after school hours they must remain outside until the bus arrives to take them home.  A suitable shelter could be included in the drawings of new schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with the situation that exists at Longford national school, Kinnity, Birr, County Offaly.  That oneroom pre-fab school was erected approximately 15 years ago.  In the course of a letter to me on 15 April 1980 the Minister for Education stated that he had made inquiries and found that the Department had sanctioned a grant towards the cost of an extension to it.  The letter stated that it was understood that the Commissioners of Public Works had authorised the architect to prepare working drawings for the extension.  I gather there is confusion in relation to this matter and I do not think the Office of Public Works was asked to carry out this work.  I do not think I was meant to get the communication which I did from the Minister.  The roof on this pre-fab is sagging and the parents are concerned that it may collapse <Col N="965" /> or be blown off.  It is as bad a school as there is in the country.  You should inquire into this matter and communicate with me.  I am anxious to know if it is the intention to provide a new school in Longford, the most desirable thing, or, alternatively, if an effort will be made to improve the existing accommodation. This matter has been going on for three years.  Children of the area should be catered for.  The teacher at the school is an excellent person but the pre-fab is in a desperate condition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to bring to the attention of the Minister of State the position in relation to St. Columbas Christian Brothers School in Tullamore.  When the school was erected in 1959 it was to accommodate 140 pupils but now it caters for 340 pupils.  It is an excellent school in all respects.

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the matter up with the Department of Education.  I should now like to refer to St. Conleth's reformatory which is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  As the Minister and his Department are aware, Saint Conleth's is now being used as a store for items of historical interest from the National Museum, a lot of which were stored previously in Kilmainham.  I remember seeing a television programme showing how some of them were deteriorating and rotting at that time because they had been left out in the open.  I compliment the Office of Public Works on taking the initiative in providing an alternative site for these items of historical interest, many of which would have been rendered completely useless were it not for that action being taken.  They are at present being stored at Saint Conleth's in Daingean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What concerns me is that they are merely being stored there, kept under lock and key.  This is a huge building, with extensive walls all round it and so on, offering excellent security.  Rather than merely having those items of historical interest stored there I would hope that, through consultation with the National Museum, they could be displayed there.  This would entail an extension of the National Museum to Saint Conleth's in Daingean.  County Offaly, in the midlands, with the Office of Public Works having overall supervisory responsibility.  It would also be accessible to many tours in that area.  It is a terrible waste to see this building being used merely as a store.  What is even more sad is that all of those items will be left there until some other alternative premises are found.  In my view it is not commonsense <Col N="967" /> to have all of these items kept under lock and key because they are of tremendous public and historical interest which should be on display for our people.</P>
    <P>With this in mind I would ask the Minister to look into this matter.  If such a suggestion could be implemented I can assure the Minister that he would have the goodwill of all of the people in the midlands.  Daingean has every facility&mdash;tourists can have meals there.  Tullamore is nearby, and there are parking facilities and so on available in the town of Daingean.  At present local people are dissatisfied that this fine building is being used merely as a store.  Indeed, a museum there would provide employment in the area also, which would be most welcome. This building and grounds covers acres. There is also a farm there which has been taken over by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I know this suggestion would not normally come within the ambit of the Minister's responsibility, but perhaps his Department would consider having discussions with the Industrial Development Authority to ascertain whether or not they would be interested in a portion of this building and surrounding lands because of the acreage involved.  This building is as fine and extensive as can be found.  There are also many facilities there&mdash;squash courts, tennis courts, ball alleys: I might not be correct about squash&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister's Department are the owners of this building and it is a crying shame to see a building of this nature closed down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it would be up to the Department of Education to take the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>As the building comes within the ambit of the Minister's Department. I would put it to the Minister to <Col N="968" /> make representations to the Government, as I have already done, and to the Department of Education to have this initiative taken because it is of utmost importance to all of the people involved.</P>
      <P>I want to bring one other matter to the Minister's attention.  The old library in Tullamore was purchased by the Minister's Department approximately 12 to 18 months ago.  It is quite an extensive building which was to have been replaced by new offices for Government services. Perhaps the Minister would investigate this matter and let me know what plans his Department have in this respect.  I note that it is not included under any of the subheads in the Department's Estimate. There are a number of Government offices situated in Tullamore that are unsatisfactory.  For example, the building housing the Land Commission is not at all suitable or satisfactory and the people there are working under difficult conditions.  There are other offices there as well.  I understand there is a new district veterinary office planned for Tullamore also.  I would hope there would be some endeavour to have most of these services located in the one centre in that area.  The people of Tullamore and surrounding areas are anxious that these offices would be provided in Tullamore at the earliest possible opportunity.  Perhaps the Minister would deal with this matter also when replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to two other matters before concluding.  As the Minister is aware, the Slieve Bloom range of mountains runs right across the midlands, across Laois and Offaly, and is a most important tourist area.  The Minister is probably aware also that Lakelands are providing quite an amount of money towards the development of the Slieve Bloom area as a tourist attraction.  The Forest and Wildlife Service are co-operating in this matter, as are also the county councils of Laois and Offaly.  The reason I am raising this matter here this morning is that the Office of Public Works have been involved in this in a very small way only.  I feel the Minister's Department could undertake a considerable amount of work and offer much help in the development of this mountain range as a tourist <Col N="969" /> attraction.  The construction of some roads has been undertaken by the Forestry Service, which have then been taken over and developed by the county councils.  Throughout this range of mountains there are to be found many places and items of historical interest.  Some of these should be examined carefully by the Minister's Department to ascertain whether or not they should be preserved as national monuments and maintained as such.  If the Minister wishes, I can obtain details of them.</P>
    <P>Many fine buildings and monuments throughout the country have been restored by the Office of Public Works. I would hope that the Minister and his Department would carry out an in-depth study of this whole area in order to ascertain whether or not his Department can provide assistance.  There is a Slieve Bloom Association, a positive and active group of forward-thinking people.  Perhaps officials of the Minister's Department might have consultations with these people.  I might add that these people are more conversant with the historical aspects of the area than I am.  Indeed, they have undertaken an in-depth study of this whole area going back hundreds of years.  There are many fine books on it.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of the Slieve Bloom range that are worthy of support from the Minister's Department and I know that the Department will be forthcoming and anxious to provide help.  This range has been extensively developed by the Forestry and Wildlife Service, the Lakelands organisation and the county council.  I would ask the Minister, over the next number of weeks, to see if he can arrange consultations with the forestry service, the Lakelands organisation and with the Slieve Bloom Association because there are many items that the Department can assist with.</P>
    <P>I started by discussing drainage and I will conclude on it.  In regard to the Barrow and the Nore there have been a number of deputations going back over the last ten years and no positive move has been made in regard to those rivers. The Barrow covers Portarlington and Mountmellick and the Nore covers Durrow <Col N="970" /> and the area around there.  When the Barrow drainage scheme was handed over to the authority that works under the Laois and Offaly drainage board they were told to maintain the river in the condition it was in.  They are doing everything they can to maintain the river.  But further powers should be granted to the drainage boards and to the county councils to enable them to improve these rivers. At present they are limited in what they can do and all they can do is maintain them.  More money should be provided to enable them not only to maintain the rivers but to extend the schemes.  Perhaps the Minister would look into this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to go a stage further in regard to drainage because it is very important.  We have had, in relation to the Nore, a number of deputations consisting of public representatives from Carlow and Kilkenny and also Laois and Offaly.  There is a huge expanse of land all across the south of Laois which is flooded and I would ask the Minister to do something positive about it because there is continued unhappiness in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech has covered a wide ranging list of topics, all of which are of the utmost importance.  I am glad to see that quite a lot of improvemenst in regard to these matters have been implemented. The Minister of State said he hoped he would be present when the final survey of the Shannon is carried out.  I hope that the work will be carried out soon.  If the Minister is responsible for allocating that £600,000 and having the work carried out I will take off my hat to him and shake hands with him.  No matter who does it the people in the Shannon catchment area will be very grateful. When it is done it will be a major breakthrough for all of us because it has been talked about and, sadly, laughed at.  It is probably the finest river in Europe and it is up to us to ensure that this very valuable asset is utilised properly and that whatever benefits can be obtained from <Col N="971" /> it are obtained.  Up to now nothing has been done about it and the people are blaming the politicians no matter what side they are on, and possibly they are right.  This survey is a two-year survey and it is of the utmost importance that it be carried out at the earliest opportunity. Then we can get down to the job of seeing that the work is done.  I am sorry to have laboured this so long but, living there, I can see the problems.  I have often gone to Banagher and looked across and one would think one was looking out into the Atlantic because the whole area in front is flooded.  There is a similar situation further up towards Shannonbridge.  I will be listening with interest to the Minister's concluding remarks to see what he is going to do with regard to this survey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to congratulate the Minister of State on bringing in this Vote.  I would also like to congratulate him on the magnificent work he is carrying out in the Office of Public Works.  I note that the sum of £½ million has been included for the purchase of sites to build new offices under the programme of decentralisation of Government staff.  This is a clear indication of the Government's intention to proceed as fast as possible with the purchase of sites where sites are not already available and to erect the new offices.  I am glad that Killarney is one of the centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also glad to know that the Vote provides for the purchase of land for national parks and the national monuments and waterways services and that provision is made for the purchase of additional land where necessary.  I would like to congratulate the Office of Public Works for the manner in which they acquired land in the Killarney area, particularly the manner in which they have sealed off completely the Lakes of Killarney and the immediate zone around there from undesirable developments. The OPW put a good deal of planning, thought and hard work into the acquisition of these lands and they deserve the greatest credit and congratulations for so doing.  A feasibility study is being carried <Col N="972" /> out at the moment in relation to Killarney and I would like to see this study expedited as there is great potential for recreational and other purposes in the great national park which surrounds Killarney and which is right on the verge of the town.  Not alone is it the greatest asset, it is also one of the greatest national recreational assets in the country.  In recent years many additional employees have been taken on there and I believe that this park when fully developed and during the course of its development will provide one tremandous source of employment in this district.</P>
    <P>The provision of £1.6 million in respect of a programme for the decentralisation of Government Departments is well worth noting.  It is for the building works for this year, and how serious the Government consider this programme to be is shown by the fact that they intend to carry out a substantial amount of the building work this year.</P>
    <P>The OPW are doing tremendous work in regard to national parks and monuments and for this they do not always get credit, particularly in relation to monuments. This Department have done tremendous work in the field of acquiring, preserving and maintaining monuments.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the new sewage treatment plant at Muckross House, Killarmey, is nearing completion.  I have been advocating this scheme for a long number of years and it is gratifying to know that at long last it is almost completed.  I have no doubt from a recent visit to the area that the scheme will prevent any danger of future pollution in that part of Killarney. It is a scheme that could be used as an example by local authorities in many counties in relation to prevention of lake pollution.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1,790,000 is provided in respect of works which will be undertaken by the Department of Justice and of this more than £1.5 million is in respect of work for the Garda.  This provides for the erection of new Garda stations and residences and for the improvement of existing Garda accommodation.  I urge the Minister of State to take a particular interest in the Garda station in Killarney which requires either replacement or substantial <Col N="973" /> improvement works to be carried out.  This Garda station is in a very important tourist town and many visitors call to the station making routine inquiries. Such inquiries are dealt with in police stations in countries throughout the world and it is natural for people coming to Ireland to go to the local Garda station to make certain types of inquiries.  It is only right and fitting that a town like Killarney should have one of the best-planned and most attractive Garda stations in the country.  I urge the Minister of State to take cognisance of this fact.  I urge him also to examine closely the position in relation to the residence attached to the Garda station in Beaufort in south Kerry.  This is a rather old building which should be completely renovated or replaced as soon as possible.  I would like very much, therefore, if the Minister could see his way to bringing both Killarney and Beaufort up on the list.</P>
    <P>I note that £60,000 is provided in respect of an extension to Valentia Coast Radio Station for which tenders will shortly be invited.  This is another scheme which I have been advocating for some time and therefore I am gratified to see it being brought to a conclusion.  I have no doubt that this money will be very well spent and again I congratulate the Minister and the OPW for setting out to invite tenders shortly for this scheme.</P>
    <P>I note as well that the OPW are undertaking the provision of the buildings required for the telecommunications programme. This is a very important programme and providing these buildings will add considerable work to what I would regard as the already understaffed OPW.  It is well worth noting that of this programme about 150 buildings at present are under construction.  This gives an idea of the magnitude and extent of the programme.</P>
    <P>Of the £10,470,000 which is being sought and provided in connection with the arterial drainage scheme being undertaken under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, I will reiterate what I stated in previous debates on this Estimate.  I have maintained for a number of years past that about 10 per cent should be taken <Col N="974" /> from this subhead and that the money should be utilised in doing what I would call essential repair work and maintenance work on smaller rivers and on streams where such work is required and where the rivers and streams do not qualify for grants under the western drainage scheme.  These rivers are overgrown with bushes and little islands have been created.  There are also heaps of silt. These rivers could be cleared at a low cost, with the co-operation of the adjoining land owners.  I am thinking particularly of the River Flesk which flows through the parish of Glenflesk and drains into the Lakes of Killarney.  When there is heavy rain the people in the valley are in danger of losing their lives.  During a serious flood in the area last autumn it was very fortunate that a number of people were not drowned.  Some families were awakened at 4 o'clock in the morning when water came into their houses as a result of the flooding of the valley and the River Flesk could not cope with the volume of water.</P>
    <P>The Forest and Wildlife Service of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry have added to the problem by planting and draining thousands of acres on a hillside where the river commences.  This means that water flows into the river faster than ever before and comes down through the Flesk Valley into the Lakes of Killarney at a far quicker pace than before.  It brings with it a volume of water which the river banks cannot carry and which is impeded by bushes, silt and little islands.  Some of the 10 per cent which I have been talking about down the years should be taken out of the arterial drainage fund and devoted to solving the problems in rivers like the Flesk.  I strongly urge the Minister to do his utmost to see that a sum of between £50,000 and £100,000 is provided this year to have something done with this river.  A survey should be carried out in conjunction with local farmers and land owners.  They would be most co-operative and would be prepared to take away the debris thrown up on the river banks following the clearance of the river by the Office of Public Works or some other agency.  We are only looking for a minor scheme to <Col N="975" /> clear the bushes, the islands and the silt. It would not cost very much, it would not take too long to do it and very little machinery would be required to do the job.  Most of it could be done by manpower. I strongly urge the Minister to take positive action in this regard at an early date.  I have submitted a detailed document to the Minister of State in connection with this matter.  It was prepared by a local action committee on behalf of people who have suffered for a long time and who are most anxious to get something done.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister say in his reply whether the River Lung will be drained under the Arterial Drainage Act?</P>
    <P>Subhead G.3 covers the cost and maintenance of completed drainage and embankment schemes and the cost is recovered from the county councils concerned. I would like the Office of Public Works to accept responsibility for the maintenance of completed drainage and embankment schemes.  I know this is a hardy annual in Estimate debates, but there is a lot of merit in it.  County councils should no longer be asked to pay the cost.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to see that the Minister has provided money to cover the cost of certain coast protection schemes.  Something positive should be done in relation to getting a coast protection scheme in the Maharees, near Castlegregory, County Kerry.  This is an area which has been eaten away by coast erosion.  It is a valuable tourist resort and has beautiful long sandy beaches.  These beaches are almost circular so no matter what part of the area visitors come to they can always find a spot which will be sheltered, warm and suitable for swimming, regardless of the prevailing winds.  The real problem here is coast erosion.  Local people are afraid, and I am also concerned, that this area will become an island if steps are not taken in the near future to carry out a scheme of coast protection work.</P>
    <P>On visiting the area recently I was amazed to find that so much of the coast had been eroded by the sea during a period of two years.  If the problem is not tackled very soon the area will become <Col N="976" /> an island and a much greater problem and much more expense will be involved so far as the State and the local authority are concerned.  I appreciate that some steps have been taken by the county council and that the necessary prohibition order has been made by them and ratified by the Minister for Transport. This clears the way for the Office of Public Works to provide the necessary moneys for the work and to enter into negotiations with Kerry County Council regarding the planning of a scheme of work and its implementation.  This is one of the most urgent problems in the county in this context.</P>
    <P>Another matter that is causing concern relates to the proposal by the Office of Public Works to impose a charge for boating on the Lakes of Killarney.  Having regard to the teething problems in this connection, I would ask the Minister to indicate his willingness to meet a deputation from the people concerned. It will be some time before certain people will understand the reasons for the necessity for a licensing system for boating on the lakes.  I am convinced that there should be a licensing system for this activity because in the absence of a licensing system it is virtually impossible to implement rules, regulations and, in particular, safety standards.  There is no point in waiting until such time as there may be a major tragedy on the lakes before taking action to ensure that proper standards are applied.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Office of Public Works for the tremendous job they are doing at Ross Castle, Killarney. The work involved is slow and cumbersome. Because of the dangerous condition in which the building was, this restoration work cannot be speeded up.  I have been in that area many times and I have visited the castle during the course of the restoration work.  I have found that the men are doing an excellent job in very difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>On the question of national schools, I would urge the Minister to expedite the approval of plans for Raheen national school in the parish of Glenflesk and to invite tenders at the earliest date possible so that the work can get underway.  I <Col N="977" /> hope, also, that work will go ahead as fast as possible on the new school at Ballyferriter.</P>
    <P>I note that £4 million is being allocated for harbour work.  In this respect I would urge that the Office of Public Works undertake a survey of the Dingle and Ballydavid areas.  A major scheme was undertaken at Dingle in about 1973 but fishermen and others in that area tell me the clearing of a shallow channel into Dingle harbour is very necessary.  In addition, they are interested that a survey be conducted regarding the potential of Ballydavid pier and harbour.  I would urge that there be a survey conducted also in respect of Valentia harbour.  Considerable work has been executed at the pier there but there is an important fish-processing plant at Reenard Point and the proprietors of that plant find it very difficult to land their catches because of the condition of the pier and because of the nature of the harbour.  In that area also there is Portmagee pier and harbour which is based on very deep water.  This, also, is an area that is well worth investigating in terms of its potential for the future.  These areas are known locally as the Valentia harbour areas.  I urge that they be investigated in the interests of the fishing industry there.  I compliment the Minister and his staff on the introduction of this comprehensive Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the question of the national interest, this Estimate provides us with the opportunity of raising matters that relate to our own constituencies and of highlighting the problems that arise from time to time in our areas. It is not generally understood that the Minister of State in charge of the Board of Works has a direct responsibility on his own to undertake works of national importance without getting clearance from the different Departments to which he is responsible for the erection and maintenance of buildings and so on.  So, any criticism we may have of the system does not necessarily apply to the Minister who is regarded by us as a man who can lend us his ear and listen to our problems. I have found him very helpful and we <Col N="978" /> have done quite well in Clare in financial allocations since he took office.</P>
      <P>I shall mention a few areas where he has recognised the tourist potential.  He has provided the first stage of a national park in a very prominent area which is known world-wide, the Burren in North Clare.  I hope he will arrange in the near future to provide the necessary access roads, appoint a biologist and possibly an archaeologist.  This would help tourists who explore, winter and summer, this unique area.  We hope the Minister will extend the area under his control.  He would be contributing to tourism in the country and particularly in the county, because tourists from practically all over the world are continually coming there. Even a few weeks ago I met quite a few of them there.  We appreciate the Minister's concern in that respect.</P>
      <P>I should also like to thank the Minister for his interest in amenity development in the Mount Shannon harbour area which I suppose could come under the River Shannon Navigation.  I would ask the Minister to look towards Killaloe and see if amenities there can be improved because we have there the winter berthage for boats plying the river during the tourist season.  We do not expect all the allocations at once.  We are quite happy to get reasonable consideration.  Development of the potential of our waterways and the recreational facilities which can be provided are long-term benefits in the sense that while dependent on tourism we are creating amenities which are valued both by tourists and our own people.</P>
      <P>There is rather heavy expenditure on the provision of frontier customs posts in quite a few areas.  I hope, and I think we all hope, it will not be necessary to continue to provide these for very long in the future and that as a result of rational thinking on both sides of the Border and a more sensible approach by all parties we should be able to dispense with frontier posts for any purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has responsibility for the provision of office accommodation for the Army I will refer specifically to the question of an FCA headquarters in Clare.  In the past 40 years it has been located in the county capital at Ennis. <Col N="979" /> Recently, personnel have been transferred from there to an area adjacent to Limerick city and the company headquarters has also been moved out of the town.  I do not know if the initiative should come from the Department of Defence or whether the Minister himself could examine the possibility of the erection of suitable headquarters for the FCA and the permanent defence training corps there&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to wait for a direction from the Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the Minister for Defence in the county and we can whisper into his ear.  There is a demand for this headquarters in Ennis where it has been located for the past 40 years.  Both from a military point of view and from the point of view of saving travelling expenses with a scarce commodity like fuel involved, the centre of the county is where we would like to see the headquarters.</P>
      <P>Having had discussions with the Minister on the possibility of erecting a central agricultural office in Ennis, I again assume he has to get the all-clear from the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we would provide that office ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a public demand for the erection of an office.  I am not very good on the economics of this but believe that, long-term, having one's own building is much better than renting expensive premises over a long period of years.  There is dissatisfaction amongst officers who are located in rented premises in the county, but that is a matter to be considered by the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem most discussed by Deputies on both sides of the House is the provision of adequate finances to serve the needs of our different flooded areas. Any undertaking, whether it be in surveys or expenditure, is determined by the available finances.  The EEC will provide <Col N="980" /> 50 per cent of the money expended on arterial drainage but because of escalating costs and inflation the actual work is being done very slowly.  If there is disappointment because of this slowing down, the Minister will understand it. Over 30 years or more there have been campaigns, public meetings and deputations about a river which floods the town of Ennis with its growing population. This is an expanding town in a growth area.  Farmers upstream have endured the hardship of unproductive flooded lands for which they are paying heavy rates.</P>
    <P>Recently, with our spokesman, for the Office of Works, Deputy Donnellan, we made a tour of some of the worst rivers in the county in this regard, at a period when flooding was very severe.  It was most disturbing to have to accept that this is something which did not just occur last year or this year but which has been evident over a long period.  One wonders about the Government's priorities, or those of the last or the penultimate Government, in relation to drainage, when it comes to expenditure of public finances. Until there is a greater recognition at the highest level of Government of the value of well-drained, well-fertilised land and until our members and our commissioners of the European Parliament come together to highlight the absence of adequate sums to deal properly with flooding in this country, there will be no real progress.</P>
    <P>Because of the priorities in the expenditure being undertaken by the Minister, to which he is limited, vast sums of money are allocated to consulates, and embassies, which I suppose by present standards are required, which other nations provide and about which we would like to be equally concerned.  However, it is very difficult to explain to people living on flooded land this expenditure of money outside the State in providing necessary facilities.  I am not always too happy that certain people in these consulates and embassies are as helpful as they might be to Irish people who need particular attention at particular times.  I have evidence&mdash;and fortunately it is isolated evidence&mdash;that on a few occasions <Col N="981" /> those who deserved to be treated with courtesy were not so treated.  I refer, in particular, to one occasion when an Irish Army officer did not get the attention he deserved from an unthinking, unconcerned junior office who perhaps had not established a proper standard of etiquette or decorum.  However, I shall go no further into this matter, because it is the concern of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I refer now to the areas of county Clare where I would like to see some surveys or studies made at this stage or some allocation of money, however small.  I refer to the river Fergus in Ennis, the Inagh river, the Scariff river and the Dunbeg-Cooraclare river where work was undertaken many years ago but which is now flooding farmland owned by small farmers who do not wish to move out of their holdings.  I hope that the Minister will pay some attention to these areas.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the areas where priority must be given, without a national policy one cannot expect any definite progress in preventing coastal erosion.  It is time to consider something which could have a very long-term effect if ignored. Years ago there was a lot of expenditure in many years, even on estuaries, but it is appreciated that everything is now much more expensive than it was.  Nevertheless, this country being an island, areas should be pinpointed for the eradication and prevention of coastal erosion.</P>
    <P>As regards the preservation and maintenance of our national monuments, I do not know what has been done in relation to certain prominent monuments in County Clare, for instance, in one historical area, Scattery Island, with its many round towers and churches which are a tourist attraction.  This is a few miles offshore from the town of Kilrush and is worthy of a survey and the provision of amenities on the island, to make that tourist area along the coast more attractive. We have some rare buildings and rare churches to remind us of our glorious, historic past.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the amount of arterial drainage carried out and the non-allocation of any money to relieve <Col N="982" /> flooding in County Clare, but I am still hopeful the Minister will allocate some small sum to the areas where the need is greatest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate, for more than £67 million, covers such a diversity of areas in which the Office of Public Works are employed that it would be very difficult to deal with every subhead at any given time.  Briefly I will try to deal with the areas in which I am concerned and where I think some changes should be effected.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works have been in existence in their present form since the foundation of the State.  Due to the diversity of their activities I consider that the time is ripe to have a look at this office and decide whether they should be allowed to continue in their present capacity or whether portion of their work should be hived off to other areas.  I mention that because of the conflict of opinion that often exists between officials of one Department and another.</P>
      <P>Since the Arterial Drainage Acts were passed, the Office of Public Works were responsible for arterial drainage.  One of the first schemes carried out by them was the Brosna arterial drainage scheme. Then we had a series of schemes which came in rapid succession year in and year out.  As time passed the problem of maintenance became more complex and more the concern of other Departments and the time is now opportune to decide if arterial drainage should be tied to the Office of Public Works or the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>In recent years many problems existed because of inadequate outfalls, inadequate planning and inadequate consultations between officers of the Office of Public Works and the Department of Agriculture.  I refer to areas not specifically covered by the Arterial Drainage Acts or by the catchment areas which have been included in the Acts.  Thousands of acres of farmland have been excluded from the catchment areas of all drainage schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture, through the offices of the land improvement services, move in at the request of <Col N="983" /> farmers who wish to carry out land developments. When the inspection is carried out they discover to their disappointment and dismay that there is a lack of outfall which would prevent specific drainage works from being carried out.  Then there is the battle between the engineers of the Office of Public Works and the officials of the Department arguing about the level to which the watercourse should be lowered or the area to which the water should be diverted.  This is a very serious problem which is causing a great deal of anger among the farming community and anybody interested in land improvements.</P>
    <P>An officer from the Department will tell the farmers that they need to have the outlet lowered by five feet and that it is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  They get in touch with the Office of Public Works and after six months an engineer might call on the aggrieved farmers and tell them that the watercourse is perfect and does not need to be deepened.  The result is that the scheme cannot be processed by the Department. The officers in the Office of Public Works do not make any effort to try to meet the needs of the farmers concerned, nor will they co-operate with the officials of the Department.  I have seen ample evidence of this lack of co-operation in my county of Westmeath.</P>
    <P>The time has come when the Department must take sole responsibility for drainage.  There are too many drainage authorities at present.  We have the major authority, the Office of Public works, then we have the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and every local authority.  The time has come when one Department should be responsible for all drainage schemes.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and his senior officials to have a long hard look at the role of the maintenance engineers employed by the Office of Public Works.  I am not satisfied that they are making any contribution towards the future progress of land improvement and I doubt if they are serving the real needs of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="984" /> Most people realise that when an arterial drainage scheme is carried out the cost of maintenance is levied on the local authority.  I come from a county which is expected to bear the brunt of these maintenance costs.  We have the Brosna drainage, a bit of the Shannon and the Inny drainage.  This is a statutory demand and the local authority are obliged to provide sums approaching £200,000 this year to the Office of Public Works for the maintenance of drainage schemes already carried out.  This is where the real problem arises.  I am satisfied the people responsible for this activity are not doing their duty nor are they serving the needs of the farming community.</P>
    <P>Time creates problems; progress creates problems, and this is the area where there is a great deal of dissatisfaction.  In my view the Department of Agriculture will have to be given a greater say in the administration of maintenance schemes which are at present operated by the Office of Public Works.  It is disastrous that a local authority are obliged to make available a certain sum of money while they have no say in where or how that money will be spent or whether it will be spent at all.  It is in the hands of the engineer who is often happier not to take action.  This is a source of great concern, and much valuable farmland is lying dormant and cannot be improved because of the lack of understanding and effort on the part of some engineers in the Office of Public Works.  Before any more surveys are carried out future demands regarding land improvement in the catchment area of rivers must be considered.</P>
    <P>I welcome the finance being made available for national parks and monuments. This is one of the most scenic countries in Europe and the OPW have made a major contribution.  Activity must be intensified if we are to preserve our national monuments in the way we would wish and I should like to see an extension of the activities of the OPW because they have become specialists in this field.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see the creation of more national parks and the OPW have been active in this field.  Recently a beautiful park and gardens came on the market in County Westmeath adjacent to the <Col N="985" /> shores of Lough Ennel.  Officials of the Department carried out an inspection and were impressed by the scenery of the area and the plant life there.  They expressed the opinion that it was unique in Ireland.  The land is still available and Westmeath County Council are endeavouring to acquire it as a public park. However, I would urge the Minister to acquire the land and designate it a national monument.  County Westmeath is known as the &ldquo;Killarney of the Midlands&rdquo; and it is not surprising that I am anxious everything should be done to ensure we get a fair share of the tourist traffic.  For that reason I appeal to the Minister to consider the possibility of acquiring this land.  His officials have given an excellent report and I compliment them on the speed with which they produced it.  This is one of the most valuable properties in Leinster and there should be greater consultation between the county council and the Department with a view to acquiring it for posterity.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that nowadays people have more leisure time than formerly and they are more conscious of the environment than ever before.  They will tend to make greater use of the amenities available and this is a worldwide trend. It is gratifying that people are becoming more and more conscious of the need to protect and improve the environment.</P>
    <P>I had expected some reference in the Minister's speech to the provision of a new Garda headquarters in Mullingar and I was surprised that this was not specifically mentioned.  The existing building is deteriorating rapidly and the gutters are hanging from the eaves.  It is in very bad condition both internally and externally and I had hoped the Minister would announce plans for the renovation of the building or for the provision of an alternative.  At present staff are working in overcrowded conditions in a building which could be regarded as unsafe.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister and the Government to continue the successful policy of decentralisation of the civil service.  Originally many civil servants expressed the view that this scheme would not work but now many of them wish to work in the <Col N="986" /> country.  This may not apply to senior civil servants who have been long established in Dublin but many of the younger staff members are determined to move back to country areas.  Recently in Mullingar and Athlone there were ten times more applicants for jobs than could be accommodated.  This is a clear indication that civil servants are prepared to work in the country and I am confident the decentralisation programme will be an outstanding success.  We tend to look on Dublin as being the whole of Ireland but that is not the case.  The people in Donegal, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Galway and elsewhere are entitled to the same recognition as the people in the capital.  For that reason I compliment the Government on their efforts towards decentralisation and I ask them to continue their efforts in that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason for the delay in the payment of disability benefit to a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 13 January 1981 and has been paid from 16 January, fourth day of incapacity, to 23 February, date of the latest medical evidence received.  He has also been paid pay-related benefit from 27 January, 13th day of incapacity.  The delay in payment was due to the fact that he quoted his insurance number, instead of his RSI number on second and third certificates, dated 19 and 26 January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say the exact delay in this case and will he say why there was no provision for the transition from insurance numbers to RSI numbers?  Will the Minister also say why the Department did not make a provision to cater for the difficulties which the <Col N="987" /> Department should have foreseen, a difficulty which will cause hardship to many people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department made enormous efforts to deal with this problem and are surmounting it.  This was discussed here before Christmas and I outlined the steps which the Department took to try to avoid this situation arising. In the case which the Deputy raises the failure to quote the RSI number is the problem.  In relation to that the Department have conducted a campaign on television and elsewhere to highlight the need to quote the two numbers at this time.  In addition, the Department are working very extensive overtime to solve this problem and to have the disability benefit system computerised.  It is a major change and I would ask Deputies to bear with us while we get the thing back to normal.  The other problem is that it has been possible gradually to increase the cross-indexation.  That means that an insurance number is cross-referenced with an RSI number.  When the system is completed we will be able to do that 100 per cent.  It can be done up to 75 per cent and the problem would be solved if the RSI numbers were quoted in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister would agree that if it is now possible to improve the cross-indexation of the old and the new numbers something should have been done for the changeover earlier in the year so that a person who quoted his insurance number would not have had a problem.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that it is obvious that adequate provision was not made for the transition to RSI numbers?  I say that because I have some experience of computers.  Will the Minister also agree that even the use of the initials RSI will lead to confusion because of the similarity with the initials PRSI?  I had that experience this morning in the Minister's office.  Will the Minister acknowledge that every day at the Department of Social Welfare hundreds of hungry people are queuing for their payments?  Will the Minister agree to stop prancing around the country singing songs and to do the job he is paid to do?</P>

      <P>In relation to the problem here, Deputy Mitchell has declared that he has some knowledge of computers but he will not find any group here who will handle 1.25 million files in the way in which the Department do.  Every time there is a problem in Social Welfare the Deputies on the other side of the House use the occasion to berate the Government of the day and the Department of Social Welfare.  My understanding of the situation is that we are over the peak of the problem.  The records section is now completed.

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 13 January 1981 and has been paid all benefit due from 17 January, fourth day of incapacity, to 16 February.  He was certified fit to resume work on 17 February.</P>
      <P>As the second and third medical certificates, dated 20 and 27 January 1981, bore only his insurance number, some delay occurred before they were associated with his first certificate which had been recorded under his RSI number.  He is not entitled to pay-related benefit.</P>

      <P>The Minister might consider changing the intitials RSI because of the confusion with PRSI.  He stated that people do not use their RSI numbers. As regards the question I wished to raise today by way of Private Notice Question, which was refused, and which I also raised two weeks ago, that was not the case.  The person submitted a medical certificate and RSI number and yet the Department had the gall to tell me today that his medical certificate was not supplied when the person had queued for <Col N="994" /> hours and handed it in.  Does the Minister still stand over his statement that the only problem is that people do not use their RSI number?</P>

      <P>In a number of cases raised specifically by the Deputy either the RSI number was not given or the medical referee said that the person was fit to go back to work.  That is a medical decision and not mine.  Another major element is that governing contributions.  Quite a few of them have not recorded their contributions for the year in question which means they cannot be seen to be in benefit. In some instances, this is due to employers not returning the information. In that case we provide credited contributions. We are giving credit even though we do not have the evidence in the first instance.  We are doing everything we can to improve the situation.  That is the reality of the situation.  I accept that it is a problem but I am doing what I can.</P>

Special investigations were made by my Department and as a result credit has been allowed for the contributions due.  Payment of benefit has now been made up to 26 January 1981, the date of the last certificate received.

      <P>He appealed and was examined by a second medical referee who also said he was capable of work.  These cases occur all the time.  When someone comes along and says he is incapable of work and it is doubted by the social welfare officer, the social welfare officer feels the person is capable of work and the case is referred to a medical referee after a certain length of time.  If, as in this case, the medical referee finds the person is capable of work, if the person appeals it is referred to a further medical referee.  On appeal for the third time it goes for an oral hearing.  It is difficult for the Department to do much more in such a case.</P>

He did not reply to the request and he was again asked to supply the necessary details in November 1980.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The claim in this case, which was received in my Department just before Christmas, was first investigated by the social welfare officer on 15 January.

He also had to make inquiries from the claimant's solicitors regarding the possible transfer of the farm.</P>
      <P>The necessary information to enable the claim to be referred to the local pension committee has only recently come to hand.  The social welfare officer is not, however, recommending payment of pension, as the claimant's means, consisting of half the weekly value of a holding, exceed the statutory limit laid down. If the pension committee's decision is unfavourable, the claimant will, of course, have a right of appeal against it.</P>

Payment was disallowed from that date and his case was the subject of three separate appeals.  His appeal for the period from January to 12 April 1978 was allowed but his claim since 13 April 1978 has been disallowed.</P>
      <P>During the last four years he has been examined on a number of occasions by different medical referees and on each occasion he was considered capable of work.  The orthopaedic report submitted by the Deputy was considered by the medical referee at the recent examination. He is, however, still considered capable of work and his case is again being referred for decision by an appeals officer.  It is understood that before deciding the case the appeals officer proposes to hold a hearing which this man will be invited to attend and to give evidence.

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 18 July 1979 and payment had been issuing at regular weekly intervals to 27 December 1980.  As he did not attend for an examination by a medical referee of my Department, payment was suspended after that date.  On receipt of an explanation for non-attendance, payment was restored and issued to 10 January 1981. Due to an error in recording the date to which payment was made, cheques ceased to issue after 12 January 1981.,</P>
      <P>Payment for the period from 12 January to 21 February 1981 has since been made, cheques issuing on 13 February, and the issue of payment at weekly intervals has been resumed.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit from 8 November 1980 in respect of an accident at work on 29 October 1980.  Before payment could be authorised on the claim it was necessary to seek confirmation from the employers that the incapacity arose out of an accident at work and the necessary inquiries were initiated.</P>
      <P>At the same time the question of paying him disability benefit on an interim basis, pending determination of his claim to injury benefit, was examined but it was discovered that he had no contributions to his credit in respect of the year 1978-79, the contribution year governing payment of disability benefit on the claim. Further inquiries were, therefore, necessary to establish the duration of the employment in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two sets of inquiries have now been completed and it has been confirmed by the employers that he had sustained the injury during the course of his employment.  Injury benefit was, accordingly, awarded from 8 November 1980 and payment of all benefit due has issued to him in respect of the period up to 16 January 1981.  In the absence of medical evidence of incapacity he is not entitled to payment after 16 January 1981.  If he was in fact incapable of work after that <Col N="1017" /> date he should submit covering medical evidence when the question of payment will be considered as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>This is a typical case where a man, his wife and five children were left without anything up to about a week ago from 7 January last.  Is the Minister aware that this man was in hospital for some of that period?  Would the Minister not agree that the social welfare <Col N="1018" /> contributors who pay so dearly for this benefit should not suffer in this way because of the change-over?  Is the Minister aware that the change-over has caused suffering not alone to this family but to families all over the place and that it is grossly unfair to have a system which has inflicted so much hardship?  I am familiar with this family and I know what they suffered.  If it was not for the supplementary allowance they would have died of starvation.</P>

There were no certificates received between 19 January 1981 and 9 February 1981.  Deputy Pattison asked me earlier about sending individual letters.  An issue comes from the computer in those cases.  These are on the monthly system of certificates and these are the ones called &ldquo;automatic&rdquo;. They are not put off immediately but if no certificate has come in, the computer will automatically issue a letter stating that no certificate is in and then approximately six weeks after the certificate is due and if nothing has happened at that stage it is put off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the question of decentralisation and I dealt with the centralisation of Government Departments throughout the country.  It is a step in the right direction and it has received the wholehearted endorsement of all the Irish people.  I appeal to the Minister to implement a more ambitious programme of decentralisation.  The private sector could be called upon to participate in this decentralisation.  The Minister mentioned that it is hoped to involve the private sector in the provision of public buildings.  This is an opportunity to ensure that the private sector play their part.  We have a large number of building contractors capable of providing such buildings and we have a number of financiers willing to provide the finance. The Minister should pursue this policy as energetically as possible because there is no doubt about the need for decentralisation. The provision of buildings always seemed to be a problem in this area but <Col N="1028" /> the Government should get the private sector involved and then we would have suitable buildings in the shortest possible time.</P>
      <P>In relation to the £10 million allocation for arterial drainage, I will refer to the River Shannon, which presents a huge problem in drainage.  The draining of the Shannon has been talked of over the years.  It is mentioned at every general election and at every by-election being held on either side of the Shannon. Twelve counties are affected by the Shannon, so it is not surprising that it has been a contentious and emotive issue down through the years.  However, the people continue to suffer.  If money is being made available for the carrying out of a survey it should proceed with all possible speed.  The long-suffering rural communities are anxious to see positive steps being taken in relation to the drainage of the Shannon.  I realise there is no easy solution to it and that more than the provision of money is involved because of all the varied interests involved.  The ESB are involved as well as the Inland Fisheries Trust and various other trusts and they have a vested interest in maintaining specific levels at specific points.  I have no doubt that positive action will be taken in relation to the survey because words and promises must be replaced by positive action.</P>
      <P>If money from Brussels is available, I welcome it, and I would ask the Minister to make the money available for this project. The Minister mentioned the shortage of engineers but I have no doubt that he will be able to get all the engineers he requires.  The best engineers should be engaged.  I am not satisfied with the efforts made by some of our more junior staffs.  They are not interested or dedicated to their work although they are in sheltered positions and do not need to worry about layoffs or redundancies.  We are justified in asking these people to give of their best and nothing else will satisfy the long-suffering community along the banks of the Shannon.  I visited people in flooded areas near Athlone and it is a pity that our planners could not visit these areas and see for themselves the suffering of these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> Successive Governments have talked of this problem but at last the light is beginning to appear.  Let us hope that the survey will commence and eventually some progress will be made towards draining the Shannon.  Let us hope that when the Minister and his Department start work on the survey they will receive the wholehearted co-operation of all the other interests.  I mentioned earlier the conflict between the Department of Agriculture and the engineers of the Board of Works to highlight the problems that exist.  When the survey on the Shannon commences let us hope that the ESB, the Inland Fisheries Trust and all the other interests will give their full support and co-operation.  That is one reason we need a national drainage authority.  At present we have too many Government Departments engaged in drainage, the result being that there will always be areas neglected.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with the problem of the provision and improvement of national schools.  Here I should say that the Office of Public Works are not always the culprits, that there are times when local organisations may be responsible for the holding-up of the provision of a national school or the carrying out of improvements to an existing one. One often hears teachers' organisations or somebody else condemning the Government, blaming them for all the problems, but it must be remembered that it is not always the Government, the Office of Public Works or their engineers who are at fault.  At times it may well be the fault of the local community.</P>
    <P>I was pushing the Minister and his Department for the provision of an extension to a school in the county and, having got the files available, I discovered that those involved at local level had not even applied for planning permission.  I give that example to illustrate that it is not always officials or departmental inspectors who are at fault; it may well be local organisations, school managers or others.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of asking the Minister to make a special effort to have improvements proceeded with at Rochfortbridge <Col N="1030" /> boys' national school in County Westmeath.  Deputy Enright mentioned another school on the Westmeath-Longford border, at Ballynahown. I understand that a successful tender has been placed for the erection of that school and I see no reason why building work should not now commence. There is another school in my county, situated at Curramore, adjacent to Mullingar where there are three prefabs. They are not very satisfactory and constitute a fire hazard.  The recent fire disaster in Dublin should bring home to all of us the importance of having all our public buildings rendered safe, the importance of ensuring that we have buildings that are as fire proof as humanly possible.  In my opinion prefabs are neither safe nor fire proof.  But they have served a purpose, they have succeeded in providing additional classroom buildings to meet the needs of the day and they should not be condemned just because they are a fire hazard.  They were provided nearly always in a temporary capacity to serve a temporary need.  Of course the ultimate aim should be the provision of proper, permanent buildings.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to proceed as rapidly as possible with the improvement of the schools I have mentioned. This is a matter which always seems to attract a great deal of public attention.  Indeed it is one about which very often people's tempers become frayed because of their concern for the wellbeing of their children.  We must remember that if we look after our children &mdash; the people of tomorrow &mdash; then it is an investment in the future and certainly something that will be appreciated by those who benefit most.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the provision and repair of courthouses.  I do not know if the word &ldquo;courthouse&rdquo; was used, but the Department of Justice were involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That was the point I was just about to make.  To date local authorities have been responsible for the repair, maintenance and upkeep of all courthouses throughout the country.  This is an area in which the Office of Public Works should become involved.  They are now responsible for all public buildings in the country.  They should take over the maintenance and running of all courthouses because in most major towns today they already have the staff &mdash; caretakers, office cleaners and so on.  I do not see any difficulty in transferring responsibility for their maintenance from the local authorities to the Office of Public Works.  I do see a difficulty for the Department of Justice because they are not involved with buildings or their maintenance.  The Office of Public Works would be the most competent body to administer and maintain these courthouses. I would respectfully suggest that the Minister examine this question and ascertain whether or not it would be possible for the Office of Public Works to take over their maintenance, making full use of the staff already employed in most major towns.</P>

      <P>In regard to the acquisition and maintenance of national monuments I compliment the staff of the Office of Public Works on their work to date; they are possibly the most competent staff in the country.  But I should like to see officials of the office of Public Works, archaeologists and all those employed, taking a greater interest in some of our more neglected national monuments. Probably we have more national monuments than any other country in Europe. <Col N="1032" /> It is important that we get to know more and more about our past because, as the old proverb says: a nation which forgets its past has no future to look to.  However, I should like to compliment the Office of Public Works to date on their efforts in the field of archaeology.  I feel a great deal more has been achieved than that with which their officials have been credited.  They have done a magnificent job throughout the country.  I should like to see their exploratory efforts extended further because of the value of their work.  Indeed, the public have a greater right to know the extent of work being carried out by our archaeologists throughout rural Ireland at present.  We tend to hear of their work only when some big issue crops up, such as Wood Quay or the like.  But there are thousands of Wood Quay's throughout Ireland, national monuments just as valuable as ever Wood Quay was.  These national monuments are being explored and research is being undertaken constantly by the officials of the Office of Public Works.  They even have a summer programme when they set to work and engage part-time labour.  That exercise should receive more publicity than it does at present.</P>
      <P>I suppose we are not the people who can dictate to the national press what they should or should not publish.  But this is an area deserving more public recognition than it is receiving at present. The only way the public can be made aware of the activities of these people is through the national and local press. However, I compliment the Minister and his staff on their success to date in this field and express the hope that they continue this useful work.  Indeed, I wish them well in their future exploratory work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk of the £67 million, the total amount of expenditure this year by the Office of Public Works, it is only right that we make some reference to the cost of maintaining our buildings abroad. When we realise that we are an island nation, a nation dependent entirely on our exports, then we realise also the importance of our embassies, the importance of ensuring that our embassies are <Col N="1033" /> alert to the needs of the community at home, to the need to develop these embassies and have them properly staffed by people who are competent to explore new markets and to ensure outlets for our exportable goods.  We all talk about providing industry but we cannot provide industry unless we have a market for the product we are manufacturing. We can play a magnificent role here and in some areas that is being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the importance of our embassies and consular buildings abroad, I fully support the efforts being made to provide such facilities.  They are more important now than they have ever been before.  I often feel dismayed when some people condemn the Office of Public Works for providing such buildings abroad, saying that we should be carrying out drainage in some place or other instead.  Both are necessary in this day and age.  Therefore it is most important that the Minister and his staff continue expanding the embassies abroad and providing new buildings whenever they are necessary.</P>
      <P>There is nothing more I can say at this stage except that I hope the Minister and his staff will examine some of the proposals I have made and consider the criticisms I have made.  I tried to highlight the problem areas in the Department.  I realise it is not easy to effect changes overnight.  But because of the number of people involved in the Office of Public Works there is a need to look at the entire operation to see if certain changes can be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have waited to speak in this debate on the Estimate for the Office of Public Works because I represent a constituency which more than any other is affected by the Office of Public Works because about one-eighth of its land area is controlled by the Office of Public Works.  The Phoenix Park and the Memorial <Col N="1034" /> Park in Inchicore are just two examples, although I will not confine my remarks to those areas.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom focal a rá mar gheall ar An Scoil Lán-Ghaelach in Inse Chaoir a bhí agus atá ag lorg suímh áirithe ag Droichead na hInse in aice le hInse Chaoir.  Tá a fhios agam go raibh an tAire Stáit féin ag féachaint ar an suíomh ach ní raibh sé ábalta an suíomh a thabhairt don bhord bainistíochta.</P>
      <P>We speak a lot about the revival of the Irish language.  In Inchicore there is a very successful all-Irish bunscoil or primary school which was approved by the National Coalition Government.  The school has been operating under very difficult circumstances in temporary buildings; they have had to move from place to place.  It started as a naí scoil and has developed into a bunscoil and it has been in four different locations.  The school asked for a particular site in the ownership of the Office of Public Works at Islandbridge near Inchicore.  I know the Minister of State visited the site, and I thank him for it.  But he did not allocate the site to the board of management.  The reason given was that there is a general policy in the Office of Public Works not to part with any land in their possession. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that. Certainly that was the message that was conveyed to the board of management and to An Cumann Tuismuitheoirí, the parents' association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to review that decision because the site in question is an isolated one at the end of what is locally known as Memorial Park but which I think is referred to in the Department as the proposed Phoenix Park extension.  This site is mainly cut off from the rest of this huge public area about which I want to speak in a few minutes.  It is ideal for a scoileán-Ghaelach because it is right in the middle of a large catchment area.  In fact, if they had that site they would extent their catchment area because it is on many bus routes.  It is on or near the Inchicore, Clondalkin, Rathcoole, Newcastle, Drimnagh, Palmerstown, Chapelizod, Lucan, Leixlip and Maynooth bus routes and it is also on the bus route to Ballyfermot. <Col N="1035" /> This site is only half a mile from the location where the school started; it would be absolutely ideal and, what is more, that site is not much good for anything else.  It is right beside a site which the Office of Public Works gave to the St. John of God Brothers for a special school there which is a great advantage to the area.  So there is a precedent.  As the St. John of God School is of great service to the area around it, so would a scoil lán-Ghaelach.  I therefore appeal to the Minister to review his decision.  It is very important and urgent.</P>
    <P>Last year I raised this in the House with the Minister for Education and, while he expressed great concern and a great wish to help the school, he was unable to do so.  The school started first in a local hall as a naí scoil owned by Conradh na Gaeilge and there was such interest in it that it developed.  Eventually they got the use of the local Church of Ireland hall but it got too big for that and, in any event, the owners understandably wanted their hall back for use because it is a very thriving parish.  Very intense steps were taken last year in which they were involved, as were other public representatives for the area, in trying to get either a temporary site or a permanent site.  Also involved were Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board, both of whom were extremely helpful.  A number of sites in the area were the property of the corporation but none of them was big enough, and in one or two cases where they might have been big enough for temporary sites the expenditure would not have been warranted and there would have been difficulty in all the circumstances, given that it is the declared policy of the State since its foundation to revive the Irish language.  I tell the Minister of State that here is a golden opportunity to do something tangible about it.</P>
    <P>The school left the Church of Ireland Hall, Inchicore Road &mdash; which is only a few hundred yards from the site at Islandbridge that I am talking about &mdash; last June and they now have gone miles away to classrooms in a school in Crumlin.  This is causing great difficulty for the parents <Col N="1036" /> many of whom have approached me regularly and consistently even up to this week.  There may be a problem in that many of the schools in the general vicinity are now less than fully populated, but if that is the reason why the site is not being given, that should be stated honestly and then the board of management, an bord bainistíochta and An Cumann Tuismitheoirí, would see where they stood. They deserve to know whether their effort in a practical way to help the revival of the Irish language has really got official sanction.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the rest of the memorial park which is in the ownership of the OPW.  The Minister of State has agreed to a proposal for a road to cross the site more than half way up Con Colbert Road, the new Chapelizod by-pass. Indeed, it was I who suggested the route about six years ago and recently agreement was given to it, I understand.  The site would be cut in two but the road would cut away one part which has been leased to the Dublin City VEC.  The rest of the site is now and will remain derelict until something is done about it.  One of the Minister of State's predecessors, the late Deputy Noel Lemass, when he was Parliamentary Secretary at the OPW some years from 1969 to 1973, came up with a proposal for a municipal golf course on the whole site.  It was also then to be the Phoenix Park extension and I remember seeing plans of pedestrian over-passes crossing the Liffey connecting what was called on the plan the Phoenix Park extension to Phoenix Park proper.</P>
    <P>I was very enthusiastic about the plan. Unfortunately, the general election came in 1973 and the local Deputy, Deputy Lemass, was no longer in charge of the OPW and the proposal was dropped.  It would not be practical to talk in terms of a municipal golf course for the rest of the site that would be left after the VEC have taken possession of the part of the property which they are leasing, although that would be a good development in itself in that there would be a sporting amenity in the area.  Therefore, I ask the Minister of State to come up as soon as possible with proposals to develop or use in some way <Col N="1037" /> the remainder of the site known locally as the memorial park.  In fact I am talking about that part of the property which is in the possession of the OPW which surrounds the memorial park proper.  Perhaps the Minister of State would consider even making the site available on a lease basis &mdash; or whatever other basis he would like to consider &mdash; to Dublin Corporation so that the much-needed amenities and facilities in the whole area of Inchicore, Ballyfermot and Chapilizod, which are contiguous to the site in Islandbridge, could be developed.</P>
    <P>The site in question is right on the banks of the River Liffey, in fact on that part of the River Liffey which I think is the most attractive part within the city of Dublin.  I have felt since I was a child &mdash; because I was born and reared in the area &mdash; that this site has great potential.  On the opposite side of the river are a number of boat clubs and on the south side where the site is there is one boat club. A lot of boating goes on in the area and the whole area from Islandbridge to Chapelizod Bridge could be developed into a great boating amenity for Dublin city. Dublin Corporation themselves have bought an old boathouse from a boating club who have built a new one.  The boathouse which Dublin Corporation have bought is on the north side of the river and they intend to develop it into a boating amenity for the children in the Ballyfermot-Inchicore neighbourhood. This has great potential.</P>
    <P>I know that this is a time of financial stringency and that no Minister has money to throw around, but the Minister, Dublin Corporation, a number of boating interests, probably a number of business interests in the area and Bord Fáilte also could develop an absolutely splendid boating amenity &mdash; and not only boating, but a water facility &mdash; between Islandbridge and Chapelizod.  Chapelizod by-pass goes along the river bank from the city side of the Ranch Estate for some hundreds of yards going towards Chapelizod. On the Chapelizod end of the Ranch the corporation have what was a dump until recently and they are going to develop what will be a useful and very attractive park.  Just across the river is <Col N="1038" /> Phoenix Park and there are boathouses on the banks of the river.  It is a dream area and would be a great addition to the city if the Minister would do something about it or allow the corporation to develop it for the OPW.  The Dublin Corporation Community and Environment Department would be very pleased to be involved in this and so would the entire council.</P>
    <P>I come now to the biggest single responsibility of the OPW, Phoenix Park. The park is embraced completely in my new constituency of Dublin West.  It is bigger than Ballyfermot.  Whoever was responsible for the siting of the Phoenix Park deserves the eternal gratitude and praise of the people of Dublin because it is a magnificent amenity.  It is appropriate to praise the Minister and the staff of the Office of Public Works for the way it is maintained.  It has retained its character. The staff in the park are always very courteous and well dressed.  They do their job very well.  We are quick to blame the Minister when things go wrong so it is only right to praise him when things go well.  I should be grateful if he would convey a message of appreciation to the staff in the Phoenix Park and to the officials in the Office of Public Works whose responsibility it is.</P>
    <P>Do we make enough use of the Phoenix Park?  I should be glad to have the Minister's comments on whether or not we could have more facilities such as a swimming pool, either indoor or outdoor, without detracting from the amenities of the park.  In my travels abroad, when I was Lord Mayor of Dublin, I saw open-air swimming pools in countries with colder climates than ours and they were widely used.  They added greatly to the character of the areas in which they were located.  Tennis courts were proposed for the park a few years ago but they did not materialise.  There should also be basketball facilities.  All these facilities could be sited in corners of the park and would not detract in any way from its appearance but would add to the amenities.  The Phoenix Park is not used enough.  It is surrounded by vast urban development. Until comparatively recently there was nothing outside the park on the <Col N="1039" /> Knockmaroon-Castleknock-Blanchards-town side but now a vast new city has developed there.  These new areas lack facilities even more than the old areas like Inchicore, Kilmainham, O'Devaney Gardens, Navan Road and Blackhorse Avenue.  Apart from football pitches and polo grounds, there are no facilities for physical recreation.</P>
    <P>The community and environment department of Dublin Corporation and the community affairs section of Dublin County Council could form a committee on this matter.  These two authorities are building and extending new communities in the vicinity of the Phoenix Park and they have to plan facilities strictly within their areas of responsibility.  They cannot or do not make refernce to the potential of the Phoenix Park.  As a member of the corporation's youth and community affairs sub-committee, I know that the corporation &mdash; I am sure the same is true of the county council &mdash; would be delighted to develop the Phoenix Park in a way which would not detract from its visual attractions.</P>
    <P>The Phoenix Park is a greatly valued part of Dublin.  It is very well protected and rightly so.  When the local authorities proposed the new western motorway they could not widen the Conyngham-Chapelizod Road which runs right along the park from Parkgate to Chapelizod &mdash; the most obvious way to go &mdash; because they were not allowed to take a few feet from the frontage of the park.  I am not sure that measures which go to that extent to protect the park are warranted. I would have reluctantly moved the wall of the Phoenix Park back about 20 feet which would not have taken away anything from the park and would have facilitated the building of the road.  Instead of that the corporation have to build a new bridge across the Liffey at great expense. There is going to be an S-bend at Kingsbridge on the motorway from O'Connell Bridge to Leixlip.  They had to build a dual carriageway along St. John's Road from Islandbridge to Sarsfield Road, Ballyfermot, at the Ranch in Inchicore.  That also included a staggered junction bridge over the railway at Islandbridge.  The corporation <Col N="1040" /> have gone to extraordinary lengths to avoid taking a few feet off the park.  Their final route within the city proposes knocking down a local public house and several houses, disrupting a whole estate, The Ranch, in Inchicore, and going in front of 80 houses in Sarsfield Road and 30 houses in Saint Laurence's Road, Chapelizod.  This was all done to preserve the Phoenix Park.  I know it is a good cause but was it reasonable to put the country to such expense and to delay the road by many years in order to preserve the Phoenix Park?  I am not sure that the right decision was made, even though the spirit in which it was made was absolutely right.</P>
    <P>I want to raise the question of the main road from Parkgate to Castleknock. There are a considerable number of accidents on this road.  I do not know how this problem can be overcome.  Animals are involved in some of these accidents though many of the accidents are the result of speeding on this straight and wide road which is almost three miles in length.  Another factor is the bad lighting on the road and also the absence of markings of any kind.  Many people have told me that they would not drive through the Phoenix Park at night because of the difficulties presented by the bad lighting. The whole question of public lighting within the area must be considered in the context of safety on the main road.  The provision of markings, too, should be considered.  I would not wish to see traffic lights being introduced into the park. Already this city has far too many traffic lights in the form of a so-called solution to our traffic problems.  In any case, something must be done to reduce the accident rate on the main road in the Phoenix Park.  Perhaps the introduction of ramps might be considered.  Regarding the problem presented by the animals, I would not advocate the provision of railings along the main road because these would take away from the whole character of the park.  Something in the nature of grids might be considered as a means of keeping the animals off the roads.</P>
    <P>Beyond the Castleknock Gate is a vast community of commuters many of whom are dependent totally on public transport. <Col N="1041" /> I am aware that I would be out of order in referring during this debate to the transport problems of Castleknock, Blanchardstown, Mulhuddart or the Strawberry Beds but there are many problems in this regard for the people of those areas despite the fact that they are within a relatively short distance of the city.  According to CIE many of the problems are the result of traffic delays.  While some of the commuters from these areas travel by car, many depend on public transport.  Those who have private transport can drive through the park and thereby avoid traffic delays but there is a big problem for those who must travel by bus.  I am wondering whether the running of buses through the park would impinge very much on the facilities of the area. On balance, I think it would be a good idea to make this provision so that people could be transported to and from the city within a reasonable time.  I expect that CIE would welcome such a move.  The ideal might be to provide the bus service at peak times only and on a straight-through basis.  Before too long there are likely to be almost 200,000 people commuting each day from the areas in question.</P>
    <P>While on the question of the Phoenix Park, I should like to refer to Aras an Uachtaráin.  The general decor and condition of this building is excellent.  The same can be said of the State Apartments at Dublin Castle and of our embassies though I can only speak for those that I have visited.  The Minister and his staff deserve to be complimented in this regard.  However, though I am not familiar with the staffing arrangements at Aras an Uachtaráin, it would appear that these arrangements are somewhat deficient since a colonel who is the ADC to the President is the person who answers the door and takes people's coats on their arrival.</P>

      <P>I am not purporting to speak in any way on behalf of the present incumbent of the Office of President or on behalf of any of his predecessors but I do not think that it is right that the task of opening the door to visitors should rest with a high ranking Army officer. Obviously, the house and the grounds are very well looked after but some consideration might be given to the question of staffing there.  At least one would expect that a butler or a stewart would be in residence.  In the Mansion House, for instance, there are in residence both a butler and a housekeeper.</P>
      <P>I come now to the House in which we have to work every day.  The condition in which parts of the House are kept is not something of which we can be proud.  I do not think the conditions in which we as Deputies and our colleagues in the other House, and the staff that are there to serve and help us, have to work are adequate.  For the press and the others who have to come here for one reason or another, I do not think the facilities and services of the House are up to scratch. This applies from heating &mdash; which is either too hot or too cold &mdash; to cleanliness in certain cases and to accommodation, although there have been improvements in that regard.  There is still not enough room.  I do not want to go into too much detail but parts of this House are below standard not only for the Houses of Parliament but for any public building.  That extends from chipped cups in the restaurant to smelly toilets and I say that absolutely seriously.</P>

      <P>In talking about the Phoenix Park I omitted to mention the former Apostolic Nunciature.  This was to be developed as an official residence for the Taoiseach.

He goes on to refer to the new information centre and car park at Knockmaroon Hill.  That will be opened next week and I am grateful to have received an invitation. I regret I shall not be able to attend as I shall be out of the city.  I am not sure that we are utilising the potential of the former Nunciature in having it as an administration &mdash; maintenance centre.  I am a little appalled at that proposal.

      <P>I do not know what exactly that means.  Perhaps when the Minister comes to reply he will elaborate on what is involved.  The administration &mdash; maintenance centre puts me off.  I felt there was great potential in the Apostolic Nunciature, which is a lovely place.  I do not know who looked after the grounds. It can be even lovelier.  I am not sure that the proposed use is the best possible and I should like the Minister to consider that matter.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister is proposing improvements at the Ordnance Survey Office.  These are long overdue.  I am also glad to note that a new building for the State Laboratory at Abbotstown is in progress and that a grain storage complex is being built there also.  I welcome those developments, which are in my constituency, and are all very badly needed, as is the second stage of the new Garda headquarters at Phoenix Park.  That is also long overdue.  The more I read the Minister's speech the more I realise what there is in it about my constituency.  A new Defence headquarters is proposed and I presume that will be at Parkgate where the present building is.</P>
      <P>Finally, I again appeal to the Minister to change his mind by a personal decision about the site for An Scoil Lán-Ghaeleach, Inchicore.  This would be a great contribution to the revival of the Irish language in the south west of the city. The school has shown its worth and the Minister can give it the very large boost it now needs by deciding to allocate a site and then I hope the Department of Education before too long would give approval to go ahead with this school.</P>

      <P>I shall comment briefly on a number of aspects of this Vote.  I shall be primarily concerned with the Vote as it relates to the Department of Justice but in general I want to make this point.  Many figures given in this document and referred to by the Minister, when compared with figures given previously in similar documents and in the Estimate this time last year or in former years, give one the impression that these figures are made up as we go along and are not really anything other than a sort of symbolic sum which we can discuss in the House, have no real studied evaluation and are not the outcome of any cold analysis of how much money the Government are spending or should be spending in these areas or what value for money, they are getting.  In other words, this debate is not as meaningful as it could be since it does not seem to be actually about the sums which are being spent.  It is about estimates which are £1,000 here or there, take it or leave it, approximate.  In some cases they are estimates about sums which are, indeed, not yet estimated.</P>
      <P>That situation is very unsatisfactory because there is no evaluation of value for money.  What I fear is the creeping paralysis, the creeping and growing burden of expenditure in the State sector for buildings, Departments, and new areas of development, many of which are necessary and essential, many more the essential nature of which has to be proven.  In general there is not a high standard of efficient management of public property.  Offices visited &mdash; be they Government Departments or other agencies &mdash; tend in general to be inefficiently heated, inefficiently managed, with files and desks all over the place and staff, in some cases, having to work under conditions under which nobody should be asked to work.  I do not believe that anybody is actually running that whole situation.  It is just growing and producing tentacles like some vast octopus and I am not sure whether it is going to be strangled in the end.  I know that its increasing cost and the output being given are matters of serious concern and, indeed, serious evaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area of the Department of Justice, <Col N="1046" /> for instance, is one which needs some study.  We have here, under items 56, 57, 59, 63 and 64 interesting areas which show what I mean when I talk about an erratic, unplanned programme of development. It is high time that the Government of the day listened to the pleas of people involved in the administration of justice for significant improvements in relation to court facilities and Garda stations. This country this year witnessed, for the first time in my memory a walkout by gardaí in stations in which it would not be appropriate to house a dog.  Whenever I have the opportunity I take pleasure in visiting the Garda station of whatever town I am in and some of them are very good.  The majority are extremely moderate and it is extremely questionable as to whether they are suitable accommodation. A significant minority of cases are below the standards of human habitation and should be closed down or rebuilt.</P>
    <P>Deputies on all sides of this House are quick to pay lip service to the Garda in the event of a tragedy, to stand up and mouth from the lips out their gratitude to them.  Of course we are grateful.  Let us show our gratitude.  I shall give the Minister one example and ask him to please refer specifically to this in his reply.  I have made in this House on three separate occasions a simple request, which would not cost a lot of money, that the gardaí who serve this House on the back and front entrances be given the decency and respect of not being asked to stand out there in all kinds of inclement weather when there are only a few of us in the House, winter and summer, without some kind of cover.  After I had raised the matter the third time, the Minister conceded that there was a case.</P>
    <P>Initially, the objection was security and so on, but I was able to point out that all around the country adjacent to prisons, for example, going away back to the sixties when we had IRA prisoners in Mountjoy Prison, we had no trouble in facilitating gardaí locally with some kind of appropriate hut.  I asked for, and obtained, the commitment of the Minister nine months ago for the provision of <Col N="1047" /> such quarters at the exits from and entrances to this House.  Nothing has been done and the winter has now gone. Every time one drives into and out of this House, one witnesses gardaí standing in the cold and the rain.  They deserve better treatment.  It would not be a big job.  In fact, in front of the House on the Kildare Street side there is a readymade alcove which needs only modest conversion and which, with the appropriate material, would not put anything at risk at all.  That would show that we mean what we say when we talk about respecting the gardaí and being grateful for what they do for the State.  Instead, we stand them in conditions which any worker, no matter how allegedly menial his job would be, on any site in or around the city would not tolerate. We should not ask anyone, unless it is unavoidable, to stand, day in day out in the rain and snow.  That is the value which we place on the gardaí.  That is the reason why around the country this year we have had gardaí leaving stations saying &ldquo;We are not going to stay in here&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The appropriate representative bodies in the Garda should be more militant about getting decent conditions for their members.  They have put up with too much for too long from too many of us. It is unfair and unreasonable for this House to be, on the one hand, blackmailed by various private sector groups into conceding any claim which is going, if our civil servants, gardaí, teachers and nurses &mdash; those from whom it is expected that there should be a particularly selfless vocational response &mdash; must put up with an image of the service long outdated. Give these gardaí the conditions to which they are entitled.  if we do not give them those conditions, we shall be asked to pay a price in due course.  Younger men, and perhaps not so young, will not put up with it.  Why has it taken nine months to get a little bit done about those men? This is a request which I had to repeat over two years.  That is unforgiveable and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Just ten days ago, Justice D'Arcy in the courts reiterated the pleas of many others when he said &ldquo;Will the State please provide decent court facilities?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Deputy, I have already ruled on, I think, four occasions that courthouses are a matter for the local authorities and not for the present Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>May I refer to it peripherally under item 57, courts of justice &mdash; provision of jury courtrooms.  I shall be very brief.  Bearing in mind that the local authorities are now funded 100 per cent by the State, if the Government do not give them the money the local authorities cannot provide these facilities.  They are not the responsibility of this Minister, I accept that.</P>
      <P>In item 57 there is a sum to be provided for the provision of jury courtrooms. Could the Minister do whatever is necessary to rectify situations where not alone the jury have not got adequate accommodation but where, in cases in the greater Dublin area, clients and counsel have to stand outside the courtroom to consult because conditions are so bad? If it is not up to him, would he use his good offices and good influence with his colleague Ministers to make sure that we obtain at least the infrastructure whereby justice can be done?</P>
      <P>In that general context of the efficiency of public buildings it would be reasonable for the Minister to say &ldquo;Deputy Keating, where is the money to come from?&rdquo; I suggest that in this general area we might consider utilisation of existing buildings far more than at present.  For example, I do not believe that it should be necessary to provide new, columned courthouses all around this country if decent court facilities are to be provided, as they are needed and should be provided.  There is no reason, particularly in areas where courts meet occasionally, why existing buildings &mdash; perhaps used by the community, perhaps used by public bodies, buildings which have, a part-time use such as, for example, a school hall &mdash; could not be looked at with a view to greater efficiency and greater utilisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, I do not accept the underlying thinking in this Estimate that every time this House meets to discuss <Col N="1049" /> this Vote we must inevitably conclude that this year's Estimate will be, on average, 20 per cent higher than last year's, plus a few bob thrown in to meet local needs and so on.  It does not have to work like that.  A proper and thorough revaluation of value for money of public buildings is long overdue.  Instead of having three separate buildings serving different purposes, let us see if one building could be run in a different way, perhaps being used for longer hours, but not, I suggest, by the staff employed for one particular use.  Let us see if that could be done. There is no reason why an information centre could not be run from a public office on Saturdays, nor is there any reason why school halls could not be utilised for certain purposes with the co-operation of the parties involved.  I remain totally unconvinced that we are getting value for money in this area.</P>
    <P>The estimated total cost for items Nos. 63 and 64 are not yet to hand.  They refer to the erection of new Garda stations and major and minor improvements schemes. The provision last year was a total of £230,000 for No. 64 and £1.25 million for No. 63.  In respect of both items this year there is no estimate of expenditure.</P>
    <P>I have made it a practice to visit Garda stations all over the country and I was always received most courteously. Gardaí are very placid.  They will not complain too readily.  In general the member in charge will show you around and one sees for oneself the conditions of the buildings.  Some are old buildings, which are converted, panelled, partitioned and so on to try to make existing needs fit but &mdash; and I defy contradiction &mdash; these buildings which are meant to be the offices of those who guard the security and peace of this State do not hold a candle to even the most moderate businessman's office.  I know business people in this city and, if they were asked to occupy these offices, even their most junior typists would object &mdash; they would not stay in them for one hour before they would walk out.  Yet we expect the gardaí in some cases to live in such circumstances, and to work and preserve the safety of State.  I do not accept that that should <Col N="1050" /> be the case.  If the Minister is willing, this side of the House will be very supportive of introducing whatever Supplementary Estimate is involved to ensure an immediate upgrading of all such stations.</P>
    <P>I will go further: some aspects of such upgrading would be very labour-intensive. When we go around many of these buildings, not just the Garda stations, we see windows which are stuck, radiators which were painted nine or ten years ago and have not been turned on or off since. That is the situation in this House and that is one of the reasons why the heating is like this.  This is sloppy, inefficient, negligent management of our resources and it is not good enough.  In any average Irish town the offices likely to be the most inefficient and expensive are those in the charge of the State and the worst offenders are the local Garda stations.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see a situation where gardaí have to walk out in order to underline their concern for their conditions.  I want those stations upgraded immediately. If the Minister would do us the honour in the light of the commitment of his colleague by providing the appropriate huts or protection from the elements for the gardaí at both sides of this House, I would be very grateful.  It should not be necessary to raise this matter in this House for the fifth time.  Let us show that we mean what we say.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies from various parts of the country will not perhaps be as aware of this as Deputies who are here five days a week.  Over the Christmas period and during January and February, come rain or snow, the sight of pale-faced shivering gardaí was something to behold nine months after the Minister for Justice promised in this House to do something about it.  He told me the Office of Public Works were working on it.  Will the Minister please get this done now?</P>
    <P>I want to ask about item No. 66, the Garda Training Centre, Templemore, swimming pool improvements.  The estimated total cost is £250,000.  I do not know what kind of swimming pool is involved.  Am I right in believing that that pool has been the cause of complaints from the date of its construction about <Col N="1051" /> the quality of the workmanship involved? Is that one reason why this money is being sought?  Was there a major flaw in that pool?  Were there complaints about leakages?  If so, what is being done about it by the contractors, or is the State expected to pay £250,000 of hard-earned money to make up these deficiencies?</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed to note under the Justice section of this Estimate that, despite the crying need for a new children's court, for new permanent courts and for new public record offices, the estimated total cost is not yet available.  This indicates that we are not as concerned as we could or should be.  The expenditure for last year is not available.  This, too, indicates that this document is a scaffolding within which we can discuss figures, but it is not meant to be taken literally. When are these Dickensian conditions, these conditions of disgraceful and absolute antediluvian standards operating in our children's courts going to end?  When can we provide unfortunate parents and children with some kind of decent place to have their problems dealt with?  Why must it be that the people who have to walk through our courts day in and day out have to put up with these conditions? The fact that this Estimate is presented in this way is an example of our lack of interest in this area.</P>
    <P>I was very distressed earlier this year to learn that what I believe should be a national monument, namely, the Papal Cross in Phoenix Park, had to be the subject of public acrimony before action was taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my <Col N="1052" /> gratitude to you for allowing me to raise this very urgent matter.  I apologise for keeping you and the staff of the House and for dragging the Minister in here.  I believe it to be a necessity because this matter has become a grave national scandal.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that about two weeks ago I raised this matter on the Order of Business and was ruled out of order.  Having received several other cases in the past few days I again raised the matter this morning and was greatly encouraged in doing so by the full page report on this subject in yesterday's <i>Evening Herald.</i> I was also encouraged by the 51 questions on today's Order Paper for oral reply by the Minister for Social Welfare, almost all of which referred to delays in social welfare payments, mainly payments of disability benefit.  In addition there were about ten questions for written reply.  We must ask why Deputies are driven to this use of the parliamentary question on such an extensive scale.</P>
      <P>The first reason is that it is almost impossible to contact the Department of Social Welfare by telephone.  If that is the experience of Deputies, what must be the experience of a pensioner living in Ballyfermot who tries to find a coin box in working order in order to contact the Department?  If one writes to the Minister one gets a stereotyped acknowledgement to the effect that the matter is receiving attention and that is probably the last one hears.  Any further communication arrives so long after the original contact that the person concerned may long since have died.  The result is that Deputies are forced to put down parliamentary questions every week, most of which are for written reply.  It is to the credit of Deputy Pattison that he allowed his questions to accumulate on the Order Paper in order to highlight this scandal and the article in yesterday's <i>Evening Herald</i> is also to the credit of that paper.</P>
      <P>During Question Time today the Minister was at pains to explain that it would be necessary to have 1.25 million staff to keep tabs on the 1.25 million people in the social welfare system.</P>

      <P>That was the burden of what the Minister said.  It is not just today or yesterday that many thousands of people have become entitled to weekly payments, but during the past few months this national scandal has arisen and has now reached breaking point.  No Deputy wants to be disorderly or to misuse parliamentary questions as we have been forced to do in order to get action on this matter.  The putting down of a parliamentary question usually results in action on the specific problem raised but it has no impact on the general problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two weeks ago I put down a Private Notice Question on an individual case but it was ruled out of order on the grounds that it was not of urgent national importance.  I was also informed, not by the Department but by the Ceann Comhairle's office, that the cheques were paid that day and this was confirmed by a telephone call next morning from the person concerned.  He received eight weeks' arrears of payment.  I want the Minister to know that this man and his family were starving because they were too proud to go to their neighbours for help.  However, their neighbours noticed and informed me of the case, which is not an isolated one.  The man concerned had gone to the community welfare officer in the local health board and he was allowed £25 per week on which to keep himself, his wife and four children.  He was threatened with disconnection of his electricity supply and has received notice from the corporation to quit his house.  All these things have created immense emotional pressures on this man and his wife, not to mention that their children have been hungry going to school.  That man telephoned me this morning and referred to the cheques he had received two weeks ago but said that he had not received any since.  My Private Notice Question on this matter was, understandably, ruled out of order but the Ceann Comhairle's office, not the Department of Social Welfare, have informed me that the cheques were issued today.  Must I raise this individual case every two or three weeks?  I was told that the man had not submitted medical certificates but this is not the case.  He had queued for hours to hand them in at <Col N="1054" /> the Department and to inquire when he would receive his money.  I was told he did not use his RSI number but he certainly did so.  I object to the Minister giving false information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true.  Of course, the Minister is not deliberately giving false information, but all the replies drafted for the Minister are not correct.  However, the Minister is responsible and if I were Minister for Social Welfare in present circumstances I would not leave the section concerned until this was sorted out.  I make no apologies for being very angry about this.  I invite the Minister to go down to those queues at his offices, the queues which were highlighted in yesterday's evening paper and ask those people what they have experienced.  This is a case of gross maladministration.</P>
      <P>We enacted a Bill to provide for the appointment of an ombudsman but he has not yet been appointed.  If an ombudsman is appointed these should be the first questions to be dealt with along with the questions on the Order Paper today because this is a case of gross maladministration and gross negligence by the Minister.  I am giving the Minister notice that if this problem is not resolved within two weeks there will be scenes in this House the like of which have never been seen before.</P>

These people have their electricity cut off and <Col N="1055" /> they are getting notices to quit from the corporation.  This is not just a local problem as has been illustrated by questions put down by Deputies Pattison, Hegarty, Harte, Begley, Deasy and others.  The problem is nationwide.  I charge the Minister with gross negligence.</P>
      <P>I am on the board of a few hospitals and I know that the Minister is great at visiting hospitals but not at giving them money, that he is a great man at singing a song and for auctions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for giving me a few minutes of his time. We must remember that the Department of Social Welfare are dealing with the most helpless section of our community. The biggest problem is the remoteness of the Department particularly from rural people.  The excuse about the change-over is unacceptable.  I do not know how necessary the change-over was but if it was necessary extraordinary steps should have been taken to ensure that this would <Col N="1056" /> not happen.  The questions on the Order Paper today give a small indication of the total problem.</P>
      <P>To make matters worse when these people approach their representatives their public representatives find themselves in an equally helpless situation. From my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny I cannot call into the Minister's office every time someone has an urgent problem about the non-receipt of social welfare benefits and I have to rely on the telephone system.  I have wasted days not just hours trying to get through to that Department, with no reply.  Most people on sickness benefit claim about once in their lives and very few of the total number claim often.  The case that I outlined today was the case of a man, his wife and five children who were left for five or six weeks without anything.  They came to me and I went through the normal procedures as I have been doing for the last 20 years and phoned the Department. Now one cannot get through to the Department.  If one writes a letter a reply is received after a while but it takes some more weeks before the case is resolved. Sometime around Christmas I wrote in about a case and only this week did I get a full reply.  Public representatives as responsible people cannot sit around waiting for replies that take that long.  It is sad that parliamentary time has to be taken up in this way but having got the information I received today I am satisfied that what I did was justified.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to reply to the allegations made by Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Pattison.  I especially give my thanks to the staff in the Department of Social Welfare for the work they have been and are doing without gratitude from this House, the media, or any of the other people who want to jump on to the bandwagon.  We are talking about a situation which was advertised in advance and of which people were made fully aware.  I suggest that Deputy Mitchell learn more about the PRSI and RSI system.  Both numbers are the same.  There is no need, as he suggested earlier, to get any other number. They are both the same number.</P>
      <P>Major changes have taken place in the system and there is no way one can regionalise or get information down the country unless it is computerised and put on video screens and so on.  If we do not change we will stay the way we are and still have delays which were accepted as standard and necessary.  The whole purpose of computerisation is to provide the kind of service Deputy Pattison is looking for on a regional basis.  One cannot start that process without going through this one and it is my task to do so.  It is a very difficult task and there are many problems, for example, employers who do not pay in money and so on.</P>
      <P>An advertising programme was undertaken to try and make people aware of the need to use RSI numbers.  In total only a relatively small number of people do not use them but it is still too big a number and I accept that.  After Christmas is a time when we have heavy bouts of disability and sickness.  Flu and other problems add to the burden.  Inquiries from Deputies who do not include the RSI and insurance numbers add to the Department's burden in meeting the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transfer of records is now completed in so far as they are available from Revenue.  There are a number of records which are not available in complete form but the records section is now completed. Before Christmas I introduced a regulation to enable officers of the Department, <Col N="1058" /> where the 1979-80 contribution record was not available, to use the 1978-79 record.  This has been effective in saving difficulty in that area.</P>
    <P>Of the post which came into the Department today and which was examined by my officers 30 per cent of certificates were from doctors and were dated between 23 and 27 February.  It can be seen that these were not submitted with any particular urgency.  Although it is only 30 per cent it creates great difficulty for the Department when one considers that the volume for one week is seventy thousand.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Pattison's list I pointed out that the problems in virtually all cases related to the RSI number and the contributions paid by the contributor in the governing contribution year which, in many instances, were missing and were subsequently credited by the Department. Medical referees denied a number of them and on repeated reference continued to do so.  Pay-related benefit was not due in other cases.  I am surprised Deputy Mitchell gets such poor response from everyone although listening to him this evening I should not be surprised. He seems to have established a particularly bad relationship with the people from whom he seeks information.</P>

      <P>As regards phones there are 70 in total, 40 incoming and 30 outgoing. They are continually busy.  There is need for a larger system.  It is possible for the phone to ring if it picks up on a call which is finishing and with the volume of calls going through it happens fairly often.  One can pick up an outgoing call and get a ringing tone although it is not ringing in the Department.  This is due to overloading and the only answer is a totally new system.</P>
      <P>Deputy Pattison also said that people do not claim often.  Of the 70,000 claims a week for disability benefit 45,000 are continuous claims over a long period and they are paid automatically provided the once a month certificate comes in.  The principle problem currently relates to disability benefits.  Deputy Mitchell mentioned pensioners and while there is no problem in relation to them generally it is possible to find a case at any time.  In 25 per cent of the questions which were put down in the House Deputies did not quote the RSI number and this makes it particularly difficult for my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to see why Deputy Mitchell wanted Question No. 24 brought up again at this stage.  The person concerned was a single person who claimed disability benefit from 17 November 1980.  He said he had no insurance number as he had been insurably employed in Britain only, prior to taking up employment in Ireland in July 1979. According to the records in the Department this man had no paid or credited contributions in 1978 or 1979 and did not, therefore, qualify for disability benefit. <Col N="1060" /> From the information given by him it was not clear how long he was in Britain.  In one letter he said he was 25 years in Britain and I can show that to the Deputy if he wishes.  In another letter he said he was 20 years in Britain and on the claim form he said his period of last employment in Britain was from 1976 to 1979. This is Deputy Mitchell's concrete example. Before seeking his British number it was decided to see if an Irish insurance number could be traced.  It was established that prior to departure to Britain he had held a number.  It was also established that he had no paid or credited contributions under that number.  Eventually it was decided to treat this person as a new entrant into Irish insurance under his RSI number.  He was given the benefit by the Department in that respect.  He was also given pre-entry credits which were allowed for 1978 and 1979.</P>

      <P>I accept that there are problems but this is not a fair example. This is a very biased example and anyone who is objective can see that the case he refers to is a special one.  There is difficulty in this area.  We must make the necessary changes if we are ever to have the situation Deputy Pattison wants to see.  I am trying to put it through.  It would be easier for me not to bother, especially at this time.  Deputies should bear with us and we will give every assistance we can to solving problems.  Deputies should get from people who raise a claim both the RSI and insurance numbers and quote them.</P>

All disability benefit due from 6 January 1981, fourth day of incapacity, to 13 February, date of the latest medical certificate received, has been paid.</P>
