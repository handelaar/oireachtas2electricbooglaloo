      <P>and <b>Mr. O'Donnell</b> asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if his attention has been drawn to a report in the media (details supplied) regarding the non-installation of telephones in Ardagh Court, Blackrock, County Dublin; if he will give the dates on which the installations were requested; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 12 applications for telephone service at Ardagh Court dating from 1976 and 1977.  There has, regretably, been long delay in providing service for these applicants because of the non-availability of cabling.  Main cabling for the area generally became available late last year and is being distributed now.  This distribution is being carried out on the basis that is more productive from the point of view of manpower utilisation.  As a result, telephone service has been provided for applicants in some estates who applied later than those in Ardagh Court.  The work is continuing and it is expected that the cable will be distributed for the Ardagh Court applicants within the next two months, or so and service provided shortly thereafter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that service will be provided within the next two weeks or so. <Col N="3090" /> The school authorities have been advised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Good.  Firstly, why did it take so many years actually to get a service for a school with 900 pupils?  Secondly, will the Minister accept my gratitude that at last the questions that were tabled have elicited some response?  The Minister is correct that the school authorities have been informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did it take so long?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>An application was made for a telephone service of two lines for St. Vincent de Paul's girls' national school on 14 February 1979.  The problem which existed was in connection with cabling.  The cabling is now completed but that work cannot be done very easily and hence the work took so long.  This application was given priority and it got it as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Do schools have priority?</P>

      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it a satisfactory situation that a school of 900 pupils would be without a telephone service for so long?  For example, if an accident occurred to one of the students or any other matter relating to the school which needed urgent attention, there would be difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is getting attention.  It was not I who created the priority list. All I am saying to the Deputy is that at this moment we are looking at the priority list and I am taking into account what the Deputy has said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will make arrangements to retain the auto-manual exchange in Cahirciveen post office and to provide operator services for subscribers in south Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is that when Cahirciveen exchange is converted to automatic working all operator services for the area will be provided from Tralee exchange.  The volume of manual traffic to be handled at Cahirciveen following the conversion of the exchange to automatic working would not warrant retention of operators there.  Moreover, the new automatic exchange for Cahirciveen has been designed on the basis that operator services would be provided from Tralee and provision of operator services at Cahirciveen would involve additional expense and delay in bringing the automatic exchange into use.</P>
      <P>I should add that the arrangements for dealing with staff displaced as a result of extension of the automatic service generally are the subject of discussion with the staff organisations representing the staffs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the very grave unemployment situation which exists in Cahericiveen at the moment.  Three factories are closed and now the telephone exchange is closing down.  Surely the Minister could see his way to diverting some extra work into the exchange to keep some of the people employed there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the figures on this but, as far as my Department are concerned, as far as employment in the Caherciveen area, and particularly in south Kerry last year is concerned, we have given more employment there than any private industrial employer.  Secondly, in answer to the Deputy's question concerning automation, do they want an automatic service in Caherciveen or do they not?  If they do not want the automatic service now, would the Deputy say <Col N="3092" /> so, because there are a thousand different places around the country where we could place this exchange.  If you are going to get an automatic exchange, how can you have an operator-assisted exchange?  It is a simple question and has a simple answer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Minister is not interested in keeping extra people working in Caherciveen.  That is what the question asked for and there is no other interpretation that can be put on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered the question but the Deputy may not interpret it in such a way as to put on it whatever type of twist he wishes for <i>The Kerryman.</i> I am now asking the Deputy and the people of Cahirciveen publicly whether they want an automatic service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will outline any immediate proposals which his Department have to provide urgently needed telex facilities throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The following steps are being taken to enable applications for telex service to be met promptly:</P>
      <P>1.  A new telex exchange at Dublin and sub-exchangers at Cork, Limerick and Waterford with capacity to meet requirements for some years ahead are expected to be brought into service within the next three months.</P>
      <P>2.  A special programme of provision of equipment needed to give certain telex applicants trunk service is almost completed and a follow-on programme is planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.  Equipment has been ordered that will enable telex service to be provided for applicants who have telephone service <Col N="3094" /> but for whom spare cabling is not otherwise available.</P>
    <P>4.  Adequate stocks of teleprinters are being built up.</P>
    <P>5.  Additional staff are being assigned to telex work.</P>
    <P>As a result of these measures, it is expected that it should be possible to meet applications for telex service promptly by the end of next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of a number of factories or other commercial enterprises in Dublin city who have been waiting for telex service for at least 18 months despite the people concerned having been given to understand that the service would be forthcoming within weeks of their setting up?  Would the Minister at least indicate for the benefit of those applicants when precisely they may expect service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The telex exchange in Dublin and the sub-exchanges at Limerick and Waterford are due to come into service at the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that these applicants will be given lines?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Of course, in the absence of an exchange, lines are not available.  The sub-exchange at Cork is due to come into service about June 1981. The initial capacity that would be provided will approximately double the existing capacity of 6,500 exchange lines to about 13,000 exchange lines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might have let me finish.  Agreements have been signed with a further 111 applicants and we are at inquiry stage in respect of 1,130 <Col N="3095" /> applicants.  That makes a total of 1,488 being dealt with at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the majority of these applicants are predominantly new businesses and new industries?  Would he not agree also that throughout the country a great deal of industrial investment and production, particularly in the export field, is being gravely hampered, even in the south Dublin and Dún Laoghaire areas, because firms are not in a position to take on employees nor to accept new orders because of the lack of telex service? They do not even have telex machines.  Are we not talking here about mainly 1,488 individual firms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  The Deputy must understand the complexity of providing a telex service either for a firm or for a private individual.  In order to provide this service we have has to build and equip a new exchange, a task which involves a certain amount of time.  We have a certain amount of time.  We have a situation now whereby we expect that by the end of this year we will be in a position to offer telex promptly, practically on order, and that is very important. I might add that throughout business it is acknowledged generally that we have what is perhaps the best telex system in Europe.  We should never allow ourselves to become confused as to what must be done and what has been done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department are not aware of any dissatisfaction with the general manner in which they conduct the business of paying pensions and allowances. There may be rare instances of a <Col N="3100" /> post office not funding itself sufficiently to pay all the pension and allowance orders presented on a particular day as the total cash required can fluctuate considerably as some pensioners allow their pensions to accumulate, but there is no question of a refusal to make pension or allowance payments properly due.  On a recent occassion at Skerries sub-post office a large number of payments normally claimed on the Friday were not made until the Saturday, presumably because of bad weather on the Friday, and there were insufficient funds on hand to pay four of the 300 pensioners who normally cash their pensions at that post office.  The four pensioners were asked to call back on the Monday to be paid.  This was an isolated occurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that he has not answered Question No. 20 which asked if his Department are unable to provide the paying service on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare.  In addition, Question No. 22 asked if pensioners have not been able to receive payments at other sub-post offices throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  This happens on very rare occassions and is due to fluctuation in the numbers coming to a post office.  I instanced what happened at Skerries sub-post office where out of 300 pensioners who should have a come on Friday and who did not&mdash;as I stated they came to the post office on the Saturday&mdash; all were paid with the exception of four who were called back to the post office for payments on the Monday.  It was just <Col N="3101" /> that the post office did not have sufficient cash on the Saturday to meet all the payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that persons who are eligible for payment of a benefit or pensions are due to that payment from the due date and are entitled to claim it on any day thereafter?  The Minister's statement about pensioners who should have come to the post office on the Friday is totally incorrect and unfair to these unfortunate, underprivileged people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Deputy has taken me up quite incorrectly.  It is normal for pensioners to collect their pensions at Skerries post office on a Friday but as it happened to be a very wet day many of them came to the post office on the Saturday.  The post office did not have the cash on hand to pay four people out of the 300 who called to the premises.  I do not think that was a major incident.  It has happened before.  Post offices always meet payments when they are due.  I agree there is the odd occassion when there may be an error in calculation but there is always a reason for it.  I think the Deputy is getting hot and bothered about something that is trivial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Four questions were answered here, apart from the interjection by the stool pigeon.  The Minister appears to have missed the point that four people, one of them an elderly woman living alone, were refused payments to which they were entitled.  That may be a source of laughter to the Minister or to his backbench prompter but that is not the point.  Despite what the Minister has said, this was not an isolated incident.  It happens regularly in this sub-post office because of the failure of the BMP to provide adequate funds.  Pensioners and people entitled to unemployment assistance are refused payment on days, after the due date.  It would behove the Minister to rectify the situation rather than making fun of the unfortunate people involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made Deputy Boland aware of a fact of which he did not have knowledge before.  Seemingly he thought only one person was involved. There seems to be a difference of opinion between the Deputy and the post master in the sub-post office.  I have not received a report from him on the matter before. This was an isolated incident and I think it is far better forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that I was in touch with his office on 27 April last and that his secretary undertook to telephone me to explain the reason? I am still awaiting that telephone call but perhaps he has not been able to get through on the telephone.  That would be quite understandable.</P>

      <P>I want to take this opportunity to quote exactly what the Deputy said, as reported at column 262 of the Official Report of 11 June 1980:</P>
      <P>Would the Minister be interested to know that the information he has given, at least in respect of the German Federal Republic, is absolutely wrong, that whichever official or officials put that information into his hand does not know what he is talking about?  The Minister has given the House a piece of absolute misinformation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>He continued:</P>
      <P>Would the Minister be interested to know that in the GFR, which is the European mainland company from which most telephone traffic to this country comes and to which most of the telephone traffic goes.  It is possible on Sunday to telephone this country at about one-third of the ordinary week day rate?</P>
      <P>He went on:</P>
      <P>The Minister's file is wrong.  Would the Minister get whichever official gave him that information to get the proper information?  The German Post Office permits telephone calls at the same reduced rate to all other countries throughout the world inside and outside the EEC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>All petroleum vessels operating in Cork Harbour have to comply with petroleum bye-laws made by the Cork Harbour Commissioners which prescribe, <i>inter alia,</i> procedures to be observed on arrival and during loading/unloading operations to minimise the risk of accidents and oil spillages as well as procedures in the event of a leakage or spillage of oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Irish Refining Co. Ltd. requires masters of all tankers berthing at the Whitegate Refinery jetty to observe special anti-pollution and safety regulations.  All operations at the jetty are supervised by a terminal supervisor. <Col N="3114" /> The Cork Harbour Commissioners, the local authorities and the Irish Refining Co. Ltd. have prepared contingency plans for the clearance of oil pollution. These plans cover such aspects as manpower, machinery, vehicles, boats and equipment, dispersants, oil recovery units, booms, etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Maritime local authorities who operate under the aegis of the Department of the Environment are responsible for the clearance of oil from beaches and the immediate foreshore. Harbour authorities deal with oil spillages in harbours.  The Department of Defence is responsible for clearance of oil at sea and the Department of Transport is responsible for the control and discharge of oil from vessels.  I presume that the new plans drafted by the Cork Harbour Commissioners will do the job efficiently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, measures announced by the Government on 29 April aimed at reducing inflation included a deferment of increases in CIE <Col N="3118" /> charges pending the outcome of the review currently being undertaken of CIE policies and services.  Meanwhile, the board are also in consultation with the trades unions, examining what measures might be possible to achieve economies.

    <Title>Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1981: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The major purpose of this Bill is to fix in permanent statutory form the most generous scheme of rates relief for average farmers which has obtained since rating began.  The impact of its measures, first announced in the budget of last January, will be both timely and direct.  First and foremost, the Bill will extend total relief of rates to 94 per cent of all land holdings and partially derate a further 3 per cent.  It will complement the other considerable initiatives developed by the Government in support of agriculture by transferring a potential £62 million in tax revenue from the public sector to the free use of farmers.  Finally, the Bill will achieve these objectives by way of full subvention from the State and without loss of rates income to local authorities.</P>
      <P>Besides the unprecedented scale of the new reliefs, the Bill embodies three other welcome improvements.  For the first time in 35 years, the legislation to give effect to the agricultural grant will be expressed in a permanent rather than a temporary set of measures.  This departure from the principle of periodic reviews will be welcomed by farmers and will create a more stable framework for forward financial planning by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another innovation of the Bill is its extension of the agricultural grant reliefs to all land in urban areas.  This will benefit an additional 9,500 landholders.  Lastly, the Bill sees to it that farmers eligible for relief of rates on land will no longer suffer the irritant of having to meet the levy of certain separate charges, such as those for malicious injuries, on their rateable <Col N="3138" /> valuations.</P>
    <P>The Bill replaces the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1980, which was due to run until the end of 1982, with two major relief provisions.  One, contained in section 8, validates the additional relief granted by the Government in 1980 when the second moiety of rates was waived for farmers in the £40 to £60 valuation category.</P>
    <P>The primary, and permanent, form of rates relief given under the Bill is however set out in sections 2 to 4.  As in the past, the reliefs will take the form of an allowance to the rated occupier against the amount of the rates which would otherwise be leviable on the valuation of his holding.  For the purpose of the reliefs, land holdings may be divided into two categories &mdash; those with land valuations under £50 and those with land valuations of £50 or more but under £70.</P>
    <P>For holdings under £50 valuation, the allowances provided under the Bill amount to 100 per cent of the gross rates. This means that the holdings concerned will be fully derated from this year on. Previously, full derating applied only to holdings with valuations of up to £20. The extension of the 100 per cent allowances to holdings with valuations between £20 and £50 means that the present Bill is derating an extra 71,250 holdings in county council areas for the first time.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for allowances against their gross rates for the occupiers of holdings with land valuations between £50 and £70.  For these holdings, the relief being given amounts to 50 per cent of the gross rates.  This means that the rated occupiers are being relieved of one-half of the total rates which would otherwise be payable on their land valuations.  An estimated 13,200 holdings in this category will benefit from this relief.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation, the agricultural grant reliefs applied by and large only to land situated in county council areas.  The exclusion of urban areas from the scope of the reliefs, save for certain land newly embraced by boundry extensions, has been the subject of representations for many years now from urban councils, from the Association of Municipal <Col N="3139" /> Authorities, and from many farmers involved.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill will bring a long needed remedy to this anomalous situation. From this year on, the agricultural grant reliefs will extend in full to land situated within the boundaries of county boroughs, boroughs and urban districts. This fundamental change means that a further 9,500 landholders will be relieved of all rates.  When account is taken of the 71,250 holdings to which I have already referred, the total number being fully derated for the first time under the terms of this Bill comes to 80,750.</P>
    <P>Another worth-while improvement, provided by section 6 of the Bill, relates to the basis on which reliefs will be calculated. Up to now, reliefs under the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Acts related to the general rate in the pound only.  The rated occupier remained liable for the full amount of any separate charges which might be leviable, such as those arising from malicious injury decrees.  Local authorities had a limited power to waive separate charges in certain circumstances but without the benefit of recoupment from the Exchequer. Section 6 of the Bill extends the agricultural grant reliefs to the total rate in the pound, including any separate charges, and the full cost is recoupable from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a relatively simple one, but the benefits which it brings to the farming community are far-reaching and lasting. Seen in a more general context, the Bill is part of a wider Government commitment to implementing fair and progressive reliefs in the burden of rates.  This movement towards greater equity in local taxation began when our long-standing commitment to abolish domestic rates was honoured from 1 January 1978. Between the reliefs still obtaining under that initiative and the new reliefs for farmers now being given, nearly one million properties which bore either a full or a substantial rates liability before 1978 now enjoy complete exemption from rates.  The total value to ratepayers of the reliefs involved amounts to £183 million in the present year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3140" /> The present Bill provides the legislative framework necessary to advance and consolidate this important work.  I know that it will be welcomed by Members on all sides and I now commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this move to relieve rates on all agricultural holdings up to £50 valuation, but let me remind the Minister &mdash; as no doubt he will be reminded before the debate is over &mdash; of the amount of damage which has been done during the four years his party have been in office to the people with rather large valuations.  It is my belief, and the solid belief of many people in the State, that the reason the present Government have brought in this relief is that our party in November 1980 brought before this House a Bill and with that Bill a request to remove all agricultural rates, which would be the proper move which should have been made by the Government. As a result of that pressure, and the acceptance by the people of that measure which we brought in with that six-point plan, the present Government were forced to make this move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>PLV, as it is known, as a system has completely outlived its usefulness and, as I claimed when I first came into this House, it should not be used as a criterion either to measure the acreage of land an owner has or to decide his ability to pay taxes on that holding.  Rates levied on PLV bear no relation to the ability of the land to produce or the landowner to pay. I now wish to bring to the Minister's notice what no doubt has been brought to his notice before, the position in our own county.  We know that the farmers of Wexford have set up a fund and have brought before the courts the whole question of the PLV.  No doubt the Minister is aware that at the moment there is a threat that before this case proceeds and while it proceeds the people who contribute to the fund to fight it will pay no rates to Wexford County Council.  I would like to ask the Minister, and probably he will have some answers, the position of Wexford County Council in this whole case. What is the position in the administration of Wexford County Council if this case is not taken to the courts for two or three <Col N="3141" /> years?  Practically 95 per cent of the farmers of County Wexford have made a contribution to this fund.  This could put the county council and their services in a very difficult position, and there is very strong reason to believe that the farmers will succeed.  My personal comment on that situation is I hope that when the court case comes around they will succeed.</P>
    <P>Wexford, like most countries, has a big variation in the valuation per acre, varying from 25p to £1.25.  This awful situation has carried on down through the years and very little has been done about it, and surely the time has come to do something when these valuations in certain instances drag very large amounts of money from the landowners with the high valuations.  Whether that be on rates on the one hand or the resource tax, which was introduced by Fianna Fáil, on the other hand, PLV was used.  We heard a lot about wealth tax and its effect, but we heard very little about this selective wealth tax which was threatened in 1979 and brought in in 1980.  PLV was used and the tax at £3.50 over £75 PLV bore no relation whatsoever to the ability of the person to pay.  Still the Minister is sitting there blowing his coal about what he is doing for the farmers.  I remind him to look back four years.  No doubt the figures are available in the Department of Agriculture which show the amount of damage that his party have done as far as the farmers are concerned with the paying of rates and levies and depriving their families of education on the one hand and health services on the other. The Government sought in a two-year period to bring down eligibility for rates relief to £40 valuation and they also sought to bring down eligibility for tax to £40 valuation.  There is not much about that today, but these things have done enormous damage to the economy of this nation and have affected seriously people whose incomes were reduced over 50 per cent over a two-year period.</P>
    <P>One of the most extraordinary things about PLV is that the better land is lowly valued and the poorer land is highly valued. I understand that this came about during the Griffith valuation sometime in the mid-1850s when the land was being <Col N="3142" /> tilled and crops such as beans or wheat were being sown by spade and shovel. Heavy soil was suitable for that but it is not suitable for machinery and as a result not suitable for machinery and as a result of changing times we find that good land properly titled and fertilised can produce better crops while the poor land with the marl soil is unable to stand up to the big machinery.  It is no harm to mention that in this House.</P>
    <P>We have heard little about another situation regarding rates.  During 1980, as I have mentioned, we had the famous resource tax.  PLV was the criterion used to qualify or disqualify a person for that tax.  PLV is used also for qualifying people for the health service, for educational grants and for rates.  These things are not mentioned and they affect seriously the people with very high valuations.  I went to the bother of having a look at not just County Wexford but six or seven other counties also, and I find the very same position appertains to the other counties as to Wexford.  A person with 100 acres of land can have a £30 valuation in a county and a person in the same county with 60 acres of land can have a £60 valuation.  The officials of any Department have no other criterion or yardstick to measure whether these people should or should not benefit under certain schemes under PLV.  The time is ripe for the system to be changed and for Fianna Fáil to bring in another benefit as far as rates are concerned.  To use a figure of £50 valuation indiscriminately against landowners I would describe as careless because this system has no equity whatsoever. It is the same in every county whether it is west of the Shannon, in the south or in the east.  I have heard officials from the Department of Agriculture state that a system cannot be introduced which has a bearing on the acreage farmers have, but I believe that if the Minister checks with the Land Commission they will tell him that they have used this system for the past 40 years.  I see no obstacle to using this system in relation to rates.  If the Fine Gael Party get into power we are prepared to scrap the entire rates system.  The Minister may say that some of the large farmers with over £70 valuation should be well able to pay but <Col N="3143" /> I would like to remind him that a farmer with £100 valuation will now have to pay £14 to £15 in the pound in rates so his bill will be at least £1,500.</P>
    <P>Such people are also responsible for taxes.  The Minister may tell us that they can charge their rates against taxes.  What can the people charge their rates against if they have no money to pay taxes? There is an area in Wexford known as the Macamore, an area of 40,000 acres. The average valuation in that area is 85p per acre.  Those people have the worst land in County Wexford but they are deprived of educational and health grants.  They pay high rates and now they are being left out of the benefits announced today.  Any man who is working on an income which has been cut by 50 per cent over the last two years knows how serious it is to have to find £1,400 for rates.  Most of those people have to borrow money to pay their rates.  Last year these people had to borrow money to pay their rates and resource tax.  They also had to borrow money to buy food to feed their families.  There is not much in the Minister's Bill today about that.  If a general election was not likely to take place in the near future there would be very little by way of announcement from the Government as far as agriculture is concerned. During the four years the Government have been in office the agricultural industry has declined.</P>
    <P>Last year, after great pressure from the IFA, the Government brought in relief of the second moiety for people with valuation up to £50.  That relief was introduced in the last quarter of last year when rates were paid by most of the people I am talking about.  Rates is a very serious matter to any land owner.  Most of these small farmers sold breeding stock to pay their rates.  The Minister said that anybody who had paid their rates would get a refund but that did not come until January this year.  The Minister's Department forced the people to pay their rates. They only got the refund after they had sold their cattle at poor prices.  The people have been destocking to pay their rates and resource tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave relief last year but <Col N="3144" /> that was done only after great damage was inflicted on the agricultural industry. The Wexford County Council find that as a result of certain commitments by the Minister's Department no pressure will be put on people to pay the rest of the rates.  Wexford County Council are approximately £300,000 short and this affects our finances.  The Government gave the commitment but they were not prepared to pay for it.  The Minister's Department have an obligation to pay that £300,000 to allow us to carry on services within the county until the people are able to pay for them.  The Minister's Department should be prepared to stand over the commitment they gave.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the Minister, when he is talking about 94 per cent of rated owners who will benefit under this new scheme, of the thousands of farmers who have got no relief over the years in rates or taxes and who have failed to qualify for any benefits under health or education. Those are the people who keep the factories going, get the maximum production from their land and are prepared to invest.  Rates were not a great burden until recently but now they are a very serious matter.  The position would not be so bad if rates were related to income or profit.  If a man gets a bill for £1,500 or £1,600, although it will be paid in two moieties, he will have to pay up to £800. Such a man may look wealthy and may have assets but he has no income.  The income for such people has been seriously reduced in the last few years.  The Minister should give some relief to those people.  I understand we are not, under Standing Orders, allowed to put down any amendments which will involve the expenditure of money.  We can only appeal to the Minister in the interests of the major industry, agriculture &mdash; I am prepared to accept that it is necessary to go up to about £150 valuation because we are taking in only people with 200 acres of land &mdash; to give some relief to these people because they have paid down the years and got little or no benefit.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are claiming credit for action taken by the Coalition Government, but it is my belief that relief should be given to people with valuation of <Col N="3145" /> £150.  The policy pursued by the Government, particularly on the rates issue, has done serious damage.  The resource tax has brought in very little revenue.  This was another rates system, but because of pressure from this side of the House, that tax was dropped after one year.  Still the Government had the audacity to introduce it in 1980 although in the two previous years farmers' incomes had taken a drop of 45 per cent.  Fianna Fáil showed the farmers they were prepared to introduce what was described at that time as a selective wealth tax and they were prepared to reduce PLV from £70 to £40 valuation.  This measure created a great deal of uncertainty and did a lot of damage to the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>I welcome these measures but the sooner we have a Fine Gael Government the better because we will do away with rates altogether, which is the proper thing to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The PLV system has long outlived its usefulness.  Despite what the Minister said in his brief, the last Coalition Government started to abolish rates on dwellings.  It is not correct for the Minister to say:</P>
      <P>This movement towards greater equity in local taxation began when our long-standing commitment to abolish domestic rates was honoured from 1 January 1978.</P>
      <P>A few weeks before the 1973 election Fianna Fáil decided to abolish domestic rates.  Domestic rates were abolished by the Coalition Government, with the exception of less than 25 per cent which would have been abolished the year they took office.  It is unfair and untrue to say Fianna Fáil abolished domestic rates.  I wanted to put that on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ridiculous that in 1981 we should still be talking about a taxation system &mdash; because that is what rates are &mdash; which was introduced and operated as a result of the Griffith valuation carried out in the 1850s.  I was discussing this matter with Deputy Fitzpatrick who represents Cavan-Monaghan and he told me of a <Col N="3146" /> curious situation which occurs there. Meath is highly rated.  A rateable valuation of £1.50 per acre in Meath would be matched in the neighbouring land across the border by a rate of 50p an acre, while in Monaghan it would be over £1 per acre or even up to £1.50 per acre.  The reason is that when the Griffith valuation was being carried out a lot of wheat or flax was grown in most counties but they were not grown in Cavan with the result that the rates were low.  Since then they have had low rates, low valuation and everything that goes with it.  In my constitutency we had to pay the higher rate. When rates were removed from dwellings farmers &mdash; with the exception of those who were covered by previous Acts like this &mdash; were paying the full rate.</P>
    <P>The Minister should remember that last year his Government did an extraordinary thing.  They did away with many of the concessions given to those who were being derated and said it was no longer possible or equitable to do that. Then, having found out that things were not going too well, the Taoiseach &mdash; not the Minister for the Environment or the Minister for Agriculture &mdash; decided to reverse engines and restore remission on rates.  He went even further and said that those who had paid the first moiety need not pay the second until they were able &mdash; or words to that effect.  As a matter of fact, he said to the county councils &ldquo;Do not pester them.  The poor fellows want time.  Let us go easy on them,&rdquo; but he did not say what he meant by &ldquo;go easy on them&rdquo;.  The result is that in a number of areas those rates have not yet been paid. It is very difficult to collect the rates because the farmers rightly say that the Taoiseach said they need not pay them until they were able, and they say they are not able.  This had repercussions on health charges because people feel that what applies to rates should also apply to health charges and they should not be forced to pay them.</P>
    <P>Is there any gurantee that what is before us today will not be changed by Fianna Fáil if by any miracle they are returned to office after the general election? Is there any gurantee they will not decide the time has come to make farmtenc <Col N="3147" /> ers pay again and that they will not do what they did last year, only in reverse? Is there any guarantee they will not say that this was only a temporary measure to get them over the election?  It is a political trick to say this is permanent because before now it was renewable each year.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister answer a few questions? One deals with removing other charges, such as what would happen with regard to malicious injuries claims.  This means the State will be responsible for many more malicious injury payments than they were and everyone knows the malicious injuries bill will be pretty hefty this year because the Government did not govern.  That is what they are there for but they had not the guts to do it.  I hope they have changed their minds and realise it is their job to run the country.</P>
    <P>Another point, which is probably as much my fault as it is the Minister's, is that when the derating of houses took place no special provision was made to cover water rates.  In this city and in many towns water rates were collected with the rates but when the houses were derated water rates ceased.  In the country districts water rates were separate and farmers had to pay a few pounds a year, but these rates have been increased this year to £25.  Does the Minister understand that a local authority house in County Meath which was paying £9 PLV rates a few years ago, is now paying £25 water rates? Does he consider that to be equitable?  If it was a good move to abolish water rates in cities and towns, it should also be a good move to do away with water rates in the country.  This also applies to a farmer who makes one, two or three water connections and who is, in many cases, paying per litre.  The meter charges will be more than £25.  The Minister and the Government should know this is the most unfair system and they should get the Department officials to look at it with a view to doing something about it.</P>
    <P>The whole question of whether PLV should be continued at all should be thrashed out in the House by way of a special Bill.  The onus is on the Minister and the Government to go into this question <Col N="3148" /> of how local taxation is to be collected because it is ridiculous to find a situation in which one section are paying but another section are relieved from paying because somebody else is carrying the burden.  The ball is being tossed back and forward all the time.  It is where the value of the vote is greatest that the most relief is given.  That has been particularly noticeable in the past 18 months or so.</P>
    <P>If the Government had been serious about helping the agricultural industry they would have attempted to introduce a different type of farmer taxation.  Having lived all my life in the country I can say that smaller and medium-type farmers for years had a tough time.  Then with the advent of the EEC membership they had it soft for a while, but now they are back to the tough old times because their percentage profit is no greater than before EEC entry.  Many farmers in the two categories I have mentioned are barely able to make a living though they work hard in all weathers.  They are still being taxed under the same old idea that existed before the beginning of the century.</P>
    <P>Removing a section of farmers from the net does not mean that those who need assistance most from the State are getting it.  We know that farmers with valuations of £150, as Deputy D'Arcy has said, find it very hard to make a living while those on relatively small valuations, because of the type of farming they engage in and the location of their farms, are doing well.  All of them have to work hard in all types of weather but some are being treated more equal than others.  In farming as well as in industry and the professions the Government should devise a system whereby those who are making big money would be called on to pay their share of taxation while those who find it hard to make a living and rear families should get all possible assistance to enable them to live.</P>
    <P>We should not have the old system continued for no other reason than that Governments so far have not been prepared to sit down to devise something better.  I do not think I could imagine anything worse than the present system of farmer taxation.  It is not only land that <Col N="3149" /> is taxed but the valuation on which a farmer is taxed also covers persons, children, their right to free education, medical attention and 100 other things, simply because that is the way it was &mdash; if it was good enough for their grandfathers it is good enough for them.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that this is a permanent measure, that this will be the last Bill of its kind.  The Minister knows that there is nothing permanent in this House, not even ministerial seats, not to talk about legislation.  There is change from day to day and year to year. Therefore, if we are seriously interested in trying to help out what we have always considered to be our most important industry, we should do something about it now.  Many things will have to be considered: the types of crops grown, the conditions applying to different regions, the weather.  This year farmers are finding it impossible to put crops in because it has been raining at the wrong time.  I have seen them in my area working all night but suddenly the rain came, the machinery got stuck in the fields and they could not get it out.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there cannot be an overnight decision to do something for them but the Government must try to ensure that farmers are encouraged to get the best from their lands.  As I have said, a farmer whose valuation is £1 above a certain figure must pay a large proportion of his income in rates while the man immediately below him does not pay any.  Last year we had a similar Bill and what was said by Government speakers turned out to be nonsense within a month.  The Government attempted to reverse the situation and then we had the Taoiseach for the end of the year adopting a softly, softly approach.</P>
    <P>I hope this will not be the last Bill dealing with rates, as the Minister seemed to suggest, because any Bill of this kind dealing with PLV cannot be permanent legislation.  The way of this Bill is not the way it should be done. What we should be doing sensibly is encouraging farmers to grow what they can and what the people of the country want.  Then we will not have farmers going to the Border to picket lorries of <Col N="3150" /> Cyprus potatoes being imported despite a solemn promise from the Minister for Agriculture that such potatoes would not be allowed in.  Farmers should be encouraged to grow what is needed.</P>
    <P>Some years ago farmers and their workers were regarded simply as people who were not much use for anything but agriculture.  Now they have to be technicians as well, they have to be able to service their machinery to keep it working. It is not right that we should still be using a system devised by somebody in the 1850s, that we should now be attempting to regulate what that person should pay because of what happened over 130 years ago.  It does not make sense.  We have changed most things that occurred since then where we could.  I would appeal to the Minister to let his name be remembered in the Department for at least one suggestion of his, a better way for paying taxation other than rates based on PLV, because we could not have a worse system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have this opportunity to speak in support of the Bill.  The wellbeing of our biggest industry, agriculture, is vital to the wellbeing of our economy. One of the many measures Governments have chosen over the years to promote this wellbeing has been abating the effects of various taxes, including rates, on farmers' land.  The measures this Bill proposes will give the small and medium sized farmers rent abatements on a scale which is without equal in our history. Farmers with valuations up to £50 will pay no rates and farmers with valuations between £50 and £70 will pay only half the rates.  These are worthwhile and welcome improvements in the lot of farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own county of Offaly, 92 per cent of all rated holdings of land will be free of all rents, thanks to this Bill. Another 4 per cent will pay only half the rates.  In other words, a total of 96 per cent of land holdings in Offaly will be derated.  But for the provisions of this Bill a farmer with a valuation of £49 would be paying £591 for rates this year.  Now he will be paying nothing.  A farmer rated at £69 valuation will have his rates bill cut <Col N="3151" /> by £416.  I am confident that for the farmers in Offaly and elsewhere these measures will represent a welcome change.</P>
    <P>The Bill also extends the same generous rate abatements to urban areas.  In Tullamore Urban District, for example, about 70 land holders will be free of rates altogether as a result of this Bill.  I am glad that the Government saw fit to include the urban farmers in these generous new measures.  In all, as the Minister has stated, over 81,000 farmers, who were up to now liable for some rates, will now be totally exempt.  The measures proposed in this Bill will cost over £62 million this year and I am satisfied that these measures, together with the other incentives that the Government have extended to the farming sector, will provide a powerful stimulus to the farming industry and to the economy in general.</P>
    <P>This debate has been wide ranging and the Opposition went into more than rating. They dealt with agricultural income in great detail.  In my constituency very few people applied for the refund of rates last year.  As far as I can recall, at the November meeting of the county council the manager said that he had got no applications at all for a refund because they knew the money was going to come. I am glad to say that these two councils and many other councils paid out the money very quickly at the time.  There might have been an odd case where one might be inclined to exaggerate but I am satisfied that the repayments were paid very promptly and it was not the fault of our Department if some were not paid promptly because we took the necessary measures to deal with them.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get into farmers' incomes but I come from a farming community so I have a very good knowledge of the situation.  I can assure the House that the measures taken by the Minister for Agriculture have pleased the farming community and the results can be seen everywhere.  The people in Laois and Offaly are quite happy and I have no doubt that at the election we will get a mandate to continue the good work.</P>

      <P>We give a guarded welcome <Col N="3152" /> to this Bill.  Over all however, I would regard it as being a case of too little too late.  A great deal of damage has been done to the agricultural sector over the past four years and in particular in the past two years.  There was a time when relief was needed not just from rates but from taxation on all farmers, for the farming community.  Unfortunately, this was not forthcoming.  The result is that we have had the greatest depression ever known here, as bad as if not worse than in the thirties.  It has had serious repercussions on the economy.  It will take many years for the farming sector to set out of this recession, for the agriculture-related industries to get back on their feet fully.  We have seen more closures and job losses in the agriculture-related industries than in any other sector in the last two years.  It was a time when discretion should have been used by the Government to see that people were not put in a position where they had to cut back on production.  That is what has happened.  We have seen farmers reducing their stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  I am just dealing with the problems which farmers have had to endure due to the payments of rates.  We have seen cattle in calf being sold to the meat factories so people could pay their bills and in particular their rates.  That should not have been the case.  It has been a disastrous couple of years.  As Deputy D'Arcy mentioned, it is going to take a long time for the farming community to recover from that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics can make people believe all sorts of untruths.  The statistics here in front of us today look wonderful, but if one delves a little more deeply into them one sees that they do not tell the true story at all.  We are told by the Minister that 71,000 landowners in the country are now completely derated.  We are also told that over 13,000 are partially derated. The fact of the matter is that of those 71,000 people who are totally derated, <Col N="3153" /> the majority are not farmers at all.  A certain section of them may be involved in farming, but merely on a part-time basis.  A landowner can be defined and is defined as anybody who owns land which is rated, and that can be a small fraction of an acre.  For instance, I own two and a half acres of land and I certainly would not be classified as a farmer.</P>
    <P>Every cottier with an acre or less would come into that category, so it is misleading to give the impression that 71,000 farmers are being totally derated.  That is the impression the Government are trying to give although a considerably lesser number of full-time farmers are being derated.  In relation to the figure of 13,000 they are obviously the people within the rate of valuations from £50 to £70 and they are being only partly derated. The people who contribute most per head to agriculture are the people in the higher rateable valuations although there may be some exceptions.  The people with valuations in excess of £70 are not getting any relief under this Bill. These are the large producers whether they are dairy farmers milking 100 or 200 cows or whether they are producing beef. It is these progressive farmers who have been hammered, especially during the past two years by the recession and they get no relief under this Bill.  People in this category have rates bills which vary from £1,000 to £3,000 irrespective of whether they are making a profit or not.  In the past two years many of them have not made a profit.  They have had to sell off stock and to forego development which is so necessary for the progress of agriculture. It is a ruinous situation and we cannot condone a form of taxation which is not related to the income.  Such a system cannot be tolerated.  We have advocated that the sooner rates as a form of taxation are eliminated the better.  A farmer or businessman cannot complain if he is taxed on his net profits and that is as it should be.  That is not the case at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister boasts that 94 per cent of landowners are being completely derated and that another 3 per cent are being partially derated but he should think in terms of 100 per cent derating.  That does <Col N="3154" /> not seem an impossible target.  We should fully derate the other 3 per cent and the 3 per cent who are already partially derated. Why is there a great barrier and why can this not be done completely?</P>
    <P>With the recession we have had a national slump in employment and a national economic slump from which it will take us years to recover.  The agricultural sphere is where the assistance is needed but instead of eliminating rates on people in that category more impositions such as the 2 per cent levy on all forms of agricultural output, and a resource tax on farmers with valuations over £70 were imposed.  The Government are killing the goose that lays the golden egg because agriculture is the basis of our whole economy.  When there is a recession in agriculture all sectors suffer and it has taken this recession to make the PAYE sector realise how dependent we are on a booming agricultural sector.  In times of depression measures should be taken to alleviate the hardships involved. While the Taoiseach last January made noises about doing that, he did not come through with the necessary measures.</P>

      <P>At that time the Taoiseach said that nobody would be unduly pressed for payment if they had not the means.  However farmers in my county have been getting summonses for nonpayment of rates in the past couple of weeks.  Many of them can ill afford to pay rates.  Many people were too proud to wait and in order to pay their way they did what was not prudent for themselves or for the country; they sold off stock which is badly needed to build up the national herd.  There should have been a definite form of relief and not just a half promise which is what they got from the Taoiseach.  There was no definite follow up to what the Taoiseach said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local rating authorities may have let up for a short space but they have now started to call in the money and some people cannot afford that demand.  We would like to have seen something more <Col N="3155" /> concrete as a result of the Taoiseach's statement.  As well as misleading the farming community he seriously depleted the resources of local authorities, particularly county councils because rates were not coming in.  The Government should have compensated the county councils and written off the rates which were being demanded from people who were not in a position to pay them.  That was the solution.  Great damage has been done to the agriculture sector by the inflexible attitude adopted.  There should have been some definite form of relief.  The farming community do not object to paying tax on profits but we certainly object to being asked to pay a penal tax such as rates, the 2 per cent levy or resource tax when a profit is not being made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully pointed out in his speech that factors other than rates arise nowadays. In many cases they exceed what would have normally been payable in rates.  Deputy Tully referred to water rates from which there is no relief.  The amount of money to be paid in water rates has become astronomical.  In cases it is almost £1,000.  It is a new form of rate which takes the place of the rates which were relieved.  Besides that, there are excessive charges in respect of VAT. All these things are adding tremendously to the cost of inputs in farming.  One cannot talk about relief in just one sphere when the impositions in other spheres more than offset the relief given.  It is a misnomer to say that farmers are being relieved when their overheads have become considerably greater due to new forms of taxation and an increase in existing forms of taxation such as water rates.</P>
    <P>We give a certain welcome to this Bill as it goes a small way towards alleviating the hardships of certain farmers.  However, it does not alleviate the hardships of some of the more progressive farmers and as a result agriculture and employment are taking the beating.  We welcome the extension of the relief to farmers in urban areas.  This was an anomaly which should not have been tolerated.  It was most unfair that a person inside an urban boundary would have to pay full rates when a neighbour would get relief.  I compliment <Col N="3156" /> the Minister on eliminating that, something which was long overdue. Overall the Bill is only a sop.

      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on this Bill of which there has been unfair criticism.  Deputy Deasy mentioned that farmers had been left out, that the rest of them were part-time farmers.  If 96 per cent of landholders are part-time farmers, only 3 per cent are contributing in any way towards the economy.  I do not agree with that.  I believe small farmers are hard-working people who have contributed down through the years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was the odd man out in my own party because I did not agree with completely derating small houses and farms.  Taxation must come from somewhere.  If it comes off one thing it goes on something else.  In this case you must take from the wealthy to give to the lower classes.  Down through the years when subsidies were given to farmers the sky was the limit.  The more acres a farmer had the bigger subsidy he drew. I believe in subsidising a person to a point where he can make a living.  I do not believe in subsidising the rich to get <Col N="3157" /> richer.  I know some farmers are in a bad way.</P>
      <P>I never agreed with the poor law valuation. Why is there a song and dance about it today?  I am in favour of the adjusted acre because I think poor law valuation is grossly unfair.  For as long as I can remember I have been complaining about it and no Government have done anything about it.  The Minister, who came in with a good package, should not be criticised for not doing something about the poor law valuation.  I would like to see an alternative to the poor law valuation.  Deputy D'Arcy made good suggestions.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission adjusted acre scheme is very fair, putting the good with the bad and getting an average.  Having said that, I think the Minister has done a reasonably good job.  We had a recession in 1974.  I spent evenings on the Opposition benches trying to get the Government to do something.  I remember they gave a fodder subsidy.  At that time you had to gamble a calf.  Things were also bad in 1978, but the Government made an effort by meeting farming organisations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to congratulate the Minister for including urban farmers.  I have been campaigning for this for years.  It is extraordinary what can happen coming up to an election.  I read in our local paper where a councillor mentioned at the <Col N="3158" /> urban council meeting at Ballinasloe that he had got a letter from a Senator saying that urban farmers were now going to get the same relief as rural farmers.  One would imagine the Senator had given that relief, which came from the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>The relief on rates does not affect the overall situation.  I have been preaching for a long time that we should subsidise the cost of production.  This is partly subsidising the cost of production because it has taken the rates off land.  Deputy Deasy mentioned £49 valuation.  Where I come from the rates are about £14 in the pound.  That will given an idea of what relief a small farmer has this year. Deputy Tully rightly mentioned other charges.  Something will have to be done to remedy the whole question of local rates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has done a good job in this Bill.  I criticise the <Col N="3159" /> Government as often as I criticise the Opposition, but no reasonable person could criticise this Bill.  Ninety-six per cent of land owners in the country have been completely derated.  Small farmers have been the backbone of the country down through the years.  I hope they will be again and that they will get subsidies to keep them on the land.  They did not get big subsidies from directive 159 when it came in.  They gave lousy grants to the small farmers and large grants to the bigger farmers.  This Bill has given them something.  There was no talk about the PLV for the first £20.  I do not agree with PLV, but what is the point of making a song and dance about it today when it has been in existence for so many years?</P>

      <P>I could not agree more. The Opposition had a poor case today.  I shall not be here to listen to what Deputy Fitzpatrick will have to say, but he will have something better to say, wherever he gets it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That package is a good one which will be accepted by the farmers, because farmers are in no way fools at all.  There are a few who are in the higher valuation and it is unfair and unjust, but we have no other system.  I would appeal to the Minister and to any Government in office to try to get away from that form of taxation.  I want to put it on record that I would be in thorough agreement with its abolition.  It was certainly great that the 9,000 farmers in the urban area were put in the same category as those in the rural area.  I could ramble on, but the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is the very man who would control my rambling.  I am convinced, as far as subsidising farm income is concerned, that there should be a complete change in attitude and not such emphasis on price rises.  After we joined the EEC, prices fell flat in 1974 and went up at an amazing rate in 1978 but the cost of production went up along with the price increases.  I would be better off, as a farmer, taking £100 less for cattle if my cost of production was less.  The EEC should consider that.  High prices <Col N="3160" /> are only feeding inflation.  The farmers' input should be subsidised.</P>
    <P>This may be my last term here, but I will say that any time anything good came along, no matter which Government were in power &mdash; and Deputy Tully knows this more than anyone &mdash; I gave them great praise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> There can be no doubt about it, a confident and prosperous agricultural industry is the backbone of this country. The success or failure of our economy depends on a confident and prosperous agricultural sector.  Our capacity for generating employment depends on agriculture. The extent of our balance of payments and our trade balance depend on agriculture.  It is, therefore, essential that we have an agricultural industry which has confidence in itself and which can generate wealth.  Unless we have that sort of agricultural industry, there is no future for our other industries.  Direct employment in agriculture is enormous and there is a very considerable amount of spin-off <Col N="3161" /> employment from it.  The number of people directly and indirectly employed here in this sector is very high indeed.</P>
      <P>At the moment, our balance of trade is alarming and is worrying all our experts and economists.  To get the situation into a managable state we must rely on agriculture. Our foreign debt is also enormous and again we rely on agriculture. Our farmers will do a good job if they are given conditions in which they can engage in long-term planning.  The performance of the Government in regard to farming taxation, and rates in particular, over the last number of years is a glaring example of the way in which uncertainty is created in agriculture.  We have had a stop-go policy in regard to agricultural taxation, an up and down policy.  Nowhere was that more apparent than in regard to rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government were campaigning before the 1977 election they gave the impression, in their manifesto, and certainly at the doors of the houses of rural Ireland, that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power, agricultural rates and farm taxation would disappear like snow off a road.  I propose only to deal with their performance in regard to agricultural rates.  The first thing they did on resuming power was to introduce a Bill which abolished relief in respect of rates on all agricultural holdings with a valuation of more than £70 a year.  In that way, they increased enormously the rates payable by farmers with valuations exceeding £70.  These rates went up by something like 50 per cent.  Some of the Deputies in this House may not have a lot of sympathy for farmers with a valuation of over £70, but that is what the Government did as from 1 January 1978. On 1 January 1979 they abolished relief in respect of rates on agricultural holdings with a valuation of £60, almost doubling the rates for that category of farmer.  Again, some people may not have much sympathy with people with a valuation of £60, which they may think is a high valuation.  As from 1 January 1980 the Fianna Fáil Government had a right go at the agricultural community.  They <Col N="3162" /> abolished relief on rates in respect of agricultural holdings with valuations of £40 or over.  The farmer who the previous year paid on average about £190 on rates was asked to pay £490.  In other words, his rates went up two-and-a-half times. That was the performance of this Government in regard to rates, as well as introducing the numerous levies which we all know about, including the notorious 2 per cent levy.  Farmers did not know what their taxation would be.  For that reason, they cut down on production. The national cattle herd, about which Deputy Gibbons used to talk so much, is back to our pre-EEC figures. Fianna Fáil undid all the good that had been achieved as a result of the aids and increases that we had benefited from. They did this by way of the uncertainty they created in regard to taxation and also by way of inflation.  The result is that the national herd is now at about 1970 figures and is certainly well below the 1972 figure.  What is worse, as Deputy Leonard knows, the cow herd is very low. This is very unfortunate especially in our part of the country where milk production and the grazing of cattle constitute the backbone of the income of the agricultural community.  In County Wexford the predominant aspect of agriculture may be grain but that is not so where I come from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am relating the fall in agricultural production and in cattle numbers to the increases in rates in 1978, 1979 and 1980 and to the uncertainty created by the taxation policy.  Farmers did not know what was happening.  Because of the very serious drop in the national cow herd numbers, it will be many years before the position can be rectified.  In the meantime, the small and medium farmers of Counties Cavan and Monaghan and of the other counties also, are suffering drastically.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances I am glad that this Bill is before us.  It is a Bill that indicates an about turn and rightly so in the policy pursued by Fianna Fáil since 1978 when they increased rates by two-and-a-half times on valuations of between £40 and £50, when they were increasing rates substantially on valuations of between £50 and £70 and when they were increasing rates very substantially also on valuations of more than £70. The Bill indicates a repentance, albeit a death-bed repentance, on the part of the Government who, fortunately, have realised how unjust was their policy and how bad it was for agriculture and for the country generally.</P>
      <P>In the context of the overall lack of confidence among the agriculture community, there is nothing more serious than the drop in cow numbers because this situation will continue to manifest itself in the years ahead as its ill effects will be experienced by the farmers and by those employed in the meat factories in Ballyjamesduff, in Clones and elsewhere. The factories will not be able to obtain supplies and, consequently, the workers will be either put on a three-day week or laid off entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of this Bill the Government are reversing a policy which has done a lot of damage and about which they did not say anything when they were campaigning for the farmers' votes in 1977.  In addition to what I have mentioned here, there were the various levies that are too <Col N="3164" /> numerous to mention but the one that we remember most, perhaps, was the 2 per cent levy.  Then, there was the resource tax which amounted to a wealth tax, a selective wealth tax, on the agricultural community and which was nothing more nor less than rates on top of rates.  However, Fianna Fáil learned the hard way. They dropped the resource tax after it had done a lot of damage and now they are reducing the rates that they increased enormously after those increases, too, have resulted in a lot of damage.  The 2 per cent levy damaged not only the farmers but the entire country.  It had the result of separating the agricultural community from the urban community.  After the Government changed their mind about the levy, they were hit by the trade union sector.  The damage that has been done to this country by the crazy policy of Fianna Fáil in the area of rates, levies and resource taxes, is untold.</P>
    <P>The Government introduced forms of taxation that took no account of profit or income.  The increase in rates from between 33 to 60 per cent on farmers in the various categories took no account of capacity to pay.  The same applied so far as the 2 per cent levy was concerned and also so far as the resource tax was concerned.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister for the Environment intending to pursue the abolition of rates and to cease to assess the means of farmers for educational grants whether general education or agricultural, or for health charges on the rating system?  The Minister admits that abolishing rates up to the £50 valuation level is unfair.  Is it his intention to abolish the system of applying the PLV to assess the income of a farmer for education and scholarship grants for his children and in respect of his liability for health contributions?  It is obvious that a farmer should be assessed on his income and not on an imaginary profit.  Farmers made no profit either in 1979 or in 1980 but in those years they were assessed on a profit basis and deprived of educational grants for their families.  This was in a situation in which farmers suffered losses and where their cousins in the towns were enjoying the <Col N="3165" /> type of grants, although earning more, that the farmers were being deprived of. What is the Minister's policy in regard to that?</P>
    <P>I want to know also what the Minister intends to do with regard to farmers who are receiving writs for rates they were unable to pay last year.  Does he intend to allow those proceedings to go ahead? Does he intend to allow the county councils to sue farmers, as they must do unless they get a direction to the contrary from the Minister?</P>
    <P>The Minister is now proposing to abolish rates in respect of holdings with a PLV of up to £50 and to halve rates where the PLV is between £50 and £70.  Does he intend to extract from farmers an amount equivalent to 50 per cent of the rates in one way or another?  This year the Minister made a speech at Kilkenny and he told the gathering on that occasion that there were ways and means for local authorities to boost their incomes.  He pointed out that there was at least £1 million to be got in the area of planning applications.  In his speech the Minister said local authorities could make good the loss they had suffered by charging for services.  What services was he talking about?  Is it the Minister's intention to charge for services that have been free up to now?  In my opinion the Minister is imposing charges on farmers to counter the abolition of rates.  I defy any Deputy in the House to say the Minister did not make that speech in Kilkenny.  I think he spoke on that occasion to county managers and I should like an interpretation of that speech from the Minister when he is replying.  He specifically mentioned water rates and planning applications.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that farmers within urban districts who did not enjoy relief of rates will have their rates abolished now.  That measure is long overdue. I have been a member of a local authority since 1950, with a short break when I was in government.  During all that time I have advocated at conferences that farmers within urban areas should get the same treatment as farmers elsewhere. Deputy Tully raised this matter also.  He and I want to know if water rates will be abolished.  They are payable in some local <Col N="3166" /> authority areas but not in others.  When rates on private dwellings were abolished water rates were not abolished and I want to know what is being proposed with regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>I hope that the introduction of this Bill can be taken as an assurance to the agricultural community that there is an end to the up and down form of taxation operated by Fianna Fáil since 1977. There was the proposal to increase rates for three years and the introduction of a two-tier rating system by imposing a resource tax and various levies in addition to rates but now Fianna Fáil see the folly of their ways when the damage is done.  Restitution is welcome at any time but farmers have suffered severe hardship. This Bill can be welcomed in the same way as was the prodigal son when he returned home.  The prodigal son did not offend half as much as this Government have offended the farmers by the imposition of huge amounts of rates.</P>
    <P>This is not the first strange performance of Fianna Fáil in regard to rates. Some people here referred to the 1977 election campaign in this connection.  I should like to make a passing reference to the 1973 election when we campaigned on the basis of making certain concessions with regard to rates.  We proposed abolishing rates on houses by instalments over four years but Fianna Fáil said that was stupid, that the money could not be got.  They relied on a white paper they had produced a few years previously which said that the only way to finance local government was by way of rates.  In the 1973 election campaign&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Deputy Collins arranged for the printing of one million leaflets to distribute throughout the country, stating that the policy of the National Coalition in relation to abolition of rates was daft, that it could not be introduced and that it would ruin the country.  That was done for two of the three weeks of the election campaign and then there was an about-turn by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3167" /> Deputy Collins's leaflets were scrapped, but he could not stop the advertisement in the local paper.  He took a full-page advertisement in the local paper condemning the policy of abolishing rates in four equal instalments.  While the local paper in Deputy Collins's constituency carried this huge advertisement, the leaders of the party changed the policy. They made speeches saying that if they were elected they would abolish rates the next day.  They would abolish rates holus bolus, rump and stump, immediately they got into office, although Deputy Collins's advertisement was condemning and damning and denouncing any such policy.  It is no wonder that they have an up and down stop-go approach to the rating system.</P>
    <P>It would be funny, and we could all laugh at it and enjoy it, if it did not have the disastrous effect on agriculture which it had in the past couple of years.  Let us hope that sort of performance is at an end.  The only way the Irish farmers can ensure that some new tax will not be thought of by Fianna Fáil to extract money from them in the form of charges other than rates is to change the Government at once.  I do not know when the election will be held.  They say it was ready to be held last week and put off. There is an old saying in our part of the country: &ldquo;He who hesitates is lost&rdquo;.</P>

There is probably more marginal land in Cavan than there is in Monaghan and therefore <Col N="3168" /> the PLV is not as high as it is in Monaghan. Monaghan is fifth or sixth in the league after Meath, Louth, Dublin, Kildare, Limerick, and so on, with the highest PLVs per acre in the country.  The Griffith valuation is out of date and I support very strongly any move towards revaluation.</P>
    <P>Farmers with PLVs under £50 are completely derated.  That is to be commended. Most farmers in the Border regions have valuations of £50 or less. Many of them are full-time farmers. There are many PLVs per acre as high as £1.25 or £1.30 and many farmers are working on 45 or 50 acres of land.  They face a real struggle, irrespective of how capable they are, and irrespective of how efficient their production is of meat, milk, or whatever.  They are working on a limited acreage.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Besides the unprecedented scale of the new reliefs, the Bill embodies three other welcome improvements.  For the first time in 35 years the legislation to give effect to the agricultural grant will be expressed in a permanent rather than a temporary set of measures.</P>
    <P>That is very important.  People can plan in advance and know their commitments. If they are developing their land, or purchasing land, or increasing their stock numbers, or breeding stock, or fertilising, or reseeding, they will know that they have not got to meet the burden of rates in the future.  That is a very important aspect.</P>
    <P>I could not follow Deputy Deasy's line of thought when he mentioned the derating of an extra 71,000 holdings.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The extension of the 100 per cent allowances to holdings with valuations between £20 and £50 means that the present Bill is derating an extra 71,250 holdings in county council areas for the first time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to cottiers with half acres.  Did he realise that up to now cottiers with half acres and farmers with two-and-a-half acres were under the £20 valuation and were not paying rates on <Col N="3169" /> their land?  That knocks his argument that the cottiers and the men with very small acreages made up the 71,000 people mentioned in the Minister's speech.  I take it their valuations are between £20 PLV and £50 PLV which are completely derated.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Another innovation of the Bill is its extension of the agricultural grant reliefs to all land in urban areas.  This will benefit an additional 9,500 land holders.</P>
    <P>While the number is not very large, it is an important aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Years ago the land of farmers in urban areas was more valuable when they supplied milk and vegetables because they lived a very short distance from the market place.  Now milk is supplied by the co-operatives and there is no fresh milk in most towns.  There are no fresh milk outlets in Monaghan town.  It is all pasteurised, packaged and bottled.  Many of the vegetables purchased in that region come from north County Dublin and other places, which is deplorable.  The farmer in the urban area is now producing on a par with the man in the rural areas. I am glad to see that anomaly being removed.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that farmers eligible for relief of rates on land will no longer suffer the irritant of having to meet the levy of certain separate charges, such as those for malicious injuries, on their rateable valuations.  This separate charge was discussed by most local authorities.  In our county especially the situation obtained in which many farmers were not liable for rates since the withdrawal of rates from domestic dwellings and those with a valuation of under £20.  In Monaghan 10p or perhaps 13p in the £ was levied as a separate charge for malicious injuries.  We decided that it was not worth while and would cost too much in stationery.  Therefore, I am glad to note that that charge will be met now from central funds.  This is particularly welcome in Monaghan where over the past few weeks we have been faced with the wanton destruction of the finest building in the town, the courthouse, and another <Col N="3170" /> private dwelling belonging to Lord Rossmore which contained many valuables. Following the burning of the courthouse an estimate of the damage caused was £2 million.  Even if that were exaggerated there is no doubt that the bill for damages in both those cases will total £2 million. That is a bill that could not be met by any local authority.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the remaining 6 per cent, the 3 per cent receiving partial relief and the other 3 per cent receiving none.  It would be interesting to know the amount of revenue such would yield.  The people finding it most difficult to earn a living from the land are those with valuations up to £50 and also those with valuations between £50 and £70, receiving 50 per cent relief.  There has been mention here also of the difficulties farmers face.  This rates relief, along with other measures introduced, constitute a positive step in enabling them to plan ahead in so far as they know they do not have to meet a rates bill in future years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to support this Bill, one of the many measures this Government, who are a caring Government, have introduced. The Government realise that farmers have been experiencing bad times over the past two years.  Last year grants were given to first time silage makers to help them produce winter feed, enabling them to carry their cattle over the glut period in the months of October and November. The grant given, £150, was quite small but it meant that many farmers were able to keep their cattle over to the springtime, when prices rose, when confidence was restored, when there was realisation that we had an excellent Minister for Agriculture who could negotiate with his counterparts in Brussels to get the bestever Irish package brought back by any Minister since we joined the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year relief of the second moiety of rates was granted to certain farmers in an effort to help them, and we saw the benefit it was to them.  This relief is a follow-up on that.  Ninety-four per cent of farmers will now be relieved of rates. But what is of more interest to me is to <Col N="3171" /> know that the grant for the relief of rates from the Government to County Meath alone will amount to £1.9 million. Eighty-seven per cent of all holdings in the county will be completely relieved of rates, with a further 4.4 per cent paying half only.  That means just over 8 per cent of farmers in Meath will be paying rates this year.  To give the House some idea of the benefit in hard cash to individual farmers, a farmer with a valuation of £49 will benefit to the tune of £483 while a farmer with a valuation of £69 will benefit to the tune of £340 in rates relief.  Therefore this constitutes something really concrete and worthwhile for farmers, enabling them to plan ahead.  Now farmers know they will not have to meet the first moiety, usually collected in June&mdash;which was the worst possible time for them&mdash;or the second in September.  The small and medium-sized farmers are being relieved of this rates burden in future years.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of urban areas being relieved of this burden.  Formerly in some towns the urban area stretched out to the farmland, where people were badly caught, having to pay full rates, receiving no relief whatsoever.</P>
    <P>One provision particularly welcome is that the State will now take over responsibility for malicious damage claims. Indeed in the past week two very fine buildings were burned down at enormous cost.  I well remember being a member of the county council when there was this type of burning of property in the early seventies, or earlier, when the bill for damages was astronomical.  The ratepayers of County Meath had to pay for the burnings and explosions that took place and which, in most instances we felt, were not carried out by people within the county.  In one case the Garda were able to follow the perpetrators of such misdeeds across the county boundary.  Also we were always being billed with any malicious injuries that took place in Drogheda because Drogheda Corporation felt the people who cause the damage could have come from County Meath since it was just on the border.  To be on the safe side they would always put in a claim against Louth County Council and <Col N="3172" /> an equal claim against Meath County Council and then the courts would decide which county would have to meet the bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very welcome and will be of immense value to the County Meath farmers.  When the figures are added up they amount to quite a substantial sum of £1.9 million, a worthwhile sum when you consider that it refers to just one county. The farmers in Meath and elsewhere will appreciate very much the benefits accruing from this Bill.  It will bring into effect the benefits of the budget apart from taking away the malicious injuries claims which can be substantial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle earlier remarked that this Bill was not about the general election but about rates on agricultural land.  In fact he probably was not describing the situation entirely accurately because it would be unreal for us to think that the debate on the Bill is not being held in a situation where members are and have been expecting for some weeks past a general election.  In that context it is interesting to see that arrangements for discussing the Bill were very hurriedly moved forward. The original Order of Business for this week was changed so as to bring discussion on this Bill forward from its original place in the list to become the first item to be discussed on this first sitting of the Dáil this week.  I believe it was because of the imminence of a general election and because of the anxiety of Government Deputies to see this legislation enacted so as to give effect to budget proposals that this move was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, the move was felt necessary by Government Deputies because of the lack of confidence among the agricultural sector in the attitude of the Government and in the record of the Government regarding our farmers over the past four years.  That is in stark contrast with the supposed restoration of confidence referred to by Deputy Crinion and others this afternoon.  The fact is that Irish farmers' confidence in the Government's attitude towards them and in the Government's ability to deliver for them was sorely and severely tested in the past four <Col N="3173" /> years.  Let us be honest about it: those farmers who in large measure helped to elect the present Government in 1977 by changing their political allegiance, many of them for the first time in a lifetime of voting, on foot of promises made to them mainly regarding farmer taxation were lured into a false situation on the basis of the misinformation and misleading prom&mdash; ises and have suffered the consequences since.  While I understand the anxiety of Government Deputies to have this Bill enacted before the Dáil is dissolved because of their difficulties with the farming community, I do not believe that any measures such as this or any other belated measure by the Government would regain for them the confidence of the farming community, which as a Government they deliberately, one might almost have thought, threw away in the past four years.  As other Opposition Deputies have said, both in relation to the 2 per cent levy and the introduction of the resource tax, which in all but name was a replacement of the wealth tax, the Government showed their true colours and attitude towards the farming community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Most extraordinary was the Government's attitude towards rates on agricultural land because, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, in three successive years the Government took steps to dismantle assistance traditionally given to the agricultural sector.  They first reduced to £70 the limit for farmers to get agricultural abatement.  In the following year they reduced it to £60 and later reduced it to £40.  So it remains that only those farmers under £40 valuation could receive agricultural abatement.  That was the situation up to early 1980.  Yet we now have a Bill which the Government had to introduce when they saw the chaos created in the agricultural community during 1980. This Bill gives relief of the second moiety of rates for farmers of between £40 and £60 valuation and it also seeks to implement the provisions of this year's budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe the Irish farmers will be fooled again as they were in 1977 or <Col N="3174" /> that they regard this Bill as an expression of the Government's good intent towards agriculture, because the record of the past four years is clear.  It is a record of sorry mismanagement in regard to the agricultural community.  As has been asked by other Deputies, I ask how was it, when in the course of 1980 local authorities were asked to &ldquo;go easy&rdquo;&mdash; I think that was the expression used &mdash; with the farmers who found difficulty in paying their rates, that there was no talk then about who would pick up the tab? The fact is that it was going easy very belatedly on the part of the Government to announce that local authorities should hold their hands against farmers in financial difficulties.  The Government were spending other people's money in that announcement; they were suggesting that local authorities should go without money they could ill afford to forego. That was the position regarding that piece of deceit and sleight of hand on that occasion.</P>
    <P>As regards agricultural rates we are doing nothing more now than tinkering with the system.  No doubt this measure would not have been proposed had there not been put forward by Deputy Bruton, then Fine Gael spokesman on agriculture and subsequently Deputy D'Arcy, six points to become as it were a rescue package for our farmers.  In those six points we as a party undertook to relieve the agricultural community entirely of the burden of rates and we introduced a Bill to that effect here some months ago. The simple situation is that there is no way this proposal would have been before the House were it not for the fact that the Government perceived we were prepared to make a realistic approach to the farming community and provide a climate to restore confidence in agriculture, something which has been lacking in recent years.</P>
    <P>Very often in the past it has been an easy pastime for Deputies who did not have a rural segment in their constituency to indulge in farmer-bashing, but the remarks made today are valid.  In the same way as what is good for General Motors is good for the United States, what is good for Irish agriculture is good <Col N="3175" /> for the Irish economy.  When agriculture suffers the entire economy suffers.  In the last two years we have seen the effects of the downturn in agriculture on the economy, the balance of trade and on our exports.  I do not accept that the partial measures proposed in the Bill will go towards solving the problems of our farmers.  The Minister for the Environment, who introduced the Bill, should know that a large proportion of the farmers in his constituency and in mine, will not be assisted by this measure because many of them have valuations in excess of £70.  Certainly a high number of them in the £50 to £70 category are endevouring to carry on business in Fingal, the constituency of Dublin-North.  The Minister must know that farmers with large valuations have been faced with rate demands of the order of £2,000 or £2,500. The Minister must be aware of people in north County Dublin who in their agricultural trading account last year lost up to £5,000.  However, they are still obliged to pay up to £2,500 in rates to the local authority.</P>
    <P>It is irresponsible of the Government to suggest that local authorities should go easy in seeking this money.  That money is due to the local authorities and without it they cannot provide the services they are legally charged to provide.  I should like to emphasise, on behalf of Fine Gael, that our commitment is to the total abolition of rates on agricultural land.  We are disappointed that this measure has not gone as far as was proposed some months ago by us or as far as is necessary to restore confidence to the farming community. I am disappointed that the Minister, who must be aware that a number of his constituents lost money in the course of their farming enterprises in the last year, had not done anything to help such people.  In some cases the amount of help they received is marginal.  There is inequity in a system where a man operating to the best of his ability over 12 months who experiences a sizeable loss on his operations can be asked to pay a sum of the order of £2,000 or £2,500 as a form of local taxation.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Callanan said, there is a <Col N="3176" /> need to examine the sources of local finance and assess where the local authority system now stands.  There is a need to examine the future method of funding, but it would be unrealistic at this stage to suggest that there is now going to be a reintroduction of rates as a form of local taxation.  All political parties have committed themselves to the abolition of rates on domestic property and it is, as Deputy Tully said, a little less than honest of the Minister to suggest that it was his party alone who abolished domestic rates.  My recollection is that his party abolished one-quarter of the remaining domestic rates.  The health and housing charges had been removed from the rates between 1973 and 1976 and between 1975 and 1977 three-quarters of the remaining domestic rate was funded by the Government at the time.  The additional amount abolished by Fianna Fáil was to meet the one-quarter levy that would have been sought for domestic rates in 1978 as a last contribution.</P>
    <P>It is unrealistic to suggest that any of the political parties will put forward the notion of the re-introduction of domestic rates to finance local government.  That should be made clear.  It is also unrealistic to suggest that there will be a continuation of agricultural rates.  An indication that Fianna Fáil are moving towards Fine Gael policy in this matter is the introduction of the Bill before the House.  Is it not extraordinary that over a succession of three years farmers should have seen their rate bills more than doubled?  That has been the situation through the change in the abatement structure and as a result of increases of the order of 10 and 12 per cent in rate demands that came about each year since 1977.  The average farmer is now paying more than twice the amount he paid for rates in 1977.  Is it not extraordinary that a Government who deliberately brought about that situation in three successive years should now turn about and attempt to abolish agricultural rates in this partial fashion?  On behalf of Fine Gael I want to state clearly that in Government it is our intention that rates on agricultural land be abolished entirely.  In that way this measure falls far short of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill, one of the most welcomed pieces of legislation to be introduced in recent years.  It is welcome because it is acceptable and is a step in the right direction. It is welcome because it endeavours, as far as possible, to restore equity to the majority of our small farmers.  I should like to commend the Minister, and the Government, on their foresight in placing this Bill before the House.  Farmers appreciate what is being done for them in this legislation.  I am not surprised at the muddled thinking which is affecting the minds of Opposition Deputies.  They feel their thunder has been stolen from them.  They feel that there is not any opportunity now of getting back into Government.  Their contribution to the debate clearly indicates they have lost a weapon they felt they could use on Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil and the Government deserve great credit for introducing this Bill at a time when the farming community need a boost.  We are delighted to have reached a stage where 96 per cent of our farmers enjoy derating, complete or partial.  That is a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate has indicated that Fine Gael are concerned only about the big farmers, that 3½ per cent or 4 per cent of our people who have big farms.  If a farmer with 1,000 acres, 500 acres or 300 acres is not capable of farming that holding and paying rates, he should get out of agriculture quickly.  Another matter which was carefully missed by Opposition speakers is the fact that farmers who pay rates qualify for tax remission.  That is a concession to all farmers, but Opposition speakers cleverly ignored that fact, because it would not suit them to see it. But the farmers who are paying rates know full well that they can claim remission for the full contribution of rates when making their tax returns.  That in itself is a benefit which those bigger farmers who are not covered by this Bill are getting.  Generally speaking it is wonderful legislation and is going to benefit the farming community.  In my county of Westmeath the farmers stand to benefit to the tune of £1.5 million this year.  That <Col N="3178" /> may seem insignificant in the eyes of the Labour Party but it is a very significant advance in so far as the farming community are concerned because they have no longer to worry about the appearance of the rate collector at their door twice yearly.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  The fact that the Opposition are so annoyed here today is one clear indication that the Bill is a success.  The farming community are going to accept it and they are going to go to the polls and once again endorse the Fianna Fáil Party as the friend of the small farmer. That has been clearly borne out here today when Opposition Deputies expressed concern for only the bigger farmers who already are enjoying benefits through tax concessions by the rates set-off.  This Bill will introduce a new element of confidence in farming in Ireland. This has been a successful year so far for Irish agriculture and this Bill goes further to demonstrate the Government's concern for the farming community. Whether we like it or not, farming is our greatest single industry and, therefore, every effort must be made, is being made and has been made by this Government over the last six months, to ensure that the farmers will regain the confidence required in order to give a boost to agriculture in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture is associated mainly with <Col N="3179" /> exports, and that fact is of great benefit to the economy of this country. It is of great benefit to the employment incentives here because money generated through agricultural wealth filters right back through the economy and every section of the community benefits directly or indirectly because farmers are good spenders.  Loók at the employment content of the co-operatives today.  That would not have been possible without a thriving and progressive farming community. This Bill gives a further incentive to farmers to modernise their own economies and produce more for export.  The markets are there and the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy MacSharry, brought back a fine package from Brussels. This is a further fine package which will benefit the farming community and I have no hesitation in saying that it will be remembered by them.  The words of the Opposition expressing concern for the bigger farmers only will be remembered by the 100,000 small farmers in this country.</P>
    <P>This is fine legislation and I accept it without any criticism whatsoever because it has come when the agricultural economy needs that little boost because agriculture has gone through a difficult period.  I have never tried to conceal the fact that we had problems in agriculture in 1979 and through the greater part of 1980, but the situation was not as bad as it was in 1974-75 when a Coalition Government were in office and the men who claimed to have superior intelligence had control of agriculture and of the Department of Local Government, now the Department of the Environment.  There was little concern for the farming community at that time.  The best that the then Government could offer them was an ill-conceived fodder scheme badly administered and we all know that there was a High Court inquiry regarding the administration of that scheme.  Many traders were issued at that time with vouchers which have not been paid for yet due to the fact that the scheme was ill-timed, badly administered and hastily conceived by the then Minister for Agriculture <Col N="3180" /> who is now an MEP.</P>
    <P>This is wonderful legislation designed in the long-term to relieve the farmers of the burden of rates, as the Minister has said.  It replaces the grants under the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act which was required to be introduced annually.  The scheme coming through this Bill replaces that old scheme, and it will be welcomed by thousands of farmers. It has been said that the urban dweller received complete remission of rates on his house but the farmer still was obliged to pay rates on his land.  That obligation no longer exists in so far as the majority of farmers are concerned, and let there be no doubt about it, the majority of the farmers are in the £15-£20 land valuation bracket.</P>
    <P>People must come first.  People must come before the broad acres.  Fine Gael do not see it in that light.  They put the broad acres first and the people last and that was borne out today in contributions by previous speakers.  The old saying is, &ldquo;The man for the road and the bullock for the land&rdquo;.  I am convinced that Fine Gael believe in that philosophy still.  Deputy Deasy, for one, seems to believe in it.  I do not know how he is associated with agriculture or how much he knows about it, but that philosophy was borne out today by his statements.  We in Fianna Fáil never believed in that type of philosophy. We believe that people come first. No nation can survive without people and this Bill is not only going to benefit the farmers but it is going to encourage many more farmers to stay in agriculture because they are relieved of this burden and, therefore, have a few pounds more to invest in their industry, in their homes and farm buildings and in their efforts to increase farm production.  Let there be no doubt about it, everything that can be done must be done to improve the lot of those engaged in Irish agriculture because of the contribution they are making to the national economy.  Our Government have left nobody in any doubt whatsoever about their concern for the problems of agriculture and, as one engaged in that industry, I am satisfied that the farming community appreciate what is being done for them.  One point <Col N="3181" /> I have to make is that thousands and thousands of farmers flocked to the Fianna Fáil national collection tables last Sunday because they appreciate what is being done by the Government for them. This Bill is a further indication of the Government's concern for the farmer.  I am satisfied that it is the best legislation that has come in the way of the small farmers for a long time.  It is worthy of the unanimous support of this House and I wish the Bill a speedy passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak for a short period on the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1981.  It is a fine Bill which comprises four main features.  The first is that it now offers total relief to some 94 per cent of all land holdings and 50 per cent relief to a further 3 per cent.  This is estimated to leave with the farming community the spending of £62 million.  This is a considerable amount of money to be left to that community.  Knowing the diligence of this community and also the fact that they spend &mdash; and spend Irish in the main &mdash; this will be a very big boost to the economy and to employment here at home.  I know that in County Wicklow this year there will be a grant of £1.2 million in relief of farmers' rates and over 91 per cent of all land holdings will be exempt from rates and a further 3.4 per cent will pay only half rates.  This is to be welcomed. As far as I can read, it will be just below the national average, but that is the way it works under the PLV system.</P>
      <P>The second feature is that it removes or abolishes a temporary set of measures. A temporary set of measures is not satisfactory. By nature the word &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; does not exude confidence and does not leave people with a feeling or sense of confidence.  By putting this measure on a permanent basis we boost the confidence of people involved in agriculture. The farming community will see it in this regard, will see their fortunes considerably enhanced by this measure and will respond accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third factor in the Bill is the extension of the agricultural grants relief to all land owners in urban areas.  There was an <Col N="3182" /> anomaly here which I saw when Bray secured an extension to its boundary on 1 January 1980.  This incorporated quite a number of land owners who lost any relief they had.  This Bill will give those people the opportunity to benefit.  The Minister referred to 9,500 landowners who will fall within this category.</P>
    <P>The fourth category is farmers eligible for the 100 per cent relief or the 50 per cent relief who will now be freed from malicious injuries charges.  This is a considerable improvement when one considers the extent of malicious injuries charges which are reflected in the payments which must be paid through the rating system by those eligible to pay rates.  There is an allowance of 100 per cent to those under £50 valuation and 50 per cent allowance to those in the category of £50 valuation but under £70 valuation. This shows the continuation of a policy of moving towards a better system of equity within the overall tax code. Certainly the pledge of exempting domestic dwellings, farmhouses and so forth was honoured on 1 January 1978. In the intervening years we had various other temporary relief schemes introduced. This Bill is putting the matter on a permanent footing.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that there will be a saving of £62 million to the farming community.  Would the Minister breakdown that £62 million as between those in the category of under £50 valuation and those in the category between £50 and £70 valuation?  What would the cost be of derating all farming lands?  What projections would be involved in that?</P>
    <P>The Bill is an excellent one to which the farming community have given a great welcome.  People throughout society have a much better appreciation of the problems which each sector has. There has been some excellent debate over the years involving various groupings in our society.  There is a deep appreciation of all the problems and needs.  I know the urban dwellers appreciate that there is respite on a permanent basis for the people who really need it, the small and middle men.  This Bill offers those people this relief.  I have every confidence in the Bill and I would like to <Col N="3183" /> congratulate the Minister and his Department on introducing it.  I know it is having a speedy passage through the House because every Member welcomes it. There have been all sorts of pledges, but this is a factual Bill.  The people see it as a rational measure.  People are becoming more rational and are not taken in by emotive issues.  The Bill will give people considerable confidence to move forward in what is our greatest industry.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate, particularly those who expressed such a warm welcome for the Bill.  That has not been from this side of the House alone, but it would be expected that this side of the House would recognise such a step forward in the assistance which has traditionally been given to the farming community by this party.  All Deputies referred to the importance of agriculture to the economy.  I could not agree more with the sentiments expressed.  Agriculture is the backbone of our economy.  It is very important from our economic point of view that the agricultural sector is in a healthy state and does well.  This is why the Government have been working to assist the farming community and also working, as is the guiding principle of this party, in close consultation with the representatives of the various communities concerned, no matter what issues are under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have been working in very close consultation with the IFA and the ICMSA.  This has been going on since the Government were elected in 1977 and particularly since the appointment of the present Taoiseach.  There have been a series of meetings between the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance to improve the lot of the farming community. This process of discussion will continue in the years ahead.  The Minister for Agriculture, in his very successful negotiations in Brussels, achieved the farming package, which is something we are all very proud of.  I know all sectors <Col N="3184" /> of the agricultural community have welcomed this.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives statutory effect to the commitment given in the budget and is a further indication of the Government's commitment to the agricultural sector. The Deputies on the other side attempted to pour cold water on the Bill and suggested it was merely a half-hearted measure and an election ploy.  I assure them they will not convince the farming community about that statement.  The farmers have shown their support for this measure since the budget was introduced. I am glad to have the opportunity of introducing the Bill and replying to the Second Stage.  I want to put on the record of the House the number of holdings involved: 71,250 holdings together with 9,500 landholders in the urban areas, bringing the total number of people whose property is being fully derated for the first time under the terms of this Bill to 80,750.</P>
    <P>Deputies are entitled to know what this will mean for their own counties and I would like to put on record the exact number of people who will benefit: in Wicklow those with valuations of up to £50, 10,011, 91.27 per cent, and between £50 and £70 valuation, 380 people, 3.46 per cent.  Deputy Boland spoke at length about the problems of agriculture and their effects in our constituency.  There are 11,924 holdings being fully derated and a further 276 have been partially derated &mdash; a 50 per cent rate of reduction &mdash; 93.23 per cent plus 2.16 per cent of all farmers in the area.</P>

      <P>Deputy D'Arcy, opening the debate for Fine Gael, spoke about the valuation system, as did a number of other speakers.  Deputy Tully made a very good contribution on the inadequacies of that system.  Nobody claims that the valuation system is perfect but this Bill goes a long way to help adjust inequities by relieving all rates on properties up to £50 and half rates on valuations between £50 and £70.  These two reliefs will benefit over 95 per cent of the rated holdings in County Wexford.</P>
      <P>Deputy D'Arcy then went into the total nonsense area when he attempted to claim that the Government were forced by Fine Gael of all people, to bring in this relief.  The Fianna Fáil record on rates relief goes back to 1932 when the first relief was directed especially to those under £10 valuation.  In 1967 we gave total derating up to £20 and we continued with full derating up to £50 valuation &mdash; a record of continuous derating.</P>
      <P>Deputy D'Arcy mentioned Fine Gael scrapping the system and this was echoed by a number of other Deputies.  I would like to ask the Fine Gael Party &mdash; who when it suits them regularly chastise the Government about taxation and borrowing levels &mdash; who will be taxed to raise the £31.5 million that will be necessary to meet their commitment here and now?  I read in this morning's paper and I heard on the radio that there will not be a Fine Gael manifesto next October when the election is held, but I ask them to answer this simple question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In their literature &mdash; some of which was very well printed &mdash; they say that if elected they would demand a fair taxation system, including the reintroduction of the wealth tax.  If Fine Gael are to scrap the rates system will Labour go along with them, and if Labour are to reintroduce the wealth tax, will Fine Gael support them? They cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>Deputy D'Arcy said that farmers with valuation of £40 to £60 did not get refunds of the second moiety before January 1981.  Every last penny of the £6 million was paid out by the Government before the end of last December. If there was a single farmer who had to wait for his refund, the fault was not with my Department.  Deputy Tully claimed that the Coalition abolished domestic rates.  I would remind him that it was Fianna Fáil who first proposed the abolition before the 1973 General Election. The Coalition were converted to the idea very late in the day.  They gave a 25 per cent remission of domestic rates in their last year of office in 1977, not 75 per cent as given by Deputy Tully.</P>

      <P>Deputy Deasy made a statement which was very well answered by Deputy Keegan.  I will not go into detail on it except to say that the figures quoted do not tell the full story.  Deputy Deasy said that the 71,000 derated are not all farmers, that they include cottiers. The 71,000 are all people with valuations of between £20 and £50.  They do not include cottiers as alleged by Deputy Deasy.  The same Deputy said that those with valuations of more than £70 do not get any relief.  This is not so.  Most of those farmers would be liable to income tax.  Despite what Deputy Deasy said, rate bills are allowed as a direct offset against income tax.  Therefore such farmers get relief of rates.  Deputy Deasy also said that people have been getting summonses. It came to my notice that this had happened in a few isolated cases.  I spoke to the managers involved, I have been in touch with the IFA about certain counties where such action had been taken and I can assure the House that the situation is now under control. I would be surprised if the IFA are unaware of that.  I am satisfied that any farmers who may be in difficulty about paying rates can be assured of a reasonable and helpful attitude on the part of the local authorities.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Callanan for his comments and, for his information I will give the figures for Galway. The number of holdings in that county fully derated is 34,169, that is, 98.37 per cent, and the number of holdings liable for the 50 per cent rate is 311, that is 0.9 per cent.  Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested that the reason for abolishing rates on valuations up to £50 is an acknowledgment that the valuation system is unfair. That is not so.  The reason for the relief to this category is that it comprises smaller farmers who will benefit most from rates relief.  The Bill has nothing to do with other services such as health, education or eligibility for these services. The Deputy criticised various changes made in rates relief legislation since 1978. I want to put on record that the various Bills introduced since 1978 had the effect of steadily increasing the amount of the agricultural grant.  For example, in 1978 the agricultural grant was £38.3 million; in 1979, it was £39.8 million; in 1980, it was £43.5 million, and this year it will be £62.2 million.  On top of that, since 1978, with Fianna Fáil honouring their commitment to derate domestic property, farmers have been free of rates on their dwellings and farm buildings at a cost of about £13 million a year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keegan put on record Fianna Fáil's commitment to the small farmers and to the farming sector as a whole.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to present this Bill and I thank Deputies from all sides for their welcome.  Admittedly the welcome from the other side was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to note that section 1 of the Bill is the section dealing with the abolition of actions for criminal conversation.  In itself it is almost identical with the Private Members' Bill which the Government unanimously defeated here over a year ago. I welcome the abolition of a concept which is outdated, though I do say in passing that perhaps it is symptomatic of this House and of the manner in which we transact our business that we are dealing with issues about which there is no major public concern at this time and which are essentially dealt with in a most reactive and belated fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is legislation which, in a civilised society, in a society which cares passionately for proper human values and for the dignity of men and women, would not even be a matter for Dáil debate but should have been done long ago.  I suppose it is too much to expect that in what appears to be the autumn of a Dáil from which the soul appears to have fled long ago, we could be dealing with anything other than something which is very belated.  It is welcome in itself but it would be nice if for once this House could be involved in initiating some action in the family law area, or indeed in any area, instead of reacting slavishly years and years after it has been evidentially shown that this kind of action is long overdue.  It would have been possible for the Government to have accepted our <Col N="3192" /> Bill a year ago.  It would have meant that the charade we went through then and apparently now in this respect would have been unnecessary.</P>
    <P>A lot of play is regularly made by Government Ministers about the Law Reform Commission. I have said, and I repeat, that the Law Reform Commission is too often used as an excuse for prevarication.  They are a body who are doing good work, short-staffed though they may be.  I would like to know why it is, when so much store is regularly placed by Ministers in reply to Dáil Questions and in general debate on the deliberations of the Law Reform Commission, the implication being that the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission will be pursued inevitably and inexorably by the Government and that anything that suggests any slight deviation from that is tantamount to heresy, that on this occasion in regard to section 1 the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission for a replacement action are not being taken up by the Government.  I am happy that they are not.  But I would like to know the kind of wisdom, the kind of thought process that went into a contribution by the Minister in the debate on the Private Members' Bill where the implication was that the findings of the Law Reform Commission would probably be approved of by the Government. But these thought processes are now, 12 months later, fundamentally different and there is no replacement action and we appear to have grown up just a little. Why the apparent change of heart?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the one hand, Deputy Keating welcomes the abolition of criminal conversation and, as he is aware, his Bill came at a time when the Law Reform Commission had not submitted their final recommendations.  The Government considered these recommendations at the appropriate time and in consequence of that they decided that it was proper and correct to abolish the action rather than retain it.  I do not think that I have to justify the Government's grounds for taking that decision, particularly to Deputy Keating.  I am satisfied <Col N="3193" /> that all of the women's groups, and indeed other organisations which include men, agreed that it was desirable and necessary to abolish it and I am satisfied that the Government's action has been totally correct in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not at issue, nor is it what I asked.  As the mover of the Bill which sought the abolition and which was voted against unanimously by the party opposite, I do not need to be told that the total abolition is what is appropriate or correct.  But the reticence and the hesitancy and the inhibitions which the Minister's party showed on the occasion of that vote seem to have undergone some transformation.  I am pleased for it. I just wondered if the Minister would like to tell us why.  That said, it is welcome in itself even though it is probably about 100 years too late.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I want to make it clear that there is no essential division about any of the major segments of this Bill.  This section is about introducing into law a condition relating to an agreement between two persons to marry, the engagement situation whereby the present ability of one party or other to sue the other for breach of contract would no longer be valid.  I welcome that.  I think that, particularly young people, emotionally immature people are not adequately aware of the importance of the step involved and if any pressure was to be brought upon young people subsequent to a change of heart or a change of mind by them which would force them to enter marriage when their better instincts and intelligence tell them that it is not the right thing for them though they had already contracted so to do, that pressure should be removed and that is what this section does.  Let us take a hypothetical situation where perhaps there might be <Col N="3194" /> a written agreement between two parties &mdash; I admit the circumstances would be unusual &mdash; or there is perhaps a religious sect which sometimes undertakes marriage ceremonies in this manner, or a situation where people solemnly entered into a contract.  To what extent does this section cut across the law of contract in this respect?  It says that an agreement between two persons to marry one another, whether entered into before or after the passing of this Act, shall not under the law of the State have the effect of a contract.  What kind of an agreement are we talking about here and what is the definition in this Bill of &ldquo;engagement to marry&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The section states that an agreement to marry shall not under the law of the State have the effect of a contract so there can be no question of us cutting across the contractual type of situation the Deputy has referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This comes back to the question of the definition of &ldquo;engagement&rdquo; because we are dealing with the question of the property of the engaged couples.</P>
      <P>The section says that:</P>
      <P>Where an agreement to marry is terminated, the rules of law relating to the rights of spouses in relation to property in which either or both of them has or have a beneficial interest shall apply in relation to any property in which either or both of the parties to the agreement had a beneficial interest while the agreement was in force as they apply in relation to property in which either or both spouses has or have a beneficial interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this fairly ostrich like assembly we must recognise the fact that today there is a growing trend that people live together in what are known as common law marriages, so that the definition of marriage as a church or civil witnessed <Col N="3196" /> contract is not as comprehending as it might once have been.  What happens in circumstances like that, particularly with regard to the children of such a union? Do the interests of the children arise in this case of a common law marriage where people have been living together for perhaps ten or 12 years without being married and where one or other of the partners might for the purposes of this section say that they were engaged and therefore their rights in this matter are affected by this section?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage, Deputy Mitchell referred to this type of situation. Common law marriage is not recognised in law and there is no provision for dealing with something that is not recognised by the law of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that there is no provision is a reason why we should concern ourselves.  Many injustices in society arise because there is no provision in law to deal with them.  Where two people have been living together and there are children, have the children any rights to property of the so-called engaged couple, the property of a <i>de facto</i> marriage.  They are presumably deemed to be illegitimate and have no rights.  Does this section appertain in any respects to such children?</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dail Eireann, having regard to the wide range of crises which beset the nation at present including:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the continuing rise in unemployment which, it is forecast, will rise to 135,000 by the end of the year;</P>
      <P>&mdash;continuing dramatic increases in prices, which rose by 21% in the year to mid-February last and which are forecast to rise by 18% in 1981;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the crisis in our balance of payments and the dangerously low level of our external reserves;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the recent increase in interest rates, which reflects growing pressure on the Irish Pound and which will create further difficulties for industry at a time when this sector is already in deep crisis;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the cuts in local authority and health board expenditure which have led to substantial reductions in the quality of the services provided by these public bodies;</P>
      <P>condemns the incompetence of the Government, and recognising that the Government has disastrously mismanaged the nation's economic affairs, resolves that it has no confidence in the present administration.</P>
      <P>I have no desire to cavil on the comment you have made regarding the Labour Party's motion. To quite an extent we, too, are in some difficulty in framing a motion of this nature, because from day to day one is not quite sure what motion one should table on economic and social policy in order to respond to the vacillations of the Government in the management of the economy. Even this evening, as the House starts to debate this motion, we are informed that a Bill will be circulated tomorrow dealing with the textile industry and its role in the economy. A new factor enters into the economic equation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason we have tabled this motion is that since the Taoiseach took the decision to abolish the Department <Col N="3201" /> of Economic Planning and Development there has been no short or even medium term planning of the economy. We are now apparently to go into a general election tomorrow and already, before the official campaign has started, the Government have overspent in this year's management of the economy, an estimated £200 million in what can only be classified as belated and almost hysterical vote-getting projects and services in key electoral areas.  Witness, for example, tomorrow's announcement on the textile industry, foreshadowed in terms of a proposition to give relief there. The whole situation has reached a state of electoral farce.  We should have a general election, so that those who have some responsibility in the public sector for framing economic and social policy will be able during the summer to bring the country back to some semblance of political control over the management of the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>The single most important aspect of this motion &mdash; a motion of condemnation by the Labour Party &mdash; is this.  While our immediate preoccupation is with the coming general election, the time is long overdue for some serious long-term economic planning or, at least, some serious realisation of the enormity of the problems facing us in the next ten years.  That seriousness does not seem to have impinged on the consciousness of the Government.</P>
    <P>Our economy has been operating well under its potential capacity for the past three years.  We have had a labour force growth of 1 per cent per annum.  We had a productivity increase of 2 or 3 per cent per annum.  Output should be growing at somewhere about 4 per cent per annum. In terms of growth, 2 per cent has been achieved in 1979, 1 per cent in 1980 and a prospective 2 per cent in 1981.  Clearly, therefore, the principal objective of any future policy of the next Government must be to try to raise actual growth rates of output to the level of our potential.</P>
    <P>We are endeavouring to become an alternative Government and we accept that there are factors common to whatever Government will be in control of the <Col N="3202" /> economy.  There are oil price rises, which the Government have trotted out now and again.  There has been the virtual collapse of incomes on the agricultural side.  We are well aware of the weak state of general industrial demand in Europe and the United States and the decline in British industry.  All these factors &mdash; many outside our control &mdash; are undoubtedly holding us back.  I submit in so far as we have a lack of domestic policy, that the mismanagement of the public finances by the Government at central Exchequer level has now left almost no room for manoeuvre in terms of assisting Irish industry, job creation, job maintenance and job protection.</P>
    <P>We now have an unprecedented and almost unsustainable level of public foreign borrowing.  This is the price we are paying for the oscillations of Government. One need only look back to the January budget to see what has happened since then.  There are oscillations of policy by the Government on a daily basis with no coherent effort to endeavour to bring the economy back to some sense of development.  For that the country is paying an extremely heavy price.  I submit the next Government will have to sit down and over a five to ten year period plan an economic and social programme on a coherent and effective basis, outline its main objectives, stick to that programme and put it through.  That is our present single greatest political need.</P>
    <P>When the Labour Party were considering putting down this motion and discussing it at the Parliamentary Labour Party meeting, we looked at some of the statements made, particularly by the Taoiseach.  On the very first page of his budget speech in 1981, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>We must improve the structure of the public finances and provide a solid foundation for the greatly increased level of economic activity needed in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Then he said:</P>
    <P>This requires, in particular, a phased reduction in the real level of the current budget deficit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3203" /> Yet, within four months, that particular approach was jettisoned by the Government because at this stage the effort of election promises has been so geared up that unless we have an election in the very near future, at the present rate the current budget deficit &mdash; and I said this repeatedly to the Minister for Finance &mdash; will not be just £515 million this year but will probably be £750 million or £800 million.  That is something which no new Government would wish to face next Autumn after the summer recess.  It is not a situation which a new Government could view with any degree of equanimity in facing the electorate in the years ahead.  We must express our concern in this House and our condemnation of the Government's total failure to plan the economy for the years ahead and in particular, for this critical year of 1981.</P>
    <P>I now make a particular plea to the Government and to all my colleagues in the party-political sense that in the next three or four weeks, if we with our small economy continue at this rate buying votes on the basis of the promises and statements trotted out by successive Ministers on the Government side, it will hardly be worth anybody's while taking over the reins of Government in the month of July and right through to September of this year.  I do not want to hark back to the individual commitments already made, but I believe very firmly that any future financial resources or borrowings which the State might enter into in the remainder of this year should be exclusively, rigorously and deliberately devoted to providing moneys for the productive base of our economy.  There are very few votes indeed to be got, on a sheer manifesto-type popularity election, for the rigours of that approach.</P>
    <P>We must now provide moneys towards producing employment for those who are out of work.  Since there is obviously not a great deal of national political concern about the fact that there will be up to 150,000 people unemployed when we enter into the summer, with 30,000 school leavers coming on the labour market, so far as we in the Labour Party are concerned &mdash; and I am quite sure this <Col N="3204" /> applies equally to the Fine Gael Party &mdash; the provision of employment for those brothers and sisters in our community and for young people without work will be our absolute and total priority irrespective of any other demands which may arise on the Exchequer on any front during the year ahead.</P>
    <P>I want to spell out the waste, one might say, in terms of the failure to redirect our public finances in the past two or three years.  We have had virtually no policies for full employment and the Government have not given it the priority which that single greatest need demands.  I give some figures of State expenditure on unemployment benefit and assistance in the past three years arising out of a Dáil reply to a question which I tabled on Wednesday, 13 May.  They underline the stagnating impact on the economy of unemployment benefit expenditure to those in need and the failure to re-direct Exchequer expenditure, particularly into job creation.</P>
    <P>In 1978, £72.3 million was the State's contribution to unemployment expenditure. In 1979, the total State expenditure was £75 million and, in 1980, £95 million. This year alone it is estimated at £114 million.  It must be remembered that the State's contribution to total insurance expenditure is of the order of 20 per cent, so that the real total contribution of the community as a whole, endeavouring to combat the evil &mdash; nowadays it is not fashionable to refer to it as an evil &mdash; of unemployment is, of course, very much greater than £114 million.</P>
    <P>The scarce financial resources of our State should also be devoted towards particular schemes of employment for the thousands of young people who will finish formal education this year and seek jobs in our community.  It is easy to make a statement of this nature but, looking back at the efforts of 1973 and 1974 and right through to 1979 and 1980 and the variety of schemes which were not introduced, it is fair to say that at present the impetus in devising new schemes and in ensuring the development of the three or four existing schemes has slowed down very considerably in the past 12 months.  There is practically no comment from the Government <Col N="3205" /> at this point in time on that basic need in our community.</P>
    <P>In relation to labour intensive industry as a result of the very considerable pressures from the Confederation of Irish Industry and the textile sector, the Government have responded belatedly.  We do not know, because the Bill has not been finally circulated as yet &mdash; it will be circulated tomorrow &mdash; but, were it not for an election, it is fair to say that the special cases for new policies in that sector would have been totally ignored by the Government.  It is remarkable that during the past few years the labour-intensive sectors of industry, in particular the textile, clothing and footwear industries, have received very little support from Fianna Fáil.  The Taoiseach has made very broad public statements with regard to supporting these industries but apparently it has taken the prospect of a general election to get some kind of commitment from the Government.</P>
    <P>It should not be forgotten by those sectors that the Government terminated the employment maintenance subsidy scheme, the re-equipment grants scheme and the technical assistance consultancy grants scheme.  The sectors involved cannot regard what the Government have done as being a serious attempt to deal with the growing unemployment problem. The industries should be actively supported and lifted out of the relegation zone to which they have been consigned by the Government during the past two or three years.</P>
    <P>The textile, clothing and footwear industries employ 20 per cent of the manufacturing industry workforce and they contribute more than £400 million per annum to our industrial exports.  They are also extremely important as basic employment outlets for women workers. Yet, since 1977 when this Government took office many jobs have been lost in these sectors.  The apparel industries group handed out leaflets at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis condemning what they regarded as a sell-out of their interests by the Government.  The Government have responded with this legislation.  It shows there has been very little coherence in their assessment of the needs of industry <Col N="3206" /> and it has made many observers look with a jaundiced eye at their policy in this area.</P>
    <P>Other labour-intensive sectors of industry experienced problems in the transition to free trade during the seventies. We owe it to the employers and employees of these firms to support them now in their economic difficulties.  Irrespective of what the Government are doing tomorrow, we should insist on the restoration of the employment maintenance subsidy for a further period &mdash; I would go as high as £10 per employee per week to eligible firms.  There is the need for the restoration of the re-equipment grants scheme for selected sectors who are experiencing special difficulties, in particular the textile and apparel sectors.</P>
    <P>There is also the need to pursue urgent negotiations with the European Commission and, through the Council of Ministers, to ensure that the multifibres agreement which is to be renegotiated later this year will take into account the special problems of Irish industries.  The new agreement should incorporate a recession clause so that imports to the EEC will not get a guaranteed and growing market in Europe when the aggregate demand falls within the Community.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have a reasonably enlightened and progressive policy towards the development of Third World countries but there is a need for a balanced approach in this area.  There is little public evidence of any great contact between the Cabinet and Ireland's Commissioner in Europe with regard to the matters I have outlined.  For all practical purposes, Ireland's Commissioner seems to have faded off the face of the earth. The Government should ensure that the multifibres agreement is dealt with adequately so that abuses arising from the previous agreement are not perpetuated in the years to come.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects to our motion before the House, namely, our comments on the matter of price inflation.  We must be critical of the policy and strategy of the Government with regard to containing domestic inflation.  Last year the rate of inflation was 20 per cent and this year <Col N="3207" /> it will be between 17 per cent to 20 per cent.  By any European standard that level of domestic inflation is horrific.  It does not bode well for our creditworthiness with regard to future borrowings.  At the moment wage demands are following price increases, quite a proportion of which can be attributed directly to budgetary policy.  I do not propose to bandy statistics about with the Minister.  He knows as well as I the impact of the past two budgets on our rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>The contribution from these two budgets in this regard was a solid 8 per cent. It was only when the January-February economic policy of the Government became unhinged that they resorted in a last desperate fling to the introduction of further partial food subsidies to try to bridge the gap that has been allowed to broaden above and beyond the national understanding.  The response to that was purely pragmatic.  It seemed to have no relationship either to the national understanding or to the economy.  As the Minister knows, too, that move has not had much impact on either of those parties directly concerned in the national understanding negotiations.  In these circumstances we are entitled to be critical of the Government in so far as their strategy followed on the mitigation of the worse effects of price inflation.</P>
    <P>We have, also, the general crisis in terms of our balance of payments situation. No matter how one views the Irish economy at this point, one must inevitably come to the conclusion that if we are to tolerate a budget deficit this year of £750 million or about 7 per cent of GNP and if we are to have a balance of payments deficit in 1981 which could well be as high as 13 per cent of the GNP &mdash; and these are reasonably responsible current estimates of what is likely to happen in the out-turn for 1981 &mdash; there is no doubt that our credibility will be eroded to such an extent in terms of international borrowing, even for basic infrastructure, that we will face a direct refusal in this area. That would be a matter of very serious concern.  I am not making these statements lightly.  On any of the committees on which I have served outside this country, <Col N="3208" /> particularly the Economic Affairs Committee of the Council of Europe, I have found that some of my colleagues, particularly those in France and Germany, have marvelled at our being able to get away with sustaining such a high level of current budget deficit, of inflation and of wage unit cost increases of such magnitude.  They find it extremely difficult in the context of international borrowing to understand this situation.  Perhaps it is because of the relatively small scale of our economy that we are not in the situation, as one might expect any of the major European countries to be in if they found themselves in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, of having our foreign creditors taking a close and sharp look at the viability of our economy.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out, about every 75p in the £ of PAYE revenue goes directly towards servicing the national debt.  That is the kind of strait-jacket into which the Government have landed the economy.  A very different type of Government will be required to turn the economy around and to ensure that the Irish people are faced with reality in terms of our budget situation.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I would make the point that it is not possible to run the country either now or in future years, or to reduce unemployment or to provide for the kind of capital investment funds that are needed for basic infrastructure, on the basis of existing Exchequer income policies. Our country is in great need of investment for infrastructure but this cannot be provided on a narrow income basis that is related to PAYE and which is dependent on customs and excise duty, on VAT, on the buoyancy of drink and tobacco and on pay-related social insurance. Another factor is that the level of income in terms of tax contributions from the agricultural sector is extremely constrained by reason of the farmers having experienced three or four disastrous years in terms of income.</P>
    <P>Unless the Government are prepared to extricate themselves from the tax net which has closed around them as a result of the abolition of rates, of car tax and so on, or unless we are prepared to drink <Col N="3209" /> ourselves into alcoholism or to smoke ourselves to death, I cannot see any way of providing the Exchequer revenue that is necessary.  Alternatively we would all have to travel about 60,000 miles per year in our cars or pay 50 per cent of our incomes in taxation if the necessary revenue is to be provided.  The Government have abolished virtually all capital taxation and they are now in the situation in which the tax base of the whole economy has been eroded.  There is no room for general manoeuvre.  At the same time there is the major conflict, but one which has not been admitted by the Government, of trying to run a country, while advertising in the paper that 1,000 extra gardaí are to be recruited and while the Minister for Health has been going around the country for the past three or four months promising hospital and health service development practically everywhere without there being any indication of where the money is to come from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That has not been determined either.  We have a situation in which special consideration is given to certain sectors arising, understandably, with the whole range of public sector pay levels, whether in relation to gardaí, to nurses or to any other group.  Admittedly, all the increases concerned are agreed through acknowledged procedures but there is no indication as to who is to bear the cost, as to whether it will be borne by those directly concerned or as to whether the community will be in a position to bear the cost of this kind of approach by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have tabled this motion of condemnation of Government policy, that is, in so far as they have any policy.  If this country is to return to a situation of a consistent economic growth rate of at least 4 per cent per year and if we are to have an internationally competitive economy with a degree of creditibility abroad that will allow us to borrow money for productive capital investment, we will require a new Government who will make considerable changes in strategy <Col N="3210" /> and we will require a degree of planning that is totally absent in so far as the present administration are concerned. We will require an election campaign in the next few weeks or, if the Government change their minds again, in September or next year.  A total change of Government strategy will be required with some sense of urgent planning, rather than the kind of approach we have had from a succession of Ministers of Finance in the past two or three years.</P>
    <P>The amendment tabled by the Government to our motion has little relevance to the real needs of our economy.  The people will have an opportunity to vote for a change of Government in the next general election.  That change cannot come too soon in the interests of economic development, the prospects of developing employment and real economic management in the near future.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann re-affirms confidence in the economic policies of the Government and expresses approval of the measures being taken by them to mitigate the effects of the present world recession, to promote growth in output and employment, to combat inflation and to promote general economic development.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Desmond's contribution.  It was a poor performance if, as he says, we are close to an election.  It would not be my idea of a good speech at a public meeting.  I was a bit surprised at Deputy Desmond's monetarist approach which was rather new from a so-called socialist.  I want to pay some attention to one point at the outset.  I will cover the other points later. I want to praise Deputy Desmond on his accuracy and correctness because he seems to have just woken up to the vulnerability of our industries.  The people in those industries have not got the short memories possessed by people like Deputy Desmond.  I will explain the position to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3211" /> He referred to the Bill to be circulated tommorrow.  My colleague, the Minister for Labour, will deal with that Bill competently in the House tommorrow.  Deputy Desmond made such allegations that, either he was displaying a complete ignorance of the situation, or he was being deliberately mischievous as he can be on occasion.  I will trace the history of the Bill to show that the people have not got the short memories which people on the other side of the House may have.</P>
    <P>In 1978 the Government introduced for the first time an aid for firms in the vulnerable industries sector of clothing, footwear, textiles and leather.  That employment maintenance scheme continued during 1978 and 1979 and, because of difficulties about its acceptance in Brussels, a new scheme was introduced in 1980 entitled the temporary employment subsidy which had to end on 31 December 1980.</P>
    <P>In my budget speech I said:</P>
    <P>The Government have for a considerable time now been concerned with the problems of vulnerable and sensitive industries.  The change to fully pay-related contributions in funding social insurance expenditures, while principally taken for other reasons, was, in practice, of major assistance to these industries, which are mainly labour-intensive.  It will also be recalled that the employment maintenance scheme and its successor, the employers' temporary subvention scheme, made a further major contribution towards securing employment in the textiles, clothing and footwear sectors, but had to be terminated following objections by the EEC Commission that they represented a distortion of competition through State aids contrary to the Treaty of Rome.  In view of these EEC objections, it must be recognised that the difficulties involved are very great.  The Government are, however, continuing to examine the problem to see if firms with a prospect of long-term viability can be helped through temporary difficulties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3212" /> The Government have been endeavouring for a considerable time to devise a new scheme.  Time consuming and necessary discussions were held with the EEC Commission and with industry.  The problem was referred to as far back as my budget speech.  I have referred to it since then as have other Ministers.  This is the background to the Bill being introduced tomorrow.  There is no change of direction there.  Any leaflets handed out &mdash; and I saw none &mdash; did not influence that decision.</P>
    <P>This Government are committed to an energetic and expansionary approach to the management of the economy and I am convinced that this is the only way to achieve the progress this country needs. We have pursued these policies throughout a period of severe world recession and there is now ample evidence that the Government's approach to economic management was the right one.  There are clear signs in recent months of renewed vigour in the economy.  Output in manufacturing industry rose by 5½ per cent in January and by 6 per cent in February.  This is the fastest sustained rate of expansion in manufacturing output recorded since 1975.  This is hardly the performance of a sector in deep crisis as the Labour Party motion would have us believe.  Investment is also showing signs of considerable buoyancy.  Cement sales have risen in each of the past two quarters, a sure indication that activity in the building industry is improving.</P>
    <P>The volume of imports of investment goods in the period December 1980 to February 1981, the latest quarter for which full information is available, was significantly higher than in the preceding three months and, under the impact of the Investment Plan 1981, should strengthen further in coming months. Industrial exports are also very good despite continuing unfavourable conditions in most of our export markets.  The value of industrial exports in the first three months of this year was up by 10 per cent on the last quarter of 1980, a very considerable rise between one quarter and the next.  The impact of the new industries which the IDA have been attracting is shown by the increase in <Col N="3213" /> exports of office machines and scientific equipment in March last of almost 50 per cent over the level a year earlier.</P>
    <P>Consumer demand is also strong contrary to the picture painted by the Opposition. Since November last, retail sales have been rising steadily.  The volume of retail sales in the three months from November to January seasonally adjusted was 5.4 per cent higher than in the previous three months.  There is also the evidence of an increase in new private car registrations.  In January, these reached 13,152, a record figure, and the figure for February was almost similar. The total figure for January 1981 is no less than 46 per cent higher than for January 1977, yet another indicator of the progress made under this Government.</P>
    <P>These improvements all point to the strengthening of economic activity, even though external developments have not been favourable.  Industrial production in the European Community as a whole fell in December and January last.  While there is every indication of an international upturn this year, it is clear that the upturn in the economy here is taking place well before any international upturn.  This can only reflect the impact of this Government's positive approach to the management of the economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to the growth rate this year.  I would put it at 2½ per cent.  I would remind him also that the projected growth rate, or the average for the entire Community, is minus half per cent.  I believe this is a further indicator of our strength.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank would not agree with the Minister there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  But if he wants a debate on the Central Bank Report with me here, or in public, he is very welcome to do so at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to say that all the unemployment indicators are contrary to the unsupported and irresponsible allegations made by Deputy B. Desmond and others, or perhaps I could say the prophets of gloom in Opposition now who were such prophets of gloom in Government <Col N="3214" /> in 1976 and 1977.  The live register figures to date indicate a considerable slowing down on the rate of unemployment increase.  The CSO monthly returns of industrial output for January and February would support the view that the unemployment level is now stabilising with the prospect of a fall in the months ahead.  The labour force increase is being absorbed by new employment, as the data since 1977 proves.</P>
    <P>An early decline in unemployment, rather than an increase, as suggested by Labour Party spokesmen, is a realistic prospect when account is taken of the current job creation programme. Between April 1977 and April 1980 employment increased by 80,000.  In the four years from April 1973 to April 1977 the corresponding figure was 14,000. Therefore, compare the three years of 80,000 with the four years of 14,000, which indicates as well the actual position under this Government.  In 1980 IDA job approvals totalled 35,600, significantly in excess of their target of 30,000.  This year the number will rise to 40,000.  This record level of job creation will have a greater impact on unemployment in 1981 because the incidence of job losses due to recession will be significantly less than it was last year.  There has already been a substantial fall in the numbers on short-time working.</P>
    <P>The Government's investment plan will also have a major impact on employment during the year.  The investment plan will result in higher direct employment of about 10,000, most of it in the building sector.  This extra employment will be additional to the jobs arising in manufacturing industry as a result of investment by the industrial promotion agencies.  Substantial indirect employment will, of course, also arise in Irish firms supplying materials and services both for the various investment projects and for new manufacturing firms.  In addition, the 1981 Estimates contain some £17 million for direct job creation schemes.</P>
    <P>Our labour force is still increasing at a more rapid rate than in other EEC countries. In 1981 the increase could be of the order of 15,000.  The challenge is to maintain <Col N="3215" /> the progress in providing jobs for these young people and at the same time reduce the existing level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The facts point to a great measure of success since 1977.  The indications are that this success will continue as a result of Government policy, and that we will have achieved the employment objectives set for 1981.</P>
    <P>To moderate the effects of world inflation on the consumer and on the economy, we have introduced progressive social welfare policies, consumer subsidies and tax concessions.</P>
    <P>The signs are that inflation is dropping both internationally and domestically. Bodies like the OECD and the EEC have both forecast that inflation will be less this year than last year and that in the second half of this year an appreciable reduction will occur.  Regarding inflation at home, the Government have acted to halt a rise in prices which would have resulted from the Brussels farm package and from other developments, in particular increased CIE and ESB charges. This factor has not been taken into account in the forecasts made in certain economic commentaries.  The estimated effect of the action taken by the Government in the subsidies package will be that in the quarter to mid-May the CPI increase will be approximately 2½ per cent, the lowest for any quarter since November 1978.</P>
    <P>In my budget statement last January I emphasised the Government's concern to bring greater discipline into our public finances.  We accept that borrowing for current purposes is undesirable and that it should be tolerated only in certain circumstances. It must be phased out as quickly as we reasonably can.</P>
    <P>Too rapid a resolution of our borrowing however would obviously force the economy into marked recession and this would be imprudent at a time when it has been necessary to sustain growth and employment in the face of the severe downturn in world trade.  Consequently, the Government are implementing a policy of phasing out the current deficit on a gradual basis.  The 1981 budget provides <Col N="3216" /> for a deficit of £515 million, or 5¼ per cent of gross national product compared with a deficit equivalent to 6½ per cent of GNP last year.  The total budget estimate of Exchequer borrowing for 1981 is 13 per cent of GNP compared with a borrowing equivalent to 14½ per cent of GNP in 1980.  These figures illustrate the policy of progressively reducing borrowing while at the same time placing greater emphasis on investment expenditure. The provision for investment in the 1981 budget totals more than £1,700 million, an increase of 36 per cent on the 1980 level.</P>
    <P>The target set in this year's budget will be achieved.  The outturn figures for the first quarter of the year were on target while the pattern of receipts and issues for the quarter was in line with expectations.</P>
    <P>For the longer term we must continue as a major budget priority to reduce progressively our reliance on borrowing, especially for current purposes, and to direct all possible resources into productive investment programmes.</P>
    <P>The Government have always recognised the balance of payments as a potential constraint and I would not wish to give the impression that we are complacent about the present position.  But it is important to bear in mind what I said earlier: that there is a potential trade-off between balance of payments correction and the maintenance of employment. Last year our balance of payments was virtually stable.  This was despite a higher oil bill and in marked contrast to the deterioration seen in every other EEC member state, apart from Britain, which is self-sufficient in oil.  The Government, through the investment plan, are providing for a massive increase in investment this year which will involve the increase importation of capital goods.  But in the longer term this investment will increase the exporting ability of the economy.</P>
    <P>Another factor which will influence external payments this year is the continuing effects of the successive rapid increases in oil prices in 1979 and 1980 and the influence of an appreciating dollar on our oil bill.</P>
    <P>The answer to a deterioration in payments <Col N="3217" /> caused by these developments is not immediate retrenchment but gradual adjustment.  All countries in the EMS are suffering from this.  Even Germany, a country which for so long has been in payments surplus, is expected again to be in substantial deficit for the second year running.  If Germany and other countries were to act immediately and in unison to correct these payments imbalances, there would be a world recession of such magnitude as never experienced before.  We must all adjust gradually and this is the policy which the Government are following.</P>
    <P>Incomes restraint to bolster competitiveness and thus help exports and keep non-essential imports down is, of course, crucial.  Another aspect I would like to comment on is the role which tourism can play.  In 1979 &mdash; the latest year for which full information is available &mdash; our tourist industry earned the country no less than £335 million, quite a substantial sum. Indications are that it was up again in 1980.  The indications for the tourist season so far this year are excellent.  Inquiries from abroad and visitors from abroad in the first quarter were well up on the corresponding quarter of 1980.</P>
    <P>I would be the last person to suggest that we put an end to foreign holidays, but I would urge those who plan to go abroad this year to think again on whether they could not have an equally enjoyable holiday at home.  In 1979 Irish residents spent £250 million on foreign holidays.  This would be an expression of practical patriotism.  It would not only help the balance of payments, but it would help the people employed in the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>There has also been a claim that our reserves are at a dangerously low level. This is definitely not the case.  The balance of payments deficit will be financed by capital flows and the reserves will not be run down.  Monetary policy, with the stated objective of the maintenance of external reserves adequacy, has a key role to play in the financing of the deficit and in ensuring stability for the Irish pound within the EMS.  The implementation of the domestic credit guidelines in the first three years by the Central Bank <Col N="3218" /> is evidence of resolve in this regard. Along with this, the Irish pound continues to remain comfortably within the EMS limits while our international credit rating continues to be excellent.</P>
    <P>None of this points to a dangerously low level of reserves.  In fact, the official external reserves are more than adequate to meet our needs.  At the end of 1980, our reserves were large enough to cover three months' imports &mdash; a high figure by international standards.  At the end of April we still had 2.6 months' cover.  This is an acceptable figure, given the pattern of our trade and payments.  To speak of our reserves as being dangerously low is incorrect, misleading and is contrary to the national interest.</P>
    <P>The rise in interest rates was necessitated by a combination of factors, both international and domestic.  In response to volatile and high US interest rates, rates in the majority of our EMS partners have already increased &mdash; in some cases by as much as 4 percentage points.  Rates here are still low in comparison with other countries and our relative position in the EEC prime rate league is roughly the same as last October before the present round of world interest rate increases began.</P>
    <P>The sharp upward movements in international interest rates made a parallel adjustment of Irish rates necessary in order to avoid capital outflows, given the size and openess of our economy in terms of the exceptionally large volume of trade and international payments.  Failure to raise Irish rates in line with those abroad would have run the risk of a sizeable drain on the reserves through &ldquo;switching&rdquo; of the large volume of foreign currency lending by Irish banks, through arrangements for trade payments and through losses of the large amounts of foreign balances and investments by non-residents.</P>
    <P>In the light of this it is obvious that failure on the part of the Central Bank to allow our rates to move in line with developments abroad could have had very damaging consequences.  These would have been infinitely more serious than the marginal adverse effects of the recent rise of roughly 1 percentage point.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3219" /> It is estimated that the additional interest costs in 1981 will be roughly £4½ million for agriculture and £3 million for manufacturing and building and construction. The marginal nature of the effects are obvious from the fact that total costs in industry and agriculture this year are estimated to be approxiately £10 billion. The increased interest costs therefore represent less than one-tenth of 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>This is doubly insignificant in the context of the measures undertaken by the Government this year to stimulate economic activity in the agriculture, industry, construction and other sectors of the economy.  I cannot, therefore, accept any suggestion that the recent increase in interest rates will create difficulties for sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>There have also been suggestions of &ldquo;growing pressure on the punt&rdquo; as a factor in the recent increase in interest rates. This comment distorts the real position. Our currency has enjoyed, and continues to enjoy, a high degree of stability in the EMS.  This is in marked contrast to the other major world currencies.  The main exchange rate development at present is the appreciation of the US dollar which has risen very strongly against all the world's major currencies, including the EMS bloc.  This appreciation is due largely to the high interest rates in the US, which, in turn, have forced the EMS countries to increase their own interest rates.  The upward international movement in interest rates, and not any weakness of the Irish currency, was the dominant factor in the recent modest rise in our domestic interest rates.</P>
    <P>This Government remain totally committed to a planned approach to the management of the economy.  Government planning since 1977 has been ambitious and responsive to the economic and social needs of the community and has been aimed at harnessing the enterprise and development potential of both the private and public sectors.  The investment plan is the most recent expression of our commitment.</P>
    <P>Government planning for the years ahead will focus on the growth potential <Col N="3220" /> of the economy.  Our aim is to identify the realisable increases in output and employment that are possible and the measures that the Government could take, given an appropriate response from the community, to achieve this progress. The Government intend to publish a further planning paper dealing with the issues of medium term development in the light of the current international economic situation.  This paper will identify the growth which is possible for the Irish economy and the requirements that have to be met in order to achieve this growth.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the National Enterprise Agency marks another major policy initiative in the Government's programme. The agency have a far-reaching mandate &mdash; to achieve the creation of productive employment in commercially sound projects which are not otherwise being exploited at present.  By seeking out and pursuing energetically new business opportunities the agency will be making a significant contribution towards the national objective of achieving full employment.  Among their specific areas of interest will be the development and commercial exploitation of projects based on natural resources such as forestry; the possibilities for import substitution; and the results of research into product and market development.</P>
    <P>The agency's investment decisions will be taken in accordance with strict commercial criteria and the objective will be to support those projects with real prospects of achieving profitability.  The agency will also have considerable flexibility as to their involvement in particular projects.  They may either act on their own or in joint ventures with other organisations in the public or private sectors. The role of the board of directors in shaping the investment policy of the agency will be of crucial importance, particularly in their `start-up' phase.  In this respect the wide-ranging abilities of those persons who have kindly accepted my invitation to serve as directors of the National Enterprise Agency will be a tremendous asset.</P>
    <P>The Government also recently announced the establishment of a sectoral <Col N="3221" /> development committee.  This committee, who are representative of Government departments, State agencies, the trade union movement and industry-employers bodies, have already commenced operations.  They will evaluate both current problems and the potential for development of economic sectors. The sectoral evaluations to be undertaken will encompass both sectors which have strong growth potential and sectors which are experiencing particular difficulties in their present operations.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to incomes policy has been as dynamic as in general economic policy.  It was this Government which developed the concept of national understandings.  These have taken wage negotiations out of the traditional narrow arena which they had been in since the mid-1970's and placed them where they should be in a much wider framework which takes account of all the economic and social factors which together determine the quality of the standard of living of all.</P>
    <P>The negotiations which led to the signing of the second national understanding were delicate.  However, I am satisfied that we concluded an agreement which struck a fair and reasonable balance between the interests of all parties, our social development needs and the economic constraints facing us as a nation.</P>
    <P>The Government are confident that the spirit of co-operation we have built up through the negotiations of the last two national understandings can be further developed.  We have shown our ability and willingness to implement our promises under these understandings.</P>
    <P>I note with great pleasure the general expectation that agricultural incomes are expected to rise by up to 25 per cent, according to the ESRI this year.  This boost to the farming community will stimulate production and thus enable farmers to make a greater contribution to the economy, a contribution which is so important in terms of prosperity in every town and village, employment in the processing sector and exports.</P>
    <P>The Government have been acutely conscious of the difficulties which farmers have experienced in recent times, and, <Col N="3222" /> recognising the importance of agriculture to the national economy, have provided the maximum resources for farmers consistent with the many other demands on State funds.  Accordingly over £100 million has been approved by the Government since June 1980 over and above the original Estimates allocations in 1980 and 1981 and a further £20 million is being provided to enable the special EEC package, worth £51 million in all to Irish farmers, to come into operation.</P>
    <P>These aids cover a very broad range, including extra finance for capital investment under the farm modernisation scheme, reliefs to reduce outgoings on rates and taxation, increased headage grants for sheep and cattle in the disadvantaged areas, a calved heifer scheme, fertiliser subsidies, and grants for silage making.  They have been designed with a twofold purpose in mind: in the short term to maximise farmers' incomes in a period of difficulty, and to provide incentives towards increased production, which in the longer term is the only way to combat falling incomes.  I should like to emphasise that these measures are additional to other national and EEC aids and other incentives already available to Irish farmers.  To mention but one of these, the special Western Package, which I hope will come on stream shortly, will make a major contribution towards solving the structural problems of agriculture in the west.</P>
    <P>The House is aware of the satisfactory results of this year's price negotiations in Brussels where increases of over 13 per cent were won for Irish farmers by the Minister for Agriculture and where the Council asked the Commission to have a further look at the question of providing assistance to Irish farmers with a view to bringing proposals to the Council for decision before 15 July.</P>
    <P>However, there is a limit to what the State &mdash; or even the EEC &mdash; can do for Irish agriculture.  Farmers know this and are aware of the need for action of their own to raise productivity on the farm.  I believe that the Government, through the measures they have introduced and the package of aids and price increases negotiated in Brussels, have re-established <Col N="3223" /> the base from which Irish farmers will now advance to set record levels of income and output.</P>
    <P>This Government's record far outweighs that of the Coalition Government. I could dwell on the very fast growth and employment creation we achieved in our early period of office, but I think a fairer comparison would be between how we are coping with the current recession and how the Coalition fared during the earlier recession following the first oil crisis.</P>
    <P>It is clear that we are making a far better job of offsetting the effects of the international recession.  All indicators show this.  Redundancies last year were far below the figure of over 19,000 achieved by the National Coalition in 1975.  Investment will undoubtedly grow this year, under the impact of our investment plan.  In contrast, under the Coalition, investment fell steadily between 1973 and 1975, and in 1976 it was still 5 per cent lower than in 1973.  That is a deplorable record in an economy with our investment needs.  Industrial production fell by 6 per cent in 1975, a figure worse than anything ever recorded under this Government.  Industrial employment reflected this, falling by 13,000 in 1975. Throughout the period 1975-77, the monthly index of employees in private building and construction remained depressed; the upturn only began in 1978 under the impact of this Government's progressive policies.  Inflation in 1975 averaged 21 per cent, and at one point, mid-May of that year, reached an all-time high of 25 per cent; significantly higher than anything reached under this Government, even allowing for the recent massive oil price increases.</P>
    <P>I could go on, but I need not.  It is clear that our record, even during the international recession, is far superior than that of the Coalition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In a debate such as this one must look for some basis upon which to compare the performance of the Government which is under scrutiny with that of other Governments facing a similar situation.  The statistics available on that point are a far more damning indictment <Col N="3224" /> of the vacillation and lack of policy of the present Government than anything that we on this side of the House could put forward.  I refer in particular to the statistics comparing Ireland's economic performance in the recent past with that of our 16 major competitor nations contained in the most recent Central Bank report.  Those figures compare how Ireland has done as against the United States, Canada, Japan, West Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Spain and Portugal.  I am afraid those figures disclose that we have done extremely badly.  We all know that the Government have faced an international economic recession but we also know that the Governments of those other 16 countries faced an increase in their oil bills too. The best way of deciding how good our Government are is to see how we have done in these difficult situations as against how they have done in the same difficult situations.</P>
      <P>I shall start by referring to economic growth because without economic growth one does not have anything.  One does not have anything to live on unless one produces and there can be no increase in living standards unless one increases what one produces.  In 1980 the gross national product of this country fell by 0.5 per cent, the worst performance of all the 16 countries I mentioned with only one other country, Denmark, doing equally badly.  Denmark also had a decline in production of 0.5 per cent. That shows how badly we are doing as against comparable countries.  It also shows how badly we are doing as against the way we were going in 1978.  In 1978 we had the fastest rate of growth in GNP, 5.4 per cent, of all the 16 countries.  In 1980 we had the biggest fall in growth of all the same countries.  We had a decline in production and we were the worst in 1980 although we were the best in 1978. That shows how badly the Government have been able to cope with the international recession in comparison with other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest we might think that there is something unusual about this I should like to point out that in 1980 while Ireland's <Col N="3225" /> production fell by 0.5 per cent, in the supposed sick man of Europe, the United Kingdom, it actually increased by 2.9 per cent.  GNP went up in Britain by almost 3 per cent last year while it fell here by 0.5 per cent.  It went up in Italy, another so called sick man in Europe, by 3.8 per cent last year.  There was an increase of almost 4 per cent in GNP in Italy last year while Ireland's production fell by 0.5 per cent.  The same goes for another alleged sick economy, Belgium.  Their production rose by 1.5 per cent while it fell in Ireland by 0.5 per cent.  Those comparisons show how badly we are doing.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to another index of our performance, our balance of payments, how much our income as a country exceeds or is less than what we spend as a country.  Countries, when one boils it down, are like households.  If they are living beyond their means like a household they get into trouble.  If a country has a negative balance of payments ultimately it will get into trouble just as a household will get into trouble. There is far too much artificial complication of economics.  One can understand economics in most cases by looking at the situation of a household and this country as a household is spending far more than other countries are spending, relative to what we are taking in.  That is probably the most alarming of all the indices of economic performance here.</P>
    <P>In 1981 it has been predicted &mdash; the Government have not contested this prediction &mdash; by the Central Bank that the balance of payments deficit, the difference between what we are spending and what we are taking in, will be 13¼ per cent of gross national product, 13¼ per cent of a negative balance in terms of the excess of our spending over our production. This may surprise the Chair although I know that the Chair is as well informed as anybody from listening to these debates &mdash; involuntarily in many cases &mdash; about economics.  It may surprise the Chair to know that our balance of payments deficit at 13¼ per cent of GNP is three times as bad as the next worst country on the list, not three times as bad as the average, not three times as bad as the best but three times as bad as the next <Col N="3226" /> worst country on the list as far as balance of payments are concerned.  Ireland's balance of payments deficit for 1981 will be 13¼ per cent, according to the Central Bank, as against 4½ per cent in Belgium, the next worst country, as against somewhere between ¾ and 1 per cent in the UK, as against a deficit of 1½ per cent in Spain and as against a deficit in Portugal of somewhere between 2¼ and 4¼ per cent. We simply cannot go on like this.  Let nobody delude himself that these figures are not available to people who are lending us money: the bankers in New York and Zurich or wherever else the Government go for funds know we are living beyond our means.</P>
    <P>A banker who sees a farmer spending more on his farm and life-style then he is taking in is not going to continue lending him money forever.  I am sure that the Minister of State, knowing the problems of many of his constituents as he does, is aware that banks tend to adopt that attitude with his constituents as they do with my constituents.  Banks treat countries as they treat farmers or other creditors and if countries are spending more than they are taking in the banks are going to say &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; in the same way as they say &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; to a farmer, businessman, teacher or anyone else who is living beyond his means, and that is something which we as a community have not come to realise. Even if I bore the House I must repeat that we, as far as living beyond our means is concerned, are three times as bad as the next worst country on the list.</P>
    <P>The next index for comparison of how Ireland is doing as against other countries is that of increases in prices.  It has been said on many occasions, in my view with considerable truth, that Ireland's fundamental economic problem is its failure to tackle inflation.  There was a time when we did well as far as inflation was concerned. In the last two years of the Government of which Deputy Corish was Tánaiste we had a rapidly declining rate of inflation.  In the last two years of the present Government we have had a rapidly increasing rate of inflation.  However, lest I be accused of being partisan or unfair, I will compare not the performance of Fianna Fáil now with the performance <Col N="3227" /> of the Coalition but the performance of Fianna Fáil now with their own performance in 1978.  They cannot accuse me of being unfair in making that comparison and it will show how much worse things have become since 1978. The Central Bank &mdash; again their estimate has not been contested by the Government &mdash; predict that our rate of inflation in 1981 will be something in the region of 17.5 per cent.  That rate of inflation is likely to be exceeded by only one other of all the 16 major competitor nations I mentioned, namely Greece, with a projected rate of inflation for this year of 23 per cent.  We are the second worst as far as inflation is concerned.  It may surprise many of us with our inherent national inferiority complex, believing that inevitably we are going to do badly as against everyone else, to know that in 1978 we in this country &mdash; and Fianna Fáil can take their share of the credit for this if they wish &mdash; had the sixth lowest rate of inflation of all those 16 competitive nations. We have gone from having the sixth lowest rate of inflation in 1978 to having the second highest rate of inflation in 1981.</P>
    <P>That means that we cannot sell competitively abroad, that we cannot defend our home market whether it be our home market for tourism to which the Minister made some pleading reference a few moments ago, or our home market for food or our home market for manufactured goods.  If our rate of cost increases is the second highest amongst all of the competitor nations of course we are going to lose our markets at home and abroad. That is obvious.  People in the shops are not fools.  If they see the price of Irish goods increasing at twice the rate that imported goods are increasing of course they will buy imported goods.  No amount of preaching is going to stop the housewife from doing that.  That is inevitable. We are allowing a situation to continue wherein our rate of inflation is the second worst of all those 16 competitor nations as against being the sixth best in 1978. Perhaps I could illustrate my point by showing our rate of inflation in comparison for instance, with that in Japan.  Ours is 17.5 per cent.  The Japanese rate is <Col N="3228" /> projected to be only 5.5 per cent.  Is it any wonder that the Japanese are taking over the Irish market?  Our rate of inflation compares very unfavourably with the projected rate for Belgium of 6 per cent, for the Netherlands of 6 per cent, for Denmark 9.75 per cent, for Spain 14 per cent, for Canada between 10 and 12 per cent and for West Germany 4.75 per cent. Those are the projected rates of inflation for other countries with whom we must compete, when our rate is projected to be 17.5 per cent.  Clearly things have been going radically wrong in the last two years under the present Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister sought to compare the record of the Coalition with that of the present Government.  I intend to deal with that more fully tomorrow, but I will make one point in regard to the increase in the cost of living which perhaps is the best way of measuring the performance of the Government.  Under the present Government in the last two years the rate of increase in the CPI has been far faster than the rate of increase in the price of imports.  Therefore, the amount that we have added here in this country to our own cost of living has been very great under the present Government, whereas during the period of the Coalition, even though the rate of inflation was high and no-one can say it was anything but unsatisfactory, the rate of increase in the shops in Ireland during that period was actually less than the rate of increase in the price of our imports.  During the period of the Coalition we in Ireland suceeded in reducing the rate of inflation that we were bringing into our country whereas during the period of office of the present Government they have succeeded in adding to the rate of inflation that was being brought into this country from outside. That is a fair way of comparing the performance of the two Governments.</P>
    <P>Probably the most serious prospect facing this country, given that we are by far the most heavily borrowed country abroad, is the danger of a dramatic tightening in world capital markets.  We all know that the situation in the Middle East is very unstable at the moment, and most of the money that we are borrowing comes from the Middle East.  It may come <Col N="3229" /> to us from a German, Japanese, Italian or Swiss bank but it is Arab money that is being recycled through the European and US financial systems into this country. There is plenty of Arab money flowing into that system at the moment because of the increases in the price of oil that have taken place.  However, if suddenly &mdash; it would happen suddenly not gradually &mdash; as a result, for instance, of a war in the Middle East, the Arab money that is now being sent to the world capital markets were to be kept at home in the Arab world for the purpose of fighting a war or carrying on other activities within the Arab world; if suddenly the money which is plentifully available for us at the moment should no longer be available, not only would we not be able to borrow additional money but we would be unable even to recycle our existing debts, to maintain our existing level of indebtedness.  It is important to realise that more than half of all the money that we owe as a country at the moment &mdash; when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean the Government and the semi-State bodies &mdash; has to be repaid within the next five years.  If at any time in the next five-year period capital markets were suddenly to get tight and money was no long available, we simply would not be able to renegotiate new loans and we would find that we would not have the cash flow to continue living.  Far from not being able to increase our debt, we would not even be able to stay as we are.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Cyprus Potato Imports.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to talk about the problems regarding the importation of Cyprus potatoes.  Irish potato producers, many of whom are located in County Meath, have had two very bad years, last year and the year before.  Last year, in particular, their problems were aggravated by the very substantial importation of early Cyprus potatoes, which led to a dramatic decline in the price paid for potatoes produced here.  Considerable <Col N="3230" /> pressure was put on the Minister to take action to stop the importation of Cyprus potatoes, particularly because these potatoes were not coming from within the EEC.  They were coming from a country outside the EEC, to whom we had no obligation under the Treaty of Rome to allow their potatoes in.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in reply to a question in January, said he had taken powers to ensure that those imports would stop and that this year farmers would have the assurance that there would be no importation of Cyprus potatoes.  I welcomed that commitment.  Seven days ago, the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, was asked if that commitment was adhered to.  He was asked by Deputy D'Arcy, as reported in volume 328, column 2564 of the Official Report of 12 May 1981:</P>
      <P>Can the Minister guarantee that Cyprus potatoes will not reach this country before all the ware potatoes are bought up?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State replied:</P>
      <P>The order which the Minister for Agriculture introduced restricting imports from Cyprus is intended to do what the Deputy suggests.  There is no application for a licence before the Minister and there is no intention of granting one.</P>
      <P>Nothing could be more unequivocal. Within four days of those words being spoken by the Minister of State an application was granted by the Minister for Agriculture to allow 200 tons of Cyprus potatoes to be introduced into this country for, as we were told, processing, not for sale on the open market.  I understand that a licence was granted on the very day the Minister of State was telling the House there was no application for a licence before the Minister and there was no intention of granting one.  If, having said that, the situation can change so much within the space of three days, is there any wonder farmers do not trust the Government not to allow any more Cyprus potatoes in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Government are saying that those 200 tons are the only potatoes which will be allowed in.  If they could <Col N="3231" /> tell the Dáil in a formal reply to a question that not only would they not allow any in but there was no application to allow any in and within three days such an application was granted, is it any wonder farmers do not have much confidence in what the Minister is likely to say?  The case will probably be made by the Minister of State that he will take steps to ensure that any of the potatoes that come in here will not trickle into the domestic market and be used to depress the price of potatoes sold by Irish producers.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister propose to police that operation?  It is all right to say it will not be possible for them to be sold at retail level in County Louth and County Meath because there are enough local potato producers likely to go around the shops to keep an eye on this and report the abuse.  There will not be producers in the west in a position to go around to every shop.  What way is there to stop those potatoes trickling into the domestic market in part of the country where there is not a heavy concentration of potato production and vigilance by the producers?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State tell us why Irish potatoes could not be used for the processing operation for which he had seen his way, despite his previous commitment, to allow imported Cyprus potatoes to be used?  Why could Irish potatoes not be used for the same purpose?  In view of the statement of the Minister of State in the Dáil on 13 May, so rapidly proved incorrect, it is hard to put a lot of credence in an assurance from him.  Can he give an assurance that there will be no further importation of Cyprus potatoes? The Minister of State should know that Irish potato producers are in a very angry mood at present.  They feel they have been let down.  They feel very insecure and they want a cast iron assurance that their situation will not be allowed to deteriorate the way it deteriorated last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite simple to discern a Cypriot, whether he is a Greek Cypriot or a Turkish Cypriot, from an Irishman but it is a totally different matter to try to <Col N="3232" /> tell where a potato comes from, whether it is produced in this country or in Cyprus. How will the Minister police the importation of potatoes?  The potatoes from Cyprus have already come across the Border and will continue to flow across it in the next few months.  If this is allowed in an unabated manner, as it was allowed last year, the Irish producers may be wiped out.</P>
      <P>Irish potato growers, especially growers of early potatoes, had a disastrous year in 1980.  Normally, in the months of June and July, they could hope to get as much as £160 to £200 a ton for their produce.  Last year quite often they could get only £30 to £40 a ton.  That situation will have to be redressed if they are to remain in business.  What does the Minister intend to do?</P>
      <P>On 25 February last, in the course of another Adjournment Debate, the Minister told me he would make an order under the Agricultural Products (Regulation of Imports) Act, 1938 to control those imports.  We read in today's newspapers that 200 tons of Cyprus potatoes came across the Border from Northern Ireland yesterday and they would be used for processing.  I understood that most of the processing industry had ceased.  I know that potatoes were used for the manufacture of alcohol some years ago and there has been talk of setting up a processing industry to produce frozen chips.  Would the Minister tell us where those potatoes are going to?  According to this evening's newspapers they were actually delivered this morning to the Dublin vegetable market.  The photographs of the pickets are in this evening's newspapers.  Surely if they were to be processed they would have gone direct to the processing centres?  I am very suspicious that they will be on sale and will end up in retail shops around the country. The way these potatoes have been freely sold throughout the State has been the main cause of this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister give an assurance that smuggling will be reduced or, if possible, stopped completely?  I do not know if any attempt was made to stop or control the importation of these potatoes, but I do not believe there was.  As Cyprus is not <Col N="3233" /> a member or an associate member of the EEC nor has any trade agreements with the EEC in this regard, I cannot understand how these potatoes were let in last year and how the present situation is being tolerated.</P>
    <P>It is obvious the British are allowing the uncontrolled importation of Cyprus potatoes and that is how they are getting to Northern Ireland and then across the Border.  Has the Minister had any negotiations with the British authorities to ensure that the amount of such potatoes coming to Northern Ireland is compatible with the demand for that area alone and that the North is not being used as a depot for smuggling them into the South? It is very easy to smuggle from the Six Counties into the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
    <P>Last year we imported £4 million worth of potatoes.  For a traditional producer of potatoes this is a staggering figure.  I would like to see the Minister taking steps to eliminate this type of imports as long as there are potatoes available on the home market.  There are still large stocks of home produced potatoes available and there will be for many months to come. The Cypriots have a climatic advantage and can produce their early potatoes two or three months earlier than we can, but we do not see why our producers should be put out of business because of unfair competition, especially as Cyprus is not a member of the EEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to this protest.  Coming from a potato area I want to spotlight a grievance of the Donegal farmers who are trying to rid themselves of an enormous amount of potatoes which they cannot sell.  Recently the IDA gave a grant of £600,000 to a member of the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; a member of the other House &mdash; to open a processing factory in Letterkenny.  All the potatoes used in that factory are being imported.  This is causing grave alarm to the potato producers in County Donegal. I cannot see the reason why one State body should financially support a venture which is not taking home-produced potatoes. The excuse put forward is that the potatoes grown in County Donegal are <Col N="3234" /> not suitable and the potatoes coming from Northern Ireland are the only type that can be processed, but that is not the story which was told to the farmers when the grants were being given.  As a result of many promises which were whispered in their ears during the by-election &mdash; many farmers were told that when this potato factory opened in Letterkenny the many thousands of tons of potatoes on their hands would be taken into the factory &mdash; many farmers pledged financial support for the factory.  Many of them hoped this would be an outlet for their surplus potatoes, but what thanks did they get?  The Department of Agriculture gave that factory a permit to import potatoes from Northern Ireland.  This is the most ludicrous situation that could arise in a depressed area where people work very hard to produce potatoes and where the Potato Marketing Board have not delivered this year.</P>
      <P>A very close friend of the Minister's, the managing director of the new potato processing factory in Letterkenny, was given licence to import potatoes from Northern Ireland because, it was said, the only suitable potatoes available had to be imported from Northern Ireland. This is far from the truth.  Many people who understand the position say there are many varieties of potatoes in County Donegal which are just as suitable.  It is scandalous that public money is given to a Senator of the Fianna Fáil Party to build a factory in Letterkenny.  It is not the first grant that same Senator was given.  He got grants for hotels, probably more money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is the message they were given during the by-election.  They were told the Government were doing something for the potato producers in County Donegal, but what did they do?  They gave one of their own members a grant of at least £600,000 <Col N="3235" /> to build a factory.  What did he do?  He applied for a licence to import potatoes from Northern Ireland because, he said, the potatoes in Donegal were not suitable. The fact is they were cheaper in Northern Ireland.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for Agriculture and his Minister of State for enabling me this afternoon to arrange a meeting at very short notice with the responsible farmers of Leinster, and North County Dublin in particular, who were picketing the importation of Cyprus potatoes last night and this morning. That meeting took place with senior officials of the Department and the question was thrashed out in detail.  I would like to place on record my appreciation of the practical understanding shown at that meeting by the Department's senior officials.  A recommendation is being made to the Minister tomorrow that further imports of Cyprus potatoes cease completely and that they will not be allowed in in any circumstances.</P>
      <P>I would like also to place on record my appreciation of the responsible manner in which the farmers of Leinster behaved this morning and the efficient way they highlighted the skulduggery being carried on in this nefarious trade in relation to this importation.  On the face of it the importation of these potatoes was supposed to be for processing but they would have ended up on the retail shelves.  I would like to compliment the nationalistic-minded civil servants for their detective work.  They looked up the 1938 Import Act to enable them legally to put these facts before the Minister tomorrow to make sure we are not scourged with this situation in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This will have a twofold effect.  It will save the Irish housewife from paying exorbitant prices for potatoes and save the Irish potato industry.  If this does not succeed, we have the commitment of the Minister for Agriculture and the Ministers of State to ensure that the Irish housewife will have a quality product at a reasonable price so that she will not be at <Col N="3237" /> the mercy of a handful of importers who would exploit her ruthlessly for strictly profit motive, throwing on the market, perhaps, inferior potatoes which would not be of any use to anybody.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to reorganise the potato section in the Department and to establish a marketing board for the entire country so that the fragmented industry will have some rationale, so that we will be able to provide quality produce and give confidence to smaller growers throughout the country.  I have no doubt Irish potato growers can do this.  Neither have I any doubt that the Minister will ensure that this trade will become a viable one from the point of view of all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Smith)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 6 March the Minister for Agriculture made an order under the Agricultural Products (Regulation of Import) Act, 1938 entitled the Potatoes (Regulation of Import) Order, 1981.  This prohibits the importation, except under licence, of potatoes from all countries other than EEC member states. The order was made to prevent a recurrence of the position last year when considerable quantities of third country potatoes were imported causing an imbalance in our market.  The expectation at the time, and, indeed, until very recently, was that our own supplies plus those coming from other EEC member states would be ample to see us through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding considerable pressure from at least one third country we continued to refuse to issue any licences for the importation of potatoes on the grounds that we had adequate supplies from our resources and imports from member states.  However, when we were satisfied that supplies for processing were no longer adequate, the importation of a consignment of 200 tonnes of Cyprus potatoes for processing was licensed yesterday. This action, which had the full support of the Irish Farmers' Association, was necessary to ensure adequate supplies for the processing plants.  The potatoes were imported through Dundalk under my Department's supervision, <Col N="3238" /> and the importers concerned have given undertakings that they will, one, dispose of the potatoes only to a bona fide processor or caterer and on the strict understanding that such potatoes will not be subsequently disposed of for sale or otherwise, other than in processed form; and, two, not directly expose such potatoes for sale at any time either loose or in containers.</P>
    <P>They have also accepted that, if in the opinion of the Minister for Agriculture either of these undertakings is not complied with, the Minister reserves the right to have any potatoes in their possessions which he considers to have originated in Cyprus seized by an officer of his Department and to be subsequently disposed of as he sees fit.  There are 21 officers employed full time in the Department who are available daily to ensure that these regulations and grading conditions are complied with to the fullest extent.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that my Department will take the appropriate steps to ensure that these undertakings are complied with.  Any potatoes which are exposed for sale are liable to seizure. Indeed, I might mention that approximately one tonne of Cyprus potatoes was seized yesterday in County Louth.</P>
    <P>As regards further imports from third countries, this is a matter which will have to be kept under continuing review. Decisions about allowing further imports can only be taken in the light of the day-to-day supply position, particularly the position in regard to supplies to the processing plants.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that Irish producers will have no difficulty in clearing all their supplies of good quality ware potatoes before the end of the season.  Prices for Irish ware potatoes have been quite satisfactory since the order was made in March.  In fact the price of potatoes since March has doubled.  The controls which the Minister introduced have had the desired effect of bringing back confidence in the trade.</P>
    <P>For the information of Deputy Bruton, in case he is not aware of this, a group of farmers, the majority of whom are from County Meath, were in the Department of Agriculture this afternoon and met <Col N="3239" /> officials concerning the importation of potatoes.  On hearing the background of the decision taken in regard to this importation they were quite happy that the right course had been taken.  They expressed their appreciation of what has been done by the Minister for Agriculture and the Department to assist the industry.</P>
    <P>The development programme for the potato industry was agreed yesterday in Brussels.  This means that further aid will be available, particularly for processing and the storage of potatoes, matters of prime concern to all of us.</P>
    <P>I will refer to Deputy Harte's allegation. Anyone who has the courage to invest in the future of the country by investing in a processing unit which would save the country up to £4 million a year should not be castigated in the way the Deputy sought to do.  Such people should instead be congratulated because up to quite recently imports of frozen chips have been costing the country as much annually as the figure I have just given.  When this plan is in full production it will save the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As soon as the Donegal farmers see the possibility of producing varieties which are ideally suitable for processing in the new Donegal plant I have every confidence they will do so. We should not have Deputies coming into the House, as Deputy Harte has done, to describe the Donegal undertaking in these terms.  This will be a very successful operation in the years ahead and the Deputy cannot say anything that will take away from that.  I am satisfied that the decisions taken by the Minister for Agriculture in the issuing of the licence yesterday was in the best interests of the industry.  The producers already know that the order introduced in March has had a very good effect on the industry. The price of potatoes at the moment is indicative of the success of that development.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Acts medical conditions certified as asbestosis are in the majority of cases included within the term &ldquo;pneumoconiosis&rdquo;.  As this is a prescribed disease all persons certified accordingly are regarded as suffering <Col N="3128" /> from a prescribed disease.</P>
      <P>Injury benefit under the Occupational Injuries Acts is not payable in respect of pneumoconiosis.  Disablement benefit under these Acts is, however, payable from the commencement of the claim to persons suffering from such complaints instead of after the expiration of 26 weeks from the date of injury or disease as in the case of other occupational injuries or diseases.  In addition, all such persons who are incapable of work are entitled to payment of disability benefit under Social Welfare Acts, concurrently with disablement benefit, from the commencement of the claim provided that they satisfy the contribution conditions for such benefit. Persons who are not qualified for payment of disability benefit are entitled to payment of unemployability supplement which is at the same rate as disability benefit.</P>
      <P>While claimants suffering from pneumoconiosis receive less by way of disability benefit than they would ordinarily receive as injury benefit during the first 26 weeks of incapacity, the amount of disablement benefit payable in the majority of cases during this period, in addition to disability benefit, more than compensates for the non-payment of injury benefit. In the circumstances it is not proposed to alter the existing provisions relating to pneumoconiosis.</P>
      <P>In certain cases the condition of persons certified for asbestosis may relate to diffuse mesothelioma in which circumstances all the benefits of the occupational injury scheme, including injury benefit, normally apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The claim for unemployment benefit of the person concerned falls to be dealt with under the provisions of the EEC regulations.  He does not satisfy the statutory contribution conditions on the basis of his Irish contribution record and as he was last insurably employed in the United Kingdom his British and Irish contribution record cannot be aggregated for the purposes of his unemployment benefit claim.  The person concerned, was, however, paid British unemployment benefit by this Department on behalf of the United Kingdom authorities on their authorisation up to 18 March 1981 after which date he exhausted his entitlement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in reply to a previous question from the Deputy about <Col N="3131" /> this case, the person concerned was refused a deserted wife's allowance on the ground that she is not regarded as a deserted wife under the regulations governing the scheme.  It was held that she had not, as required by the regulations, made reasonable efforts within the means available to her to prevail upon her husband to contribute to her support.  In view of the fact that she now contends that she recently made efforts to obtain support from her husband it is proposed to have her claim reinvestigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was not entitled to an increase in his rate of unemployment assistance from April 1980 under the provisions of the 1980 budget as his means were assessed on a notional basis.  He was advised that it was open to him to have his means factually assessed and if found to be to his advantage his rate of unemployment assistance would be revised.  The person concerned, however, did not opt for a factual assessment and accordingly unemployment assistance continued to be paid to him at the rate appropriate to a recipient with means assessed on a notional basis.  If the person now desires to be factually assessed he may do so by applying to the local office dealing with his claim.</P>

      <P>The taking in charge of housing estates is a matter for the local authority and I have no function in it.  In regard to Countess Grove estate I understand from Killarney Urban District Council that since 1979 they have been endeavouring to have the estate completed by the developer so that it could be taken in charge.  Some minor works were carried out in 1980 and legal proceedings are being initiated by the council against the developer under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts to <Col N="3134" /> secure the completion of outstanding works.  I understand that refuse collection is carried out on the estate by the council. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, I have introduced a scheme of assistance for local authorities to enable them to complete housing estates where all efforts to secure their completion have failed. Local authorities have been informed (5 May 1981) of the criteria which apply to the scheme and have been asked to submit information on eligible cases for examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Nolan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 195 and 196 together.</P>
      <P>Asbestosis or any asbestos-related diseases are not prescribed disease under the Safety in Industry Acts, 1955 and 1980.  Consequently, proven or suspected cases of these diseases are not statutorily notifiable to the Minister for Labour.</P>
      <P>The Factories (Asbestos Processes) Regulations, 1975, which are administered by the industrial inspectorate of my Department are, however, concerned with the protection of workers against the hazards of asbestos in workplaces to which the Safety in Industry Acts 1955 and 1980 apply.  These regulations provide for:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  The protection of workers against inhalation of harmful levels of asbestos dust; 2. the supply of protective clothing and respiratory protective equipment; <Col N="3135" /> 3. the provision of suitable accommodation for such protective clothing and equipment; 4. the maintenance of premises and plant in a clean state; 5. the provision of safe storage of loose asbestos and asbestos waste.  The regulations are at present under review.</P>
    <P>Asbestosis is a prescribed disease under the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Regulations, 1967.  These regulations are made under the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1966, and their enforcement is the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
