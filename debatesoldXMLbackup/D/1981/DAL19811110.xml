      <P>asked the Taoiseach if it is Government policy that the island community on Tory Island, off the coast of Donegal, will be given every encouragement to continue to remain there as long as they wish to do so and that the necessary level of services, facilities and amenities for this purpose should be provided for them; and if he will give a direction to all Government Departments, State agencies and semi-State bodies to have due regard to this policy in all aspects of their operations relevant to the situation.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that Government policy will be to continue to encourage the community on Tory Island to remain on the island as long as they wish to do so.  The Deputy may take it that I will ensure that all Government Departments, State agencies and State-sponsored bodies are required, in all aspects of their operations which are relevant to the situation, to have due regard to the needs of the Tory Island community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the proposals he has to assign sole responsibility for transport matters to the Minister for Transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no immediate proposals to assign sole responsibility for transport matters to the Minister for Transport.  However, the possibility of transferring certain functions currently exercised by the Minister for Labour in relation to road transport crews&mdash;involving primarily the administration of the EEC tachograph regulations&mdash;is under examination at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that there are some administrative difficulties which can only be relieved in the Department of Transport by transferring certain duties from the Departments of the Environment and Justice?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there are considerable difficulties in deciding on the optimal division of responsibility in this area.  That is illustrated by the fact that my file contains no less than a score of letters between Ministers of the preceding Government seeking to sort out this matter which they had not done by the time they relinquished office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if the 5p per week increase for dependent children of certain social welfare recipients covers the cost of living increase since 21 July 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Miss Flaherty) Mary Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Miss Flaherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The only social welfare recipients to receive an increase of 5p per week for dependent children were persons receiving a supplementary blind pension allowance and I assume this is what the Deputy is referring to in his question.  This allowance, however, is payable as a supplement to persons who also receive the normal blind pension with which increases in respect of dependent children are also paid.  The amount of the combined increases payable with both the supplementary allowance and the basic blind pension in respect of dependent children amounts to 35p a week for each of the first two children and 30p a week for each additional child.  In no case, therefore, did a beneficiary receive an increase of only 5p a week for a dependent child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was at the poverty conference in Kilkenny last Sunday and she is well aware of the complaints made there about budget No.1 of 21 July and budget No.2 of 1 September when VAT was increased by 50 per cent. She is well aware that the 5p, or the total <Col N="1480" /> social welfare increases in the Budget of 21 July&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A question, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which were 5 per cent and 3 per cent, in no way compensated the social welfare recipients for the total cost of living increase.  Will the Minister, as Fianna Fáil did, give an increase in the region of 20 per cent or 25 per cent and not a miserable 3 per cent or 5 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by the Deputy about the 5p a week does not stand because in no case did any beneficiary receive an increase of 5p a week. The lowest was 35p a week.  In some cases that increase involved 5 per cent and in some cases 3 per cent.  In the preparation of the July budget, the Department of Finance estimated that the cost of living would increase by 3 per cent as a direct result of the proposals.  For those who received the increase of 3 per cent this would at least maintain their living standard and in the case of those who received 5 per cent it meant an effective increase.  There were price increases other than those directly resulting from the budget.  A figure of 5 per cent in the period which we are talking about would be the equivalent over the year of a much higher increase, on top of the increases which had already been received.  We are committed in the next budget to giving a very sizeable increase which will cover the rate of inflation and give a significant increase in real incomes to all social welfare recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the 5 per cent and 3 per cent increases given in the budget of July 21 were not sufficient to cover the cost of living increases since then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>They were estimated to cover the cost of living increases as a direct result of our budget.  I accept that the general rise in inflation which has been a feature of our finances for the past number of years has had a very serious effect.  The trend towards that inflationary <Col N="1481" /> situation existed long before we took office.  I accept that all involved are affected by that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that in the International Year of Disabled Persons, to offer a blind pensioner a 5p increase for dependent children is an insult?  Would she further agree that such a ridiculous increase arose only because the Coalition Government in their package gave no thought to the real effect of a 5 per cent increase on these beneficiaries?  I cannot see how an increase of 5 per cent would purchase anything more that a few sweets.  You would be lucky to purchase a lollipop with 5p.  Can the Minister say that her Taoiseach really believes an increase of 5p a week for the dependants of a blind pensioner is anything but derisory and an insult in this International Year of Disabled Persons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>No beneficiary received an increase of 5p only.  The 5p increase was on top of a further increase in dependants' allowances on the basic pension. It was an increase as a supplement.  If the Deputy is so outraged at 5p being 5 per cent of a basic allowance, how could he have been a member of the Government who established the basic allowance at that level?  We are scoring cheap points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that in our two last budgets those allowances were increased by 25 per cent notwithstanding very difficult economic circumstances?  It has yet to be seen what this Government will do in the circumstances which will prevail under their increased inflation.  Will the Minister agree that a 5p increase in this allowance does not indicate very much for disabled people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no 5p increase only for any beneficiary.  I would be glad if the Deputy could refrain from repeating that point which is an erroneous point.  There was a very welcome 25 per cent increase in the benefits last year and I hope that kind of progress will be continued.  There is need for great development in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the extent to which the supplementary benefit budgets of health boards have had or may have to be increased over original estimates to meet the extra demands made on them by reason of delays in the payment of benefits by her Department and the arrangements that are made to recoup to health boards moneys advanced by them to insured persons in lieu of her Department's entitlements; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in the first part of his question is not available.  There are provisions in social welfare legislation for the recoupment to health boards, from any arrears of social welfare payments due to claimants, of interim payments of supplementary welfare allowance made to such claimants pending decisions on their social welfare claims.  The arrangements for recoupment are that health boards apply for refund of amounts paid by them and these amounts are refunded to the health boards out of any arrears of benefit that may be due to a claimant from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What would the Minister say if a health board have to take out an overdraft in order to meet payments of this kind?  Is the interest the health board have to pay on such overdraft refunded by the Department and, if not, why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a problem in the last while due to the increase in take-up of the benefits and this is something that has to be welcomed in part.  It is due to a change in the atmosphere associated with home assistance schemes in that people are less unwilling to take advantage of them and the result has been an undue demand on health boards. Meetings are about to take place between the Department of Health and representatives of the health boards to iron out some of the problems that have arisen due to this over-demand.  I hope that between them they may be able to iron <Col N="1483" /> out some of the difficulties mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that many of the problems of delays in payment of benefit can be attributed to the fact that application forms for various benefits are not available at local level to applicants?  Will the Minister say if it is her intention to appoint local agents so that application forms will be readily available and sent immediately to the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The general intention of this Government, as I believe it was the intention of the previous Government, is to try to decentralise as much as possible.  If the Deputy will give me details of difficulties encountered with regard to application forms that will be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In the towns of north Cork, in Mallow, Fermoy, Mitchelstown, Buttevant and Doneraile, application forms are not available.  I am asking the Minister if it is her intention to appoint agents and to have application forms made available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no specific proposals regarding the appointment of agents but we shall certainly consider the general problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that there are additional costs arising for the health boards.  Will the Minister give an undertaking to recoup the extra costs to them at the end of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements for recoupment are statutory and are standardised and will be implemented.  The particular difficulties that emerge at the moment due to the demand on the services are being looked into by a meeting between the health boards and officials of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare why all recipients of unemployment assistance do not qualify <Col N="1484" /> for the non-contributory old age pension when the qualifying age is attained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Each of the two payments referred to is subject to a means test and, with one exception, the rules for the calculation of means as laid down in the Social Welfare Acts are less stringent for old age pension than for unemployment assistance.  Ordinarily, therefore, a recipient of unemployment assistance could expect to qualify for old age pension without any difficulty.</P>
      <P>The exception is in the case of farmers in certain specified areas whose land valuation does not exceed £20 and who have their means assessed for unemployment assistance purposes on a notional basis, irrespective of the actual income which they derive from farming.  This system of notional assessment does not apply in the case of old age pension.</P>
      <P>It is possible, therefore, that a person in receipt of unemployment assistance based on means assessed under the notional system would find that his means, assessed on a factual basis for old age pension purposes, are higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree with me that when a person reaches the qualifying age for an old age pension he or she should be entitled to as much as was received in unemployment assistance.  I accept basically what the Minister said but I am sure she must know of many cases where people with a valuation of less than £20 who were receiving unemployment assistance received a negative reply from the Department with regard to their old age pension application, and this after a long delay.  Has the Minister any comment on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>These people obviously fall into the categories I have outlined. Obviously there is an anomaly in this area.  The notional system favoured them, but when assessed on a factual basis and on a fairly lenient means test they are assessed to have in excess of the income for an old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister <Col N="1485" /> has said that there is an anomaly in this area.  Will she look into the matter with a view to having this corrected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly have the matter looked at again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare why her Department are seeking to reclaim further unemployment benefit moneys of £515.70 from a person (details supplied) in County Galway in respect of whom the court decided that £994.20, which was the sum originally sought by the Department, should be repaid, in view of the fact that this further claim was not included in her Department's original claim; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was discovered to have been working while at the same time drawing unemployment benefit between May 1977 and August 1978, during which time he received unemployment benefit amounting to £1,434.17 to which he was not entitled.  A deciding officer disallowed his claim and made a statutory decision to the effect that this sum was due to be refunded by the person concerned on foot of the benefit obtained fraudulently and he was requested to refund the amount in full.</P>
      <P>In view of the seriousness of the offence he was prosecuted under the penalty provisions of the Social Welfare Acts and convicted.  For technical reasons he was not prosecuted in respect of the entire period over which the offence took place and, accordingly, the amount of benefit mentioned in the charge, namely £944.20, related only to the days in respect of which he was being charged. While he has refunded this amount, the balance of the total amount fraudulently obtained is still due to be refunded under the Acts.  He has, therefore, been asked to repay the amount still outstanding and has been given the option of doing so by instalments if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event that the individual in this case will not pay the <Col N="1486" /> money, will the Minister tell the House what steps the Department will take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>As it is not possible to reopen legal proceedings, the Department will continue to seek and request the money.  Should the person become entitled to further benefits, deductions will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if it is the practice of the Department to take legal action against people who have overdrawn social welfare benefits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can gather it is the practice that where there is a serious case of fraud the case is pursued in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state if the Department are successful in pursuing their claims?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is related to the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any statistics with regard to this matter.  In this case, clearly the Department were successful to recoup a partial amount and perhaps they may recoup further amounts.  The problem occurred with the need to have precise and detailed information but information for all the months involved was not available.  The fraud amounted to £1,400.  The Department have managed to recoup £940 and they will continue to seek the remainder.  As I have said, if this individual claims benefit in the future, at that point some of the money lost through fraud may be recouped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the previous Government set up a special investigation unit to pursue such cases and that the unit in the Department of Social Welfare have had a fairly good measure of success and have developed considerably?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1487" />
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The existence of such a unit is useful in terms of pursuing all frauds which are, of course, against the spirit of the system and damage beneficiaries as well as the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether she will consider the introduction of a single parent allowance or, as an interim measure, a deserted husband's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision already exists for the payment of social welfare pensions or allowances to widows, deserted wives, prisoners' wives and unmarried mothers.  A pension may also be paid to the invalided and dependent widower of an insured woman who dies as a result of an occupational accident or disease or who was, at her death, receiving an increase of old age (contributory) pension or retirement pension in respect of him.  Increases are made in these payments for dependent children.</P>
      <P>Extension of these specific payments to other classes of single parents or to deserted husbands is not at present contemplated.  In case of need such persons may be eligible for a supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the present scheme for deserted wives allowance is illogical in that it provides benefit for an unsupported deserted wife but not for an unsupported wife whose marriage has broken down in different circumstances or for an unsupported wife who is amicably separated from her husband who later refuses to support her?  A wife who is separated by agreement and who has two children might get approximately £32 per week under the supplementary allowance scheme but if she was fortunate, in a social welfare context, to be deserted she would get £42 per week.  In the light of that would the Minister consider reviewing the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of anomalies in the scheme and the case mentioned is one that will have to be <Col N="1488" /> considered.  The whole scheme is being considered at present by the Department and the specific matters mentioned by the Deputy and ones I have come across, for which I have a great deal of sympathy, will be examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the present scheme is illogical not only in its application to wives but to husbands?  There are a number of husbands who are deserted by their wives and who are looking after dependent children.  They have no form of income other than social welfare.  At present they also are depending on supplementary welfare allowance.  There is no such thing as a deserted husband's allowance.  Would the Minister consider introducing a deserted husband's allowance and also consider the possibility that the existing scheme for deserted wives allowance could be challenged in the courts and possibly held to be unconstitutional?  If such a decision was reached in the courts the whole scheme could collapse.  Would the Minister consider this situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider the matters raised.  The general intention of the allowances that exist at present are to support persons from whom the breadwinner has been removed in one form or another.  In most countries, including ours, this is normally the husband.  However, if there were a sufficient number of husbands in these circumstances the matter would warrant more attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider in a situation where a couple decide to separate amicably, with both feeling equally deserted, that it would be logical that the recipient of a deserted wives allowance might well have a spouse who would feel he was equally qualified as a separated husband?  Does the Minister consider that the State should take up the tab at that stage?</P>

      <P>I am aware that there can be difficulty at times in getting through to the switchboard in Aras Mhic Dhiarmada due to the very high volume of incoming calls.  A number of lines have been installed in Aras Mhic Dhiarmada to relieve the position and further lines will be installed as soon as the necessary cabling is provided by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>The long term solution, however, is a new telephone system capable of meeting the increasing requirements of my Department.

There are approximately 300 extensions of 786444.  Extra lines have been installed and every effort is being made to relieve the situation in the short term.  The long term solution is the only one in terms of development of the service with potential for computerisation and decentralisation.

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>At the meeting which took place in September 1980 regarding the details of the system, the forecast for the installation was as early as 1982.  In March 1981 there was confirmation of the basic type of switchboard required and of the additional facilities to be provided. We are talking in terms of from one-and-a-half to two years before the final and complete installation will be made but in the short term we have ordered the installation of further direct lines.  However, because of the lack of cable in the area the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have not been able to facilitate us and neither have they been able to forecast when the additional lines will be available.  As soon as they are available they will be incorporated in the existing system.  I appreciate fully the difficulty being experienced by Deputies in regard to telephoning the Department and I <Col N="1495" /> assure them that this is a matter that we regard as serious.</P>

This arrangement appears to have been working satisfactorily, apart from a few months recently when, on account of industrial action by certain members of the staff of the British Ministry, some delay in payment may have occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements of the kind envisaged by the Deputy would not be helpful and <Col N="1496" /> would delay rather than expedite payments.  It would be necessary in the first instance to communicate with the British authorities so that they could decide whether the claimant on the basis of his British insurance record would be qualified for benefit.  Difficulties of a practical nature would be such that the effect as compared with existing arrangements would be to the disadvantage rather than to the advantage of claimants.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that between 50 and 60 employees of Sealink who operate the ferry service from Rosslare to Fishguard are experiencing delays of up to four months in the payment of disability benefit?  Would the Minister be prepared to ask her officials to reconsider the matter, especially since these people are not likely to seek supplementary welfare payments, with a view to providing the same system as for other Irish contributors to social insurance so as to allow for immediate payments and bearing in mind that in similar circumstances in Britain people are paid within a week of sending in their certificates?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">

      <P>The Department have considered this matter closely and they believe that the kind of delays being experienced by the workers concerned are temporary and arise out of the dispute.  My Department are satisfied that to bring about the changes suggested here would only cause further delays because the insurance records would be available only to the British authorities.</P>

Also, would the Minister consider increasing the amount of this allowance so that old people who wish to die at home can be kept at home?  This is something that I have been advocating for a number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>This does not really arise out of the question so perhaps to answer off the cuff might not be the best way of dealing with it.  At the outset the allowance was payable only in respect of a daughter or a step-daughter but it may be paid now also in respect of the following relatives of a pensioner: brother, half-brother, son, step-son, grandson, son-in-law, nephew, sister, half-sister, granddaughter, daughter-in-law and niece.  If the Deputy would like to make the matter the subject of another question I could have it looked into more attentively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was totally relevant.  The position is that if there is a second fit person in the house the allowance is not payable.  The allowance may be payable even if a person is not related to the old person concerned and my point is that this is discrimination against relatives.</P>

The scheme has been extended since to include a number of others.  The group mentioned by the Deputy is worthy of examination and I will look into the matter and contact the Deputy again in regard to it.</P>

      <P>The living alone allowance is payable to all pensioners, including widow and invalidity pensioners, aged 66 years and over who are living entirely on their own.  It was designed to meet the special needs of elderly persons living alone which they have to provide out of a single income.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are people in their fifties and especially those in their late fifties who should be just as entitled to this living alone allowance?  These are people who are in receipt of invalidity pensions, widow's pensions and so on.  In the interest of fair play and equity would the Minister reconsider reducing the qualifying age from 66 so that the small number of people who would be eligible for this allowance could be included in the scheme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The living alone allowance was intended as an aid to elderly persons having regard to their special needs in terms of heating, cooking and lighting.  I would be sympathetic to the case being made by the Deputy on behalf of other groups especially where the disabled are concerned but perhaps it would be better to direct attention towards examining the benefits concerned and considering the problems of the disabled as a group or of widows as a group. Extension of the scheme to one group in an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion would lead to demands <Col N="1499" /> from all others.  Perhaps the case is for general increases in other pensions and this is something that is being considered in the run-up to the next budget.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>Social welfare payments were increased in April last by the previous Government and there was no provision for further increases this year.  The October increase of 5 per cent in all pensions to persons over age 66 and to retirement pensioners represented a real increase in these payments.  The 3 per cent increase in all other social welfare payments was provided to compensate for the rises in indirect taxes.</P>
      <P>With regard to the references to increases of 5p, 10p and 15p, I would like to point out that these increases are increases of supplements to other payments made to the beneficiaries concerned which were themselves also increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1502" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, how can the Minister of State know that there was no intention to increase any of the benefits further later in the year? Secondly, is it not necessary for the Minister to come to the House to seek the authority of the House for a Supplementary Estimate to cover these increases now?  Thirdly, will the Minister of State confirm that of the increases which are mentioned here, the increase for child dependants of widows, deserted wives and unmarried mothers of 25p is the total increase which the child gets and that it differs from the blind pension supplement?  It is the only increase which the child of a widow gets.  I would like the Minister of State to make that quite clear in case people would misunderstand the point made by her in her reply.  I appreciate that that would apply to the blind pension as a supplementary allowance, but that is the only increase as far as the children are concerned in these cases.  As far as the living alone allowance is concerned, 10p is the total increase which has been given in that allowance.  I believe that the Minister of State is also very much aware that these increases are derisory in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The increases mentioned by the Deputy are not in any case at the level he was suggesting.  In so far as they are a percentage of an existing payment they represent an increase which related to the cost of living increase that we planned in our budget which related to the level then.  The level of benefits in general is not adequate and our Government are committed to reexamining that in the wider sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The dependants of those who are on unemployment assistance <Col N="1503" /> referred to in Question No. 19 will get only 10p per week increase.  That is the only increase which dependants of workers on unemployment assistance will get at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The 15p per week increase is the increase for a child dependant payable to a married man in receipt of unemployment assistance.  The basic allowance is increased by 60p per week and the additional allowance for an adult dependant is increased by 45p per week. Once again, the implication that this was the only amount paid is not accurate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of factual information I want to make clear without pressing the matter any further that the only increase granted for a child is the 15p.  Would the Minister of State agree that this is the case?  I appreciate that it is quite embarrassing for the Government at this stage since it is so derisory. I accept that there is a 3 per cent increase for the beneficiary on the basis of the unemployed person but as far as the allowance for a child dependant is concerned that allowance is increased by 15p.</P>

If the Deputy is so horrified at the amount of 5 per cent increase I hope that he is equally horrified at the level at which his own Government set those benefits.  The question related to the increased cost of VAT and ESB charges, and it is fair to consider increases in a family situation in that context because it is in part of a family budget that a child is catered for.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, to enable unmarried couples who are living together to be treated as married persons for the purposes of the Act. However, provision is made whereby a claimant for benefit or assistance may be paid an increase for a qualified child or qualified children who normally resides or reside with the claimant.  Such a person, being a single person, widow, widower or a married person who is not maintained by his or her spouse, may also be paid the adult dependant's increase in respect of a female person over the age of 16 who has the care of such child or children.  In such circumstances, the amount of the benefit or assistance payable would be the same as that payable to a married person who is entitled to an increase for a spouse and a qualified child or qualified children.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my duty to report to the House on the discussions that took place in London on Friday last between representatives of the Irish Government, including the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs as well as myself, and representatives of the British Government, including the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and the Secretary of State for Energy.</P>
      <P>Recalling the expressed wish of the Leader of the Opposition when Taoiseach, that a right of reply should be accorded to the Taoiseach when statements of this kind are made, I proposed to the Leader of the Opposition yesterday that I should be given the opportunity to reply to his remarks, but he was not agreeable to this procedure and is, of course, perfectly entitled not to agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would have been open to me in these circumstances to have substituted for a statement a brief debate, in which I would have had such a right of reply, following the precedent set by my predecessor <Col N="1573" /> on two recent occasions.  However, I decided that I would not follow these precedents, in view of the possibility &mdash; danger even &mdash; that such a debate, however, brief, might raise unnecessary controversy and operate against the national interest.  Rather than risk the damage that this might do, I have preferred to forego the right of reply to which I would have been entitled in such a debate.</P>
    <P>I also proposed to the Leader of the Opposition yesterday that an independent Deputy should be allowed to make a contribution for a maximum period of ten minutes, but the Leader of the Opposition also refused to agree to this procedure and was, of course, also within his rights in doing so.  I have to accept this on the present occasion but I propose to have raised in the Committee of Procedure and Privileges when it is appointed the matter of a contribution by an Independent to a statement of this kind.</P>
    <P>I have to say at the outset that I regret that the Leader of the Opposition should have chosen to make the matter of this London meeting a matter of controversy. I agree with the sentiments expressed by <i>The Irish Press</i> yesterday, under the heading &ldquo;Not a Party Fight&rdquo;.  In this leader it was stated that the prospect of a political dogfight in the Dáil over the outcome of the London meeting was profoundly depressing, and could only be sad and damaging.  It called for a measured sense of responsibility in presenting the arguments.  I shall endeavour to respond to this call, not only by foregoing the right of reply that a debate would have afforded me, but as suggested, by endeavouring to tease out the matters at issue in a calm and reasoned manner.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I would point out that after both the May and December meetings last year I supported the approach of my predecessor.  On 29 May 1980, I said in this House as reported at column 1085, volume 321, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>In the meantime...and can concentrate on bringing to its full and logical conclusion the concept of unity by consent, <Col N="1574" /> he will have the support of this party....</P>
    <P>On 11 December 1980 at column 985, volume 325 of the Official Report I said:</P>
    <P>But at this time we must wish his efforts well &mdash; for our country's sake and above all for the sake of our fellow countrymen in Northern Ireland...</P>
    <P>What has been achieved by this meeting in London can be summarised under nine headings, the first three of which relate to new institutional arrangements with the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Before detailing what has been agreed under these three headings with respect to new Anglo-Irish institutional arrangements, I should like to recall the genesis of this concept.  The view that the problems which all of us in Ireland face must be resolved in the context of progress in the wider arena of Anglo-Irish relations was made explicit in 1979 both by my own party in its policy document, &ldquo;Ireland &mdash; Our Future Together&rdquo; and in the SDLP policy document &ldquo;Towards a New Ireland &mdash; A Policy Review&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Be it said to the credit of the SDLP, a party too frequently criticised nowadays for narrowness of approach, that they presented the concept primarily as a method designed to resolve the anxieties of the Unionists rather than as a means to advance their own political priorities. In fact they conceived of the Anglo-Irish institutions as a network of dialogues through which North-South exchanges would be conducted, as it were, across a United Kingdom-Ireland table.  Thus, on one side of that table, Unionist and Unionist interests would find themselves, together with Northern minority interests, represented in British company, and, thus reinforced in a United Kingdom framework, the Unionists could face with greater confidence our representatives on the other side.  The intention, in short, was to create confidence and thus over time to facilitate dialogue; it was not to create institutions which would in themselves produce constitutional change.</P>
    <P>Following these Fine Gael and SDLP proposals, my predecessor, in May 1980, <Col N="1575" /> initiated discussions with the British Government which by December had brought the concept of an Anglo-Irish approach to the forefront.  I welcomed these discussions; I did not, as one press comment suggests, &ldquo;set them at nought&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However they appeared as being pursued subsequently in a different, almost opposite light, from that originally envisaged by the SDLP.  Instead of being seen as a strategy for the creation of confidence and the promotion of dialogue, the approach became perceived as tending to weaken confidence and to inhibit dialogue.  The unhappy consequences of this are apparent in some extreme Unionist reactions to last Friday's London meeting.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the first of the three institutional tiers, it was agreed to establish an Anglo-Irish Inter-governmental Council, through which institutional expression can be given to the unique character of the relationship between the two countries.  This council will involve regular meetings between the Governments at Ministerial and official levels to discuss matters of common concern.  This body corresponds to that which the Leader of the Opposition proposed in his BBC interview of 30 October last when he said:</P>
    <P>First of all there would of course be inter-governmental Ministerial meetings, that is Ministers from Westminster and Ministers from Dublin.  Now this body would subsume all the existing contacts between different Ministers and put these contacts on a much more formal regular basis.</P>
    <P>I have to say without rancour that I find difficulty in reconciling Deputy Haughey's commendation of such an inter-governmental council 12 days ago with his remarks last Saturday when he dismissed the inter-governmental council now established as &ldquo;limited to just ministerial and administrative considerations ... just giving a name to a series of meetings which have already begun&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Second, it was agreed that it would be for the Parliaments concerned to consider <Col N="1576" /> at the appropriate time whether there should be an Anglo-Irish body at parliamentary level comprising members to be drawn from the British and Irish Parliaments, the European Parliament and any elected assembly that may be established in Northern Ireland.  I was conscious of the fact that within the only parliamentary bodies that at present comprise representatives elected in Northern Ireland &mdash; namely, the British and European Parliaments &mdash; the membership is grossly unrepresentative as between the two sections of the community in Northern Ireland, a ratio well under one-half the proportion of that community that belongs to the Nationalist tradition.</P>
    <P>I do not exclude in principle the possibility of the membership of the Parliamentary Council being drawn from existing parliamentary bodies, especially in circumstances where the representation of the different sections of the community in Northern Ireland in these bodies were more proportionate to their actual size than at present.  But as things stand, and given the possibility, at least, that an elected assembly might come into being in Northern Ireland before long &mdash; I can only say `possibility' because I know that the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has not yet had time to consider even whether to propose the establishment of such an assembly to his Government &mdash; it seemed to me preferable not to press ahead with an Anglo-Irish Parliamentary Council at this time in view of the difficulty of securing from the existing Parliaments a fair representation of Northern Ireland opinion on such a body.</P>
    <P>I was fortified in my judgment on this point by the comment of Mr. John Hume, Leader of the SDLP, on RTE last Friday. He asserted that &ldquo;sensible progress was made today&rdquo;, and said that he &ldquo;did not expect the parliamentary ties at this stage, because of the problem of adequate representation from the North&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition, in his comment that &ldquo;the lack of parliamentary participation is a retrograde step&rdquo; appears to me not to have been sensitive to the consideration that has influenced both Mr. Hume and myself in our <Col N="1577" /> approaches to this matter.  On the basis of his own proposal, made in an interview on the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on 28 October that the Parliamentary Council should include 12 representatives from Northern Ireland, it would appear that he is prepared to envisage a Northern Ireland representation on a Parliamentary Council comprising at least ten representatives of the Unionist section of the community, and, on the Nationalist side, at most Gerry Fitt, MP, and John Hume, MEP.</P>
    <P>I would not wish my concern on this point to be seen as in any way underplaying the importance of the role of representatives of the Unionist section of the community in such a council.  It has been suggested that I have shown myself insensitive with regard to whether they participate in such a council or not.  This is emphatically not the case.  I am most concerned that they should be fully and fairly represented there, and when questioned on this issue after the London meeting I pointed out that they would have a strong interest in being so represented in order that they could ensure that their viewpoint would not go by default.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some Unionist politicians have spoken of boycotting such a council, but, as I have already stated when interviewed on this point, I find it hard to believe that most elected representatives of the Unionist tradition would wish to follow the abstentionist practice which they have always deplored in relation to the Stormont and Westminster Parliaments, and I believe that any abstention on their part, if it occurred, would be short-lived.  Commonsense and a proper concern for the protection of the interests of their section of the community, which their electors would expect of them, would, I believe, resolve any such problem.</P>
    <P>I believe indeed that among the Unionist section of the community in Northern Ireland there are many who rejoice at the proposed strengthening of ties between Ireland and Britain, and who, whatever their attitude to Irish political unity, would welcome the opportunity for closer co-operation between North and <Col N="1578" /> South within the framework of an Anglo-Irish Parliamentary Council.  The warmth of the reaction I have experienced from many Unionists to my constitutional initiative has confirmed my lifelong belief that there exists among the Northern majority a store of untapped goodwill towards a better North-South relationship, goodwill which for far too long we have ignored, disdained and discouraged.</P>
    <P>I must, however, move on to my third point.  This is the Advisory Committee associated with the inter-governmental council, which, as the communiqué says, would have a wide membership, and would concern itself with economic, social and cultural co-operation.  An expansion of this co-operation, both between Britain and Ireland, which have shared such a long, if troubled, history and whose peoples are so closely intermingled, and between the two parts of Ireland, must surely be welcomed by people of goodwill throughout these islands and there are many millions of such people.</P>
    <P>These three tiers of the Anglo-Irish Council when they fall into place, as I believe they will before long, will together provide the means of reflecting what has been referred to as the totality of relationships between the peoples of these islands.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the outcome of the recent meeting in London is in some way a drawing back from or a diminution of what happened at the Dublin Summit last December.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  What was agreed last December was that officials from this country and from Britain should co-operate in drawing up joint studies covering the range of issues I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I cannot emphasise strongly enough that there was no agreement then on the establishment of any type of council whatsoever, inter-governmental, administrative, parliamentary or advisory. There was no agreement on anything other than what was stated in the communiqué issued at that time.  There was simply an agreement that studies should be made.</P>
    <P>I turn now, as my fourth point, to <Col N="1579" /> another and very serious aspect of our relationship.  While both Governments have noted with approval the efforts now being made under the criminal law jurisdiction legislation to ensure that those who commit crimes should not be able to escape their consequences because of the border that divides our island, the British Prime Minister and myself have felt it worthwhile to invite our two Attorneys General to consider what further improvements towards that end might be possible.</P>
    <P>I have already been asked whether this means that the two eminent lawyers in question might consider the establishment of an All-Ireland Court as an additional element in our system of justice in this island, and I have replied that such a proposal would come within the ambit of their study.  I look forward to seeing the outcome of their deliberations; even before this London meeting they had already established a useful and friendly contact with each other, and I know they will lose no time in tackling this task.</P>
    <P>My fifth point concerns another matter that affects the relations between our two peoples, namely, the imbalance of treatment of each other's citizens with respect to voting rights &mdash; Irish citizens in Britain having the right to vote in parliamentary elections while British citizens in Ireland have no such right.  Now that Britain's new nationality legislation has taken shape, we are in a position to proceed in this matter, and I had the pleasure of informing the British Prime Minister that the Government have approved the heads of a Bill to be introduced very shortly which will extend to British citizens voting rights in elections to the Oireachtas.  This is a very much overdue move, offering a belated reciprocity, and will help, I hope, to still those voices in Britain which from time to time criticise the rights accorded to Irish citizens to vote in British elections.</P>
    <P>My sixth point relates to an important element of the wide-ranging agreement reached at this meeting, namely, that relating to economic issues.  Many potential areas of economic co-operation are set out in the joint studies, to the publication <Col N="1580" /> of which I shall return in a few minutes.  I was struck by the enthusiasm of our British colleagues for progress in these fields &mdash; whether they affect economic relations between Ireland and Britain or between the two parts of Ireland.  Of immediate practical importance is the negotiation of the terms on which natural gas from the Kinsale field might be supplied to Northern Ireland &mdash; a negotiation whose successful outcome would lead to immediate steps to extend the Cork-Dublin pipe-line to Belfast, with the aim of providing gas to that city, and no doubt surrounding areas, by the end of 1983, if all goes according to plan.</P>
    <P>Of great importance, too, would be the restoration of the electricity inter-connector between Northern Ireland and the Republic, which has been out of action since 1975 because of repeated attacks on it by the Provisional IRA.  As the principal beneficiary of the operation of this inter-connector are the people of this State, who if it were rendered operational again and remained so, would be spared the need for a further investment of £50 million in electricity generation plant, &mdash; the equivalent of the capital required to build 2,000 houses &mdash; the repeated destruction of this inter-connector can only be seen as an act of sabotage directed against the people of this part of Ireland.  Even by the distorted logic of this illegal organisation, the severance of this link makes no sense.  I hope that we can find means of restoring and maintaining it.</P>
    <P>A new inter-connector between the south-eastern corner of our island and south Wales would bring significant benefits to both Ireland and Britain.  It would end our island isolation so far as electricity is concerned, and reduce the whole island's need for spare capacity to cope with emergencies &mdash; all the more so as it would link us not merely to Britain but also, through Britain's existing and proposed new inter-connector with France, to the whole continental network.  I am glad that in London the Tánaiste was able to reach agreement on pursuing economic and technical studies on the possibility of such an electricity link, studies <Col N="1581" /> for which I believe the two Governments could legitimately seek EEC assistance under the terms of reference of Community regional policy.</P>
    <P>I come now to my seventh point.  I have already referred to the joint studies carried out on behalf of the two Governments by our civil servants, under five headings: new institutional structures, citizenship rights, economic co-operation, measures to encourage mutual understanding, and, finally, security matters.  It has been my view ever since these studies were commissioned last December that the confidentiality which understandably is attached to work undertaken by our civil servants carried with it dangers of misunderstandings which could be dispelled only by publication of these studies, excepting, of course, the study on security matters, which of its nature is not amenable to publication.  I believe that it would have been wiser if the two Governments when they commissioned these studies had announced there and then that they would be published when completed.</P>
    <P>The fact that this was not done enabled some people who are hostile to any improvement in relations between Ireland and Britain, or between the two parts of Ireland, to arouse and foster suspicions which had no foundations in reality.  The so-called `Carson Trail', which deeply alarmed many members of the Nationalist section of the community in Northern Ireland, and disturbed very many Unionists as well, was one of the consequences of not making it clear that these studies would be published.</P>
    <P>I stated in Opposition that, if elected to Government, I would seek to have these studies published so that the opportunity to make mischief would be removed.  Since election to Government, I have pressed this matter with the British Government, and I am very pleased that the British Prime Minister agreed to my proposal when we discussed the matter on Friday last.  These studies will be published here and in London tomorrow. They will be found to contain nothing dramatic, but much solid, useful work, upon which we can build closer relations between Ireland and Britain, and <Col N="1582" /> between North and South in the months and years ahead.</P>
    <P>There is one point I should like to add concerning the security study which is not being published.  This study which was, of course, carried out at official level, contains nothing that impinges in any way on our neutrality or raises any other issue which would require the authority or attention of this House.  I would like to assure the House that since the change of Government, neither I nor any of my colleagues in Government nor any Government official has raised any such matters in our contacts with British counterparts.</P>
    <P>I come now to my eighth point, the question of the British Government's attitude to the re-unification of Ireland by consent &mdash; a principle to which the two parties forming this Government have been publicly committed since the autumn of 1969, and which Fianna Fáil had made their own also by the time the Sunningdale Agreement was signed.</P>
    <P>The communiqué first notes that the British Prime Minister affirmed, and that I agreed, that any change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland would require the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  This statement has evoked from the Leader of the Opposition an affirmation that there was no mention of what he described as a `constitutional guarantee' in the Dublin communiqué of last December, and that in last Friday's communiqué, &ldquo;not alone is the guarantee introduced in the most unreserved and naked form, but for the first time there is a clear agreement by the head of an Irish Government to the maintenance of that guarantee&rdquo;, and he described this as &ldquo;a serious and retrograde step&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have already had occasion to comment on this statement, which ignored the fact that the phraseology Deputy Haughey complains of was drawn almost verbatim from the communiqué issued after his May 1980 meeting with the British Prime Minister.  This quoted Deputy Haughey as &ldquo;agreeing with the Prime Minister that any change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent of a <Col N="1583" /> majority of the people of Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  I think I am not alone in being puzzled as to how Deputy Haughey's apparently innocuous and beneficient formulation that re-unification &ldquo;would only come about&rdquo; on this condition is converted into &ldquo;an unreserved and naked guarantee&rdquo;, offering for the first time &ldquo;a clear agreement to the maintenance of that guarantee&rdquo;, by the simple substitution of the word &ldquo;requires&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;would only come about&rdquo;.  No amount of reflection on these two alternative verbs &mdash; and I have pondered them at great length since last Saturday &mdash; has revealed to me the significance of a purported distinction between them, never mind one justifying the striking language which the Leader of the Opposition used to condemn the shorter formulation employed in Friday's communiqué, nor yet the attempted rationalisations of the distinction by a Fianna Fáil spokesman in the <i>Sunday Press</i> and in yesterday's <i>Irish Press.</i></P>
    <P>The only credible explanation for Deputy Haughey's statement on this matter is that he failed to check the May 1980 communiqué before giving his Saturday press conference, and, forgetting what he had then committed himself to, launched an attack which cannot be sustained.  It would have been better for him if he had simply admitted his error of recollection.</P>
    <P>But leaving on one side what must be seen as a casuistic verbal rationalisation, I want to come to the essential element of this part of the communiqué, the commitment by the British Prime Minister that if the consent of a majority to a change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland were given, &ldquo;the British Government would of course accept their decision, and would support legislation in the British Parliament to give effect to it&rdquo;.  It is undeniable that no British Government has, since Sunningdale, expressed itself in quite these terms, indeed, in the interval statements by successive British Governments on this issue have been uniformly expressed in purely negative language.</P>
    <P>This communiqué sets out in clear and positive language the particular and specific <Col N="1584" /> meaning of the support to which the Sunningdale communiqué had earlier referred.  It has now been made clear that the present British Government would be prepared to support legislation to give effect to a majority wish for unity.  The positions of the British and Irish Governments are, as a result, in closer accord.</P>
    <P>But let me insist that the essential element in this, as in all formulations of the aspiration to unity that successive Irish Governments have put forward during the past decade, or have sought to have made by British Governments, is the principle of the free consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  In our insistence on that principle lies the key to the eventual removal of Unionist fears, which were built up over many years by verbal Republicanism in this part of Ireland, by talk such as that of &ldquo;getting back our lost Six Counties&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I know that it will take a long time to still the fears that were aroused by those decades of unthinking irredentism.  I know that so long as our Constitution asserts a right of the Oireachtas and Government established by the Constitution of this State to make laws for the part of Ireland that is not a part of this State, these fears will survive, with all the lethal consequences that flow from them for the embattled people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>But if our course is a steady and firm one, if we stick fast by the principle of reunification only with the consent of a majority, and are joined in this approach by an equivalent British commitment to accept any decision a majority in Northern Ireland may eventually make in favour of a change in their constitutional position and to support that decision by legislation in the British Parliament, then both sections of the community in Northern Ireland can feel that their aspirations are equally protected and assured.  In time, given this assurance, they will find it easier to live in amity with each other and to root out the men of violence on either side who seek to destroy that part of our island.</P>
    <P>Our task must be to seek reconciliation &mdash; between the two sections of the community in Northern Ireland and between North and South.  This brings me to my <Col N="1585" /> ninth and final point.  The communiqué records the joint recognition by the Prime Minister and myself on behalf of our respective Governments of &ldquo;the need for efforts to diminish the divisions between the two sections in Northern Ireland and to reconcile the two major traditions that exist in the two parts of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While I supported the initiative of my predecessor in embarking on the Anglo-Irish approach, I must now pay a tribute to another Fianna Fáil predecessor.  For it was Jack Lynch who, during the terrible and dangerous summer of 1969 and throughout the events of 1970, which threatened our State even more directly, insisted that the only way forward to Irish unity, the only peaceful and realistic way, was the reconciliation of the traditions that exist on this island.  In doing so he calmed the fears of many in the two sections of the community in Northern Ireland and his words and his actions saved lives.</P>
    <P>I am glad that my discussions in London have led the British Government for the first time to join with us in a commitment towards this end: the reconciliation of the peoples of the two parts of Ireland. Only those with a vested interest in dissension and disaffection can quarrel with this joint commitment by both of us to set about bringing an end to the bitterness that has divided this island for so long.</P>
    <P>Let none of us have any illusions that the path ahead will be short, or smooth. There has been too much violence, too much hatred, through too many centuries, for it all to be extinguished at one stroke, or without great and sustained effort.  But our two Governments are now jointly committed to the task of reconciling the Irish people.  That is a great first step along the difficult road ahead.  I am glad to have been able to participate in taking that step.  I was encouraged by the warmth and sensitivity shown by the British Prime Minister during our discussions.  When we meet again next spring we shall, I am convinced, make further practical progress with many matters set in train on Friday last.  I commend to the House the results of our work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was elected Taoiseach I pledged to make a peaceful <Col N="1586" /> solution to the problem of Northern Ireland my first political priority.  My criterion therefore for assessing Friday's London meeting between the present Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister is whether or not further progress has been made towards securing a settlement of the urgent and tragic situation in Northern Ireland.  Has Friday's meeting brought us any closer to a settlement, or has it in fact taken us further away?  The meeting may or may not have done other things, but to my mind without progress on the main issue these other things are of relatively little importance.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to put last week's meeting in the context of the previous meetings I had with the British Prime Minister.  When I became Taoiseach in 1979 there had been nearly a decade of failed political initiatives within Northern Ireland since Stormont fell, making it abundantly clear that no purely internal settlement could succeed.  Since the collapse of Sunningdale the Irish Government had not been involved or been invited to take part in the search for peace in Northern Ireland.  Its role and its aspirations were confined to ineffective cross-Border economic co-operation under a steering group of officials.</P>
      <P>In the Dáil on 29 May 1980 I indicated my view of Northern Ireland initiatives. Volume 321, columns 1059-60 of the Official Report states:</P>
      <P>... my heart sinks at the prospect of the people of Northern Ireland being forced once more to travel down the old sterile road of failed initiatives.</P>
      <P>Because every time hope is falsely renewed violent men take advantage of the inevitable disillusionment that follows.  Repeated collapse of what are called new initiatives, but which in fact are merely old initiatives in newer and more unconvincing disguise, adds gravely to the feelings on both sides of the channel that there is really nothing that can be done.  This, in turn, breeds a sort of fatalism which perhaps is as depressing as anything else that has emerged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was determined that the problem of <Col N="1587" /> Northern Ireland should be lifted on to a new plane in order to bring permanent peace and stability to the people of these islands and to avoid any settlement which would merely sow the seeds of future discord.</P>
    <P>When I first met the British Prime Minister on 21 May 1980 I emphasised the need to develop closer political co-operation between our two Governments and we took a decision to meet regularly. It is now claimed that the meeting of last Friday represents progress, because there will be regular inter-governmental meetings.  That principle, however, was established 18 months ago and set out in the May 1980 communiqué which also spoke for the first time of the unique relationship between the two countries. To announce these two things now as important new developments from Friday's meeting in London is totally misleading.</P>
    <P>Six months later, in December 1980, at a time when the dangers of a lack of resolution of the Northern problem were obvious to all and when tensions were at their height, the British Prime Minister came with a team of her most senior Ministers to Dublin &mdash; an event without precedent.  The British Government then agreed to my proposal that the British and Ireland Governments had joint responsibility for the resolution of the Northern Ireland problem and for bringing forward policies and proposals to achieve peace, reconciliation and stability.  It was agreed that the best means of attaining these objectives was the further development of the unique relationship between the two countries and that the next meeting in London would give special consideration to the totality of relationships within these islands, a totality which includes first and foremost the problem of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In addition joint studies were commissioned in five areas: possible new institutional structures, citizenship rights, security matters, economic cooperation and measures to encourage mutual understanding.  The study that was clearly <Col N="1588" /> of key importance was the one looking into possible new institutional structures which would give institutional expression to the joint responsibility of the British and Irish Governments to bring forward a solution to the problem of Northern Ireland implicit in the earlier part of the communiqué I have referred to.</P>
    <P>It was widely accepted after the Summit that this agreement marked a major advance.  The communiqué itself stated, in a manner which finds no echo in last week's communiqué, that &ldquo;the discussions were regarded by both sides as extremely constructive and significant&rdquo;. Only last month the chairman of the British Conservative Party's backbench committee on Northern Ireland stated that history would say that the meetings between the British Prime Minister and myself in Dublin and London &ldquo;represented the most significant political move in Anglo-Irish affairs since the end of the Second World War&rdquo;.  This was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday, 17 October.  The present Taoiseach, on the other hand, has failed to grasp the significance of what was decided.</P>
    <P>During the months that followed, the achievement of the Dublin Summit was constantly denigrated by the present Taoiseach and by the then leader of the Labour Party.  We were accused of trying to settle matters over the heads of the people of Northern Ireland when in fact we were seeking to set up a political framework in which they could participate without prejudice to their principles. We were accused, without a shred of evidence, of selling out Irish neutrality. Does everyone not recall the silly motion Fine Gael put down on that issue?  We were accused of excessive secrecy.  The then Opposition constantly proclaimed their scepticism about the studies, and indeed they joined and re-inforced much of the opposition being expressed by the more intransigent Unionist politicians.</P>
    <P>The progress of the studies was monitored closely by both Governments.  The general approach on key matters by Irish officials was approved personally by me. My aim, put simply, was that the studies should reflect the spirit and the letter of the Dublin communiqué.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> I was determined that the studies should be a significant exercise, and I would have firmly insisted on progress of a major kind in London last Friday.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of July this present Government took over headed by a Taoiseach who had already made it abundantly clear the he had no particular commitment to the studies.  His unhappy dealings with the British Government were concerned with other matters.  It is obvious to me, even from the summary of the studies, that no attempt was made to hold the Irish position in the areas where the two sides differed, and that the British view was allowed to prevail without serious contest.  I have already expressed my profound disappointment at the outcome of the meeting in London on Friday last between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister.  My disappointment derives from a realisation that a great opportunity has been lost.  It is not so much a question of little having been achieved or even that ground has been conceded in crucial areas.  Rather it is the failure to keep up the momentum, to grasp the full potential of the Anglo-Irish initiative, begun in Dublin Castle in December 1980.  The commitment in Dublin Castle to a new broadly-based initiative has clearly been greatly watered down.  It is in that overall sense that the London Summit has disappointed and depressed, and all the intense lobbying and propaganda undertaken by Government agencies and spokesmen cannot conceal this simple fact.</P>
    <P>To fully understand the extent of this failure to grasp a great opportunity it is necessary to go back and look fully and carefully at the communiqué issued from Dublin Castle.  I want to put before the House again the key elements in that communiqué.  First of all, there is the acknowledgment in paragraph four by both heads of Government that the economic, social and political interests of the peoples of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic have been put under strain by division and dissent in Northern Ireland and the consequential acceptance by the Heads of Government of the need to bring forward policies and proposals to <Col N="1590" /> achieve peace, reconciliation and stability.  Second, there was the firm and clear decision by the two Heads of Government to devote their next meeting in London, in other words, the meeting which took place last Friday, to special consideration of the totality of relationships within these islands and, for the purpose, to commission joint studies which would cover, among other things, new institutional structures and measures to encourage mutual understanding.</P>
    <P>In the place of the clear recognition in the Dublin Castle communiqué of the fundamental impact which the situation in Northern Ireland has had on relationships between Britain and Ireland last Friday's communiqué substitutes the following verbiage:</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister affirmed the importance which their two Governments attached to the maintenance and development of close Anglo-Irish relations</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>agreed on the need for efforts to diminish divisions between the two sections of the community in Northern Ireland and to reconcile the two major traditions that exist in the two parts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I believe there is very real contrast between those two stated positions.  Last Friday's communiqué represents a diminution of importance and significance of the problem of Northern Ireland as an international matter &mdash; an issue between the two Governments.  It returns it to a domestic Irish context and refuses to see it as something which will continue to distort relations between Britain and Ireland as long as it is permitted to continue and which will prevent full and fruitful co-operation between two neighbouring countries.</P>
    <P>I want to demonstrate the main area of the studies where the British view differed from ours, and where it has prevailed over ours.  As I have said, the key area from the point of view of political progress was that devoted to new institutional <Col N="1591" /> structures.  Naturally, the British did not object to institutionalising inter-governmental meetings and to having the same sort of body as they have with France and Germany.  In fact this would suit them very much.  The British concept was simply a form which would cover the existing pattern of meetings.  They wished to substitute a narrowly-based inter-governmental administrative machinery for the broadly-based, politically-active Anglo-Irish Council which we envisaged. The British concept may have a limited usefulness but it contributes little or nothing to a solution of the Northern Ireland problem.  I need hardly point out that the functions of the new council to be established are minimal in character and differ radically from the Irish concept of an Anglo-Irish Council at the time I left office.  I would have rejected the qualification &ldquo;intergovernmental&rdquo; which has clearly been inserted at the insistence of the British, for two reasons.  One reason is because it deliberately excludes parliamentary participation and involvement. The second and related reason is that the qualification &ldquo;intergovernmental&rdquo; deliberately excludes Northern Ireland and the totality of relationships, which should be the basic reason for the establishment of an Anglo-Irish Council.</P>
    <P>With regard to the functions, which are &ldquo;to discuss matters of common concern&rdquo; the Anglo-Irish intergovernmental council will not possess the right or the duty, to discuss the political problem of Northern Ireland.  The first public signs of this outcome were signalled in the Queen's speech on 4 November 1981. That speech clearly separated Anglo-Irish relations and the relationship which exists between the Dublin and London Governments from the situation in Northern Ireland.  It first of all stated: &ldquo;My Government will seek to maintain close relations between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland&rdquo;.  Then seven paragraphs later, and quite separately from this, the speech states: &ldquo;My Government will continue to devote themselves to the complex problem of Northern Ireland.  The search will go on for acceptable ways of enabling the <Col N="1592" /> people of Northern Ireland to play a fuller part in its administration&rdquo; (<i>Financial Times,</i> 5 November, 1981).  In other words the British Government have underlined, that so far from seeing Anglo-Irish relationships as a totality, they regard relations between the United Kingdom and the Republic as quite separate and distinct from the problem of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In my view the British Government now want to establish an Anglo-Irish council which will be exactly the same as the Anglo-French Council, ignoring completely the fact that between Britain and France there exists no problem like Northern Ireland, and there is no British political or military presence in Calais, for instance, or Normandy.  For their own reasons the British Government clearly want to make this separation and they have succeeded.  The point was further emphasised in a statement by the British Prime Minister at her press conference subsequent to the London meeting on Friday.  I quote from <i>&ldquo;The Irish Times&rdquo;</i> of 7 November 1981.</P>
    <P>Asked if she felt that greater co-operation with the Republic could bring about a political settlement, the Prime Minister answered: &ldquo;A political settlement in Northern Ireland really has to be a matter for the Secretary of State and for the United Kingdom Government.  I think anything that helps to reduce tension, to reconcile the differences between the two communities in Northern Ireland, is good.</P>
    <P>Those paragraphs in the communiqué then which the Taoiseach favours do no more in the view of the British Prime Minister than give the Irish Government a useful, auxiliary role in helping the Secretary of State and the United Kingdom government to govern Northern Ireland more effectively.  This represents a major departure from the whole basis of the process established in Dublin Castle in December 1980.  There is now a clear demarcation between the development of relations between Dublin and London as a relationship between two Governments on the one hand and as a separate matter, a proposal to bring forward <Col N="1593" /> some devolved Government structure for Northern Ireland.  That is the kernel of the matter; that is where the watering-down has occurred.  Britain will now proceed to deal with Northern Ireland, as if it were an internal British problem with, regrettably, the full agreement and acquiescence of the head of the Irish Government.  At the same time Britain will be able to turn to the world at large and say that all is well between Britain and Ireland because there has been established an Anglo-Irish Council, which indicates that relationships between the two countries are satisfactory and there are no problems.  That is where the damage has been caused.  That is why the meeting in London in fact represents a major setback to the cause of Irish unity.</P>
    <P>All that emerged from London was to institutionalise the regular meetings which take place between the British and Irish Ministers.  It is clear that special consideration was not, in fact, given to the totality of relationships within these islands, as agreed in Dublin Castle, nor were worthwhile policies or proposals brought forward at the discussions which would achieve peace, reconciliation and stability, as was decided in Dublin.  Let me remind the House that in the Dublin communiqué of December 1980 it was stated as follows: &ldquo;The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister noted with satisfaction the useful exchanges of ministerial and official levels since their last meeting, leading to new and closer co-operation in energy, transport, communication, crossborder, economic development and security&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That paragraph in the Dublin communiqué makes it abundantly clear that the programme of meetings was already well settled and in operation at that time. In effect, therefore, all that happened in London last Friday was that a name was given to a programme of meetings which were already taking place.  I believe I have elaborated sufficiently on the British view.  I now want to explain what our view was, and to express my profound disappointment that there is no reflection of it to be found in the communiqué.  In our view, one of the primary functions of <Col N="1594" /> the ministerial part of an Anglo-Irish Council would be to bring forward policies and proposals to achieve peace, reconciliation and stability and to improve relations between the peoples of the two countries.</P>
    <P>If that had been agreed, and I would not have been prepared to settle for any less, it would have formally expressed the acceptance in Dublin of joint responsibility for bringing forward a solution to the problem of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>What we had in mind and what would have flowed naturally and logically from the Dublin Summit and the joint studies was an Anglo-Irish Council which would have provided a framework within which political proposals for the solution of the problem to Northern Ireland could have been devised.  It is difficult to see why such a council was not proposed and adopted in London on Friday.  An essential part of such a council would, of course, have been the parliamentary element.</P>
    <P>This was central to our thinking.  Such a parliamentary body has now been relegated far into the distant future and even then, it is quite clear, from all that has been written and said, that if and when it is formed, the parliamentary forum will not necessarily be organically linked to the council which has now been established.  That is the big disappointment; that is the big weakness in the outcome of the London meeting.  An inter-governmental council, of the attenuated, limited kind envisaged and with minimal functions, may not strictly require a parliamentary body.  To an Anglo-Irish Council with the sort of functions I have described, a parliamentary body, organically linked, would have been essential. It would not be appropriate to have a ministerial council responsible for bringing forward policies and proposals to achieve peace, reconciliation and stability without Northern Ireland participation and involvement at a parliamentary level.</P>
    <P>It is the Taoiseach who has criticised the whole Anglo-Irish study process on the basis that it did not include representatives from Northern Ireland.  Surely, on that ground alone, he should have <Col N="1595" /> insisted on a parliamentary element in a new Anglo-Irish Council which would provide a forum in which Northern representatives could be involved in all future political developments.  This is a matter of very deep significance and importance and I want to direct the attention of the House to an aspect of the current state of affairs in Northern Ireland which, in my view, has not received anything like the attention it deserves.  In fact, I suggest that the speeches, comments and approach of the Taoiseach all clearly indicate that he is unaware of the significance of one vitally important aspect of life in the North today.  I refer to the need to understand and to cater for the anxieties, the wishes and the aspirations of that section of the community in Northern Ireland who adhere to the Nationalist tradition.</P>

      <P>In my view, the Unionists' point of view is constantly and clearly articulated, and not alone is it articulated, but it is accommodated.  The attitude and the stance of Unionist politicians in Northern Ireland have had a predominant influence on the thinking of British Governments.  They have defeated all attempts to secure political progress.  By way of contrast, the views of the Nationalist minority are hardly ever adverted to.  What is virtually ignored is the biggest source of tension on this island, the mistreatment of the Nationalist minority in the North.  The position of the Northern Nationalist is something to which I believe increasing attention must now be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very real danger that the Nationalist minority in Northern Ireland will become alienated, not alone from London and Westminster, but also from Dublin, and that they increasingly regard themselves as being on their own, isolated and, in particular, as having been let down by those in the Republic from whom they might have <Col N="1596" /> expected much more understanding, sympathy and support.  The greater such alienation, the worse the problem of violence is likely to become.  It is from that angle that I see the failure to provide a parliamentary forum in the new Anglo-Irish Council as being especially devastating.</P>
      <P>I have shown in a number of ways how, in my view, the Taoiseach had deviated from the course set at the Dublin Summit.  This deviation stems partly, I believe, from the fact that his principal political concept in relation to the North seems to be motivated by the desire to see some form of devolved Government in the North.  The Taoiseach has given implicit support in the communiqué to the setting up of a devolved assembly, and the Anglo-Irish initiative now seems to occupy only a very subordinate place in his approach.  We could find an explanation of why so little was achieved, in the fact that the Taoiseach preferred to place his trust, not in a new framework of political co-operation between Dublin and London but in some new initiative brought forward in a purely Northern Ireland context.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, the Taoiseach is moving down a sterile road and putting the whole problem of Northern Ireland on the long finger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government spokesmen have been endeavouring to attach some significance to the statement in the communiqué about the British Government accepting Irish unity, if that is what a majority in Northern Ireland wish.  All, in fact, that was obtained was a promise that the wishes of the majority would be respected, if they expressed support for unity.  There is, in my view, no particular significance to be attached to that.  It has been implicit in the situation for over sixty years that the British would support, and in all probability with enormous enthusiasm, any desire by the Unionists to join with the rest of Ireland.  Any British Government now, who tried to hold back for strategic or any other reasons, would, of course, be overwhelmed by public opinion.  It seems to me, therefore, that the wording in the communiqué is entirely empty, and marks no progress <Col N="1597" /> whatever.  It is only a fluctuation in language used without significance.  The only declaration of value would be one by the British Government of support for unity, and this, of course, is what we on this side of the House have been seeking.</P>
    <P>Many of us eagerly sought some concrete expression in the communiqué of the positive and progressive ideas expressed by the new Northern Secretary of State, Mr. James Prior, in regard to the desirability of abolishing the economic border in Ireland.  The absence of any reference to this objective is another serious omission from Friday's communiqué.</P>
    <P>The scene was set for such positive economic measures by Deputy Colley as long ago as May 1980, when he firmly expressed our political will to make Kinsale gas available to the people of Northern Ireland, by means of a pipeline from Dublin to Belfast.</P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;economic co-operation&rdquo; can become an empty phrase, a meaningless cliché, or they can represent something positive and practical.  The London Summit meeting was the place to decide to bring forward specific concrete proposals and the communiqué was the document in which to outline those specific, concrete proposals.  Regrettably, this has not happened, and it seems to me that going to London, the Irish side did not sufficiently concentrate on what their objectives should be, or what they should seek to achieve.</P>
    <P>One such objective should have been the establishment, for one or more sectors of the Irish economy, of a body which would have the responsibility of promoting particular sectors on an all-island basis, a body which would integrate and administer the sectors of the economy in a way that would secure the highest level of development for the benefit of the people of this island as a whole.  There are many sectors of the economy where this sort of integrated approach would clearly bring specific and substantial benefits.  Instead of establishing any such structures, the communiqué in paragraph 10 falls back merely on well-worn clichés and trite expressions of intent.</P>
    <P>May I deal briefly with the Taoiseach's <Col N="1598" /> unworthy attempt in Cork, and here again today, to personally discredit my viewpoint and the expression of that viewpoint.  He accused me of having a defective memory about the May 1980 London communiqué.  Unfortunately for him, every journalist who was present at my press conference in the Burlington Hotel on Saturday last can verify that not alone was my memory not defective, but that I dealt specifically in reply to questions, with the May 1980 communiqué and with the subsequent elaboration of that communiqué which I subsequently gave in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>In view of the controversy that has developed, and as this is a central, crucial matter, I believe I should devote some time in examining the two London communiqués and their treatment of this issue, namely the communiqué of May 1980 and the communiqué of last Friday.</P>
    <P>First of all, let me state for the benefit of the House, exactly what was stated in the communiqué of May 1980.  The relevant portion is as follows:</P>
    <P>While agreeing with the Prime Minister, that any change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland, the Taoiseach re-affirmed that it is the wish of the Irish Government to secure the unity of Ireland by agreement and in peace.</P>
    <P>Subsequently in the Dáil, I pointed out the significance and importance of the words &ldquo;come about with the consent of&rdquo;. I gave it as my view that those words merely recognised the practicalities of the situation and that consent would be part of the solution and not a prerequisite. There is the fundamental difference, I suggest, between that wording and the wording used in the London communiqué of last Friday, where the Taoiseach agreed that any change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland would &ldquo;require&rdquo; the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>My clear view is that this constitutional guarantee should be set aside now and that we can then proceed to bring forward arrangements or structures to which the <Col N="1599" /> majority of the people of Northern Ireland would consent.  To put such consent in the form of a basic requirement is, in my opinion, tantamount to ensuring that any process designed to secure a settlement will never, in fact, get off the ground.</P>
    <P>Stripped of all the cleverly orchestrated propaganda build-up, the London meeting was clearly a setback from the point of view of this country.  The Taoiseach and spokesmen for the Government have cast around widely in an effort to find some excuse for the failure of Friday's London Summit meeting.</P>
    <P>Two notions are now being canvassed to explain this failure &mdash; the alleged secrecy surrounding the joint studies and the fact that I indicated in advance my view of what I would like to see emerging from the London Summit.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and others, for some time now, have been seeking to make political capital out of the alleged secrecy of the work undertaken by the officials of both the Irish and British administrations in preparing the joint studies.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that anyone giving careful consideration to the matter could find any validity in this criticism.  The need for confidentiality was agreed upon at the time by the British Prime Minister and myself.  In my view this was simply a commonsence and well-established approach to work of this nature.  If permanent officials are to work together to produce something constructive and worthwhile, it is essential that they be allowed to do so in an atmosphere of mutual trust and confidence.  To suggest that permanent officials engaged in such studies should try to carry out their task in the full glare of publicity is nonsense. Nothing could be achieved in that way and in going along with criticism the Taoiseach was merely pandering to those who did not want the studies to succeed anyway.</P>
    <P>It was always my intention and I relterated this intention on several occasions that when the studies had been completed and the results brought forward for consideration and political decision by the respective heads of Government, <Col N="1600" /> the results of the studies would be published at that stage.  This is exactly what has happened.  Far from attributing the failure of last Friday's Summit to the confidentiality with which the studies were carried out, the Taoiseach should gratefully acknowledge that if it had not been for these studies, nothing whatever of any importance would have emerged from last Friday's Summit.</P>
    <P>I have debunked totally any suggestion that my outlining what I hoped last Friday's Summit would achieve could in any way have affected the outcome of the Summit meeting.  I maintained a complete and honourable silence about the work of the joint studies, and about our input into that process, until first of all the Taoiseach in an interview with the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> gave a clear indication of what was under consideration, and then following that inspired leaks and informed rumours began to surface in the media in Britain and Ireland as to what was under consideration.</P>
    <P>Valuable and constructive work was carried out by the officials on both sides between December 1980 and June 1981. I am not in a position to say what falling-off took place in the level of activity subsequent to the general election or what weakening of the determination on our side to achieve progress followed the change of Government.</P>
    <P>I cannot say whether there was any lack of enthusiasm on the Irish side from June onwards for an effective political Anglo-Irish Council or really significant economic co-operation.  But I suspect that there was such, and it was for this reason that the Taoiseach is now attempting in a most unworthy fashion to denigrate the valuable work carried on by the officials of both administrations.  The failure of the London Summit cannot be traced to any lack of substance in the joint study process, but rather to the vacillation of the present Taoiseach on fundamental and crucial issues, principally on the issue as to whether or not we were to have an Anglo-Irish Council, which would survey the totality of relationships between Ireland and Britain with particular reference to the problem of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1601" /> Perhaps the weakest argument brought forward as a follow-up to last Friday's communiqué was the specious one that only the Parliaments in London and Dublin could establish a parliamentary forum as part of an Anglo-Irish Council. I have already pointed out that there are many precedents for governments establishing such a parliamentary forum and appointing the members thereof.  The first European Parliament was a case in point.  Nor does the argument about the difficulty of securing representation from Northern Ireland hold water either.</P>
    <P>There have probably been more elections to assemblies and bodies of one kind and another in Northern Ireland than in any other part of Europe during the last decade.  There would be no difficulty whatever in the British and Irish Governments between them nominating suitable and appropriate representative people from Northern Ireland to participate in the parliamentary forum of an Anglo-Irish Council had the Taoiseach insisted on such a forum as an integral and essential part of the new council. During my time in office the studies in no way envisaged the parliamentary body being dependent on the location of a new devolved assembly.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to sum up my assessment of the outcome of the Summit meeting in London on Friday last.  My disappointment at the outcome is based on three major aspects;</P>
    <P>Firstly, there is the restoration in a new categoric form of the constitutional guarantee of the Unionist position in Northern Ireland by the British Government and now agreed to by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the narrow attenuated form of the new Anglo-Irish Council, a form which almost completely negatives its effectiveness by restricting its activities to an east-west, Dublin-London, axis and which by excluding any political development in regard to the North limits its scope and deprives it of any potential to bring forward a solution to the tragedy of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there is the loss of the momentum in Anglo-Irish relations established in Dublin in December 1981; the rowing back from the philosophy enshrined in <Col N="1602" /> the communiqué issued after that meeting in Dublin and the deflection of the political process then initiated.</P>
    <P>In my view, the currents have been turned awry.  A great opportunity for really substantial and significant progress has not been grasped.  There has been no statemanship, no far-seeing determination to place the problem of Northern Ireland in a new political framework, within which progress towards a final solution could be achieved.</P>
    <P>I believe it to be my solemn duty to direct the attention of this House and the Irish people to the detrimental trends I see emerging from London last Friday.  I want to warn against the Anglo-Irish initiative launched in Dublin Castle being diverted down a dead end and against a return to a stalemate situation in which the problem of Northern Ireland is treated as an internal UK matter.  This can only lead to further frustration and continuing violence.  The way forward is through the sort of broadly based Anglo-Irish Council that we envisaged and I urge the Government to continue by every political and diplomatic means at their disposal to continue to work for the achievement of that objective.</P>

      <P>At the outset I am sure Members of the Dáil would wish me to express, on their behalf, our appreciation of the services rendered by Mr. Mac Gearailt, who has now retired after 46 years of service to the State, of which almost 38 were spent in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, where he held the high &mdash; and most important &mdash; constitutional office of Comptroller and Auditor General since 1973.  I should like, on your behalf, to convey to Mr. Mac Gearailt our very best wishes for every happiness in his retirement.</P>

    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Constitution provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General shall be appointed by the President on the nomination of Dáil Éireann.  The fact that the appointment <Col N="1604" /> is one for which provision is made in the Constitution is sufficient evidence of its importance in our administrative machinery.  The onerous duties of controlling the disbursement of public moneys and ensuring that these moneys are properly spent in accordance with the wishes of this House are placed on the holder of the post, which requires a very high standard of ability, integrity and tact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This Bill increases the statutory limit on the amount of capital available to Fóir Teoranta from £35 million to £70 million.</P>
      <P>The company's function is to provide reconstruction finance for industrial concerns which may be in danger of having to close down or suspend activities because they are unable to raise necessary capital from the normal commercial sources.  The governing legislation requires that industrial concerns, in order to be eligible for assistance from Fóir Teoranta, must fulfil a number of conditions.  The employment content and the capital employed in them must be significant and the owners must have made a reasonable contribution to the initial capital.  Perhaps of most importance is that the prospects of profitability on a permanent basis must be reasonable.  Furthermore, there must be evidence that failure to receive financial assistance would have serious repercussions at national or local level.  These are the general criteria.</P>
      <P>Deputies on all sides of the House will appreciate that the board of Fóir have a very difficult task.  I know that they consider applications thoroughly and with full understanding of all the implications of their decisions.  In 1980 alone the board approved assistance for over 50 concerns employing nearly 9,000 workers and this clearly demonstrates a sympathetic approach.  The jobs saved in this way are of the utmost importance to our economy.</P>
      <P>It is inevitable, of course, that following a detailed examination by Fóir of a firm's circumstances and prospects for future viability, some applications for assistance will not be successful.  This usually happens because a firm cannot show that it has a reasonable prospect of ultimate success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In agreeing to providing finance, Fóir Teoranta may decide that further steps <Col N="1608" /> need to be taken in relation to a particular firm.  They have insisted on measures such as association with a stronger firm, changes in management and at board level and the introduction of consultants to deal with particular functions within a firm.  In addition, Fóir Teoranta may utilise the services of their own management services unit, the members of which are specialists in the main areas of management, to help firms where assistance at managerial level is necessary for survival.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta are reaching the limit of their borrowing powers which was fixed at £35 million by the amending Act of 1976.  Amending legislation to increase their resources is therefore, necessary to enable the company to continue their work.  Section 2 of the Bill before the House proposes that the new limit on borrowing by Fóir Teoranta be fixed at £70 million, an increase of £35 million on the present limit.  On the basis of disbursements since the last Act, the extension proposed should suffice for another four or five years depending on demands for reconstruction finance.</P>
    <P>The company have been almost entirely financed by borrowing from the Exchequer as the returns on the company's share and loan investments have been comparatively small so far.  The company's income from their investments and the repayment of loans is growing but they will continue to be short of the amount which they are likely to have to advance in respect of new applications for assistance.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, therefore, in section 3 of the Bill, to raise from £35 million to £70 million the limit on the power of the Minister for Finance to provide loan capital to the company.</P>
    <P>When the original Act was introduced, the House was informed that an administrative limit would be introduced on Fóir Teoranta's discretion to advance funds.  This was fixed at the time at £250,000 and it is now intended to raise it to £1 million.  Any advances in excess of this will be subject to the consent of the Ministers of Finance and Industry and Energy.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies &mdash; of which I was a member <Col N="1609" /> at the time &mdash; recently produced a report &mdash; the 17th Report &mdash; on Fóir Teoranta. I note the committee's agreement that the company perform a most valuable function, on the basis of rational criteria, by helping industrial firms in temporary difficulties to survive and recover profitability.  The committee have raised a number of issues relating to Fóir in their report and these are the subject of continuing examination both by Fóir and my Department.  Discussions on these issues have taken place and will be continued.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta are, of course, but one link in the chain of the State's efforts to give assistance to industry.  Most of this effort is, through the IDA, principally geared to encourage industries to establish and expand in Ireland.  However, we will always have problems with our existing industrial base due to changed market conditions, costs and so on.  While we would ideally like to see Fóir used as little as possible as that would mean a healthy industrial base, unfortunately there will always be a need for reconstruction finance in certain cases.  Fóir Teoranta provide an orderly and efficient procedure for dealing with these firms.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the House as it will enable this vital State agency to continue their important work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Our party have no difficulty in accepting the Bill before the House which provides for an extension of facilities to Fóir Teoranta by way of borrowing and loan facilities.  We will support the Bill and I know some of my colleagues will have some comments to make on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his closing comments the Minister of State said he would like to see Fóir Teoranta used as little as possible but I am afraid that is a dreamland the Minister will not see for some considerable time. Since the inception of Fóir Teoranta by a Fianna Fáil Government some ten years ago, there is no doubt this institution has been of tremendous assistance to industry.  I admit there have been growing pains but, with the co-operation of the IDA and other important State agencies, there is no doubt that Fóir Teoranta <Col N="1610" /> assisted in solving many serious problems.  The work of the agency progressed very considerably during our time in office.</P>
    <P>In his opening remarks the Minister of State referred to the criteria for involvement by Fóir Teoranta in some companies.  If the industry or company concerned happens to be in one's constituency one is inclined to be critical that not enough action or swift action is taken to save jobs but on the whole the approach of the staff and management of Fóir Teoranta has been reasonably flexible.  The staff, management and board have always been as courteous and as helpful as possible in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Malley, who will be following me in the debate may wish to develop the following point. There was very considerable co-operation between Fóir Teoranta and the IDA and other State agencies but I wonder what is the present position in that regard.  There are cases when approval for a decision by the board has to be obtained from the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  Which Minister is it?  Will there be difficulties or does anybody know?  Has that been ironed out yet?  It is important that there are no hitches of that nature.  Fóir Teoranta should be as flexible as possible in the present difficult economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>We read today that there are almost 130,000 people unemployed.  That is the highest figure on record, according to one newspaper.  I remember the Tánaiste sitting on these benches a short time ago criticising the Government and saying that unless we changed our policies the figure could well be 120,000 by Christmas.  Now he has had the greatest audacity to make a statement to the public defending the present figure, which is 10,000 higher than what he had predicted a few months ago when he was in Opposition.  The once proud Labour Party, how sorry they must be now when their leader and Tánaiste makes that kind of admission.</P>
    <P>These are the sad circumstances that are the background to this discussion.  We <Col N="1611" /> are making extra funding available, should it be needed, for the operation of Fóir Teoranta.  The Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies examined this operation and expressed their satisfaction that the view of the Department of Finance was fully justified.  It is encouraging to think that, having been examined by them, the committee were satisfied with Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>There is an area where more progress was made during our time in office than had been the case prior to that.  A Bill was introduced in 1975 extending the amount of money available at that time. The importance of management expertise being made available to industry when in difficulty was recognised.  This is referred in the Fóir Teoranta report. There is still some room for improvement.  Fóir Teoranta should make available the expertise necessary to help firms minimise the difficulties they face whether in the area of production, sales or financial control.  In some industries which have closed down one will find there was a lack of top quality production, marketing expertise, management of finance and so on.  Fóir Teoranta are committed to increasing the number of personnel they have to handle management difficulties.  Many companies have been assisted by Fóir Teoranta but it is not always just a capital injection that is needed.  There is need for early warning of firms in difficulty.  Substantial progress has been made in that area and I commend it.  Not only must that progress continue but we must strive for improvement because of the danger of complacency setting in.</P>
    <P>At present there is a firm in difficulty in Dublin.  A meeting was held with a junior Government Minister on Friday. According to him on Friday evening, the problem was gone.  This morning I heard something about a receiver being appointed.  That does not mean the end of the road in any way.  I understand there are a number of jobs involved.  I would say to that junior Minister it is important that he should be factual in any comments he would make rather than creating an impression, perhaps unintentionally, <Col N="1612" /> which could be misleading afterwards. There is a situation where the operation could continue but with a reduced workforce.</P>
    <P>Every act of the Government to date has been designed to create further costs. Our competitiveness is important.  Wage increases and how they are arrived at are of consequence to every firm mentioned in the Fóir Teoranta report.  Yet what do we see?   We see a Government who are not interested, or do not know, how both sides of industry should be approached to see whether a national wage agreement can be achieved.  This is not an easy task.  It never was.  Perhaps it will be more difficult this year than in others.</P>
    <P>Every step taken by the Government seems to have been designed specifically to wreck the talks.  I am not sure whether this was due to their lack of experience or to what happened in the heady days of May, June and later of this year, but whatever the reason the Government have been the cause of a major upset to progress in this sphere of a national wage agreement.  The Minister of State has a good background in the trade union movement in addition to his years of experience here.  He is a sensible and constructive Member of this House and I hope that in his reply he will be able to tell us in detail how the Committee on Costs and Competitiveness reached a figure of 6.5 per cent.  These three eminent men, after three or four weeks' deliberations, decided on a norm.  This norm, though its level was not then known, was the centrepiece of the entire Fine Gael election propaganda.  It was propagated at every church gate and in every piece of Fine Gael literature prior to the election.  It was modified somewhat in the Gaiety.  The first figure arrived at by the three eminent men concerned was 9.5 per cent but within a very short time the press were reporting a figure of 6.5 per cent.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to tell us what happened to bring about the change in the figure, having regard to the importance of a pay agreement.  Each of the firms listed in the Fóir Teoranta report is very concerned about what the wage norm is to be.  This figure of 6.5 per cent was put forward within months of <Col N="1613" /> the Government sanctioning increases that will result in raising the inflation level from 17 to at least 22 per cent by the end of the year.  It has been said that the fluctuation of the púnt <i>vis-à-vis</i> the £ sterling was the reason for the change but it was difficult to understand how 3 per cent could have been achieved in that way. However, the Minister of State knows what happened, so I am sure he will inform the rest of us too.</P>

      <P>I am merely emphasising the importance of a wage agreement to all of those firms listed in the Fóir Teoranta report, many of whom are substantial employers.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the performance of the Government in the whole area of the national wage agreement but I shall not pursue the matter further. With 130,000 people unemployed it is vitally important that we make available to Fóir Teoranta the necessary moneys to enable them to rescue as many firms as possible and, above all else, to preserve as many jobs as possible.  I say this because often, when efforts are being made to save a firm who are in economic difficulties, jobs are lost in the process. We must remember that people are our most important asset.  In this context I would criticise the Government for their lack of understanding of this priority. Tomorrow during the debate on the Finance Bill I hope to tell the House why the budget was unnecessary and to make it clear that it was no more than a propaganda exercise, a question of tactics, decided on by Fine Gael before they came into office.  The Labour Party must realise that for tactical reasons the Government have impinged increasingly on every Irish worker as well as on every unemployed person.  Other speakers from this side will have more to say on this Bill and they too will be emphasising the importance of this State agency who, since their foundation by Fianna Fáil have made worthwhile contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the <Col N="1614" /> remarks of Deputy Fitzgerald one might be forgiven for thinking that our economic problems and the trends in unemployment have manifested themselves only within the past few months whereas these problems have been building up during a considerable period.  Fianna Fáil must accept a major share of the responsibility for that situation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the paper mill at Clondalkin and I, too, should like to address a few remarks on that subject in the context of the Bill.  In 1968 there were 1,800 people employed in the paper industry which at that time comprised six paper mills.  Now, as a result of the Government we have had in this country in the past decades there is but one paper mill remaining and this employs only 500 people.  This remaining fragment of the industry is now in serious jeopardy.</P>
      <P>I am aware that various talks have been held between Fóir Teoranta, the IDA and other agencies in this regard and, consequently, I would not wish to say anything that might jeopardise a possible successful outcome of any such talks. However, I appeal strongly to the Minister and to the various agencies concerned to do everything in their power to ensure that the jobs at this mill will be preserved.  The problems of the paper industry are twofold.  Deputy Fitzgerald has referred to the wage cost element but in reports that I have studied on the subject the wage element has not been an issue.  However, there are two factors which are of major importance to the industry.  The first is the hydrocarbon tax and the second is the cost of the very large quantities of electricity that are used in this industry.  It has been pointed out that the hydrocarbon tax which was imposed in the 1980 budget added £280,000 in one year alone to the costs of the Clondalkin paper mill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes I wonder how we get by in this country when I consider how we organise our affairs, how we plan matters for ourselves and the things we do.  We gear ourselves through the IDA to attract in foreign industry.  That is fine and I am all for it, but we pay scant and insufficient regard to the needs of our ever-declining home-based industries.  This is a primary <Col N="1615" /> factor in those climbing unemployment figures.  We see here the real threat of this last industry in Clondalkin fading away and having to close.  Why?  There are reports aplenty as to the reason.  What are we doing to assist them and to save those 500 jobs and keep those unfortunate people off the dole queues?</P>
    <P>The paper industry requires grant assistance from the State to enable it to compete with comparable industries in the other paper manufacturing countries in Europe and North America.  What is our record in that respect?  I want to quote a couple of examples on the subject.  The annual grant per person employed in the paper industry in Norway is £458; in the UK it is £419, in Sweden £671, in Canada £844 and in Ireland £144.  Small wonder then at our inability and the inability of the Clondalkin Paper Mills as constituted and financed at present to compete against that massive State subsidy and support provided for their competitors in North America and Europe.  The other very major cost item affecting the production of paper is the electricity cost.  I want to give some comparable unit cost figures referable to that item.  The cost of a kW in Irish pence in the US is 1.81, in Canada &mdash; a major paper producer &mdash; 1.03, in Sweden 1.62 and in Ireland 3.93.  Of the list of some ten countries furnished, Ireland is far and away the highest of the lot.</P>
    <P>These are the sort of things to which we have to apply our minds if we are seriously interested in preserving home-based industries that have been here for generations.  If we do not look to our laurels the £35 million and Fóir Teoranta's increase of £70 million are quite meaningless.  You can talk about £700 million and it is not going to solve these problems.  We have to ensure that the opportunities are given to the home-based industries to work and operate and be able to sell their products.  The word &ldquo;protectionist&rdquo; has become a dirty word in many respects.  There is nothing at all wrong with a bit of protectionism.  What efforts are being made through the EEC &mdash; with which we are stuck, unfortunately <Col N="1616" />&mdash; and what efforts are being made and have been made by the present and last administrations to secure some protection for the remnants of the Irish paper industry?  It can be done.  For example, I see a note in the 18th report of the EEC that in the textile industry concessions were obtained and that we were permitted to apply a measure of protection.  It is about time that some measures were taken to look to other industries, in particular the paper industry, to see what help can be provided for them.  Our production compared with major producers like Canada, Sweden and Norway &mdash; countries which are not in the EEC &mdash; is miniscule.  I suspect that to those who control the policies of the EEC in Brussels, Strasbourg and so on &mdash; in which we have a very small say and a very small input &mdash; the degree of our production as opposed to those giants is small.  It could well be that, if we laid down the law and applied pressure there, some substantial help would be achieved.</P>
    <P>A further matter which has not helped the industry is the EMS system.  The cost of external commodities being purchased here has not helped the industry at all. Of course, it was known before we entered that that would apply and for this reason the EMS interest subsidies arrangements were entered into.  In 1980 we obtained approximately £45 million in subsidies from the EMS fund.  Instead of taking that money and placing it into the Central Fund to disappear into limbo, it ought to be applied specifically to whatever industries are hit so badly as a result of that system, industries such as the paper industry at Clondalkin.</P>
    <P>Once again I want to make a very earnest and sincere appeal to Fóir Teoranta and to the Minister to take every possible step to ensure that that factory will not close and that those jobs will be preserved.  Whether Fóir Teoranta have the resources, methods or system that would enable them to do that I do not know, but it highlights again the urgent need for the National Development Corporation that is a part of the Gaiety Theatre document and which will have such a vital and important role to play in this kind of situation.  It is a situ- <Col N="1617" /> ation where it would be appropriate for the National Development Corporation to take a substantial equity interest in industries like the Clondalkin Paper Mills&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and it has my support.  Over the years I have had quite a lot of dealings with Fóir Teoranta, a body of whom I can speak highly.  In my experience in the Department of Industry and Commerce certainly they were a very worthwhile, useful and progressive body and I have no reason to believe that they will be any different in the future.</P>
      <P>This Bill allows an extension in their powers to borrow through advances from the Exchequer.  It does not confer on them the right to get that money and one wonders whether in fact the sort of money they are going to need in 1982 on present indications will be available to them.  I hope it will be, because the taxpayer will get better value from the money disbursed through Fóir Teoranta than they will through some of the other methods whereby certain public moneys are being spent at present.  Too often the public at large and many companies themselves think that money is the source of restoring a company to health. Frequently it is not, and I think Fóir Teoranta themselves have made this very point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A high proportion of the failures in Irish industry over the years has been attributable to poor quality management, poor industrial relations on both sides of the fence and, very frequently, to poor or non-existent marketing.  When companies who are patently incompetent in terms of doing their job find themselves in a loss situation and seek assistance from Fóir Teoranta, I am sure that Fóir Teoranta have frequently found the difficulty that they know perfectly well that an injection of further funds will only put off the evil day.  I often feel &mdash; and I think <Col N="1618" /> the Joint Oireachtas Committee felt it too &mdash; that the deficiencies of many of these companies should be highlighted to a greater extent and that we should not think a simple injection of money will make any long-term contribution to such a company.</P>
    <P>This body have proved themselves to be important and useful during the nine years of their existence in their present form.  All current indications are that 1982 will be their busiest and most important year ever.  I reiterate what Deputy Gene Fitzgerald has said in regard to the present unemployment figures, the highest ever known in the history of the State. These figures have increased very substantially in recent months.  I contrast what the present Tánaiste had to say on this subject six or 12 months ago with the situation existing today, what he said then with what he is saying now.  I take it that there is on his part and on the part of the Government a fatalistic acceptance that 130,000 is only the start of the climb up the ladder and that it is simply a question of time until our unemployment figures reach 140,000 and subsequently 150,000.  The only real question exercising the mind of anybody on the Government side is whether a halt may come to the climb in the figure before or after the figure of 160,000 unemployed is achieved, if that is the word to use.</P>
    <P>While I know my two colleagues want to talk in some detail about the position in regard to Clondalkin, I reiterate what Deputy Fitzgerald has said.  The fact that the industry is gone is not a total surprise to everybody but we had the spectacle last Friday of the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy appearing on television and saying that the situation looked hopeful and bright, that prospects were reasonable and that he had every confidence about the future of the plant; on the following Monday afternoon a liquidator was put in.  It is significant, unhappily, that it is a liquidator and not a receiver because quite clearly the intention of the group is to liquidate the business.  The plant could only be re-started by someone else buying it and that would be after an interval. In all the circumstances I would not be <Col N="1619" /> very optimistic and it was very irresponsible of the Minister of State to take the line he did within the past few days.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a further extension of the rescue committee in the Department which was extended about a year or 18 months ago to include a number of other agencies.  That committee used to meet fortnightly but as this recession became more serious they had to meet weekly.  They had their finger on the pulse of the more ailing patients in Irish industry because they had a list of between 40 and 90 such enterprises, depending on how sick the various patients were.  They reviewed each of those cases at regular intervals.  Before I left office it was a very representative committee involving people from the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, the Department of Finance, the Department of Labour, the IDA, Fóir Teoranta, the ICC and CTT.  They have a very clear picture of the causes of so many failures in industry and I had it in mind to ask the committee to publish, without going into details about individual firms where that might prove embarrassing, a six-monthly account of the state of ailing firms in Irish industry, why they were ailing, how the problems might be overcome and how they might have been prevented from getting into such a difficult situation.  Pure finance is only one of several reasons why they are in difficulties.  The publication by the committee of a synopsis of their findings in relation to a broad number of these businesses would make very interesting reading because frequently the reasons are quite different from the public perception of them.  It would enable other firms in various industries to avoid the same pitfalls.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  Unfortunately it is very timely and I hope that Fóir Teoranta will not be short of funds in the coming 12 months because all the indications are that they will need more money than ever before.  By and large the State has got good value from what Fóir Teoranta have done.  The average cost of saving a job is substantially below the average cost of creating one.  With the highest ever unemployment figures and resigned <Col N="1620" /> acceptance on the part of the Government that the figures will climb higher and that they cannot or will not do much about it, one thing they can do is give every possible assistance to the body whose affairs we are now discussing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and congratulate Fóir Teoranta on their excellent work on behalf of the nation during the nine years of their existence. It is unfortunate that their services and expertise will be more necessary in the period ahead than at any other time in our history.  This morning we heard that the figure of unemployed is now 129,211, the highest ever.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the point made by Deputy O'Malley regarding the commitment to provide this money.  We have heard much talk since the change of Government about the unacceptable level of borrowing of the previous administration.  The Minister of State has been the most vocal in this cry.  I should like a commitment from him to the House, to the workers and to industry that the necessary moneys will be provided, not only by way of borrowing, in the grave period ahead so that industries in trouble will be assisted and jobs saved.</P>
      <P>Fóir Teoranta have been doing an excellent job but I foresee a difficulty in the path of their progress.  It is that in too many cases their assistance is called for when the fate of the company has been sealed, when the receiver is at the door. It is like closing the door when the horse has bolted.  I appeal to the Minister of State to consult with industry with a view to giving companies the message that the earlier the call goes to Fóir Teoranta the greater will be the possibility of saving the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta are only one of the agencies which are designed to assist industries.  There are the ICC, the IDA and CTT, all with marketing expertise in both the export and the domestic markets. There is also the Irish Goods Council.  As I have said, I do not want to see Fóir Teoranta in the future being called in when companies are beyond rescue. They should be called in to protect employment in industry much earlier.  It <Col N="1621" /> is not all about money.  It is also about management and industrial relations from the factory floor to top management.  It is about marketing design.  If they are not called in at an early stage Fóir Teoranta do not get a fair opportunity to assist industries in the way they would like to.  From this point of view I think the organisation should be renamed because at the moment when word goes around that Fóir Teoranta have been called in to assist in industry the competitors of such an industry, the colleagues in the CII and the FUE too readily assume that the company concerned are suffering from some terminal disease.  Therefore, I suggest that the image of Fóir Teoranta should be changed so that they can be seen more as an assistance rather than a rescue agency.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta have another important role in co-operation with other State agencies.  Earlier in the year we as a Government entered into negotiations with the ICTU to discuss the setting up of sectoral committees to examine problems that exist and others that will arise in the future possibly.  Fóir Teoranta have an important role to play in that examination and I should be obliged if the Minister would let us know if such examinations are being proceeded with.  Now with unemployment at a record level and the Government's acceptance that it will rise even further, it is time for an over-view of industrial problems in the different sectors rather than to look at each company individually.  It is time for a comprehensive sectoral over-view.</P>
    <P>The need for this can be seen particularly when we look at the position at Clondalkin.  Deputy Lenihan will be going into this in greater detail later. Today I was disturbed and disappointed to hear a Labour Member, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, talking with such a level of acceptance of the situation at Clondalkin, acceptance of this loss of jobs.  As well, we had a show of irresponsibility by the Minister of State, Deputy E. Collins, last Friday when he gave us and the Clondalkin workers the clear impression that the difficulties in the company had been overcome and that the future was relatively bright.  That kind of thinking typifies <Col N="1622" /> the whole attitude of this Government who have been talking in figures but do not consider people.  Nearly 500 people are involved in Clondalkin and they deserve better than the attitude displayed last week by the Minister, Deputy Collins.</P>
    <P>In the industrial sense, 1982 will be a very difficult year and therefore the efforts of the experts in all State agencies will have to be concentrated as never before on the protection of existing jobs and the creation of new jobs.  Our young people leaving school must have something better to face than the prospects of spending years in the dole queues.  I appeal to the Minister of State, even at this late stage, to get his party leader, the Minister for Industry and Energy to show some concern and interest in the Department for which he has responsibility.  He should ask the Minister to show the same level of commitment to job creation, job protection and job maintenance as was the hallmark of his predecessor in the Department responsible for industry.</P>
    <P>What we have seen so far of the performance of the Minister for Industry and Energy is a matter of grave concern to industrialists and workers.  It is a matter of considerable concern to the various agencies for which he is responsible.  Our young unemployed people deserve better than what they are getting from the Government.  The Government have accepted an unemployment figure of 129,000 and that the situation will get worse.  A discussion I heard on radio last night about the unemployment figures terrified me.  I was frightened to hear a comment that we can never again aim to achieve full employment.  That sort of fatalistic approach about our future is something Fianna Fáil have always refused to accept.  We have the agencies and the expertise and what we need is the drive and motivation.  The Government are not giving the motivation and I appeal to the Minister of State to make some effort to do this.  In his reply the Minister should let us hear a commitment that the money will be made available, not just an increase in the level of the borrowing power of Fóir Teoranta from £35 million to £70 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill which extends the borrowing limits of Fóir Teoranta from £35 million to £70 million.  To that extent the Bill is acceptable.  The reality is, of course, that one does not get the £70 million by writing that figure into legislation.  I hope the Minister of State will tell the House about the reality of the financial backing, and its availability, to Fóir Teoranta bearing in mind the draw that will be on their funds to cope with the serious unemployment problem we have.  We have seen the unemployment figures rising to 130,000 today.  Fóir Teoranta, with the IDA and the Industrial Credit Company, formed the three spurs which seek to stimulate in a financial and advisory sense industries that get into difficulty.  It is important that an early warning attitude be adopted by State agencies and industries because there has been a tendency to approach Fóir Teoranta at a late stage, thinking only of the agency as a rescue body.  It is much more than that.  There is a lot more expertise available to Fóir Teoranta and it should not be considered merely as a rescue agency.</P>
      <P>The more effective the early warning system in relation to an industry's difficulties is, the better it will be all round. The closer the monitoring arrangements of Fóir Teoranta, the IDA and the Industrial Credit Company with industries on a sectoral basis, the better for everybody. There is no question but that it can be a frustrating business seeking to put a company that has gone off the rails back into operation.  The important thing is to try to get it right while it is still on the rails, to be present when the slowing down process starts and, while the company is on the rails, to get in early and endeavour to rectify matters.  I should like to hear from the Minister of State about the effectiveness of the early warning system that exists between the Department, the three agencies concerned and industries on a sectoral basis.  That in an important aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important aspect is referred to in the annual report of An Fóir Teoranta, the importance that body places on the management services unit. <Col N="1624" /> I agree with that.  It is not just a question of Fóir Teoranta supplying finance, important as that is.  It is important to ensure that expert advice and consultancy advice in the various areas, financial and marketing, is made available at an early stage to a company which may be slowing down but may be in a position to get on to another track and pick up speed again.  This is essentially a management problem but I should like to hear from the Minister of State on the progress that has been made in this regard.  The report states that Fóir Teoranta have strengthened their management services unit.  I welcome that move and I hope the unit continues to expand because there is a real necessity for such advice to be given to any firm that is slowing down.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there is serious dismay at present about Clondalkin Paper Mills, an industry which in many ways represents in microcosm the problems facing Irish industry.  This is a long and well established firm which is part of a group of public quoted companies employing 1,250 people.  In fact, almost 500 are employed in the paper mill operation.  Those employees have been given notice, a liquidator has been appointed and the whole operation is now threatened.  In that industry there is a large reservoir of skills and it has existed in Clondalkin for many years.  The threat to this industry means a real social problem because if one looks in a fatalistic way at the liquidation one cannot help but see it as representing the disposal of skills that have been accumulated over the years. Some of the employees have 37 years experience with the company.  The average is 14 years and that is quite high. There is a pool of expertise and skills at every level, from worker to management, and they are in danger.</P>
    <P>I intervene in this debate in order to get a constructive attitude going.  My information is that the appointment of a liquidator may not mean the end provided the Government, through the State agencies, adopt a positive approach.  I appeal to the Minister of State to tell his colleàgues who are charged with responsibility in this area, particularly the leader of his party, the Tánaiste, that this is a <Col N="1625" /> serious matter which cannot be approached in an off-hand manner as it has been dealt with so far.  I can recall that as Minister responsible for Forestry I made timber supplies available to another Clondalkin operation at giveaway prices in order to maintain employment.  The present managing director approached me and we facilitated him in every respect.  That sort of approach should be adopted by the Government to the Clondalkin group.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister of State comment on the report in the business and finance section of <i>The Irish Times</i> of today, 10 November?  It reveals a disturbing state of affairs as far as the Government attitude and help are concerned.  I quote from the third paragraph:</P>
    <P>At the same time the owners of the paper mill, the publicly-quoted Clondalkin Group, issued a statement saying that the net cash effect on the group of the assistance offered by the IDA as an incentive to keep the mill open amounted &ldquo;to zero over the next six months and a negative cash flow of £550,000 arises at the end of fifteen months on installation of new equipment&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I read that because it seems to indicate, to put it mildly, a very negative attitude if we are talking in terms of a pittance of money concerned solely with the subsidisation of the interest rate. I see that that figure is put at different levels in different papers, so perhaps the Minister would clarify that.  The figure mentioned in the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning is £300,000 in 1983, and the figure in <i>The Irish Times</i> is slightly higher. I would like some precise information on that.  It appears to be a niggardly contribution on foot of very serious difficulties. If it is merely a matter of subsidising the interest rate over a period and is contingent on the company itself investing £2 million in new equipment, that on that basis there will be an interest subsidy of £300,000 in 1983, it is little or no help. <Col N="1626" /> That has been rejected by the company. The company apparently regard the Government as not being serious in making that type of offer in face of a very serious problem compounded by the imports of basic materials that have to be paid for in dollars, compounded by high energy costs and other problems.  There are problems but they cannot be faced up to in that sort of niggardly manner particularly when the company offer a certain positive contribution towards a solution of the problem.  I would like to deal with that and I would like to hear the Minister of State comment on it.  I quote from the statement of the company in this morning's <i>Irish Independent:</i></P>
      <P>With 470 jobs threatened, Mr. Henry Lund, Managing Director of the Clondalkin Group, said the appointment of a liquidator did not prevent a rescue move, but that his firm would like to see an element of &ldquo;risk sharing&rdquo; in any new structure.</P>
      <P>This comes down to the nub of what I intended to say.  I agree with the managing director, Mr. Lund, in that respect. There is no point in talking about an interest subsidy next year contingent on very substantial investment by the company.  Unless the State itself participates in an equity manner in this firm I do not see any positive way out.  Unless there is a risk-bearing on the part of one of the agencies that I referred to, the Industrial Credit Company, Fóir Teoranta or the IDA, or a combination of all three, there is no real way out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expertise is there.  I respectfully suggest that one does not have to wait for the formation of the Industrial Development Corporation about which much noise has been made.  It was part of the Gaiety Theatre presentation and has been talked about by the Minister of State and his party leader as being the panacea for all the problems.  Here is a classical example of the sort of problems that the State should be dealing with by way of direct investment, not by way of subsidising loans.  The State should, through one of these agencies, take on some of the risk-bearing aspect.   That is the way forward.  To judge by the statement <Col N="1627" /> made by the managing director, as quoted in the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning, he is willing to talk business along those lines with representatives of the State agencies.  That is what State involvement is all about.  This problem presents a real challenge, particularly to the Labour Party who talk so much about State involvement.  Here is a chance for the State to get involved in an industry that is basically sound.  It would be a tragedy if this country got out of the whole pulp processing and paper industry.  If this company closes down that would be the net effect because this company represents the highest degree of expertise and technological ability available in this State at the moment in this area.  There is a positive recommendation already on record from a group composed of representatives of the Forestry Division of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and the IDA advocating substantial State investment in this very area.  Far from allowing this type of industry to deteriorate and become extinct, that report of the IDA and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry stated that the Clondalkin Group was, by reason of our timber resources the nearest approach to a vertically organised pulp processing industry here.  But the main lynchpin of that group, which is the paper mill itself, is being allowed to become extinct by way of liquidation.</P>
    <P>We should look ahead and regard Ireland as having a real future and being able to absorb those coming onto the labour market in the years ahead. Looked at in that way it would be unthinkable to see a major sector industry such as this being doomed to extinction.  I know there are problems and difficulties.  I know the sort of money that is involved.  I know the sort of costs involved.  But I am optimistic enough to believe that they are temporary although they put this industry at a certain disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> similar industries in other countries.  I know there are international difficulties with regard to this industry but if the Minister of State would have a look at this report published about 18 months ago he will see that there are <Col N="1628" /> very real long-term expectations which show that there is real hope and optimism for this type of industry because of the availability of timber resources which we have here and which represent such an advantage in any vertically organised pulp processing industry and would cater for newsprint, which has not been touched here yet, and the whole range of paper products.</P>
    <P>The biggest single asset we have is our timber products.  We could even incorporate timber supplies as a zero contribution to such an industrial undertaking and wipe out any cost except the cost of harvesting as far as such an industry was concerned.  It would be a question of mobilising the expertise of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry to accept such a situation of a no-profit aspect as far as timber supplies are concerned, to make the timber available to such a pulp processing complex free except for the cost of harvesting.  I realise that the timber supply aspect is not involved in this paper mill operation which is dependent at the moment on imported raw materials.  But that is part of the overall conceptual approach that the IDA and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry had in the report published 18 months ago.  It is optimistic on the long-term prospects by reason of our timber materials now coming on stream and which will continue to come on stream into the eighties and the nineties.  Here is a classical example where we have the nucleus of a pulp processing industry.  We have the skills and the expertise on the ground. There are financial difficulties that undoubtedly will exist in the short term; but on all the assessments of the two relevant Government agencies &mdash; the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and the IDA &mdash; there are very real and positive medium and long-term prospects.  Surely this is a classic case for the practical implementation of the sort of thinking which the Labour Party said they had in regard to the Industrial Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>There is no point in putting labels on ideas.  In the Gaiety Theatre it may have sounded grand to talk about a new Industrial Development Corporation but <Col N="1629" /> within the State agencies to which I have referred, the skill and expertise already exist and finance can be obtained, provided the Government have the will to provide it, to do this job in a positive way.  They should do it by way of equity risk-bearing investment, plan and calculate how it should be done and go ahead and do it.  I regard Clondalkin Paper Mills as a test case of the bona fides of this Government, in particular of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>In the statement which was issued by the company there is almost a positive invitation by the managing director stating he would like to see an element of risk sharing in any new structure.  If there is an involvement by the State in the company it should not be represented in a niggardly fashion by reducing interest charges or wiping them out for next year for the paltry amount of £300,000.  In fact, they propose to do this in 1983, not even next year.  That is the only offer on record so far, to give an interest subsidy in 1983, contingent on the firm going ahead with an investment of £2 million. The State should recognise that this represents the nucleus of what could be a major technological industry which we do not have at present in the pulp processing area.  This firm have already accumulated skills and expertise which can be expanded by way of a joint venture between the company and the State.</P>
    <P>The will and the mood is there on offer in the statement by the managing director.  This surely represents an instance in which the State should be directly involved in a positive and constructive manner.  I should like to hear the views of the Minister of State on some of the suggestions I have made in regard to this industry which is at risk at the moment and which represents a test case of the bona fides of the Government in regard to employment and economic planning. It is also a test case for the Minister of State personally who has this responsibility in regard to economic planning and who will find in his own Department planning documents concerning what I am talking about in regard to the timber processing industry and especially to the pulp processing aspect of it.  To put it <Col N="1630" /> colloquially, he should get dug into this matter.  What constructive contribution has he to make in this matter?</P>

      <P>I have some difficulty in replying to the various points raised by Deputy Lenihan, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald and Deputy O'Malley because we resume Private Members' Business at 6.20 p.m.</P>
      <P>I have two constraints with regard to the Clondalkin Paper Mills, apart from the time element.  Discussions are currently proceeding between Clondalkin Paper Mills and Fóir Teoranta.  As Deputy Lenihan and his colleagues are well aware, continuous discussions have been going on between the company and the IDA, quite apart from any meetings which have taken place between the management, unions and the Minister of State, Deputy E. Collins.  However, it is misleading to suggest that the Government are in any way holding back, negligent or tardy in their anxiety to assist this company.  As Deputy Lenihan knows well, there is considerable restraint about revealing financial details in relation to any company.  I notice that in all the newspapers considerable data has been given and figures vary from £5 million to £10 million in terms of moneys which might be sought by way of package or otherwise, to rescue the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no prior notification about the appointment of a liquidator yesterday to the IDA, who might have expected to have been informed since they are deeply involved, to Fóir Teoranta who could be regarded as having a direct interest in the matter or to the Department of Industry and Energy.  The appointment of a liquidator by this company came as a complete surprise, especially since negotiations and discussions were in train.  It is reprehensible that the management of any company, without prior consultation with the trade unions concerned, in this case unions which represented 470 workers, and without bringing in on a confidential basis senior staff of the IDA, Fóir Teoranta and of the Department, or without alerting the Ministers directly <Col N="1631" /> concerned, simply sprang it for reasons which perhaps will enfold.</P>
    <P>I deplore that kind of management of a major company, I resent it, particularly when the IDA have been putting forward a package which could help the company. Since various figures have been bandied about, I want to give one parameter in terms of one aspect.  The management and unions met my colleague, Deputy Collins, on 6 November, because the company announced that they proposed to close the plant in December.  Deputy Collins outlined in details to the company and the unions the offer made by the IDA.  Deputy Collins urged the management to resume negotiations and discussions with the IDA and, if necessary with Fóir Teoranta.  He pointed out, and I agree with him, that any question of closure at that stage was premature.  I will elaborate on other aspects of this tomorrow but I want to put on record tonight what happened.  I deplore the bandying about of £5 million and £10 million in the newspapers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of very grave concern that the Minister's contribution to the debate on a matter of great importance to our children and the future of our people should be a bellicose speech with no educational content.  Only a very few minutes were devoted to proposals for the future.  This may be understandable because he has given no real thought to his proposals and is not in any position to develop them.  It has been my experience in this House over the years that when a speaker has nothing to say on the subject under debate, or wishes to avoid saying anything of substance, the way out is to indulge in shadow-boxing. On a matter of very great import for our children it is not good enough that a Minister for Education should adopt such a procedure.</P>
      <P>The Minister has the temerity to accuse us of speaking of matters in this debate other than the welfare of children.  I am more than willing to have my speech and that of the Minister studied by impartial observers and to abide by their decision as to which of us showed most concern for children's education.  The greater part of my speech was concerned solely with the damage to the education of our four to six year olds arising from the Minister's decision.  I use the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; here in its broadest context.  While I referred to teacher unemployment, I related it to the detrimental effect on education resulting from fewer teachers in our schools in the future and to the matter of equity and fair play in respect of students in colleges of education, particularly as the Department of Education controls entry to such colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Minister's decision was made for the purpose of effecting a saving and nobody here is so foolish as to believe that he will spend that saving, and much more besides, on the development of a pre-school system.  There is no doubt that we will see one or two symbolic gestures by the Minister to lend a helping hand to those he expects to support him in the lobbies.  There is no doubt in anybody's mind here, irrespective of what side of the House he or she is on, but that nothing of substance will emerge.</P>
      <P>We have a curriculum which, at infant level, contains a high degree of informality and flexibility.  Great progress has been made in the development of the child's intellectual capacity through the operation of this curriculum in recent years.  The need now is for more teachers, more facilities, more equipment at infant level.  Given this, the Minister can be assured that he will be conferring real benefit on our children and ensuring their future well-being and that of the country.</P>
      <P>I again appeal to the Minister to withdraw his decision and to allow children of four years of age to enrol at infant level for the benefit of their education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What I wish to say on this subject I probably can say in three minutes and will probably satisfy nobody by saying it.  It is that, far from there being a need, or a good reason, for raising the age at which children are allowed to enter <Col N="1634" /> school, far too little is being done for the pre-five group, to educate children at what is now regarded as their most impressionable age.  Why we should have this proposal to raise the age is a puzzle. If it is money, it is a sad misinterpretation to consider it worthwhile for the saving it may make.  If, on the other hand, it is being deplored merely because teachers might have less employment, or fewer of them might be employed, this, in itself &mdash; while something to be regretted &mdash; is not the reason we should give either. Whether it is a convenience or an inconvenience for the parents that they should or should not be allowed to send their children to school before four or five years is not the important aspect in any sense of the word, despite the fact that it may be of particular concern to many parents.  Far too little has been said about the children.  Money, parents and teachers have been much in the news, much debated upon and commented upon and far too little has been spoken about the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My knowledge of what might be done for children between three and six years of age may be totally inadequate but it is now commonly held by expert authorities that their most impressionable age is between three and six.  It is also true that languages come to children more easily at an earlier age than at any other time in their lives.  If there is anything that we as a people lack, it is multi-lingualism.  That is very noticeably absent from us as we now go abroad more and mix more than we might have done in the past.  We heard a cry over the years that bi-lingualism was, in fact, inhibiting our children's education.  I was brought up believing that.  Now I find, when I go abroad, that three, four and five languages are not unusual and, in fact, three and four are the norm.  For instance in Belgium, many people are fluent in five, six, seven, eight and nine languages and are learning a tenth.  I suggest that, instead of talking about raising the age, we should be trying to utilise the years up to five when the ordinary curriculum starts.  We should concentrate on exposing these children to various languages, starting with our own language, Irish, and going on from <Col N="1635" /> that to some of the modern continental languages.  In that way, we would give the children a groundwork which would be easily built upon long afterwards, to their very great benefit.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with those who say that our children are leaving school too early at the moment.  I may be out of date but when they do leave school they have not even the basics of education.  What is wrong?  I do not believe the fault lies with the teachers.  It must lie with the curriculum.  It is almost true to say that many students on leaving school cannot add two and two together, or spell anything other than their own names correctly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, the importance of this motion has been emphasised by this side of the House.  It has been emphasised that people should consider, in aid of the Minister for Education, supporting this motion before the House.  This proposal is the this end of the wedge and if it were to succeed it would be disastrous.  In passing my motion the Deputies in this House will have strengthened the hand of the Minister for Education when other attacks are made on the education budget.  It is well known to every Member of this House that the red herring has an honoured position in parliamentary debate, covering weak argument.  We had plenty of red herrings in this debate. We had the suggestion that circular 24 of <Col N="1636" /> 1981 was introduced for the better organisation of our schools.  Anybody who argued thus was resolved to die in the last ditch of prevarication.  Corporal punishment was dangled as a red herring to keep people's minds off what was being done.  The Combat Poverty group were introduced by way of a very deeply smelling red herring and the Working Party on Child Care were also introduced.  I contend that not since Biddy Mulligan was selling the fish at Patrick Street corner have we seen so many red herrings around the city of Dublin.</P>
      <P>We will not allow the Minister to get away with the red herring.  We maintain &mdash; we are fully convinced of this &mdash; that the Minister for Finance in October attacked the education budget by changing the rules of admission to primary schools.  This was on 1 October not 1 September, so that the problem did not arise at the beginning of the school year. People could be gradually edged into the situation which the new circular 24/81 was bringing about.  This was a clever move because the anger of the parents would have swept the Minister for Education and the Department of Education away on a tide of anger had this thing been attempted a month earlier.</P>
      <P>The philosophy behind it was to save money at the expense of the children of the country.  I contend that this barbarous philosophy in the offspring of &ldquo;cold-hearts and muddy understandings&rdquo; and nothing else.  When the Minister for Education made his contribution last week he said he did not have any consultation.  Why did he not have consultation?  He did not have any consultation because he was afraid he would be opposed.  This is a new definition of parliamentary democracy.  The Minister would not give an opportunity to people to discuss their vital interests, people such as parents, teachers or unions.  The ukase comes and that is it.  Do not consult lest there be opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our position is as outlined last week. There is an eight year period laid down for primary schools, a carefully constructed curriculum, which was worked on for many years, which was tested in the schools.  The first module of that eight <Col N="1637" /> year curriculum, consisting of the first two years, covers the infant period.  The best psychological training and insight went into the construction of that curriculum.  We have the curriculum and we have the trained teachers.  That is very important.  Those teachers are trained in the light of that curriculum, with the objective of putting that curriculum into practice and with the teaching of it in view.</P>
    <P>We have a two-year module, a careful curriculum and trained teachers.  What are we being offered?  The House knows from what we heard last week that the children are not being offered anything. The amendment to the amendment, the botch of the botch to which I referred last week was a highly insulting one for our teachers.  Deputy Power was perfectly in his rights when he resented it last week. He was expressing the views of the vast majority of the people in the profession and outside it.  If Deputy Kemmy and Deputy Browne knew what was going on in the country for the past decade there is no way they would put down this insulting extension to the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get involved in the definition.  This is taken with the Government amendment now. Anybody who says that the programme we have now is damaging the pupils in the schools does not know what is going on.  It is a common experience of parents that the children are distraught if at any time they have to miss a day in school because they are so pleased with the type of education they are getting and the way they are being handled at the infant level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I read into the record of the House the considered view of the Department of Education on this proposition in 1980.  I said the views were considered <Col N="1638" /> views, they were measured views, they were civilised views but, above all, they were professional views.  There was no professional input into the decision of circular 24/81.  I challenge the Minister for Education on this.  I know the Department of Education and unless his Fine Gael appointees in the Department of Education have those views I know the permanent officials both educationalists and administrators in that Department do not hold them.</P>
    <P>There is a mention of positive discrimination in the area of those who are socially deprived.  There is positive discrimination in this circular, 24/81, but it is against those who are from the socially disadvantaged areas and against those who most need the stimulus in the beginning of their career in primary education. Deputy Faulkner referred to the Rutland Street experiment.  That has proved that the stimulation is good, that it makes for educational advance in those areas. When you lock the school doors on them you are depriving them of that stimulus. It is hard on the socially deprived who want to develop social and intellectual skills.  It is hard on people from remote areas.</P>
    <P>I could mention the problem about transport, which was mentioned in this debate.  When children of four years of age are taken off the quota for school transport there is a danger that school transport will be discontinued.  There is also very serious positive discrimination against parents where both parents have to work.  This was adverted to.  I cannot expand on all those areas but Members of the House know and the people who are in the educational world know that when both parents are working it is very necessary to apply educational stimulus early on.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I would like to emphasise because it has not been emphasised in the debate.  We were, in following what obtained up to 30 September 1981, providing a facility for parents who are free to use it as they wish.  There is total freedom on the part of the parents whether they should send their children to school.  There is not an element of <Col N="1639" /> compulsion in that regard and there is no traumatic effect.</P>
    <P>In the programmes of Fine Gael and Labour for the general election we were told that the improvement of the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools was very important.  They did not tell the people that the way they would improve the ratio was by the expulsion of the innocents from school.  This is a very simple one.  If you keep putting them out you can have a one teacher, one pupil, a one and one, situation.  When we were improving the pupil-teacher ratio we were taking in the four years olds and year by year, including 1981, we were training teachers to bring down the pupil-teacher ratio.  I found classes of over 40 numbered between 3,000 and 4,000 and, as far as I know, it was not more than about 650 when I left office last June.  I want to put that on the record because it has been peddled around in the House and outside it, through the media and in the newspapers that we fell down on this particular programme.  That is not in accordance with the facts.</P>
    <P>I gather the Minister for Education talked to the Labour Party.  What bargain did they get?  What bargain did Deputy Browne and Deputy Kemmy get when they went to see the Minister for Education on that afternoon?  A damn bad bargain, with due respect.  Senator Many Robinson would not buy it for one, and I am sure other members of the Labour Party are very unhappy with it.  I suspect the Chairman of the Labour Party could not possibly but agree that what he was getting in respect of four year old entrants to primary school was a damn bad bargain.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner mentioned that the Minister spent one-and-half-minutes saying what would substitute for what existed up to 30 September 1981.  He said a national register of pre-schools is to be established.  He said the Department of Health would provide inspectors to inspect them.  Education be damned. Education out the door.  The Department of Health were to come in and that would be it.  Wait for it.  The other big bargain <Col N="1640" /> was that operators would be trained for the pre-schools.</P>

      <P>He mentioned areas of deprivation and disadvantage.  Four times during the course of that debate I asked: how much?  Once Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn asked: how much? We got no answer.  The House can draw its own conclusion from that.  It is not merely the Labour Party, the Fine Gael backbenchers, Deputy Kemmy and Deputy Browne who are concerned.  The children of the country, and especially the children of those who are married among the 129,211 unemployed about whom we read this morning, are the ones who will suffer.</P>
      <P>I want to reiterate what Deputy Faulkner said about the substance of my contribution on the last occasion in this House.  Eighty-five per cent of my speech was on the educational aspect of circular 24/81 and 15 per cent was about teachers' posts and the plight of the trainee teachers.  I challenge the House to examine the record on that.  Deputy Faulkner said the Department of Education have a special responsibility for the people they take into training in the colleges of education. The Department of Education took them in with a view to using them in our teaching force.  They are not entitled to wash their hands of them.  That is a fact which cannot be controverted.</P>
      <P>There is an obligation on the Department of Education to provide employment for the 300 teachers I put into training in 1978 to be extra to those required for new schools and extra to those required to substitute for people retiring in 1981.  There will be 300 more in 1982 because I did not stop recruiting in 1978 and next summer people will also be coming out of the training colleges.</P>

      <P>Unprincipled and fascistic are the only words I can use in this regard. The Minister backed down on two-teachers schools.  He backed down on minority schools.  He backed down on pre-schools.  He did not send out any circular about pre-schools with the original circular.  He backed down on the handicapped.  I would ask him to back down on his amendment.  Who supports him?  The parents?  No.  The boards?  No. The INTO?  No. The Labour Teachers' Association who are picketing?  No.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions?  No. Dublin Corporation?  No.  Senator Mary <Col N="1642" /> Robinson?  No.  Will the Minister call on Deputy Browne and Deputy Kemmy? Let the rabbits hear his call.  He may get support from a journalist he put on a State board, which prompts me to remember Boss Croker's definition of honesty: a man who when bought stays bought.  He will not get any support from the education people, or the parents. Anybody who supports this motion is doing a good job not merely for education, but for the Minister who is starting out on his career in the Department of Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the economic policies of the Coalition Government which have greatly increased prices and the cost of living and which are causing severe hardship for social welfare recipients and those on lower incomes and calls on the Government to take special measures immediately to safeguard the welfare and the living standards of these sections of the community this winter.</P>
      <P>The Coalition Government's economic policies were in the first instance based on a false premise and constitute a recipe for economic disaster, for disruption and for gross inequity.  The Taoiseach, as we know, exaggerated our economic difficulties and over-reacted grossly in the remedies which he took.  One example of these remedies here tonight was just narrowly passed by this House, narrowly passed because it was a remedy purely and simply to save money at the expense of the education sector.  This is only one of a long list of similar propositions by this Government which will be contested in this House by us.  Indeed, we will appeal to the Labour Party and the Independent Members to recognise what is really happening here with this Government and the policies they are pursuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most insidious and disturbing aspects of this Government's policy is the fact that it is shifting so much of the burden from taxation generally to indirect taxes.  The Coalition began their term with a budget that was unnecessary and was aimed at raising unprecedented taxes not in this year but in the coming year, 1982.  The purpose of this budget, <Col N="1650" /> which contributed so little to this year, can be seen only when we look into the context of next year.  These indirect taxes are intended to collect sufficient money in 1982 to help offset the enormous cost of reducing direct taxation.  For example, the 50 per cent increase in the 10 per cent rate of VAT will bring an extra yield of £188 million in 1982.  One would ask if the savings which are being effected currently in education were necessary at all when you have that kind of money coming into the Government coffers next year, when this is in effect an equivalent of £268 per annum from each PAYE taxpayer.</P>
    <P>One of the most unacceptable aspects of the Coalition policies is that the burden of this taxation will fall most heavily on the middle and lower income families.  In simple terms these families are heavy consumers of goods and services, but because of their lower incomes and untaxable social welfare benefits they pay very little tax and stand to gain little from the reduction in direct taxation.  These are the people to whom we want to address ourselves here tonight particularly.  The Coalition's shift from direct taxation to indirect taxation will favour the rich and increase the burden on the poor.  It will create more poverty in Ireland and will lead to greater unemployment.  I believe that most of even the economic commentators at this stage are coming to recognise the validity of this argument.  The Coalition have placed the indirect taxes on the normal household necessities instead of restricting them to luxuries.  Of course, they did this because the tax yield from luxuries would be too small in Ireland.  The band of luxuries is relatively small in relation to the area covered by the 10 per cent VAT rate, which is the area of normal household consumption.</P>
    <P>The effects of these regressive indirect taxes are numerous.  They will involve heavier taxes on the poor and on larger families in particular.  The VAT increase is a good example since it increases the cost of school books, medicines and household goods.  They also increase inflation.  The recent budget package <Col N="1651" /> added 5 per cent to the CPI and next year's package will, it is estimated, add a further 8 per cent to the CPI.  Therefore the Coalition have themselves increased prices by 13 per cent and consequently lessened the prospects for job creation. The indications now are that next year's inflation will be from 22 to 25 per cent as a result mainly of these policies.  Indirect taxes result in people with the same incomes paying different amounts of tax according to their consumption patterns. Therefore, when the taxes are placed on non-luxury goods, as they have been by the Coalition, they fall most heavily on the middle and lower income families. Also they hit the one-income families harder than where both parents are working. In this way they are one of the economic instruments which force both parents to work, and they militate against the traditional Irish family.</P>
    <P>The shift to heavier indirect taxation will create a greater divergence between the North and the South of Ireland by raising prices here relative to the North. The resulting increase in cross-Border smuggling already apparent will lead to less production here and consequently fewer jobs.</P>
    <P>One of the most obvious aspects of the Coalition policies, which is already coming to light, is the whole question of rising prices.  The Coalition's honeymoon is over.  The gestation has run its course and a new cost of living monster has been born.  This monster has easily recognisable distinguishing marks.  Families and those on lower incomes will know them well.  They include Government-led price increases in household requirements, medicines, schoolbooks and materials. VAT is one of the prime examples of this, with the increase from 10 per cent to 15 per cent.  They also include excessive increases in transport costs through Coalition petrol, motoring and CIE cost increases.  If we look at the increase in the price of petrol from 1 June to 16 October we see that the price of a gallon of petrol in June was £1.90 and on 16 October it was £2.26, an increase of 36p. Bottled gas, which surely is one of the most widely used methods of heating now <Col N="1652" /> especially for people on low incomes, has increased from£4.33 on 1 June to £5.94 on 16 October, an increase of£1.61.  A bag of coal increased from £3.50 to £5, an increase of £1.50.  When we look at the ESB we find expecially excessive and unwarranted increases.  Electricity prices have been increased by 25 per cent on com-domestic bills and 29 per cent on commercial accounts.  I pointed to this at the time when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, introduced his budget in July.  He said at that time that the ESB had sought an increase.  The NPC had given them 12.3 per cent, but because there was a delay in the implementation and the questioning of the need for such an increase at this time, he felt that they should be given a 25 per cent increase for a period of not less than a year to recoup what might have been lost to them.</P>
    <P>This 25 per cent increase, which he included almost as an off-the-cuff remark, is now being shown on the normal domestic and commercial bills, except that on commercial bills it works out at 29 per cent.  I have here a bill issued on 3 November which covers the September-October period, the first to include the Coalition increase.  The increase in the general domestic rate is from 3.890 pence per unit to 4.360 pence per unit, a 12 per cent increase.  The fuel variation surcharge goes up from 1.111 pence per unit to 2.017 pence per unit, an increase of 81 per cent.  Even the least involved people in this area will recognise that the fuel variation surcharge should not in that time increase by anything of that order.  Indeed, fuel prices have been relatively stable in that period, as was anticipated.  The ordinary domestic consumer has been faced with this gigantic increase of 82 per cent in ESB bills.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Society of St. vincent de Paul have considerable difficulty in helping people to meet ESB bills and I was quoted a figure of £250,000 which they expend in Dublin as a subsidy on these bills and for some other fuels. They will now come under extreme pressure and at least 25 per cent can be added to that requirement.  There will also be more people in need of assistance.  The <Col N="1653" /> impact of these ESB increases will be very serious for those on lower incomes.</P>
    <P>The ESB accounts published in September show a profit of £6.3 million with £26 million for depreciation and £26 million for amortisation, giving them a cash flow of £58 million.  Notwithstanding that, the Minister for Finance, as part of the Coalition policy on their assumption of office, gave the ESB a 25 per cent increase on their total electricity income of £400 million.  This amounts to an increase of about £100 million.  It is disgraceful and reprehensible.  The average bill of between £60 and £80 will be increased by amounts ranging from £15 to £20 and this is no small addition in view of the other increases which the Coalition have introduced through VAT and other measures.</P>
    <P>This will also have effects on jobs and the provision of employment.  The case of Clondalkin Paper Mills is a classic example.  In the course of the debate on the Finance Bill I mentioned that their electricity bill is £1.5 million per annum and the Government have without any justification allowed a 29 per cent increase.  It is no wonder that this company are faced with a situation in which they will have to let go 470 people.  How could they survive under a Government like this, especially when their energy inputs are so high?  They can point to the fact that their competitors in other countries receive assistance from Government rather than penalties.  This matter is so serious that there should be a public inquiry into the damaging effects on industry and consequently the provision of jobs.  A further increase in unemployment will lead to greater demands on the social welfare services and those who are already at work.  I hope the Independent Members are nothing the consequences of the policies adopted by the Coalition.</P>
    <P>House mortgage interest rates have been increased from 13.15 per cent under Fianna Fáil to 16.25 per cent under the Coalition.  At the same time the 1 per cent interest subsidy given by Fianna Fáil has been removed.  Speaking on a radio programme, the Minister concerned said he did not regard this as a particularly serious situation but there was a rumour <Col N="1654" /> that the rate might go to 18 per cent and in that case they might have to look at the possibility of re-introducing the subsidy.  The matter is already very serious and the Coalition should not have removed the subsidy.  The increase from 13.15 per cent to 16.25 per cent has added £40 a month to repayments on a £20,000 loan over 20 years.  That is the kind of treatment the householder is getting from this Government.</P>
    <P>In one area the Coalition are set for an all-time record during the eighties.  Their cold-blooded economic policies and the shift from direct to indirect taxes will create a new and expanded poor.  Their hare-brained tax plans will leave the 1.5 million people who cannot benefit from their tax plans much worse off because they will have to pay the indirect taxes and the higher prices.  These are the 700,000 social welfare recipients, the 100,000 small farmers, the 350,000 in the lower income group who do not pay tax and the 350,000 who pay already only 25 per cent, giving a total of 1.5 million. These people will constitute a new and expanded poor.</P>
    <P>Before the election the Coalition denied all of those suggestions.  They produced enormous advertisements in the newspapers to prove that they would not increase prices, that they would control them and that we would have a better society if people voted for the Coalition. These appeared under the caption: Fine Gael nail the big lies.  One lie they were nailing &mdash; and it was one big lie nailed &mdash; was that there would be huge increases on petrol, beer and spirits.  Fine Gael gave a commitment that, as far as their economic policies were concerned, they would strictly control the prices of these items.  Even at this stage I do not have to comment on the way these prices have gone, together with quite a few others.</P>
    <P>As far as their commitment in regard to value-added tax was concerned, they adhered to that by not imposing value-added tax on clothing and footwear. However they imposed it on every other conceivable commodity bought for the household as part of the normal weekly package.  They said then that all housewives would not gain from the Fine Gael <Col N="1655" /> proposals for women, that their package would benefit nine out of ten.  I am sure they would like to erase that one now because it will cause enormous difficulty one way or the other.</P>
    <P>Then they contended that with Fine Gael all taxpayers with incomes under £50,000 a year would have more take-home pay.  I suppose if one assumes that the money will be taken from their weekly budget instead of their take-home pay that could be true but certainly they will have less money at the end of the week than heretofore.  There were a number of other commitments given but those are just some relating to prices.  These were the promises this Government made so publicly before coming into office.  In office they turned around and reversed their ideas in that respect.</P>
    <P>One measure mentioned &mdash; which they themselves regarded as a very important election issue &mdash; was the question of the £9.60 con trick, or what might be described as robbing Peter to pay Paula, charging Peter the cost of the transaction. It is now admitted, off the record, by both Fine Gael and Labour that the promise of a weekly payment of £9.60 to the wife who is fulltime in the home brought an extra eight seats to the Fine Gael party, thus enabling them to form a Coalition with Labour and others.  Naturally, with a short run into an election, there was little time to tease out the details of that programme.  Consequently, many people viewed this measure as a family support which would be widely available.  Indeed, the promise given in the Gaiety Theatre document is a very interesting one.  It said in regard to the direct payment of the tax credit in respect of wives working in the family home, that the full amount would be payable even when the present family income fell below £4,000 per annum, thus aiding low income families not liable to tax at present.  That was the commitment given in the Coalition document.  That was their firm commitment, as expressed in the document put to the Labour Party delegates and endorsed by them.  It presented a proposal under which lower income families would benefit along with <Col N="1656" /> widows, old age pensioners, small farmers, the unemployed and the handicapped.  That is the way people interpreted that promise.  What else could it mean?  The only conclusion that could be drawn was that it would mean that widows, old age pensioners, small farmers, the unemployed and the handicapped would also benefit from this proposal, and that this would help to offset, in a major way, the increased indirect taxes for them.  It would also help the small farmer to live with the Coalition-led inflation rate in excess of 20 per cent.  However, we have seen that the policies adopted inevitably would lead to an increase in inflation, the worst possible medicine for the small farmer as he has no way of recouping this in the market place.</P>
    <P>The original Fine Gael manifesto spoke only of £23 million to offset the adverse effects of their package on social welfare beneficiaries.  It was estimated that 280,000 wives would not benefit under the tax credit arrangements.  However, to pay the £9.60 to them each week would cost £140 million.  Hence the lack of credibility on our part of the Gaiety Theatre promise to pay the £9.60 even where the income level was below the tax credit level.  We find it very difficult to accept that this would be applied across the board to ease the burden the indirect taxes will create for those on lower incomes.  If the scheme is to be based on the tax code then those benefits which are taxable only would be included. These would include old age contributory pensions.  Therefore, we could expect the wife of the old age contributory pensioner to receive payment but no other social welfare beneficiaries would receive the £9.60 or, in any event, very few of them.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the situation of Peter and Paula, there are 500,000 wives of whom 100,000 are working.  Therefore potential claimants of the optional £9.60 per week are, at the maximum, 400,000.  How many of these will claim if it is optional? How many will be interested in robbing Peter of £500 or £2,000 tax free allowance for Peter will have his weekly income reduced by £9.60 by virtue of a reduced <Col N="1657" /> tax free allowance of £2,000 so that claimants can call to the post office or whereever else is designated to collect the £9.60 a week on an appropriate voucher? The family, as a whole, will be no better off.  Therefore it will not help in any way to offset the increased indirect tax burden on them.  Of course Peter will have to pay for the administrative cost.  If one is to assume that, at a minimum, some 500 staff would be required then one is talking about £4 million per annum for staff alone not taking into account postage or stationery.  If one takes account of postage at 22p per week for 52 weeks that amounts to £4.75 million overall.  If one includes the cheques and envelopes the total cost for 400,000 per week would exceed £9 million.  Those are the kinds of potential administrative costs involved. Therefore, Peter must pay his wife, Paula, £9.60 a week and carry £9 million to administer the scheme for his wife.  If, of course, he must pay another man's wife as well then his administrative costs will increase correspondingly.  Indeed his personal cost will greatly increase if he has to pay for the Gaiety Theatre promise of £9.60 for all those who would not otherwise qualify.</P>
    <P>This whole situation obviously has upset the civil servants involved.  Here I quote from an article entitled &ldquo;Civil Servants Attack Critics&rdquo; which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Saturday last.  The question raised in this article related to civil servants' efficiency in work and the unproductive nature of some of the work.</P>
    <P>Without naming him, the association singled out ... an assertion by the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Mr. Kelly, earlier this week in which he talked about unproductive civil servants passing paper to one another. &ldquo;Yet it is his Government which insists on hordes of civil servants processing an enormous volume of paperwork just to transfer £9.60 from a working husband to a wife working at home.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The association is particularly upset about this kind of operation which, of course, constitutes merely a circular movement of money from Peter to Paula and will do nothing to offset the burden <Col N="1658" /> on those people in the lower and middle income groups suffering so severely from the effects of this Government's policies which involve a major increase in indirect taxes falling very heavily on them.</P>
    <P>While Fine Gael pursue relentlessly their coldblooded and inhuman economic policies, the Labour Party keep their heads down in a deafening silence. Robert Louis Stevenson said: &ldquo;The cruelest lies are often told in silence.&rdquo;  The deafening silence of the once proud Labour Party tells far more than any words of mine.  They remain silent while the social welfare beneficiaries lose the gains they made under Fianna Fáil. Instead of demanding real increases, they accepted a 3 per cent rise in all rates other than old age pensioners, who got 5 per cent.  As a result, the widow gets 85p per week extra for herself and 25p for each child.  The old age pensioners living alone had their allowances increased by 10p per week, and the dependant of a blind pensioner gets an extra 5p per week.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the living alone allowance for the old age pensioner was increased by 10p per week by this kind and compassionate and sincere Government whose policies we are expected to accept.  The old age pensioner living alone is in particularly difficult circumstances.  It is because of this that such pensioners are given an additional allowance, small and all as it is, but to offer such an elderly person 10p per week to help to offset the kind of increases in costs that I have mentioned, which the Coalition have directly caused, is an insult.  Earlier there was some discussion of the fact that the supplement for the dependants of blind pensioners is 5p per week.  This is similarly derisory and insulting, particularly in this International Year of Disabled Persons.  When told about it, some children say it would not buy a lollipop or an ice cream a week. That is about the size of these increases. They are derisory and must be seen for what they are, a hypocritical sop to sell the Coalition package to the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party remained silent also while education, health and social welfare budgets were drastically cut back. <Col N="1659" /> The school age was raised to save money, for that and no other reason.  It is only the beginning of the process of severe cutbacks in education.  We have seen that despite the lofty sentiments expressed about caring for the mentally handicapped and the aged, projects in these areas have been stopped.  At Kilcornan in County Galway a major project for the mentally handicapped, on which building was due to be started, has been stopped, though the contract had been approved and was awaiting signature.  Money for the project had been provided this year without a Supplementary Estimate.  At Carriglea in Waterford, units comprising 50 beds for mentally handicapped adults lie idle.  The project was completed but not allowed to go into use.  The units had been built, they were ready.  Following studies which had been done in the area of the mentally handicapped, one of the highest priorities is the building of care units for adult people.  Here are some fine modern units being left idle for want of a relatively small amount of money in the last two months of this year, with greater money during the full year of 1982.</P>
    <P>At Ballymun in Dublin, two crisis intervention units for mentally handicapped children were completed but they, too, are lying idle.  At Dundalk a new 112-bed geriatric unit, a day centre for 20 to 25 people and a 40-bed welfare unit for elderly people were due to be begun before the end of the year.  The money had been allocated but it has been withdrawn, apparently, and there is some dispute about it.</P>
    <P>Thanks to pressure from the Fianna Fáil Opposition, old age pensioners, widows and other long-term beneficiaries will be given a double week at Christmas. The Tánaiste and Labour Party Leader, Deputy O'Leary, was forced belatedly into conceding the much-needed Christmas bonus when he and his colleagues in the Coalition should have been demanding an early announcement of the legislation necessary to implement it.</P>
    <P>The Coalition claim that they will advance the incomes of social welfare beneficiaries in real terms, but so far the <Col N="1660" /> reality is far from this.  The double week for Christmas must now be implemented by legislation in the House so that it can be put into operation during the second week in December.  That is a very tight schedule, but because it was introduced last year the system is there and we will give it all our support when it is going through the House.</P>
    <P>The free fuel scheme has been increased from £3 to £4.  I requested the Minister for Finance to have the amount increased to £5 at least, to keep up with the increased cost of a bag of coal.  The price of bottled gas is now £5.94 per cylinder.  Last year we not only increased the amount but we extended the scheme, but the Coalition have said they will only look at the possibilities of further extending the scheme sometime in the future.</P>
    <P>The increases given by the Coalition from 1 October were derisory.  They did not even match the inflation imposed by the Coalition's policies.  Unemployment has now reached 129,000 on the register and because of Coalition policies that figure will increase further during the coming winter.  These policies are doomed to failure.  They will create further greater hardships for those on social welfare benefits and for the middle and lower income groups.  They are disastrous for families and will lead to greater unemployment, rising prices and the creation of a new and expanded poor.  These policies are disastrous for the majority of employees and small farmers and will deal a cruel blow to old age pensioners, widows, the disabled and other less privileged groups.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that we condemn the coldblooded economic policies of Government Minister who have asked us to regard these coldblooded policies as the correct thing for these times.  That is why we condemn these policies and ask the Members of the House to reject the Government's amendment and to support our motion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>1.  To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1661" />&ldquo;Dáil Éireann expresses its confidence in the policies of the Government, as set out in its Programme, to secure social justice for those who are dependent on social welfare.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The proposals of the Government programme in the social field envisage a radical reform of the social welfare system. This will provide a secure and permanent base on which to deal more effectively and in a more sympathetic and enlightened way with the needs of our society.  The proposals contained in the programme provide for action on a number of points.  In the first place the Government are committed to indexation of social welfare benefits thus maintaining the real value of existing payments.  The Government are, however, very much aware that the present level of these payments is inadequate having regard to the cost of the essentials of life and the legitimate aspirations of a modern society.  It is the Government's intention, therefore, to ensure that those dependent on social welfare payments receive a real increase in their incomes.  This will be done notwithstanding the very serious economic difficulties which the Government were confronted with on taking up office.  As the Taoiseach said at the Kilkenny Conference on Poverty last Sunday there is a temptation to take the view that social progress must await the resumption of significant economic growth and that we cannot afford to tackle the issue of poverty.  That temptation will be resisted and it is the Government's firm intention to carry out their social policy commitments in full.  One of the major concerns of the Government is to ensure that no part of the burden of the economic measures which are necessary to set the economy right are borne by those who are dependent on social welfare payments and the necessary measures will at all times be taken to ensure that their position is protected.</P>
    <P>The provision made for social welfare in the July budget demonstrates the Government's determination to protect the situation of those people who depend on social welfare payments and who are <Col N="1662" /> most vulnerable to the effects of economic forces.  The reintroduction of an October increase in payments is a measure of our concern that compensation to social welfare recipients, particularly pensioners who are permanently dependent on the system, should be provided more speedily to offset the effects of rising price levels on their standard of living. Increases in indirect taxation announced in the budget were estimated to add 3 per cent to the consumer price index.  The improvements provided in rates of social welfare payments therefore protected those in receipt of these payments from the effects of these increases and, in the case of pensioners, afforded an additional real increase in payments.  The Government's programme, as Deputies are aware, provided for an increase of 5 per cent in old age pensions, from October.  The increases actually provided went beyond this and included, in addition to the 5 per cent increase promised to contributory and non-contributory old age pensioners, a similar increase of 5 per cent in pensions payable to other pensioners who have reached pension age and to all retirement pensioners.  Consequently, recipients of widows` pensions, contributory and non-contributory, deserted wife's allowance and invalidity pensions who have reached age 66 also received the 5 per cent increase as well as retirement pensioners under the age of 66.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, provision was made for a 3 per cent increase in the weekly rates of social welfare payments to persons under pension age.  These included recipients of disability benefit, unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance as well as pensioners under pension age. The previous Government provided increases in social welfare payments from April last which were designed to provide real increases in these payments to cover the year 1981-1982 with no provision for any October increase.  This Government are committed to guaranteeing real increases in incomes to social welfare recipients and pensioners and the increases provided from October represent a first step in that direction.  As a result of the increases, a single recipient <Col N="1663" /> of old age pension and a widow who has reached age 66 previously receiving a non-contributory pension of £26.25 now receive £27.55 while a married couple both previously receiving old age pension now have their pensions increased to £55.10.  The rate for a couple receiving old age (contributory) pension was increased from £53.55 to £56.25 where both have reached age 66.  A widow under age 66 with three children had her widow's contributory pension increased from £52.90 to £54.50.  The Government, as I have said, are committed to guaranteed indexation of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>This is a minimum requirement and there is a further commitment to raise the value of these payments in real terms. The increases so far given were estimated to cost £38 million in a full year and were the maximum which could be afforded in the difficult economic situation we found ourselves faced with.  I would like to emphasise, however, that it is our firm intention to build on this, so that during the Government's term of office very substantial improvements will be made.  The question of further increases will, of course, be considered shortly in the context of the forthcoming budget and the House can rest assured that I will be concerned to see that further substantial increases will then be provided to those dependent on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The provision of a double payment to long-term social welfare beneficiaries this Christmas has, as I announced at the week-end, also been approved by the Government and not in response to any pressure from the Opposition.  This was announced as an indication of our commitment to recipients of social welfare benefits to bring some comfort to them over the Christmas period.  We have taken this decision notwithstanding the serious situation we find ourselves in.  I can assure the Deputy that we will get the legislation through and that the payments will be made.  I thank him for the co-operation he has offered us in that regard.</P>
    <P>The double payment will be made in the week beginning 7 December 1981 and the cost of the measure is estimated at <Col N="1664" /> some £12.5 million.  A double payment was made in 1980 under the terms of the second national understanding but on that occasion no October increase in payments had been provided.  This is the first occasion ever on which provision has been made for an increase in payments in April, a further increase in October and on top of that a double payment at Christmas.  A permanent increase in rates of payment is obviously more valuable to recipients in the long run and my main effort will be concentrated on achieving real increases in the actual level of social welfare payments.  I am happy, however, that apart from the October increase already referred to and although the commitment made in the second national understanding did not extend beyond 1980, the Government have now agreed to a double payment on this occasion. This measure will, I have no doubt, be widely welcomed and will be of considerable assistance to those involved in meeting the additional expenses arising at Christmas time.  The number who will benefit from the provision is estimated to be 376,000 with 120,000 dependants and the provision will mean, for example, that a single old age non-contributory pensioner will receive £55.10 while a married couple will receive £110.20 in that week.  A widow with three children on contributory widow's pension will receive £109.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention the increase from October in the weekly fuel voucher under the national and urban fuel schemes from £3 to £4 a week.  When the national fuel scheme was introduced on 1 October 1980 the amount of the weekly voucher was £2.  The voucher was increased from £2 to £3 by the previous Government for the final 13 weeks of the 1980-81 season and it was specified then that the increased amount would also apply for the 1981-82 season.  While the increase to £4 represents a considerable advance on the position I regard it as in effect an interim measure pending a complete review of home heating provisions as a whole and the introduction, as promised in the Government's Programme of &ldquo;realistic heating provisions for the elderly&rdquo;.  Adequate heating is critical to <Col N="1665" /> the health and well-being of the elderly in our society and I will ensure that the review of the present provisions will be completed as quickly as possible so that I can bring forward proposals for realistic provisions in this area.</P>
    <P>Another area in relation to which I will bring forward proposals at an early date is the free telephone rental scheme.  It is a requirement of the scheme that the recipient must be living alone or with one or more other persons who are so permanently incapacitated as to require constant care and attention.  The Government's programme promises an extension of the scheme to cover elderly couples living together and I am having proposals drawn up for the implementation of this commitment.</P>
    <P>The measures I have referred to which have been taken by the Government in the brief period since they assumed office have illustrated our commitment to protect the position of social welfare recipients.  In the longer term the Government programme envisages major developments with the aim of bringing about a comprehensive, efficient and humane system of social welfare in the coming years.  Obviously, it will not be possible to bring these changes into effect at once but I can assure the House that I am pressing ahead with my examination of all aspects of the system. The developments so far implemented may be seen as the first instalment of what will be a continuous process of improvement over the coming years.</P>
    <P>The most vital matter which needs to be tackled is the problem of poverty in Irish society and I was happy to be able to announce details last week-end of my plans for a new poverty agency to tackle this problem.  The Government programme included a commitment to draw up and implement an anti-poverty plan within the context of national economic and social planning, to re-establish the structure of the combat poverty organisation which had been discontinued under the previous Government and to set up a special unit in my Department to co-ordinate the work of the programme.</P>
    <P>The new agency will be set up on a statutory basis and this I feel will give it <Col N="1666" /> a status and a framework of permanency which will enable it to function effectively.  Among the tasks of the agency will be to examine the causes and extent of poverty, to appraise existing policies and programmes and to suggest new ones, and very importantly to engage in public education as to the nature and extent of poverty.  The agency will make regular reports and these will be published.  In conjunction with the new agency I am setting up a special anti-poverty unit in my Department to carry out the necessary liaison between the Department and the agency and to ensure that the proposals put forward by the agency have a direct input into the policy-making process.  The Government are committed to a serious approach to the problem of poverty and the prompt establishment of the new agency is an earnest of our commitment.</P>
    <P>The work of combating poverty must result in the long term in an effective redistribution of income and wealth in our society.  In the shorter term there are a number of specific improvements in the social welfare system which can make a significant contribution in this area and to which the Government are committed in their programme.  The first of these which I would like to mention is the reform of the supplementary welfare allowances scheme to meet its original objectives.  This scheme is of immense importance in that it acts in many cases as a `fire brigade' service.  The scheme has been the subject of some criticism, as is probably inevitable in a scheme of this nature.  It is my intention that the scheme be critically reviewed and the necessary measures taken to ensure that needs are met speedily and in a flexible and humane manner.</P>
    <P>Apart from the supplementary welfare allowances scheme there are a large number of social assistance schemes operated by the Departments of Social Welfare and Health catering for many different categories of need and subject to varying conditions and different means tests.  It is clear that a much greater degree of co-ordination than exists at present can be achieved in this area and there is, in my view, an obvious need for more rationalisation. <Col N="1667" />  When my examination of this whole question has been completed I will be bringing proposals to the Government.  It may be that through a reformed supplementary welfare allowance scheme a degree of co-ordination of social assistance provisions for different categories of persons can be achieved.</P>
    <P>To some extent, of course, progress in this area is dependent on extending the scope of the present social insurance system which provides cash benefits in return for payment of contributions.  In the social welfare field while all employees have access to the social insurance system which provides benefits as of right in return for contributions and without the requirement of a means test, the self-employed are not entitled to social insurance services.  Access for the self-employed to social insurance services exists in one form or another in all other member states of the EEC and its absence in this country is particularly noticeable in view of the proportionately very large numbers of self-employed that we have.  It is a matter of particular concern that self-employed persons, who are subject to the contingencies of old age <i>et cetera</i> in the same way as employees, are unable to ensure a pension through payment of social insurance contributions and must rely on the various means tested services and whatever private arrangements they may make.  The sharing of responsibility which a social insurance system would involve would ensure a more adequate level of financial resources with which to meet the cost of protective provisions.  I am aware of course of the tradition of independence which is a feature of self-employment but I am confident that a social insurance scheme applicable to the self-employed can be devised which will meet the needs of this sector and which will command general acceptance.</P>
    <P>I see the pensions area as being of most importance in relation to the self-employed and the proposals which I will be bringing forward in relation to a national pension plan will be designed to include provision for the self-employed. Sickness is another area which can have <Col N="1668" /> a major impact on self-employed people, particularly those whose business depends on their personal involvement on a continuing basis and I am examining the question of making suitable provisions also in this area.  The extension of social insurance to the self-employed would of course, in time, considerably reduce the scope of the existing social assistance schemes and would facilitate the achievement of greater rationalisation of social assistance services to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The pensions area is one in which I am personally very interested.  The Government are committed in their programme to reducing the qualifying age for pension from 66 to 65 within their term of office. That commitment will be met.  Apart from this however I am concerned about the gaps and the inequalities which are a feature of pensions provisions generally. Some employees on retirement enjoy a level of income which bears a fairly close relationship to their income while employed.  This is achieved through a combination of flat-rate social insurance pension and an occupational pension based on earnings.  A very large number of employees, however, are not members of an occupational pension scheme and are entirely dependent on the social insurance pension.  For many of them the onset of old age threatens the living standards which have been built up over the years.  Those who become widowed or permanently incapable of work also face the possibility of a significant fall in their income.</P>
    <P>In my view the absence of any link between social insurance pensions and earnings, as exists in the case of short-term benefits through the pay-related benefit scheme, is a major gap in our social welfare system.  The Government are committed to bring to a conclusion the discussions on a national income-related pension scheme, discussions which were initiated by the last Coalition Government through the publication of a Green Paper in 1976, and to introduce legislation in the course of their term of office to establish a national pension scheme to guarantee all citizens an equitable share of national resources on <Col N="1669" /> retirement or in widowhood or invalidity. It is inequitable that some categories of workers enjoy high levels of pension while other categories have access only to social welfare pensions and I am anxious, therefore, to see that all workers have access to a pension scheme which will enable them to have in retirement a reasonable relationship with their previously established standard of living. Another major concern is to ensure that pensions once awarded maintain their real value as the years of retirement progress.  It is also necessary to ensure that pension rights once earned are not lost, for example when a person changes his job as can happen at present.  That is something workers feel very strongly about.</P>
    <P>In the time since I took office as Minister for Social Welfare I have been examining the various views put forward in response to the 1976 Green Paper and I hope to finalise my own proposals in this area in the near future.  I am aware that the previous Government undertook in the second national understanding to prepare a White Paper in this area and this White Paper was expected to be published in the first quarter of 1981, prior to the election.  In the event, however, the White Paper was not published before the change of Government.  While I am anxious that proposals should be put forward without further undue delay, there are a number of ideas which I am anxious should feature in a new scheme and these will necessarily involve changes in what has already been prepared.  I expect however to complete my consideration of the pension scheme in the near future and I will then be putting proposals for urgent action to the Government.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a national pension plan could go a long way to alleviating the problem of inadequate incomes among pensioners.  Another problem area which must be tackled is the area of support for poor families and this is also under examination at present.  Under the terms of the second national understanding the previous Government agreed to an examination of this whole area, taking account of reports by the National Economic and Social Council which were <Col N="1670" /> relevant.  The present Government are keenly aware of the inadequacy of existing support for families and of the need to take immediate action in this area.</P>
    <P>Rather than await the results of the examination referred to, therefore, the decision was taken, and is included in the Government's programme, to abolish the present tax free allowance for dependent children &mdash; which, by their very nature, are of greatest benefit to those paying tax at higher rates and of no benefit at all to those whose earnings are so low as to exclude them from the tax system.  The allowances are to be replaced by an augmented child benefit payable to all mothers of dependent children of £3 a week, and £4 a week for the sixth and subsequent children.  For comparison purposes these rates, expressed on a monthly basis, are approximately £13 for the first five children and over £17 for subsequent children, as compared with current monthly rates of children's allowances of £6 for the first child and £9 for each additional child.  The child benefit proposals therefore represent a significant improvement on existing levels of children's allowances and will result in a transfer of income from higher income taxpayers to low income taxpayers and to those below the tax threshold as recommended by the National Economic and Social Council and meets the point they make in that regard.</P>
    <P>The introduction of these measures will bring about an immediate and significant increase in the income of poorer families with large numbers of children whose position has seriously deteriorated in recent years.  The whole area of family support, including the payments for children under the various social insurance and assistance schemes, is one in which further research is needed.  The provision of a reasonable level of support to families in need, in particular those with large numbers of children and one parent families, many of whom are still struggling on barely adequate incomes, must be a major priority and I would see the new poverty agency as having a major contribution to make in this area.</P>
    <P>The major developments in social welfare which are envisaged in the Government's <Col N="1671" /> programme will go a considerable way towards improving the situation of the needy in our society and will give this country a social security system which can be favourably compared with what is available in other western European countries.  It is not sufficient, however, just to have a system which is good on paper.  It is also necessary that the administration of the system should be as streamlined and efficient as possible. Administering social welfare scheme is one of the biggest operations in the country and involves the keeping of very extensive data files and the continuous processing of some of the largest volumes of routine transactions in the country. Prompt and efficient processing of claims under the various schemes depends on the assembly, maintenance, retrieval and communication of information from one office to another, from one section to another and between sections and members of the public, through the post, over the telephone and across the counter. The administrative tasks increase with the regular extensions and changes in existing schemes and the introduction of new ones.</P>
    <P>The Department must make appropriate use of the best modern data processing and communications technologies to aid them in maintaining and improving their services to the public and in their day-to-day administration, policy making and planning.  While the system has adapted reasonably well over the years to the demands made upon it, strains have become apparent in recent years and it is vital that the system be made as flexible and adaptable as possible, particularly in the light of the further changes which will be introduced into the system in the future.  I am referring to changes and improvements in computerisation and telecommunication development plans for the coming years.</P>
    <P>I hope that what I have said will have made clear to the House that the Government's commitment to social progress is a positive one and involves firm commitments in various specific areas of policy to be achieved during the Government's term of office.  The commitments <Col N="1672" /> on social welfare in the Government programme are being urgently pressed ahead and I ask the House to indicate its support for this most important work by supporting my amendment to the motion.</P>

      <P>Coalition Governments have always been associated with hardship, misery and unemployment.  This Government is the worst yet.  After only six months in office they have added 5 per cent to the cost of living.  I feel sorry for the Minister for Social Welfare who must be embarrassed when she has to announce increases to social welfare recipients.  I have the list from which she was quoting and it is sad and disturbing to see amounts of 5 pence, 15 pence, 20 pence and 25 pence being granted.  How can any Government dole out that sort of money to people in the lower income group who are so badly hit by the increases and the economic policies of the Government?</P>
      <P>Obviously the Minister is living on promises of finance for her Department. Promises, promises, promises.  She has not got anything and is not going to get anything.  I am sure she is doing her best but she has not made any definite commitment except for a 3 per cent and a 5 per cent increase.  The increases announced in the budget have already eroded those increases.  The Minister also talked about index linked social welfare commitments.  Were the 3 per cent and the 5 per cent index linked?  How can that cover the increased cost of items which Deputy Woods spoke about?  There has been an increase of £1.60 in the price of bottled gas and £1.50 on a bag of coal. Those prices are not index linked.  What about all the other items which have increased in price?  ESB charges have soared and food also has gone up in price. How can any Government say they are index linking price increases when 3 per cent or 5 per cent would not nearly cover that type of increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social welfare recipients are lucky that Fianna Fáil brought in the double week last year because if we had not done so they would not be getting it this year. They were shamed into granting it this year also.  I know the Taoiseach made <Col N="1673" /> lots of mistakes when he named his Cabinet but he named one very well &mdash; Minister for Poverty.  The Coalition Government are going to need a poverty agency in the coming months and, after the next budget, they will need a large Department to look after poverty.  Not only will the less well off people be impoverished, the people in the middle income group <Col N="1674" /> who were doing reasonably well are going to be poverty stricken also under the policies of the present Government.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware (i) that a considerable number of pensionable servants of county councils (a) have been laid off or (b) are on short-time in 1981 due to a redundancy situation; (ii) that lay-offs or short-time working seriously affects pensionable service in view of the service day rule under the Superannuation Act, 1956; and if he will notify local authorities that in the present circumstances the lost time could be regarded as paid leave (nominal) so that pensionable service may not be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>(i) Arising from recent inquiries made of county councils it is understood that (a) one local authority had laid off workers during 1981, and (b) that three other authorities had found it necessary to put workmen on short-time in order to contain expenditure within the limits of their incomes.  In the case of one of these it has been found possible recently to re-employ the workers on a full-time basis; (ii) The local authority superannuation code is governed by legislation i.e. the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956 and the reckonability of service days is a matter for each local <Col N="1520" /> authority in accordance with the provisions of that Act and of the Superannuation Revision Scheme, 1977.  The non-reckonability of unpaid absences for superannuation purposes in local authorities is in line with the position in the public service generally and it would not be appropriate for me to seek to amend the existing provisions in this matter.  One of the improved benefits granted under the revision scheme allows a pensionable servant to reckon all his service days (subject to maximum of 250 days in any year) whereas previously he could not reckon service days in any financial year in which he had less than 200 such days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware that Westmeath County Council failed in their efforts to have a company prosecuted under the Fire Brigades Act, 1940; and if local authorities require additional powers in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that Westmeath County Council served fire precautions notices in respect of the premises referred to by the Deputy.  I am informed that one notice specified requirements as to the walls and roof of the premises and an appeal was annulled by the District Court on the grounds that requirements of the notice were unreasonable.  It appears that another notice specified requirments as to the roof but was annualled on appeal because work meeting the requirments of the notice had been undertaken before the case was heard.  I understand from Westmeath County Council that the premises is no longer considered by them to be a fire hazard.</P>
      <P>While the outcome of this case appears to have been satisfactory, I accept that there is a need generally to update and strengthen the legislation governing fire safety matters.  This is one of the primary purposes of the Fire Services Bill, 1981, which was restored to the Dáil Order Paper on 21 October last.</P>

      <P>The question of the steps to be taken in connection with unauthorised camping is a matter for consideration by the local authority, in this case Dublin County Council.  I understand that the school authorities have submitted their complaints to the council for attention.  I have no jurisdiction in matters relating to the school.</P>
      <P>I believe that an essential part of any solution to problems arising from random camping by travelling families is the provision of accommodation in accordance with Government policy.  My Department gives every assistance, including financial assistance at the rate of 100 per cent of the capital cost of providing special housing, serviced sites and ancillary accommodation, and support for the employment of social workers.</P>
      <P>Each local authority has been asked by my Department to prepare a plan to deal with the total settlement problem in their area, through provision of houses, or serviced sites, according to the individual needs of the families concerned.  Consultation between local authorities is encouraged in the case of providing for families moving between areas.</P>
      <P>I understand that proposals for a programme for provision of serviced sites to meet the needs in the Dublin area which was submitted to Dublin County Council has been referred back by the council for re-examination.</P>

      <P>It is expected that Falcarragh and Killygordon exchanges will be converted to automatic working by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The programme for automatic service in Donegal is being reviewed at present to determine if provision of automatic service throughout the county can be speeded up.  Under the current programme, it is planned to provide automatic service at the following exchanges in 1982: Ballintra, Ballygorman, Carndonagh, Carrigart, Donegal, Downings, Fahan, Inch, Inver, Laghey, Lifford, Malin, Manorcunningham, Mountcharles, Moville, Quigley's Point, Rathmullan.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the current programme, the following exchanges will not have automatic service by the end of 1982: Annagry, Ardara, Arranmore, Ballybofey, Bunbeg, Burtonport, Carrick, Churchill, Cloghan, Clonmany, Clooney, Culdaff, Creeslough, Doaghbeg, Doochary, Drumkeen, Dungloe, Dunkineely, Fintown, Glencolumbkille, Gleneely, Glenties, Greencastle, Gweedore, Kerrykeel, Kilcar, Killybegs, Kilmacrennan, Kincasslagh, Lettermacward, Muff, Portsalon, Ramelton, Rosbeg, Tamney, Tory Island.</P>

      <P>Sketch-plans for the proposed new school at Barnesmore, County Donegal, have been prepared by the Commissioners of Public Works.  The accommodation to be provided will be four classrooms and a general purposes room.  A grant towards the cost of the project cannot be sanctioned until satisfactory title to the site <Col N="1557" /> has been established.  My Department first requested evidence of title in April 1978.  Title documents were submitted at the end of September 1980, but proved to be unsatisfactory.  The Chief State Solicitor reported in May 1981 that the title as submitted by the chairman's solicitor was not satisfactory and that he had written to the chairman's solicitor regarding the matter.  It has been ascertained from the Chief State Solicitor that as at 5 November 1981 he is still awaiting a reply.  He will write to the chairman's solicitor again shortly.</P>
      <P>When good title is established a grant will be sanctioned.
