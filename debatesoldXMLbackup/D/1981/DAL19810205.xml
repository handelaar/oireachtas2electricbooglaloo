      <P>I was dealing last evening with the commitment of the Government to the underprivileged, the sick and infirm.  I was somewhat amazed at the concluding remarks of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry when he said he was deeply interested in the affairs of the handicapped and pointed to the fact that the Government had removed VAT from wheelchairs.  In glowing terms he took great credit for believing that a Government with such a commitment deserved the praise and support he was giving them.  He boasted of the 25 per cent increase being given social welfare recipients in this budget.  Let us examine whether or not this represents a 25 per cent increase to them.  When one considers that all of these payments will not come into effect until April next when one-sixth of the year will have expired, this means that the remaining five-sixths of 25 per cent represents 21 per cent and, with inflation running at an annual rate of 19 per cent, these people are in fact getting an increase of 2 per cent.  The real purchasing power of the increase being given them is a mere 2 per cent.  A Government which in the Year of the Handicapped see fit to award the poorer section of the community an increase of 2 per cent and then boast in glowing terms of their social conscience and their great concern for the sick, handicapped and underprivileged are disgusting to say the least.  It is disgusting that a party would read the social position of this country and its people in such a way.  I want to protest in the strongest possible terms at such behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome some aspects of the increased social welfare payments, especially to old age pensioneers.  I congratulate the Council of Ireland of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for reading the situation of our needy much more accurately than the Government elected to take care of them.  I must acknowledge that some suggestions put forward in the pre-budget submission to the Government <Col N="1123" /> have been met, but others have not. I might be permitted to read some examples from this booklet.  It says that at least one-third of the nation's children live in families dependent at least in part for their income on weekly social welfare payments.  It is contended further that one-quarter of all households living on low incomes are headed by an elderly person.  Households headed by an elderly person are 2.7 times as likely to be poor as other households.  Households consisting of elderly people living alone are three times as likely to be poor as other households.  Thirty per cent of all those interviewed lacked basic water amenities.</P>
    <P>A sum of £2 per week cannot possibly purchase sufficient fuel to provide adequate heating for the elderly.  About one in seven of our old people living alone are consistently lonely.  That is an indictment of Irish society, a total indictment not alone of the present Government but of this House and of the concern we have for people in such need. Each of us in public life, in our constituencies, must be aware of elderly people and families living on well below the breadline, of old people who must go to bed early because they have insufficient finance to purchase coal or other fuel. They go to bed to keep themselves warm and remain in bed longer during the day because, by so doing, they will not feel the hunger pains as much.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way in the last 50 years but there are still aspects of our society not being tackled properly.  There is insufficient evidence in the present budget that we are tackling that matter in the way we should.  I give credit to the new Minister for Health and for Social Welfare for being a concerned person, someone who wants to listen to what is going on.  But if one looks around at the way moneys have been doled out to speculators to get back into business, to get on the gravy train of the Haughey administration, so that in turn they can pay into the coffers of the Fianna Fáil Party at election time, one begins to see the basic truth.  These are the hard facts: you scratch my back and I will scratch yours. <Col N="1124" /> The Tacateers have returned, or are knocking at the door to get in, and the Government are encouraging them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare quoted some figures worthy of examination.  He said that the old age pensioner would have an increase from the present rate of £24.50 per week to £30.65 and showed that that was an increase of 25 per cent. It is not a 25 per cent increase and, in real terms, it is not £6.15 per week.  When one takes into consideration the inflation rate of 18 per cent and the fact that he will not get the increase until April, it is only 75p per week.  That old age pensioner will have to stand against the inflation that this budget has caused between now and then.  In this year when the Government say they are so concerned about these people and when inflation is at 18 per cent &mdash; and that is not disputed by the Government&mdash;they have given these people 75p per week in real purchasing terms.  Of course, a widow with a contributory pension who is just one year under the age for the old age pension is expected to live on £2.50 per week less; the new pension in this case is brought up to £28.15 per week.  On the same calculation that I used in respect of the old age pensioner, that widow will receive a 67p increase in real purchasing terms.</P>
    <P>Where is the commitment that this Government talk about in this year of the handicapped?  This is what is called ringing the changes, making people believe that because they have more money in their pockets they are better off.  Why cannot these people have their increases from the time the prices increase?  Inflation started as a result of this budget last Friday with the increase in the price of petrol and it will get progressively worse between now and April when the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans, the families in need of social welfare benefits, get their increases.  What are we doing? We are telling them that if they need money they should go to the social welfare officer and get the supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>Is there any appreciation by the Government of a thing called human dignity? Have we lost all sight of the fact that people have pride and that they should <Col N="1125" /> not have to go on bended knees to the social welfare officer asking for a dole out to help them pay for the groceries or fuel, the footwear and the clothing that they need for their children?  Why is it that we have not got imagination or appreciation? Are we fooling ourselves or do we not have the money to make the social welfare payments as and from the time other increases are granted?  It is not beyond the bounds of imagination or possibility, and there is no administrative difficulty, that these increases to the elderly, to the sick, the infirm and the handicapped, could be made payable at the time of the budget.  It is merely a book-keeping exercise and could easily be done.  Why is it not done?</P>
    <P>The Government might say that when we were in power we did not do it.  What justification is there for concluding that because we did not do it&mdash;and it was wrong&mdash;that the Government should continue the error?  One could say that it is traditional to do things in this way. Why cannot we change tradition if there is a need to change it?  Why must someone like me argue and make accusations across the floor that the Government are not really interested in welfare of the needy until people in high places get embarrassed and say this is what should be done?  We do not have any special gift from God of having greater concern for the sick and the old and the infirm.  It is not because one is born into a particular tradition, the tradition of a political party, that one has a monopoly on this. Each of us has been given the same ability by our Creator to think out these things and recognise them and do something about them.  Why is there so much silence on the Government benches when it comes to this?  Why is there so much applause on the back benches when the Minister talks about the massive increases in social welfare, particularly for the elderly, the infirm and the handicapped? What has not been done is a fine-combing of what happens when it comes down to buying the butter, the bread, paying the rent, buying the shoes and the clothing.</P>
    <P>On the figures given by the Minister, a widow on a contributory pension with <Col N="1126" /> three children gets an increase from £45 per week to £52.90 per week.  The Minister argues that that was an increase of £7.90 per week.  I argue that that family is £1 worse off.  Again the increases are not available until April.  So, with one-sixth of the year gone and taking into consideration that between the end of the year and the next budget in 1982 they will still feel the effects of this bad system of delayed payments, we are back to the example that the Minister gave when he was speaking on the budget.  He said that a widow with three children would now be £7.90 better off.  I dispute that and again I take into consideration inflation at 18 per cent and not 19 per cent which is the reckoning of the economists.  The increase that that family received in the budget was 19 per cent and not 25 per cent.  We calculate 19 per cent over 12 months but this family has only got the increase for ten months so in real terms it is 16 per cent and that is 2 per cent below the 18 per cent inflation, so in terms of purchasing power that family is £1 worse off.  That is taking almost the lowest example to prove how kind the Government have been to the widows and orphans.  If we take into consideration a family of four children then that position gets worse.  If we take into consideration a family of five children the position is worse again.  I do not know why this has not been exposed before now.  I do not know, nor can I imagine, the thinking in the Department of Finance, advised by the Minister in his Department of Social Welfare, that will allow such things to happen.  If one section of our society is to be protected, we must all agree that it should be the people who do not have any fathers to care for them, the mothers who have all the trouble of being father and mother and who are living on £52.90 a week.</P>
    <P>Recently the former Taoiaeach, Deputy Lynch, speaking at a Fianna Fáil occasion, said it was important for the Fianna Fáil Party to stick together because in the event of a change of Government, such alternative Government would not last six weeks and Fianna Fáil would have to come back into power, maybe under a new leader&mdash;perhaps that <Col N="1127" /> is what Deputy Lynch was speaking about.  The only hope the former Taoiseach had for this nation was that Fianna Fáil should stay together because if they did not there was no future for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>What disgusted me about this was that Deputy Lynch was lecturing at a function where those present had paid £20 for their meal, as much as some hungry people in Dublin, Cork and rural Ireland were given to keep them for a week.  He said unless people continued to vote for a party which kept them in such dire distress, God help the Irish.  If there is ever a change of Government I hope that any party I support will have a greater commitment to the needs of our society than the present administration.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare told us he increased the free fuel allowance from £2 to £3 per week.  He missed the point that the price of fuel has increased by that amount and that these people are not getting anything extra.  What annoys me is that if he recognises the right of people to free fuel why can he not do the honourable thing and include this amount in their pension?  Why do they have to make application and tell the community care office how poor and needy they are, or how some member of the family is not living up to his or her responsibility to support their parents? Why do they have to go through this humiliation?  Why do they have to come to public representatives saying they got fuel vouchers last year but not this year although they are as poor, if not poorer this year than they were last year?  Is there no appreciation for human dignity? Is there no imagination in the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Finance or in the Government ranks, that old people have a certain amount of pride, no matter how poor they are?  If free fuel is seen as a necessity, the Government should do the decent thing and include this allowance in their pensions.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect on the social welfare scene to which I would like to refer, and that is the increase in maternity allowances.  This is to be welcomed but I wonder if we are going far enough.  I hope <Col N="1128" /> I will not be misinterpreted when I say this, and this view will be shared by many people in this House and in local authorities. When a young girl gets married and looks for maternity leave a few months later officials in county councils and health boards tell me, and I do not disagree with them, that for the few weeks before her official maternity leave starts that young woman, for physical reasons which must be understood and sympathised with, is not concentrating on her job. She goes off sick two or three weeks before her maternity leave officially starts.  She is justified in doing this because her doctor recommends it and no one is disputing that.  When her official maternity leave terminates she might not be fit to return to work and will continue on sick leave, which she is also entitled to.  This means that in many cases maternity leave is not for 14 weeks, as provided in the budget, but can be extended to 20 weeks or even six months.</P>
    <P>There is the disruption in her place of employment to be considered.  During the time she is off work her replacement has to learn the ropes for the first few weeks and this has an upsetting effect on the place of employment.  When the young lady returns to work after four, five or six months, she is out of tune with what is happening in the organisation.  I wonder if we have reached the point where we should be seriously looking at a system which would pay young women to stay at home while they are having a family?</P>
    <P>On one of my trips abroad to a communist country, Bulgaria, one of the weakest, if not the weakest, economy in Europe, I learned that everyone, man and woman, is guaranteed a job.  When a young woman announces she is pregnant she is entitled to her weeks wages for two years from that date forward to stay at home and look after her child.  I wonder if we should be heading in that direction.  I have not studied the economics of the situation but I imagine it would lead to economic convulsions to deal with it right away, because some people would take advantage of it, and it could be argued that others are excluded.  We are going in that direction and sooner or later <Col N="1129" /> we will have to look at the facts.  What I said is really happening at present and the increases provided by the Minister are not the answer to maternity leave.</P>
    <P>In the budget the Minister announced that he was providing £250,000 to examine the potato industry.  When we talk about potatoes we are talking about Donegal.  The potato seed industry in that county is so basic to the agricultural industry that it is an insult to offer the pittance given in the budget.  Many potato growers believed from what they read in the papers that this £250,000 would benefit them directly, but that was not the case.  Not one penny of that £250,000 will go directly into the pockets of the potato growers in County Donegal, many of whom had their potatoes collected by the Potato Marketing Board as far back as September, October and November of last year and have not yet been told what the price per ton will be, nor have they been paid.  I want to put on record that I do not know any section of the agricultural industry who work as hard as the potato growers in County Donegal.  I say that with apologies to no one, either to other farmers in County Donegal or to farmers in any other part of the country.  The potato industry in Donegal demands hard work, long hours, dedication and a big effort.  All growers, both present and past, involved in the potato growing industry, deserve recognition. It is a hard earned living which has gone wrong in the recent past.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure whether the Potato Marketing Board continues to hold the confidence of the potato growers in County Donegal.  I do not want to say they have lost that confidence because I am not sure, but I do know the entire potato industry has got to be reorganised quickly because many people &mdash; not all my supporters, many of them are Government supporters who supported the Government in the recent by-election, financially in an effort&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Smith, apparently, knows more about the politics of the <Col N="1130" /> majority and the minority of potato growers in Donegal than I do.  I am not sure if it was the majority or the minority but if what Deputy Smith says is correct, little thanks the Government have given them in the budget.  They have ignored their pleas and they have been lobbying Ministers, Deputies and county councillors. We have had deputations here and my doorbell never stops ringing with hard pressed farmers seeking, not begging help, saying they have grown the potatoes, produced the crop and put the effort into it.  The whole thing has gone wrong and they have been let down.  That is the message they are trying to get across. Deputy Smith says the majority of them voted for his party candidate in the by-election. Shame on Deputy Smith for admitting it and supporting a party that has done so little in return.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what the economic position is with the different families that traditionally grow potatoes, people who are recognised as being agricultural experts in the potato industry.  They may have little nest eggs that will take them over the present economic difficulties. They may not.  Whatever the position is, the Government is in default for doing nothing about it.  £250,000 has been described as a gob stopper to keep noisy farmers quiet in County Donegal, to get them off the backs of Fianna Fáil Deputies, Senators and county councillors. They want them off their backs because they are annoying them.  They did not annoy them last year or any previous year.  They are doing it this year because they are justified in so doing and the sooner the Government and young men like Deputy Smith, who has a responsibility in the agricultural industry, does something about it, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Government speakers talk about the tourist industry and point to the fact that, because of our low currency rate, many people will be coming from Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the Republic and we are in for a boom period.  I hope they are right.  The people to whom I have been talking in the North of Ireland do not see it that way.  Those people are from both traditions.  They are just Irish people who live north of the <Col N="1131" /> Border and where they go on Sunday morning is of little concern.  They are not talking about coming to the Republic on their summer holidays because our punt is now 74p against sterling.  They will come across the Border for a meal, which is now 26 per cent cheaper in Southern hotels, but the people in the North can now go to the Mediterranean, to other European countries and to Florida for three-quarters of the price they paid last year.  That is the advantage.  I hope the predictions and forecasts made by the tourist board and the optimism shared by the Government comes to pass but I have grave doubts.</P>
    <P>In County Donegal, which has so many people unemployed, living in bad houses, paying telephone charges for a telephone system that does not work, having to use bad roads and an inadequate public transport service, there is nothing in the budget to suggest that the support which the present Government have had in the past will continue.</P>
    <P>There are now almost 2,000 families in need of rehousing in County Donegal. There is no hope whatsoever for them in the budget.  The Government are going to give money to the building tycoons. We know them, we see them in the corridors of power, talking in the lobbies of Leinster House outside the Chamber. We recognise them mostly by the suits and shoes they wear and the gold rings on their fingers.  As I said earlier, they were the backbone of the Tacateers of the sixties and early seventies &mdash; mostly the sixties.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, to his credit, got rid of the leeches of political life.  They are people who have more control over the destiny of the nation than people elected, the faceless men in public life, the guys who can lobby the Ministers, twist their arms, to get things done and who do not have to stand before the general public at election time.  He is there all the time.  If there is a change of Government, it will not be too long before he changes his allegiance. I wonder how many of them would be lobbying Coalition Government Ministers if we had won the last election.  Since 1932, Fianna Fáil have never been beaten <Col N="1132" /> twice in a general election.  There are leeches who persuade Government Ministers that building too many local authority houses, floods the market with new houses.  The Government, therefore, do not proceed to build local authority houses in sufficient numbers to meet the needs of people living in bad houses.  If they did, there would be too many houses on the market and the tycoons in the building industry who are so closely embedded in the Fianna Fáil party, would not be given as much money for the houses they build.  If this is unfair criticism, someone can paint another picture but that is how I see it.</P>
    <P>If ever a Government stands condemned this Fianna Fáil administration does.  In the last two or three years one of the major decisions taken by the Government, under a different leader but collective responsibility makes them all responsible, was to join the EMS.  We joined the EMS because we were told it represented a stable currency.  We joined it because sterling was falling and was getting dangerously low.  We joined it because we all wanted to be good Europeans and we were told so but we joined it blindly and the people who knew the facts&mdash;I mention Deputy Lynch as Taoiseach, Deputy Colley who was Tánaiste, Deputy O'Donoghue who was Minister for Economic Planning and Development and the other members of the Cabinet&mdash;did not inform the Government backbenchers of the true nature of the risks we were taking in joining the EMS.  The Opposition were not informed of the true position.  I could not figure out what was happening but I was tempted by the fact that I believed Ireland should be part of Europe.  Therefore, the carrot of a European monetary system appealed to me as, undoubtedly, it did to other members of my party and Government backbenchers.</P>
    <P>It is now time that we admitted that the EMS, a well-intentioned decision, has gone wrong.  While some people in Irish Society have benefited it must be admitted that a greater number have not. I should like to give some details about this and argue the point which has a political base.  In the sixties the late Seán <Col N="1133" /> Lemass argued that if Irish unity was to be a real thing, was to be on the cards or considered by people north of the Border there would have to be social welfare benefits here equal to their own.  The gap was being narrowly bridged until we broke with sterling and joined the EMS. Now there is a 26 per cent difference.  If the Government do not understand what I am talking about they should take into consideration the case I shall put forward.</P>
    <P>Two people who worked in Northern Ireland have now moved to the Republic and are being paid a British old age or retirement pension and have a great benefit. They would tell any Member that they are living in the lap of luxury now, that times were never so good.  However, if one approached a person who served this part of Ireland over a number of years, a retired civil servant, Army officer or ordinary soldier, a retired garda, or their widows, and are now living in Northern Ireland one would be told that they are worse off.  In fact, they are poverty stricken because their pensions have been cut by 28 per cent.</P>
    <P>Weekly I get telephone calls from people who are living in Northern Ireland on behalf of widows of civil servants now living in Derry, Omagh or Coleraine.  It is pointed out to me that they can no longer live on their pension and I am asked if anything can be done about converting the punt into sterling for them.  It is only out of despair that such requests are made because in most cases they are aware of the answer.  What the late Seán Lémass forecast and tried to achieve in the sixties his son-in-law, Deputy Haughey, the Taoiseach, has undone by a stroke of the pen.  I have been informed that had we remained linked to sterling our repayments on foreign borrowing would be 26 per cent less and we would have saved about £170 million per year. I should like to give an example of the position faced by a constituent of mine although I accept that there are many in this position.  A young dynamic farmer, on this side, who must get up at 6.30 in the morning and does not finish work until 10.30 p.m., by tradition had his bank account in Northern Ireland.  Naturally, <Col N="1134" /> a farmer's bank account is mostly in the overdraft situation.  The young person concerned had an overdraft of £120,000 and now must repay that in sterling.  It is now going to cost him £40,000 more to do so.  He is paying 15 or 16 per cent interest not on £120,000 but on £160,000.  That is one of the tragedies of us having joined the EMS and there is no way out of it.</P>
    <P>It is no good saying that that young farmer should have transferred his money to the Republic because it would be in contradiction with the Fianna Fáil Party's position of being anti-partitionist to ignore the Border.  The State has also done the same thing.  The State borrowed money abroad that would have cost us 26 per cent less had we stayed with sterling.  The public external debt by the end of 1980 was £2,900 million with between £700 million and £1,000 million due in 1981.  External reserves are £1,340 million and if our currency falls 11 per cent the true cost of repaying those loans escalates sharply.  The interest rate could become 30 per cent or even more.  We have imported inflation.  Our imports last year amounted to £5,425 million while our exports amounted to £4,134 million. The difference is nearly £1,300 million. Imports from Britain and Northern Ireland amounted to £2,757 million, up from £2,408 million the previous year.  Exports there were £1,768 million, up from £1,624 million.  The rise in imports was 14 per cent and exports 9 per cent.  There is no evidence from that that the fall in our currency has helped us to win a larger share of the British or Northern Ireland Markets.  In fact, we have not benefited as forecast.</P>
    <P>The reason I say that the whole thing has gone wrong is that the forecast of the Government on entry to the EMS was that our currency would get stronger and our difficulty was going to be to compete on the British market.  Well, if we have got stability in our currency we have it with countries with whom we do not do business but we have instability with Northern Ireland and Great Britain with whom we do business.  It shocks me and I believe that as a result Irish unity is back a hundred years. <Col N="1135" /> On the question of prices, I believe that, thanks to Britain's successful policy of keeping sterling high, inflation is expected to halve there this year to below 10 per cent.  Already it is down from 20 to 15 per cent whereas we are at 18-19 per cent.  Because of our weak currency, prices will rise faster this year.  The economic background to the budget admits an average fall of 11 per cent in our currency last year.  This will add at least 5 per cent to domestic inflation.  With sterling the reverse would have been the position.  Admittedly some businesses have done well and that is to be welcomed, as most of these businesses were not doing well because of policies pursued by this and past Fianna Fáil Governments. In Border towns because of the tariff barriers and because of economic differences, mostly to the disadvantage of people in the Republic, people had the advantage of going into Northern Ireland to shop at the expense of traders in the Border towns.  By mistake it has been reversed and the Border towns are now benefiting because of the currency difference, not because of the economic policy of Fianna Fáil, not because of the forecasting of Fianna Fáil when we joined the EMS, because their forecast was that our £ was going to be stronger, but more in spite of what Fianna Fáil planned.</P>
    <P>What are the effects?  Cattle dealers in the Republic now cannot compete with cattle dealers from Northern Ireland. Abattoirs and meat factories are closing in the Republic because Northern buyers are coming down here and paying sterling for our cattle.  Therefore, there is a net gain and a greater net loss.  Economic convulsion is happening in this State and we are not aware of it because of the bad planning.  There is also the terrible difficulty that when we talk about Irish unity nobody here now can afford to go to Northern Ireland on holidays.  It is coming this way.  That might be a good thing, but no one is going from the State.  One of the faults that we identify is that not enough of us are going up to see how they live up there.</P>
    <P>One thing I must say before I conclude is that if we were with sterling the timber <Col N="1136" /> we import from Scandinavia would be 26 per cent less.  Our oil which we buy with dollars would be 26 per cent less.  Our petrol, diesel, steel and coal which we import from Poland, the US and Britain, and foreign motor cars, would all be getting cheaper by 26 per cent.  On that score I am told that British cars are being subsidised by their manufacturers because they would be priced out of existence if we were paying sterling for them.  Deputy Callanan will appreciate that 98 per cent of our farm machinery is imported.  All of that would be 26 per cent less if we were with sterling as also would be soya beans and animal feedstuffs.  The farmers tell me that they are selling in IR£ and buying in sterling and this is causing havoc.</P>
    <P>The only way that our joining the EMS can be undone is if we find oil off the west coast, if the British economy starts falling or if the EMS starts rising.  Then our economy might be levelled off with that of Britain.  Sterling has appreciated because of North Sea oil and because of high interest rates.  Our leaving sterling meant that we were saying that we did not want to share Britain's North Sea oil and we did not want to benefit from high interest rates.  Those people who do not listen to what I am saying will say that we are better off the way we are, that the £ sterling is too dear.  If the £ sterling is too dear what they are really saying is that we had better not find oil off our west coast because the IR£ might then become too dear, so let us stay out here.  That is an irrational argument.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by saying definitely &mdash;because it is the kernel of Irish politics and of what has me in public life&mdash;that any Government who have the political unity of Ireland as the cornerstone of their political philosophy and who have preached the unity of Ireland with constant regularity since their foundation, any Government who with their supporters believe that they and they alone are the true United Ireland party; any party who do all these things and do not produce and support economic, monetary and social policies consistent with that basic political position, but instead produce and support badly thought out policies <Col N="1137" /> which disrupt and interfere with the rights of Irish people on both sides of the Border to trade and deal with each other on terms which are fair and equal to each other, are in fact a partitionist party who forfeit the right to speak about Irish unity.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, past and present, have built economic partition between North and South and have introduced and supported economic policies which have discriminated against one-third of the Irish people because one-third of us live north of the Border and that discrimination is against Nationalist as well as Unionist.  It may have been intended to be against British goods, but that is what it has meant to Irish people living north of the Border.  The currency partition compounds all the mistakes and errors of this and past Governments.  Never before has Partition been so complete.  That is the net result of badly thought out policies. Whether it is palatable or otherwise, it is something I believe deeply and I have yet to be convinced that I am wrong.  If you preach the political unity of Ireland your economic policies, your currency policies, your financial policy, your educational policies, your agricultural policies and every other policy must be consistent with the basic political philosophy, otherwise you are talking a lot of humbug.  It was summarised in a fireside chat in a house in Donegal that I visited last Sunday evening when a young man said to me, &ldquo;Paddy, the Fianna Fáil Party have no commitment to Irish unity.  They are like the young boy who went to the confessional and told so many sins that the priest said to him, &lsquo;Son, do you want to go to Heaven?&rsquo;  and he said, &lsquo;I do, Father, but not yet.&rdquo;&rsquo; It is the same with Fianna Fáil.  They want a united Ireland &mdash; but not yet.  They want to commit all the sins against it and hope at some stage that they will be forgiven by everybody and that by some freak of chance they will become the party that will unite the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I always like to listen to Deputy Harte because he is a great speaker and I believe he says what he actually means.  He went to town on the <Col N="1138" /> fact that we joined the EMS and that this was a mistake.  I am not a financial wizard and I will not go into the matter but I was of the opinion, as he said, that we would be higher than the £.  The great reason for the punt's problems is the fact that sterling has gone up on account of the oil, which Deputy Harte mentioned.  I wonder and I have heard economists wonder if Britain are so very well off with the pound being so high.  Deputy Harte mentioned the price of cattle and I wonder where we would be last November, when cattle prices fell, if the punt were tied to sterling.  Deputy Harte spoke of the Northern buyers who were able to give more for cattle here.  I thought at the end of last year that was a good thing. Prices are good now but they were not good when people were panic-selling.</P>
      <P>Our position has its advantages and disadvantages.  If you compare our currency with the major European currencies I think we are fourth, and this is not bad.  Perhaps the projections were not correct.  I dread hearing people giving long-term forecasts of what will happen in Europe or elsewhere.  It is like the case of wool.  I never knew anybody who could forecast six months ahead what the position would be.  I remember attending a sale abroad at one time and the wool was bought up so quickly that everybody thought it would double in price but before six months it dropped.  The greatest experts could not tell that.  My opinion about the whole European economic system is that it is very hard to forecast what will happen.  I have reservations when I hear geniuses telling us what the situation will be in two or three years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget got a poor press but I will not complain about the press.  I often get a poor press and I often get a good press. It is a grand thing that the press are free to say whether something is good or bad. I think the budget got a bad press because we have so many pressure groups that are important to the press.  None of them was satisfied with the budget.  All of them expected more than they got.  Deputy Cluskey once spoke here about a Coalition budget and said it was a budget of concern.  The last budget was a budget of concern for the poor and under-privileged <Col N="1139" /> sections of the community who have no pressure groups to make themselves important.  I believe that is why the budget got a poor press; I do not blame the press at all.</P>
    <P>I am stating facts.  I think somebody said the budget took from the rich and gave to the poor.  That is what always happens.  Anybody who thinks we can get free this or free that is mistaken because there is nothing free anywhere; somebody must pay.  The only reasonable course for a Government is to strike a balance between the haves and the have-nots.  You must tax the haves in order to give something to the have-nots and that is what the budget has done. Even in my own party I heard people express the hope that we would have a great budget because this is supposed to be an election year.  I am fed up with dishonest declarations by all political parties approaching an election and, even though this is a hard budget for certain sections of the community, I am delighted that it is an honest budget.  I have said this before but I am totally convinced that we are dealing with a very well educated electorate who will not be codded and any party that tries to do so will find that they will not get the answer they want.</P>
    <P>I am also convinced that our youth are very concerned about the people who benefit in this budget and they will have a big say in the next election.  I hear many saying the youth are not as good Christians as the older people.  That is pure cod.  The older people may have been better church-goers but the younger people have a great concern for the underprivileged. In my young days I do not know if we would organise walks and push barrows across Ireland to make money for the underprivileged but that is being done by the youth of today.  I claim, in the words of the song, that we may have had good men but we never had better than the youth of today, and I am one of the older generation.  They want leadership and they want truth. Undoubtedly, the economy is not in a good position; we are going through a recession.  In the Donegal by-election at <Col N="1140" /> every church gate where I spoke I made it clear that I was not there to say that everything in the garden was rosy.  Everything was not rosy due to one of the worst recessions in the lifetime of this Dáil or the previous one: the first was in 1974. What I said was that we were doing our best in that kind of situation.  The budget has proved that we are endeavouring to do our best.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that social welfare recipients, old age pensioners, small farmers on small farm social welfare all got increases.  I am delighted that the small farmers, whether on factual or notional systems, are now getting a 20 per cent increase.  It might be no harm that it was the other way last year because it gave an opportunity for those who were on notional to go on factual.  Everybody spoke about the amount of fiddling going on in regard to small farm social welfare and I know many of them went on to the factual system and 80 per cent of them got an increase, which proves that there was no such fiddling as was assumed.</P>
    <P>I give credit here where credit is due and criticise where I consider it necessary and I have a couple of criticisms to make regarding social welfare recipients. Nobody seems to talk of them but I shall continue to do so and perhaps if I continue long enough somebody will take heed.  Old age pensions have been increased by practically every Government and increased well, even though Deputy Harte thinks that in real terms the benefits are not increased at all.  Inflation has been running so high that very few incomes have been increased.  The social welfare recipients have got a good increase in the budget but I cannot understand why no Government have considered increasing the limit of income for eligibility for an old age pension.  It is still the case that a single person with, I think, anything over £6 cannot get the full old age pension.  I am surprised that the Minister has not increased that limit.  I have been talking about this for a long time.  I am still talking about it and I suppose I will continue to see if something can be done about it.</P>
    <P>The second point relates to the allowance given for caring for old people who <Col N="1141" /> are living at home.  I have said on many occasions, and I will repeat it now, that elderly people want to die at home.  The cost of keeping them in county homes is very high.  I have said before that if I were Minister for Social Welfare I would give a decent allowance in respect of the care of old people.  At the moment the conditions attached to the allowance are too restrictive and money is not paid to relatives. The allowance should be paid irrespective of the relationship to the old person concerned.  I am convinced that many people who are at present in county homes would be kept in their own homes if the allowance were adequate.  If the Government made the necessary change in the regulations there would be a saving in the long run.  Some people have argued that if the change was made across the board it would cost a lot of money, but I do not agree with them.  At least it would mean that those really in need could be accommodated in the county homes.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government have granted an increase in the free fuel allowance and I am also glad that long-term benefits have been increased.  The unfortunate people in psychiatric hospitals had to try to exist on £2.50 per week pocket money but now the amount has been increased to £4.  I had asked that they be given £5 pocket money and I want to make it clear that I sought this increase on medical grounds.  I brought up this matter at meetings of the Western Health Board and I was informed that if a person was too fond of drink he might become a nuisance.  I said allowances should be given on the instructions of the doctor or the nurse in charge.  In my town, Ballinasloe, there is a psychiatric hospital and in Loughrea, which is in my constituency, there is a home for old people.  People living in these institutions had only £2.50 per week and I must admit I had great pity for them.  I am glad there has been an improvement in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte was good enough to do what I have always said politicians should do, namely, to give credit where it was due.  From my contacts with people who are not politically minded I know very well what they think of politicians.  It is their view that the Opposition will criticise <Col N="1142" /> automatically anything the Government do but this argument does not hold with intelligent people.  People not involved in politics themselves have little interest in political matters and their attitude is that one party will contradict the other whenever there is a debate on any current topic.  It is my view that politics will have to change.  By all means let us criticise where that is necessary but, equally, we should give credit where it is due.  Until that is done there will be little respect for politics or democracy.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his efforts to improve the lot of the underprivileged.  As I said before, they have no union to speak on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Next is the question of agriculture, which is my pet subject.  Farmers have had a very bad year.  There is no doubt about that.  They probably would have had an even worse year if there had not been a difference between the punt and the £ sterling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind Deputy Harte.  We are good friends.  I hear a lot of talk about stopping the export of cattle, in order to provide cattle for our factories.  I would be completely opposed to that.  Some incentive for people to keep their calves should be provided in the package being presented by the Minister to the EEC on which we hope to have an answer within the next fortnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember 1974 very well and how we were treated by the factories when we were wholly dependent upon them.  People were stopped from bringing their cattle into the factories, which was a disgrace. I am totally opposed to taking the competition out of the cattle trade, but we <Col N="1143" /> should endeavour to give an incentive to people to bring up the definitely falling cattle figures, which is serious.  It is not right that the unfortunate producers of cattle should now have to take a smaller price because they cannot export.  I worry as much as any Deputy here about the future of the factories because of the present scarcity of cattle.</P>
    <P>Looking at what has been done for the farmer, Fine Gael looked for an end to the resource tax and this has been done away with.  I never liked that tax.  If I were narrowminded, I could say that only 3 per cent of the people in my county were affected by it, and could stand up and say that it should be continued because of that fact.</P>
    <P>I never agreed with complete derating. I had reservations about completely derating houses.  They should have been derated up to a certain valuation, but I was completely against derating mansions, as I said before.  Whether we like it or not, nothing is free and the Fine Gael package cost £70 million.  All farmers, irrespective of whether they were on social welfare or not, would have to be in the tax net, which would be a disaster for the very small farmer.  The Government gave full derating on £50, half derating on £50 to £70 and above that the rates have to be paid.  The Opposition members, when the agricultural grant was done away with, put up the argument which holds good now for the Government side.  The person with a valuation up to £70 would, unless he had a very large family, be in the tax bracket and could put his tax against his rates.  In no way would the £40 man be in the tax bracket, so whether he made money or not, he would have to pay his rates.  The Government did a reasonably good job and there should not be any complaints about it and Opposition Deputies have not complained very bitterly.  Their five points came up at a meeting of the Galway County Committee of Agriculture, of which I am chairman, and I put an amendment to them. I agreed with the removal of the resource tax, did not agree with complete derating, but with partial derating.  We agreed on disease eradication levies.  Again if I <Col N="1144" /> were to be narrowminded, I would say not many people were sending their cattle direct to the factories.  The dairy trade was affected, but that was a good thing. I congratulate the Minister on that.</P>
    <P>On the question of subsidising interest rates, we agreed partially on that but there should be a limit to the amount and a check on what the money was being borrowed for, whether it was borrowed as a speculation to buy land when the person already had enough, or borrowed for the genuine purpose of development. We wanted that point clarified.</P>
    <P>The last point was about stamp duty on transfer of farms.  This was a tax which, with two others, was brought in by the Coalition Government when they removed the wealth tax.  Some people tell me that Dáil Éireann did away with death duty but brought in life duty which proved, owing to the artificial value of land, to be much more severe than the death duty had been.  There is hardship there and I would like to see this duty reduced.</P>
    <P>Our amendment at the county committee meeting put forward that brothers, nephews and nieces should be included in the direct link on transfer within the family.  They were not included in the Act.  The only people included in what we call the one per cent on the interest are the sons and the daughters. There are special concessions when a favourite nephew or niece lives with the farmer in question, and a reduction in stamp duty, but if an uncle lived 30 miles away and left the place to his nephew or niece, the place would have to be sold to pay the stamp duty.  The inclusion of these people in the direct link has not yet been done and the £70 million spent on the Fine Gael proposal did not give any substantial relief in my area.  The Government acted reasonably.</P>
    <P>Farmers are having a difficult time, although other sections of the community may not realise it.  I come from an area with a number of small, hard-working farmers and am convinced that, unless EEC policy is changed in support of the common agricultural policy, things will be even more difficult for the farmers.  At the moment, support is got through price <Col N="1145" /> rises but that is not the answer at all.  One may get a percentage rise this year which is fair enough, but the cost of production will rise after it and what happened farmers in the past two years was that the price rise did not come, although the cost of production kept increasing.</P>
    <P>At present, under EEC regulations, one is not allowed to subsidise agricultural produce.  Even the national Government cannot do so.  It was a great loss when our subsidies were withdrawn.  The very important subsidies for ground limestone had to be phased out because we had to be good Europeans.  If we get a 10 or 15 per cent rise this year, unless this continues each year, with the price of production going up and inflation, we will be in difficulties.  Is that going to continue? I might be wrong, but I do not think it will.  Last year we had the problem of Britain's refusal to pay its contribution towards CAP.  West Germany and Britain, two very important members of the EEC, are kicking at the traces.  Will they continue to subsidise costs so that these increases in price can be given each year?  I would be much happier if a lot of this money were going towards the cost of production, the most important components of which are fertilisers and ground limestone.  This is vital where I come from, because we have a number of small farmers who are endeavouring to increase production.  They cannot increase, or even maintain, a fairly good stocking rate unless they put out a lot more artificial manure than a larger farmer.  The small farmer must have a certain stocking rate to keep the farm viable.  Would the Minister approach the EEC in an endeavour to get at least the first ten or 15 tonnes of artificial manure subsidised.  There is a lot of talk about western drainage and the development of the west, but it is absolutely useless to put out manure on land which needs lime. I would put a limit on the subsidy for ground limestone but every farmer is entitled as a taxpayer, to a subsidy on the first ten tonnes of ground limestone.  The EEC have fallen down on this.</P>
    <P>At present no-one could complain about the price of cattle, which is fairly good.  Is it fair to say that a farmer should <Col N="1146" /> get a 10 per cent price increase?  I agree that an increase in the price would be good for everybody, but the cattle trade is a different matter.  Many people have reduced their stock, particularly because of the panic about fodder.  An unfortunate woman came to me the other day and told me her hay had gone bad and that she had not cut silage, although the Government had advised farmers to do so, an excellent thing to do because many farmers today have plenty of feed because of that advice.  However, a number of people panicked, sold their cattle when the prices were bad and they find themselves without cattle this spring.  To try to replace them will be one hell of a job.</P>
    <P>I suggest that serious consideration be given &mdash; I have appealed for this time and again &mdash; to production subsidies. That is more important than price increases. Everything farmers produce ends up on the consumers' table and if price increases are too high there will be a drop in consumption and we would begin again the European mountains of butter and other things.  We have got rid of the butter mountain and let us hope another will not be started.  Therefore, I suggest that instead of big price rises farmers be given production subsidies.  In the past two years farmers were caught badly by production costs.  Tractors are not luxuries any more.  What I am suggesting would mean that if there was a fall in price, at least the cost of production would be within reason.</P>
    <P>I want to bring to the Minister's attention the recent revision of severely disadvantaged areas.  Only a few district electoral divisions were taken in in my constituency although in the centre of the county a drain river runs right through Dunkellen.  So far we have not got any response to appeals to drain that area. Consequently it is one of the most severely disadvantaged in the country. We had expected that the 12 western counties would be included as severely disadvantaged, and it is a bloody shame they were not.  Although we are recognised as being severely disadvantaged, we do not qualify for the higher grants even after the recent revision.  I am asking <Col N="1147" /> the Minister to contact the powers that be in the EEC to try to get the 12 western counties included as a severely handicapped area.</P>
    <P>We are hoping to get the promised western package in the near future.  I hope this package will include substantial grants for farmers in the West, particularly smaller farmers, for development and building.  I have spoken repeatedly about this.  I have a special interest in the 30-acre farm carrying heavy cows.  That farm cannot be developed unless it has a yard to hold the cattle during the winter. It is no use cutting silage unless there is a yard to hold the cattle during the winter. Otherwise the cattle will get drowned in muck.</P>
    <P>My case is that there should be substantial grants to help farmers to lay down such yards.  It would allow farmers to take the heavy cattle off the fields during the winter.  In the spring the fields would not be cut up as they are and therefore it would be possible to grow grass for silage. The yard would have to be in proportion to the size of the farm.  We cannot bring smaller farmers into the development category unless such farmers have yards, which in turn would mean such farmers could have two cuts of silage every year.</P>
    <P>Under earlier schemes transitional farmers and others got only the smaller 30 per cent grant whereas the larger farmers in the development category got the higher 45 per cent.  That was a scandalous arrangement, completely biased against the smaller farmers.  That was done under EEC Directive 159, and when I raised my voice against it when there were other people on these benches I was told I was only throwing cold water on the scheme. All farm organisations now admit that that scheme was biased against the smaller farmer.  About £60 million was paid out under that scheme.  I had intended to put questions to the Minister in relation to this scheme: how much money was paid out to farmers in the £30 valuation and under, how much was paid to farmers with valuations of between £30 and £100, and to those with valuations of more than £100?  The replies would be astonishing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> Unless there is a change in that system under the promised western package we will have to conclude that an attempt is not being made to help the smaller farmers to develop.  I hope the grants will be at least 50 per cent and that low interest loans will be made available to smaller farmers to help them to lay down yards for their cattle because there are many young energetic farmers who are extremely anxious to develop but who cannot because they cannot take their cattle off the farms in winter.  Such farmers also need fertiliser and ground limestone subsidies so that they can manure their land properly.</P>
    <P>As I have said, production subsidies are more important than big price increases.  Price rises are all very well while they last but the farmer is in trouble when they cease.  I appeal to the Minister to keep this point in mind because price rises cannot continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Subject to the criticisms I have made, the Government have done a reasonable job in this budget.  No farmer is satisfied, but nobody is ever satisfied with what he gets.  It must be remembered that farmers have suffered a loss in income during the past two years which no other section of the community would tolerate.  However, farmers are reasonable people and they realise that this loss was caused to a great extent by circumstances outside the control of the Government and that the Government did make an effort to come to their assistance.  Today's farmer does not want handouts but he is developing an industry which is of vital importance to our economy.  Things would have been much worse last year but for the income generated through the export of livestock. Unfortunately that income may be reduced this year due to the reduction in the herd.</P>
    <P>Let not anyone say that the Fianna Fáil Party are not interested in promoting the growth of agriculture because I do not know of any other party who are more aware of the real situation of farmers, and the measures contained in this budget are more appropriate to their needs than the proposals put forward by Fine Gael.  I am hopeful that farmers will have a better year in 1981 and that we <Col N="1149" /> will secure from the EEC a favourable western aid package which will enable the small farmer to develop his holding. Someone has said that the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer and up to a point this has been happening.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to local government and the increase in the Road Fund. In my county we have been given a substantial increase this year in the road grant and this is very important.  As a member of a local authority I have had to listen to prophecies of doom and gloom about our financial situation and I have been told that we did not have even the price of a shovel.  It is true that the roads have been deteriorating but the increase for this year shows that the Government are concerned to improve our infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I understand that housing grants will be increased this year and I thank the Government for this.  Much has been made of the fact that money was not freely available for local authority loans, but I would point out that until Fianna Fáil returned to office the amount of the local authority loan was too small to be of any use.  Even the present loan of £12,000 is low for a person building a house.  The income limit was raised from £4,000 to £5,500 and the result was that most local authorities received almost double the number of loan applications and had to stop sanctioning.  It is extraordinary how many people qualified when the income limit was raised to £5,500 and this was the cause of the scarcity of money.  I welcome the substantial increase in the amount allocated this year for local authority loans.</P>
    <P>I am very worried about the unemployment situation.  particularly among the young, and I am hoping that the measures taken in the budget will help to provide extra jobs and cut down the number of redundancies.  It is dangerous for any country to have a large number of well-educated young people who are unemployed.  When I was a boy the unemployed were uneducated and it was easy enough to satisfy them, but most of the young unemployed today possess <Col N="1150" /> their leaving certificates.  Their brains will not be left idle simply because they do not have employment, but their only interest will be in living on the dole.  They will use their brains in the wrong direction. Every effort has been made in this budget and I hope it will provide the required results of more employment for young people.  The most important job this budget does is to look after our young people.  There has been a lot of criticism of our young people but I often meet them at youth conferences and then ask questions relevant to the economy.  We have never had better young people and when they study the programmes of the parties and their records coming up to the election they will make their judgment in a reasonable fashion.  When I spoke to young people in Donegal I did not say that the economy was in tip-top shape but I told them that they had a choice between the collective responsibility Government of Fianna Fáil and the Coalition who have entirely different views on certain policies.  The young people will take that into account at a general election.</P>
    <P>Whether we win, lose or draw, I am glad that we introduced an honest, straight forward, harsh budget.  This budget shows concern for the less well-off. It takes from the haves and gives to the have-nots.  Nothing is free, so that has to be done.  This budget made a decent effort to do that.  The price increases have hit everybody, especially the price of petrol.  People in the city have a bus service, but a person living in County Galway who has to travel 30 miles to the city to work must have a car.  It is not a luxury anymore.  However, these increases had to be made in order to get the money to run the country.  If the Opposition can point out any method other than taxation by which to raise money let them tell us, but I believe they have no answer to it.  In this budget in what is supposed to be an election year the Government have proved their honesty. The press have highlighted the increases but in the long run the second reaction to this budget will be more favourable.</P>

      <P>I will not take it.  Something that disgusted me about the Dáil before the time control was introduced was people speaking for hours.  I saw a speaker here, when I was in Opposition, starting to speak at 4.30 p.m. and he spoke right up until the Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. and he was still going strong.  The same Deputy started the next day and it was 9 p.m. before I got in.  On both sides of the House the practice was that one speaker would be sitting in and when he went out another Deputy would come in and repeat exactly what he had said, but he could not be accused of repetion because he had not been there to hear the first speaker.  I never did that. One should say what he has to say in as few words as possible.  No matter what I would have to say I would find it hard enough to remain talking for over an hour.  I imagine I would become boring and naturally when one feels that one is a bore one should sit down.</P>

      <P>As time goes on, probably into next May, this budget will be more appreciated. If we have been accused of robbing the rich to help the poor I do not mind because I have a socialist outlook.  The budget did its best under very severe circumstances when we had come through a very big recession.  I hope that 1981 will see a turning in the economy and an upturn in employment as a result of the budget.</P>

      <P>Until the last two minutes of Deputy Callanan's speech I reflected on the thought that if he lived in almost <Col N="1152" /> any other constituency he would probably be speaking from these benches.  The last couple of minutes of his speech in which he invited us to consider the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, in the robes of Robin Hood was almost too much to bear.  Those robes would not sit lightly on the Taoiseach's shoulders and the garments that he wears under them are the garments that he has always worn, the mohair suit.  Deputy Callanan spoke of the need to rob the rich &mdash; and to look after the poor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To take from the rich.  If the rich resent giving, it is another matter, but they rarely do.  But if we are to take from the rich &mdash; and that is not the entire philosophy of this party, although it is a reasonable proportion of it &mdash; all I can say is that the effects of this budget on the rich people in our society have been very marginal indeed.</P>
      <P>In relation to this real, presumed or hoped for impact on the economy as a whole, this comes across as a very tired budget from a very tired Government. The Government might have been in power for 40 years it shows so little imagination and so little willingness to tackle the problems they have created and the problems that have been created outside. If we look at the parameters of our times and the parameters of the crisis we are facing &mdash; and we can barely avoid that as it is staring us in the face &mdash; unemployment has risen by a quarter in the last year to its highest level since the thirties. Every day there are further reports of lay-offs and redundancies and unemployment is now forecast to rise to between 135,000 and 160,000 over the coming year.  Industrial output has fallen in the last year and according to the last figures we have for September 1980 was down by over 10 per cent on 1979.  Farm incomes are estimated to have fallen in real terms by 25 per cent in the last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have done what they can in the budget but this has obviously not satisfied the farmers.  It is doubtful if anything they <Col N="1153" /> can get from Brussels will subtract to any degree from the level of dissatisfaction they feel.  The effects of the fall last year have been to some degree cushioned by massive de-stocking so that the outlook for next year, with a greatly reduced herd, is even worse.  We have only to look at the objective results of that and the closures affecting the meat industry, which should be one of our most buoyant and vital industries, to see how wrong the whole equation has gone.</P>
    <P>Prices have risen by over 18 per cent in the last year.  This morning's forecast, which I heard on the radio, is that inflation will be about 13½ per cent in the current year.  I suppose we are expected to take that as good news.  It is a sign of how very badly things have been going that an inflation rate of 13½ per cent is expected to be greeted with hurrahs and cheers as if the horse you had put your money on had won the Grand National. I suspect, if there is a fall in the inflation rate, that it may be only a temporary one and that the actions of the Government not only in this budget but in the last few budgets have put us inexorably on the road to a situation in which our inflation may reach Israeli-style levels.  I do not wish that on the Irish people but it is not I who have done that.  The Government by their actions are responsible for that.</P>
    <P>The degree to which the budget any longer does what people traditionally expected it to do is questionable.  If we were honest about it we would admit that the budget represents just one day in the year when a number of taxes are imposed and the Government make a statement about financial policy.  It is not, as it used to be, a housekeeping session for the year.  It is not, as it used to be, a day in which the auditors were called in to examine the books for the preceding year, the projections for the forthcoming year and give their judgment on them.</P>
    <P>It is not what it used to be for several reasons.  One reason is instalment budgeting, which is taking place in the public sector, notably, over the whole 12 month period of each year.  There is the rise in prices in public services.  The action of the Government in permitting price rises in other areas have a greater cumulative <Col N="1154" /> effect, taken over the whole year in some cases, on public revenues and public expenditures than any individual taxation item in the budget.  Another reason why budget days are not what they used to be is that just as political power is becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of the Cabinet &mdash; this is almost inevitable given our system, to some degree &mdash; so also the power that comes from information has fled from the Dáil, if it ever resided here to any great extent.</P>
    <P>All deputies, whether they come from the Government backbenches, like Deputy Callanan, or the Opposition front-benches, like Deputy Boland and I, come into the House to examine a budget. When we look at any budget we look at it with all the resources at our command, The resources at our command are what we have between our two ears and one-third of a clerk typist.  At the same time there is a proliferation of expertise in other bodies outside the House.  The trade unions &mdash; they could spend their money in no better way &mdash; have their research departments.  The employers and bankers have their research departments. The NESC hire economists by the new time to tell us what should be done and what cannot be done to help them make their recommendations to the Government. There is this extraordinary contrast between the enthusiastic amateurs in the House and the hard-bitten professionals outside it, those who have access to information and projections &mdash; Government Ministers, have access to the projections and facts in Government Departments &mdash; which are denied to us. We end up in a situation, so far as power is concerned, in which the people outside the House have power over many things and responsibility for nothing and those inside the House have power over very few things and responsibility for everything.</P>
    <P>It is time we looked seriously at the structure of the way in which we present and discuss our budgets.  I am in favour of the creation of an economic policy committee of the Dáil and of a social policy committee of the Dáil along the lines of the committee, set up with some considerable success, to handle the <Col N="1155" /> affairs of the semi-State companies, so that Members of the House will not be confined to what lies between their ears and the services of one-third of a clerk typist when it comes to evaluating the economic and social strategy of this or any Government.  I do not anticipate that committees of this kind will always be unanimous because that would presuppose a consensus model which, by definition, our Government and parliamentary system excludes, except on certain occasions and on certain policies.  It would, however, bring a focus on economic, social and budgetary policies back into the House where it belongs and it would bring expertise into the House and put it at the service of all Members of the House, regardless of whether or not they are in the Government.</P>
    <P>I believe such a committee should have the power to summon not only Ministers but senior civil servants as well to tease out the implications of budgetary and social strategy.  There is a long standing theory that the civil service is neutral &mdash; it is in a sense &mdash; but sociologically it is inconceivable that any large permanent body of people, many of whom are professionals, highly skilled, highly trained and highly knowledgeable, should not develop their own modalities of ways of doing things, their response to problems, their preferred options, which they will suggest to Ministers in contexts which make Ministers believe that they have choices whereas in fact they are funnelled inexorably towards the preferred choices of the administrative structure.</P>
    <P>I am not making any allegation of a party political kind because I do not believe that is the point.  I believe that, just as the political aspect of the nature of our administrative system must be taken cognisance of and that we should not treat our parliament in a total-like manner and assume that simply because we have representative democracy and vote here to elect a Taoiseach or to unseat one, that we have control over all institutions and over the budgetary and economic policies, which are largely farmed <Col N="1156" /> in the inner workings of these institutions.</P>
    <P>In relation to the budget in particular I believe that a good case could be made for it if it was introduced in 1978.  I believe it would still be open to substantial criticism even in 1978 but it was not introduced then.  It was introduced in 1981. Worse than that, it cannot even begin to put right the problem created by the budgets of 1978, 1979 and 1980.</P>
    <P>More seriously, it is being introduced at a time in which there is increasing scepticism about the figures on which the Government are basing their budgetary protections.  Governments will always choose the figures most suitable to themselves. That goes without saying, and it is quite legitimate.  Up to now there has been at least an assumption that the figures the Government choose will bear some kind of relation to what actually happens at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>It is always reasonable to claim an over-shoot here, or exceptional circumstances, or that the Arabs are at it again, or whatever.  The figures with which we have been presented lack even that basic credibility.  Take the Estimates, for example.  The level of indebtedness by local authorities, over and above what has been given to them in this Book of Estimates, will probably amount to a minimum of £100 million in the coming year.  If that £100 million is not in the Estimates, it has to be added on to the borrowing.  That is the only option if we are not to increase taxation further.</P>
    <P>I had a miniature example of something similar in the Department run by the Minister of whom I am the counterpart on these benches, the Minister for Education.  In response to a question of mine the other day he announced a 10 per cent increase in the new fees for secondary schools.  It may be the case that this grant will not all fall due in the current year, but I somewhat doubt that. When I asked him where this £1½ million was to be found in the Estimates, all he would say was that the Government would meet all the Claims on the Estimate for the Department of Education. The subhead we were talking about had actually been increased to a very miserly <Col N="1157" /> degree in relation to last year.  As far as I know, it was paid at last year's level. There is a Supplementary Estimate of £1½ million for the Department of Education before we start.  God knows what will happen in the school transport service and all the other areas in which cuts have been made beyond the limits of what can be believed or, I suspect, what can be done.</P>
    <P>When we look at the figures and the projections for the borrowing requirement, the same credibility explosion occurs.  Last year the projection was for £896 million foreign borrowing requirement. The actual foreign borrowing was £1,217 million, that is, an increase of 30 per cent from the beginning of the year to the end.  We are supposed to be borrowing £1,296 million this year.  This is the Minister's projection as of January 28.  I do not know what to say because, if the over-shoot this year is to be 30 per cent, in other words at the same rate as it was last year, we will be paying a terrible price for the time we are buying.</P>
    <P>I do not know if people generally realise exactly how big that price is.  If they do not, I suspect the reason is that they have not been asked to pay their full whack of it yet.  They are becoming aware slowly of the fact that almost 70p of every £1 they pay, willingly or unwillingly, in income tax goes towards our foreign debt servicing.  They are not yet aware of the real costs.  The real costs are evident and will be much more evident when the services are cut.</P>
    <P>People always have a residual objection to paying income tax, or taxation of any kind, but they will continue to pay taxation, at least grudgingly, for as long as they are getting services.  When it becomes increasingly evident that the money they are paying, the money they have earned by the sweat of their brow, is going in the shortest possible space of time, via the Exchequer, into the vaults of some German, or Dutch, or Saudi-Arabian bank, they will not be just displeased. They will become angry, aggrieved and resentful.  This may provoke a kind of social situation in which the Government will be powerless to prevent the effects of any cuts which have to <Col N="1158" /> be made from falling most heavily on those with the least ability to bear them.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to inflation.  It is a sad day when we are expected to run up flags for a projected inflation rate of 13½ per cent.  I should like to turn very briefly to the question of the social welfare increases.  By and large I welcome those increases.  The Government have been meaner than they might have been. In a number of crucial categories very small extensions of the scheme could have been made at comparatively small expense in order to ensure greater equity.</P>
    <P>For example, the greater increase in social welfare is designed for long-term social welfare recipients.  Long-term social welfare recipients do not include people on unemployment assistance because of the fiction &mdash; and unfortunately for many people it is a fiction &mdash; that people on unemployment assistance are shortly about to get a job.  We all know what happens.  People lose their jobs. They are made redundant.  They get their redundancy payment.  They get their unemployment benefit.  They run out of stamps and they go on unemployment assistance.  Increasingly these days, if they are over 40 or 45 years of age when they are first made redundant, they will be on unemployment assistance to the bitter end of their days.  They could be on unemployment assistance for a decade and yet the Government regard them as not being long-term social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>Another area of importance is in relation to the extension of the telephone facility to certain categories of disabled people.  Members of the House will be aware that there are two forms of disability payments.  There is the disability pension and there is the disabled persons maintenance allowance.  One is slightly higher than the other.  People who have the option generally opt for the one which gives them the extra £1 or £1.50 a week. These people have been excluded from the operation of the scheme because they opted, as was their right, for one scheme rather than another.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare, when he is taking the necessary administrative and perhaps legal steps, to <Col N="1159" /> do something about this and, at the very least, not to create the invidious class distinction between the unfortunate physically handicapped people in our society which this provision creates.  It is a small price to pay in that department.</P>
    <P>I shall now turn to the question of taxation.  Last year an elaborate piece of juggling was done in an attempt to persuade PAYE workers that Christmas had come and life would never be so good again.  At the end of the year we saw what happened.  The harvest of taxation reached by the Government's mammoth inflation rate had removed in some cases most, in other cases all and in other cases more than the amount of the benefit they thought they were receiving at the beginning of the year.  It is undeniable that this budget does not attempt to pull that kind of confidence trick but there are many confidence tricks hidden in it here and there.</P>
    <P>We are told that the concession to PAYE workers will amount to £60 million this year and to more in a full year. I query the use of the word &ldquo;concession&rdquo;. If income tax allowances were indexed and the kind of adjustments made that the Government are making at present that would be a concession.  In a situation in which allowances are not indexed, any Government rearrangement of the taxation system which does not result in the PAYE category as a whole paying less rather than more is not a concession but an imposition.  For a start, we know the history of the £40 million which is due to the increase of another £200 in the special allowance to PAYE workers.  The history of that is that it was wrung out of an unwilling Government by the trade union movement on the eve of a national understanding. Not even the Minister for Finance expected us to believe him when he came into the House portraying that as a concession.</P>
    <P>It is indisputable that the extra revenue which will be generated this year in the PAYE sector for the Government over and above the concessions or allowances which are being made in the budget will be between £140 and £150 million.  Therefore, the PAYE sector this year are <Col N="1160" /> between £140 and £150 million worse off. This brings me back to Deputy Callanan's contention that one must take from the rich to give to the poor and to the Government's contention that in the budget they are doing precisely that.  The genesis of the whole PAYE revolt over the last few years has been the belief that the Government are not taking from the rich to give to the poor but are taking from the slightly better off to give to the worse off.  Transfers are taking place in the economy but they are leaving the upper reaches of the economy virtually unscathed.  Speculators, people who make quick capital gains and others have had their situation dramatically improved over the last four years by a whole series of legislative and administrative arrangements brought in by the Government. The load must be carried by someone and it is being transferred from their broad shoulders &mdash; they were not carrying much to begin with &mdash; to the ever narrowing band of people whose incomes are subject to scrutiny by the tax authorities, who have no access to special reliefs, who do not have the capital to speculate and make gains and who are becoming more and more disturbed by, as they see it, the disproportionate burden they are asked to bear.</P>
    <P>If the Government in their search for an incomes policy, and all Governments need incomes policies, thought seriously about the situation they would spend less time talking about the need for moderation and restraint on the part of workers and more time examining their own conscience to see how many immoderate and unrestrained claims &mdash; I have yet to see a claim that goes beyond the rate of inflation &mdash; are due to the growing perception among wage earners that the tax system is unjust and inequitable.  If people see the system as unfair their willingness to pay towards its maintenance will be correspondingly reduced and that is unmistakably what has happened over the last three or four years.</P>
    <P>The irony is that they can be backed up in their belief that the system is unfair by no less an authority than the Central Bank.  In their winter report for 1980 they have more imagination and progressive <Col N="1161" /> thinking in relation to the tax system in it than the Government have been able to produce in the budget.  If ever there was an indictment of a Government for lack of imagination and willingness to do anything it is in that statement.  The Commission on Taxation are sitting but one would have thought that some of the things in the Central Bank report are so obvious and have been pointed out so many times that the Government would not have to wait for the commission to report to them to do something about the situation.  According to Joseph O'Malley in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last week the commission are divided and are unlikely to produce an agreed report for a considerable time.  Does that mean we will have to wait for a considerable time for any greater degree of equity in the tax system? I sincerely hope not.</P>
    <P>In page 45 of their report the Central Bank state:</P>
    <P>The width of the tax base also has implications for equity.  A narrow tax base, in particular with respect to income tax, has led to perceived horizontal inequity and therefore tax resistance and conflict between different groups in society.  Only if the burden of taxation is seen to be spread more equally will these problems abate.</P>
    <P>The language is somewhat mandarin but the sentiment is unmistakable.  There is inequity and the Government are responsible for it.  It is that inequity, more than anything else, that makes the Government's attempts at an incomes policy so laughable.  The sad fact is that even when workers succeed in getting claims which will compensate them for the worst ravages of inflation in money terms, they discover that their standard of living, the quality of their lives and that of their families is not as good as it was because they have to dig deeper and deeper into their pockets for goods and services formerly provided by the public sector but which are not being provided by them any more because the Government are cutting back on the public service.  This is especially true in education and in all areas relating to local authority services. <Col N="1162" /> It will become an increasing feature of life in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank, the new found haven of radicalism, points out in relation to interest on personal borrowings for tax purposes:</P>
    <P>It is arguable, however, whether any interest on personal borrowings, with the exception of interest on borrowings to finance the acquisition of assets, &mdash;</P>
    <P>that would be house mortgages, for example &mdash;</P>
    <P>should be an allowable expense for tax purposes.  Tax concessions on such loan interest amount, in effect, to a subsidy on personal borrowings and tend to divert savings from the financing of investment.  It is difficult to see the justification for such a subsidy, which is likely to lead to a misallocation of resources and a loss of efficiency.</P>
    <P>Of course the other aspect of this form of tax relief is that the goods on which these personal borrowings are spent are almost universally expensive imported consumer goods.  The more expensive they are the more interest you pay and the more relief you get because the relief is not at the standard rate of tax, which would be an interim step but at the marginal rate of tax.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for Finance told me that in 1981 the cost to the Exchequer of the income tax relief to the buyers of Volvos, Mercedes, yachts, and God know's what will be approximately £12 million.  I believe that that £12 million should not be borne by the Exchequer in the majority of cases.  The bitter truth of it is that it is the buyers of these expensive items who will be in a position to claim relief against their income tax whereas the ordinary people out in Artane, Howth or wherever, who has mortgaged themselves up to the back teeth with hire purchase agreements on furniture, cookers, fridges and things like that which are essential, either will not be earning enough to make the relief worth anything to them or simply will not know sufficient about the way the financial system works to be able to take advantage <Col N="1163" /> of it.  Therefore that relief is extremely regressive.</P>
    <P>Again the Central Bank isolates one area in respect of which we in the Labour Party have been roaring and screaming about the need for more taxation in recent years.  In their report or Quarterly Bulletin for Winter 1980 they say:</P>
    <P>The banks should be subject to the same taxation system as other non-manufacturing enterprises.</P>
    <P>(v)  Differences beween the standard rate of taxation on corporation profits and the levels of taxation paid by banks have been due to the various taxation-related lending schemes, such as, leasing, Section 84 loans and preference share financing.  If these were abolished it is tentatively estimated that in a full year the banks' liability to taxation in the state would increase by approximately £40 million &mdash; a figure which should be regarded as an order of magnitude.</P>
    <P>Those are not the words of some wild, left-wing orator standing on a soap box throwing his arms around at the corner of Abbey Street.  Those are the words of the economic commentary of the Central Bank.  And if the economic commentary of the Central Bank suggests that the banks at least should contribute another £40 million to taxation revenue, if they were taxed in the same way as other business, then it is something at which the Government should be looking very seriously indeed.  If they are not looking at it, then they need to examine their consciences, and if they will not examime their conscience we will do it for them.</P>
    <P>I will not talk about the wealth tax to any great degree because it has become a hardy annual, especially from these benches.  More is the pity that it has become a hardy annual because every year that passes the amount of lost revenue from that tax increases.  The same is true of the capital gains tax, whose effect has been reduced by 70 per cent by the present Government.  I daresay that when one adds together the capital gains tax and the wealth tax alone, since the time the first was emasculated and the <Col N="1164" /> second suspended, and if one divided the 84 Fianna Fail TD's into the amount of money that has been foregone by the Exchequer because of the abolition or emasculation of these taxes, one would come to the regretful conclusion that over the four years in question each of those Fianna Fáil Deputies, and each of their votes in the lobby to elect the Taoiseach of their choice, has cost this country £3 million or £4 million.  I only hope that when the time comes the country will come to the conclusion that it has not been worth it.</P>
    <P>The overall reaction to this budget has been bad.  It will not get better, as some Government speakers seem to hope, and it will not get better because people, while they see the financial changes that have been made particularly in relation to social welfare, do not believe that the leopard changes its spots.  They do not see this as any long-term change of heart on the Fianna Fáil side.  Even within Fianna Fáil, despite the public trumpetings and blowings, there is deep resentment about some budgetary provisions.</P>
    <P>I was in a pub down the country only last Thursday.  I was recognised when I went in for a drink.  A man near me started to talk about politics.  After a few phrases he said he was in Fianna Fáil.  I said: &ldquo;Fair enough.  What do you think of the budget?&rdquo;  He said he had nothing to say about the budget.  A few minutes later, of course, he was talking quite freely about the budget, and his first comment was: &ldquo;They gave too much to the idle.&rdquo;  He was a supporter of the Government. After that he said: &ldquo;They gave too much to the farmers&rdquo; and, after that, he said they did not give enough to him.  It went on to the point &mdash; and he was not being pressed by me on this &mdash; at which he expressed himself in disagreement with virtually every single plank of the Government's economic policy.  At the end of it I said: &ldquo;Look, you disagree with almost every aspect of the Government's economic policy.  Why do you go on voting for them?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;Ah, Well, I vote for them for other reasons&rdquo;.  Now, it is difficult to argue with that, but I am hoping that when the time comes for the next election these mythical legendary or <Col N="1165" /> other reasons, whatever they are, will not weigh as heavily in people's hearts or pockets as will a realisation of what this Government have done over the last four years and of what more they will do if they are permitted to come back for another four years.</P>
    <P>We are often accused on these benches of being all spenders and no taxers.  I have suggested four major headings on which a start could be made in increasing public revenues through taxation.  I would emphasise that it is a start only, because while wealth must be created in society wealth must also be taxed in society, and ownership has to be shared in society.  Until that is done there will be no perception of any equity in the taxation system and Governments of any persuasion and of any colour who fail to take these steps will pay the price at the polls.</P>
    <P>At the end of the Taoiseach's speech the leader of the Labour Party and myself commented here on the glum looks ranged in rows behind the Taoiseach.  I likened them to Kamikaze pilots waiting to go out on a mission.  I do not think the situation has changed over the past week. It has become fashionable on these occasions to call for a general election immediately so that the people will have an opportunity to pass judgment on the Government of the day and not just on their budgets but on the budgets of their predecessors.  Let me say that I do not much care when the election comes because I know it will come and I know that after it is over Fianna Fáil will not be in the majority in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity of making a few comments on this budget.  I should like, first, to congratulate the Minister for Finance on his appointment.  I have been listening to Deputy Horgan for the past few minutes. I want to say to him, and indeed to all the people across in those benches, that when the general election does come I have no doubt but that once again Fianna Fáil Deputies will be sitting on this side of the House.  Indeed, listening to Opposition speakers in this Debate over the past couple of days it must be said they have advanced no alternative policies, <Col N="1166" /> none whatsoever.  I am confident that when the Taoiseach does call a general election once again the people will give Fianna Fáil the mandate of carrying on the task of progress and expansion generally.</P>
      <P>We have heard from the opposite benches that public expenditure has been cut back.  I would like to ask them to outline clearly and concisely where the cutting back has taken place.  In all aspects of the capital budget there have been, even in this year of financial restraint, widespread increases in expenditure on all fronts, in education, in agriculture, in grants to local authorities and, more particularly, to the social welfare recipients.  Vast increases have continued to take place and indeed when the occasion arises during the year, as happened last year, increases will be implemented as necessary.  For that reason I am confident that, when our Taoiseach does call a general election, once again this party will be given the mandate because there is no alternative.</P>
      <P>Listening to the comments of my constituents over the past seven or eight days I found that the reaction to this budget was very favourable.  This party has consistently put to the people the problems which exist because of world wide recession and the people, as always, will accept the constraints which were necessary in this budget.  In outlining his budget the Minister stated that he must have regard to the social as well as the economic aspirations and to our capacity to pursue those aspirations to make an effective impact in achieving progress and harmony within the community.  He went on to say that at the best of times it was difficult to reconcile the expectations and needs of the different elements of society. That sums up the budget in its widest aspect.  We must have regard to social as well as economic and financial aspirations. That is important in the society in which we live.  In this year of severe constraints on financial expenditure the budget has expanded in all sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to go on to the Minister's references to agriculture.  Agriculture has gone through a difficult period during the two years 1979 and 1980.  During the early <Col N="1167" /> seventies there was an unprecedented reflection in regard to farmers' incomes. The agricultural sector has benefited well from this budget but this is only part of the package.  In so far as agriculture is concerned I am confident that the Minister for Agriculture will, in the very near future, announce some further packages of aid to boost one of our most important sectors, agriculture.  The Government have viewed with serious concern the decline in farmers' incomes over the past couple of years.  Through their package of aids at the end of last year and in this budget the Government have shown that they are committed to improving the lot of farmers who are the backbone of this nation.  We realise the importance of agriculture, of building up the farm family, and of granting aids to enable young farmers particularly to make a good living from farming.  The Government will continue to aid this important sector through the allocation of grants.  The grants made last year towards the farm modernisation scheme is a further indication of the willingness of the Government to improve the lot of the Irish farmer as is the doubling of the rates of grant under the disadvantaged areas scheme and the inclusion of other areas in it, brought about by the good work of the Minister for Agriculture.  We agree that enough is not being done but as I have already stated the Government are examining ways and means of helping farmers and will continue to do this in the months ahead.  Like most European countries we have been hit very badly by this world recession.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming review of EEC farm prices will provide an opportunity to compensate farmers for rising costs. There are constraints within the EEC arising from the limitations imposed on the budget, but the Government are determined to obtain the best possible deal for our farmers.  From EEC reports I gather there are very good grounds for expecting that this year's price increases will be far more realistic than those of previous years.  This is as it should be. Due to the very small increases in the price of agricultural goods received last year, farmers' incomes declined.  I have <Col N="1168" /> no doubt that this year the improvements will be exceptional and that our farming community and those in the agricultural sector will enjoy once again the favourable conditions that prevailed prior to two years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the problems in disease eradication and its importance not only to the agricultural sector but to the nation as a whole.  I am glad he decided to suspend the disease eradication levy because farmers are facing very exceptional difficulties at present and this bill is being met by the Exchequer at an estimated cost of well over £9 million. The Government will continue to review the position and will decide in the light of prevailing conditions whether the levy should be reimposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister derated farms under £50 valuation and derated farms between £50 and £70 valuation by 50 per cent.  This shows the importance the Government place on boosting agriculture.  I hope ACOT will investigate the problem affecting agriculture in different counties and try to find ways of alleviating these problems.  This organisation received a very substantial sum of money in the capital budget and they are doing a very good job.  I know they will continue to do this work in an excellent manner in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>An Foras Talúntais are being asked to experiment with new varieties of potatoes. The Minister provided £250,000 to assist the development of the seed potato industry and to alleviaté the present position.  Developing the seed potato industry is very important in certain parts of this country and we hope there will be further expansion in this area in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the farm taxation problem.  He said in the 1980 budget that farm income tax, rates on land and the resource tax were estimated to yield about £86 million and farm incomes had fallen by about 4 per cent in 1979.  They have since fallen far below that figure and I am glad to note from the Minister's speech that farming organisations, officers of the Department and the Revenue Commissioners are looking for ways to simplify farm accounts.  I have no doubt <Col N="1169" /> that this report will be made available shortly.  This report will indicate where losses are made and show where improvements can be made.  This is important.</P>
    <P>In a recent speech the Minister for Agriculture referred to the improvements in farm incomes and said farmers could make further improvements by greater production and improved farming methods.  This, side by side with the improvements announced in the budget, will go a long way to improve farmers' incomes and their standard of living, not alone this year but in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government saw fit to discontinue the resource tax.  This tax, like rates on agricultural land, has to be paid without taking into consideration a farmer's ability to pay.  For that reason it is unjust and the Government made a wise decision by discontinuing this tax and derating agricultural land under £50 valuation and derating by 50 per cent all land between £50 and £70 valuation.  This is an indication of the Government's interest in boosting the development of agriculture, and more particularly, farmers' incomes.</P>
    <P>Turning to improvements in the social welfare benefits, it is the policy of the Government and of this party down through the years to boost substantially the income of social welfare recipients and of the less well-off section of our community.  Nobody denies that this is the right policy and should be continued. Improvements of 20 or 25 per cent were announced in the budget and this policy will continue.  Nobody will deny social welfare recipients their just and fair increase.  While taxation introduced on tobacco, spirits and petrol, will to a certain extent increase the cost of living, nevertheless it is on non-essential items. Therefore, the people will accept it, bearing in mind the benefit which will accrue to social welfare recipients and to income tax payers whose special PAYE allowance was increased from £400 to £600. Other concessions have also been given. We realise that these concessions must come from taxation and we all accept that indirect taxation is the only alternative. Direct taxation is not the proper method <Col N="1170" /> to improve the benefits which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The overall reaction to the budget was very fair.  Members of the Opposition who have already contributed to the debate have been critical, but when you do criticise it is important to put forward alternative policies.  They have not come up with alternative policies to put to the people in the forthcoming election whenever it comes.  I am confident that as a result of this budget, which is one of progress and expansion in a year of considerable financial contraints, people once again will give a mandate to Fianna Fáil and to the Taoiseach to continue the policies of expansion in the economy.</P>
    <P>Policies which the Government have implemented over the past two years are now bearing fruit.  Indications are, according to the Taoiseach when he spoke on the budget last week, that there is an upturn in the economy.  The base has been laid so that when the worldwide recession ends we will be in a position to expand the economy still further.  Proposals were announced by the Government recently in the programme for financial investment, particularly in the areas of telephone expansion, the developing of industry, building of advance factories for industry and encouragement by the State to attract private investment in the development of the nation.  It is important that people should be encouraged to aid financially the developments that are taking place by financial injection so that we will benefit from the improvements which will take place this year and in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the areas of expansion which have taken place in the development of the health services and the amounts that are being made available in the capital budget for their benefit throughout the country.  This year as in previous years the increases have been substantial and the improvements in the health services in regard to the free fuel vouchers, which have been increased again, are an indication of the Government's commitment to improve the lot of the less well-off section of the community. The Government, notwithstanding any comments from the Opposition, <Col N="1171" /> will continue this policy which is the right one in regard to helping and giving the necessary aids to the less well-off sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made reference to the poor international outlook and said it was both a challenge and a warning to our relatively small economy.  He said that the Government were not prepared to let the economy drift in the prevailing international recession.  He said that active support for investment development and employment remains at the centre of the Government's strategy.  The present lull in economic activity elsewhere must be seen as an opportunity for a breakthrough in the development of the national economy.  He further states that the investment plan aims at concentrating available resources on directly productive investment and supporting infrastructure.  He concludes by saying that this would create the foundation for further and faster national growth when more buoyant economic conditions follow the expected upturn in world trade later in 1981.</P>
    <P>That confirms what I have stated, that the Government in the last two years have been laying the foundation of the various infrastructures so that when there is an upturn in the economy we will benefit. That will happen because of the wise decisions and foundations laid by the Government.  The 1981 Estimates for the Public Service make it clear that the Government intend to follow such policies. The Government will continue a policy of expansion and progress.  Unlike Opposition speakers we are confident of facing the electorate to seek a further mandate and of the Government being returned. The people will give Fianna Fáil a further mandate to continue the progress for the good of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather loath to comment in detail on the contribution of Deputy Noonan but I could not help reflecting as I listened to him on the marked similarity between sections of his contributions and sections of the contributions made by Deputies who supported the Government in 1975 and 1976, a Government which I supported.  I am a little <Col N="1172" /> afraid that it is rather pious and hopeful thinking on the part of Government Deputies in the present era and in modern society to expect that the general public will appreciate the constraints on Government and are prepared to realise that they must adopt a responsible approach.  That has not been the trend in this or in other European countries in the last decade.  I am afraid we have begun to see more and more the politics of greed and the politics of pressure groups.  We have begun to see more and more in difficult economic times that people insist on using their muscle, their organised power, to wrest for themselves the best possible deal in worsening economic climates. From that point of view any Member, like Deputy Noonan, or my colleagues of the mid-seventies, who profess publicly their belief and confidence in the responsible attitude of the general public need to think again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that last week's budget is the sort of one that will be received in the manner Deputy Noonan expects it will.  I do not think a budget that did not appear to have any definite purpose will be accepted as one designed to stand the test of an election contest or as one designed to remedy ills in the public finances.  The impression I have gained from the budget is that it has fallen between two stools.  On the one hand it is endeavouring to create as favourable as possible a climate for a general election and, on the other hand, it endeavours in certain aspects to mend the Government's hand in the irresponsible approach to continued and deepening deficit budgeting in the last number of years.  Deficit budgeting had been carried on since the mid-seventies but it has deepened and has begun to eat into current expenditure because of the amount of money needed to service the public debt.  Deficit budgeting has been repeated successively since 1977 by Fianna Fáil and not, as Deputy Noonan said, over the last two years.  Perhaps there are Fianna Fáil Members who would be inclined to or prefer to forget that their party has been in power since 1977.  They got into power on promises made in that year.  The policies, such as <Col N="1173" /> they were, have been enforced since 1977 by Governments under two successive Leaders elected in 1977 by the one public. It is not good enough for certain sections in the Government party to represent that there was a mini-general election approximately two years ago on the occasion of the change in leadership in Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Surely by 1981 the purpose of the Government should have been three-fold, to combat unemployment, to combat and reduce inflation and to work to bring about a progressive reduction in the balance of payments.  I do not think the budget will succeed to any marked degree in any of those areas.  I would have thought that all the exhortations made to the Government by the differing economic experts, all of whom were in agreement that there was a necessity for such an approach in this difficult year, would have convinced the Cabinet that there should be a central theme, not referred to in a pious way, throughout the budget speech.</P>
    <P>It appears that there had been an expectation that the aspects that the Government hoped would be sugar-coated ones in their budget would lead to their re-election.  It appears that there was an expectation that the rather minimal personal taxation allowances, together with the farm package augmented by the Brussels announcement, the upturn in certain aspects of the construction industry and the social welfare increases, would spell election success.  Those items were delivered irrespective of the needs or constraints the condition of the economy demanded.  People are more discerning and more demanding now.  The general public, particularly the PAYE sector, quickly established that the tax benefits were not largely illusory but almost entirely illusory.  Those in the PAYE sector are able to work out, with the help of media commentators and others, whether they are better off in real terms as a result of the tax allowance adjustments. It is obvious to most people in the PAYE sector that the increases in the tax allowances offset against the increased payments which they will have to make in their PRSI moneys, offset by the <Col N="1174" /> increase in the cost of living through the impost of the direct taxes announced in the budget, will mean in real terms that they will probably be net losers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan referred this morning to the fact that the Government in net terms expect to get, he estimated, £140 million to £150 million extra in income tax from the PAYE sector.  That means that when not even the most optimistic of Government supporters can expect a large increase in the workforce, the same number of people at work are expected to pay £140 million extra this year.  They are not Deputy Horgan's figures, they are not mine; they are not Opposition figures. They are the Government's own figures. The same number of people who are working now it is hoped will still be in employment in a year's time and on the Government's own figures they will have paid £140 million extra.  Against that we have to balance whether the rate of inflation will be and whatever increase of earnings they will have gleaned by virtue of the national understanding.  Most PAYE workers have already established for themselves that at best they are at a standstill and most likely will turn out to be net losers through claiming additional allowances by the tax allowance adjustment and on the other hand paying more in PRSI payments and indirect taxation on what have become commonly and rather unfairly referred to as &ldquo;the old reliables&rdquo; and in seeing the CPI increases as they work down over the 12 months &mdash; the effect of the increases in petrol, diesel, telephone and postal charges.  All of these items individually are dismissed as being minimal but collectively they will have a marked effect on the CPI, the rate of inflation and people's living standards in real terms.</P>
    <P>PAYE workers are also beginning to realise that in times of continually high inflation, failure to index the tax balance to take account of that inflation means that, irrespective of whatever their salary or wage increases may be, they are the net losers, and in an economy where, as Deputy Horgan pointed out, the tax base is already too narrow and too few contributors are expected to carry too many non-contributors, those contributing, if <Col N="1175" /> adjustments are not made in a truthful and realistic way on an annual basis, will find themselves progressively worse off. The PAYE worker is probably the single most important component in the electoral college that the Government would hope to persuade whenever the general election comes about.  I do not think that they can be influenced by short-term measures such as telling them about their special tax allowance, negotiated under the national understanding, of an additional £200, the slight change in the 35 per cent rate, the upturn in the construction industry or the social welfare increases.  Very quickly they work out for themselves that these gains are illusory and they make up their minds now on a Government's performance, not on the basis of a single-day, three-ring circus budget once a year.  They make up their minds over a period of time, probably half way through the lifetime of a Government and their perceptions after that are influenced only minimally.  I recall Government supporters in 1975 and 1976 making the sort of speech I heard Deputy Noonan, quite genuinely I am sure, make in the last hour, but I do not think that those speeches matter a whit any more. The electorate in 1975 and 1976 were waiting for the general election whenever it came about.  They were lying in ambush for our Government and eventually the trap was sprung and the election was called.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies now in relation to this Government and any other government faced with the hard economic decisions that have been put before governments in the late seventies in the western world and governments who take the easy way out by deferring real options, which has been the hallmark of the Fianna Fáil Government since 1977.  I do not think that anything they are going to do now will change the inevitable outcome. People see that the tax bands have not been changed and that their living standards are likely to fall as a result of Government policy this year.  To compound that, the Government's stated intention in the Book of Estimates of allowing only a 3 per cent rise in the <Col N="1176" /> spending area is indefensible and it will mean that by the middle of the year the public services will have to be cut back to a savage extent and there will be a fall back in the level of services provided by the health boards, local authorities and public departments.  They will recover, as they usually do, when central Government professes now to implement these strictures which actually they cannot put into force, and by the year end we all know that there will be either a further series of massive Supplementary Estimates as there were at the end of 1980 or, if there has been an election in the interim there may be, if a decision is made by whatever Government are there to right the public finances at the outset after the general election, a mini-budget. There is no way, on the Book of Estimates, that especially the health boards and the local authorities can survive during 1981 without a massive cutback in the level of their services and without bringing about unemployment.  The prospect of seeing the public authorities reducing their unemployment ratio substantially is not one that any Government could sustain now.  Extra moneys will have to be made available to the local authorities, especially to the health boards and the social agencies.  To enable that to happen there will have to be either Supplementary Estimates or a second budget at the fall of the year.  An economist is not required any longer to work out that sort of thing.  The general public now have the perception of the way in which this budget has been approached.</P>
    <P>There was no real attempt to tackle the deepening and fearsome problem of unemployment combined with inflation and the balance of payments problem. No imagination or innovation was displayed. Instead we saw a further conceding by the Government to the politics of pressure that I referred to at the outset. It reminds me of the efforts of successive Ministers for Finance in recent years attempting to shore up the breaches in the system.  Give a little bit here, a little bit of cement there and bolster that up there.  Keep it going for another year and perhaps the oil will come on stream, or perhaps there will be an upturn in the <Col N="1177" /> world economy from which we can benefit on a spin-off basis, or perhaps the British will get fed up with the fact that they cannot sell their exports, perhaps they will readjust sterling, perhaps they will get into the EMS.  Perhaps, perhaps but let us wait till next year.  Let us not take the unpopular corrective action.</P>
    <P>Possibly Governments are not entirely the single party to blame any longer in this attitude.  The employers, trade unions and Governments all bear a responsibility for bringing about this climate whereby Government political parties are so susceptible to pressure and so afraid to become even temporarily unpopular that they are unwilling to do what they know is right in the medium and long-term for the economy.  The pressure groups are now so powerful that they will bring about the unpopularity of that party and the consequent electoral danger of demise or defeat.  Where unemployment is at 125,000, estimated to be 150,000 and some of the forecasters estimate an Irish economy within several years with 200,000 on the live register, there is a responsibility not just on Government but on the unions and employers.</P>
    <P>Everyone in employment must contribute in additional taxation to provide the welfare payments for the unemployed. Trade union and employer representatives have a responsibility to ensure that the economy is put back on a sounder footing on behalf not only of their members who are employed in industry or providing employment but also on behalf of those who have no jobs, have never yet had jobs, those who are still at school and who are the potential work force.  No longer have the unions, the employers or the Government the right to mortgage the future job prospects of children still at school.  To some extent that is what has happened in the sort of deficit budgeting and Government financing we have had for a number of years, a situation brought about mainly by the Government because they have the ultimate decision and responsibility, but also brought about by social pressures and forces of other contributory bodies. The responsibility to restore the economy <Col N="1178" /> to a sounder basis rests now also with all the representative groups in society.</P>
    <P>In the middle of 1977 the then outgoing Taoiseach told a group of us that &mdash; I think it was in the London Summit &mdash; EEC Heads of State had spent a long part of the private meeting of the Nine members, as they were then, discussing whether democracy could stand the test of the next 15 years in Europe.  Not to my great surprise the Nine were rather pessimistic as to how the European institutions and governments would stand the test of the pressures, continued ravages of inflation, increased oil prices, energy crises, terrorist attacks and especially failure to provide employment particularly for young people.  Those were the areas about which they were worried and expressed pessimism.  Of all the European countries ours has the highest proportion of young people, of people looking for employment.  When we talk of the necessary steps being taken to correct Government attitudes to budgetary decisions and continuing budget deficits we are really talking about how well democracy here will stand the test.</P>
    <P>I have spoken here before about the fact that if we continue as Parliamentarians to turn away from real issues, continue coming here and surrounding ourselves in a cocoon of cotton wool we could have a situation after some years where this Chamber would not still be the democratically elected Parliament.  I do not want to see that and I do not think that very many here want to see it.  We all have an obligation to realise that the time has come for the hard options and that it will not be easy to survive in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is an obligation on political parties to do the right thing even if it spells the likelihood of their electoral defeat in the next general election whenever it may be.  The prospects now seem to be of an Irish economy with a work force of about the same number, an increasing number coming on the potential work force, a figure on the live register of unemployed of perhaps 150,000 or 200,000 or even 250,000.  They talk in Britain now of up to 3 million of the work force unemployed within the next 18 <Col N="1179" /> months.  Ten years ago who would have thought that would be possible in Britain without there being revolution?  Yet it is being talked of now.  The commentators now talk of about 200,000 unemployed in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Whatever about that number of unemployed, those in employment must provide through taxation direct or indirect social benefits at whatever level they are for that number.</P>
    <P>Say that by 1985 we have 200,000 unemployed.  Young people who became school-leavers in the mid-seventies and never succeeded in getting employment would be almost 30 by 1985.  We must ask ourselves how much longer can political parties expect people who have reached 30 and presumably would have had the opportunity of voting in three or four general elections, three local elections, several referenda and so on, to respect democracy, respect democratic institutions and continue to vote for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or any other party that might register under the democratic system?  Perhaps it would be a little unreasonable to expect somebody who has been 15 years unemployed since he left school to continue to vote for a party which he could fairly say had together with its parliamentary counterparts, been failing in the system.</P>
    <P>We could have a situation, which seems quite likely in the next five years, in which Irish currency would suffer a series of devaluations as a result of our commitments abroad and continued deficit budgeting in the latter part of the seventies.  We could see a situation that might in the long-term save democracy, where budgetary policy might be decided not by the Government here but by the International Monetary Fund.  Unpalatable as that would be it might be the only way that would enable democracy to stand the test of time referred to in the discussions of 1977.</P>
    <P>This is a very gloomy picture which it is no great joy for any of us in public life to have to paint but it is not an improbable picture given that over a number of years we have not faced the hard options. Deputy Noonan could claim, for instance, that Opposition speakers criticise <Col N="1180" /> without putting forward concrete alternatives.  To some extent that is true. To some extent also the Deputy knows the political folly of a principal Opposition party at any reasonable time before an election outlining in detail their electoral policy because the easier parts to implement will be taken and very quickly the Government will be wearing the Opposition's clothes which is not an attractive prospect for an Opposition's hope of success.  He is correct to some extent; there is need for more constructive speeches if the scenario is as black as I have suggested, and I fear it is.  For instance, if a few of the more constructive things could be explored again, things that have been explored over the past few years, why cannot we look at the hard options, and if money requires to be spent in the millions that we now deal in to make even the slightest adjustment in public finances, why have we not begun to encourage early retirement so as to provide further opportunities.  If we cannot expand the labour market we should at least try to free places by encouraging people to accept early retirement.  Why have we not begun to make it more unpalatable and more unpopular for people to have more than one job?  How many people have more than one job and how many have no job?  To what extent have we endeavoured to bring about a shorter working week?  In that respect the trade unions should examine their consciences as well.  If there is the prospect of 200,000 people unemployed, surely the representatives of those in employment should say to them that rather than having more material benefits for themselves perhaps they should accept a standstill in their own standard of living in order to provide jobs for their colleagues who are out of work?  Instead of additional money being offered to the labour force, they might be offered additional time off.</P>
    <P>Of course there is need for a deliberate, conscious Government policy of intensive adult education and retraining so that people in early retirement or those who have agreed to participate in a shorter working week may find some meaningful tasks to keep them occupied <Col N="1181" /> during the additional leisure time available to them.  Those are not unknown concepts.  They have been voiced in this House by me and others and they have also been put forward by various bodies within the EEC.  They are options &mdash; perhaps not palatable ones &mdash; that would free places in the market.</P>
    <P>Could there not have been a provision in the budget on the lines of the suggestion put forward each year by me that people under 21 years should be exempt from paying PRSI and their employers should be similarly exempt from making contributions in respect of them?  That would be a positive encouragement by the Government in respect of youth employment.  We must face the fact that PRSI has become a considerable burden on employers.  It is true that between the employer's contribution and the employee's contribution approximately £1 in every £7 or £8 of the wage paid to the employee is paid back to the State in PRSI.  For many of the benefits an unemployed person gets, he and his employer have paid handsomely into the scheme, as has the State.  It would encourage employers to take on young people and to train them if they were relieved of paying PRSI.  That suggestion has been put forward here since 1977 but it has not been acted upon.</P>
    <P>Because of personal circumstances I was not in the House for the budget speech and I had to listen to the analysis put forward on RTE.  This year they invited an even larger number of people from the various interest groups to make their comments on the budget.  For the first time they had a young man who represented the young people.  In asking him about his attitude to the budget and how it would affect the people he represented, the interviewer had to admit that they had brought him to the studio on a wild goose chase because the budget did not refer to youth at all.  Surely there was an opportunity this year to make some of the adjustments I have suggested in an effort to encourage youth employment? The time to cry &ldquo;stop&rdquo; so far as deficit budgeting was concerned was this year and because it did not happen I am afraid <Col N="1182" /> it makes for an even gloomier prospect for the next few years.</P>
    <P>Surely there should have been a commitment to progressive elimination of deficit budgeting.  I am not suggesting that the Minister for Finance should have made an announcement of its immediate elimination.  The country could not have withstood that reformation so quickly but there should have been a commitment to the phasing out of deficit budgeting over a reasonable number of years.  There should have been an exhortation to the rest of us to recognise that income must relate to output and that we cannot expect to enjoy an increase in real terms unless output is increased also.  There should have been an effort to get away from the circus aspect of budget day we have seen in recent years with all the trimmings and trappings of media attention, where budget day is regarded as the day for ladies in picture hats to pack the gallery, as the day when political supporters and people who operate on the periphery of politics crowd into Leinster House, as the day for the Minister to give with one hand and to take away with the other hand without making a real attempt to manage the economy.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of the budget this year was the emphasis placed on the capital budget.  The current budget was basically a non-event in that it gave as much as it took.  In the eighties there should be a decision that the budget will be an examination over a period of months of the Government's approach to spending and of the way they set about controlling finances and managing the economy.  This is where the investment plan shows its great weakness.  It is not possible to have an investment plan for massive infrastructural capital projects just for a 12-month period, as though all of us were going to fall off the end of the world at the end of 1981.  Capital budgeting has to be of a continuing nature. Infrastructural projects, if they are of any reasonable size must extend to more than 12 months.  There must be roll-on budgeting, there must be an economic plan. The concept of budget day being the time when the Minister for Finance smiles and holds up his briefcase is gone.  The day of <Col N="1183" /> wine and roses, of a make or break situation, is over.  It is a charade we cannot afford and it is time for us to stop it.</P>
    <P>The increase caused by the increases in indirect taxes will push the level of inflation over 10 per cent by mid-month.  This consequently will allow the demand for renegotiation of the national understanding, although it is quite fair for many employers to say that they have not been able to pay the first phase.  One of the few conscious and deliberate things which the current budget has done is to push the inflation rate over the cut-off point, so that these demands can legitimately be made and the whole national understanding negotiations put back into the melting pot.  These will be negotiations, as I said earlier, brought about to exercise the maximum amount of political muscle with, perhaps, not always consideration for the long-term prospects of the jobs of those who are still at school. Their argument, and a lot of the arguments in budgetary contributions, have been as to whether the increases in indirect taxation will bring about an increase of 2, 2½, 3 per cent or a bit more in the CPI.  This is probably quite irrelevant and we are all &ldquo;guesstimating&rdquo; to some little extent.  I would not be at all surprised if all these figures are wrong and the increases turn out to be even greater.  As regards the quite expensive postal and telecommunication charges, combined with the PRSI increase and increases in indirect taxes, and the most regressive tax of all announced in the budget, that on petrol and diesel, by the time all these work their way down through the economy, the increase could be of a magnitute larger even than 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>I want to refer particularly to the increase in the price of petrol and diesel and to tell the Minister of State who is present that, of all the increases brought about, politically the increase most unfavourably received was that on petrol and diesel, unfavourably received, not just by individuals because they realise it will cost them more to fuel their own car, but because they have noticed over recent years how every time the price of oil or oil products increases, it brings about, in <Col N="1184" /> a very short space of time, increases in the price of commodities on the shelf or on the shop counter.  Once you increase the price of petrol, you increase the cost of delivery.  Once you increase the price of diesel and oil, you increase the cost of manufacture.  People have become more discerning and are now much more able to work out for themselves that there cannot be increases in these areas without increases in the end products on the shelves and on the shop counter.  From that point of view the single and most regressive tax, and politically the most hurtful from the Government's point of view, is that on petrol and diesel.  I was amazed to hear Deputy Noonan describing it as being a tax on a non-essential. We all saw, on several recent occasions when oil and oil products became scarce or unobtainable, the effect it had on the Irish pound.  To say that that is a tax on a non-essential is ridiculous and untrue.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a firm commitment to hold down the level of non-pay spending in the public sector to an increase of 3 per cent in real terms.  All we can do in relation to that is to compare the present Minister for Finance's undertaking in that regard with the undertaking given by Deputy O'Kennedy in the same office, in February of 1980, when he gave an equally and, I quote, &ldquo;firm intention&rdquo; to keep the level of current spending to 12 per cent.  In fact, the current spending level turned out to be 20 per cent and the increase in spending on services turned out to be 19 per cent at a time when the official inflation figure probably would have been 18 per cent. One wonders whether the Minister's firm intention to sin no more will be any more successful than his predecessor's was.  I have already suggested that it is unrealistic to expect the public service, and especially the local authorities and health boards, to manage to survive in a year when inflation will probably be 15 or 16 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan this morning referred to the fact that the OECD had produced a report suggesting that Irish inflation for 1981 might be 13½ per cent.  He seems to fail to realise that the OECD report was produced at year ending 1980 and before <Col N="1185" /> the OECD were made fully aware of the incautious approach to budgetary policy of the Irish Government for 1981.  I imagine that the OECD will now revise their figures.  If there is going to be inflation, even on the OECD figure, of 13½ per cent, but, more likely, 15 to 16 per cent, how can the public service, and especially the local authorities and health boards, be expected to keep down to the levels exhorted by the Government?  There is no doubt that we will see either the Supplementary Estimates which I have referred to, or, if a general election takes place in the interim, more likely an autumn budget.</P>
    <P>There is also the danger that the £200 million for privatisation referred to in the investment plan, and about which it now appears to be very difficult to obtain details, combined with the continuing high level of Government borrowing, will mean a continued credit restriction on the private sector.  If there were to be an increase in the provision of employment opportunities, it should have been within the private sector and that does not appear to be so.  Apart from certain aspects of the construction industry, we are not going to see any opportunity for additional job places provided by the private sector, both because of the general effects of the budget and the budgetary effect on banking policy, thereby bringing a continuation of the restriction on credit.</P>
    <P>It has probably been generally accepted that during the late sixties and early seventies the Irish economy grew by something like 3 to 5 per cent, a varying rate over those years and at that time, because of the change in population and the change in the work force, the economy was maintaining employment and to some extent providing additional employment.  It seems to be generally accepted by economists that there is a necessity to have a growth rate of about 3 per cent annually so as to maintain employment levels.  There is argument, depending upon which type of economist, or perhaps which type of politician you are, and on what side of the political divide you are, that there will be no growth in the Irish economy this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> Even the most optimistic cannot expect growth in the Irish economy to be greater than 2 per cent in 1981.  That obviously will mean that the economy will find it virtually impossible to maintain employment levels even at the present rate.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, if we are going to see an increase in the number of young people coming on to the potential employment market without any additional job places being provided for them, we are continuing to sow the seeds of discontent and to provide a recipe for revolt against a democratic system which appears to be continuing to fail young people.  If we continue to adopt the sort of approach which we have seen once again from the Government in budgetary policy for 1981, we are, in effect, mortgaging the job prospects of the young children who are still at school.  When they join the pool of the unemployed, then they will, in turn, reject the political system which did not provide for them. That is the danger of this situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware of the unduly long delays which are still being experienced in respect of payments of almost all classes of social welfare allowances; and if he has any plans to end this situation which is causing hardship to many families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no undue delay in the issue by my Department of social welfare payments to qualified persons where correct identifying and other relevant particulars are available.  The time taken to process claims can vary, however, depending on the type of benefit, pension, allowance or assistance claimed and <Col N="1187" /> the information furnished by the claimants.</P>
      <P>In the case of long-term payments of pensions or allowances, it is necessary to obtain complete insurance records or to investigate means, as appropriate.  In particular, the investigation of means can take about six to eight weeks in certain cases depending on the extent of the inquiries.  Every effort is made, however, to reduce the time taken to complete the inquiries in all cases in order to avoid hardship to claimants.</P>
      <P>The time normally taken to process short-term claims, such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit is between one and two weeks provided the application form, containing all the necessary data, is submitted to my Department at the commencement of the claim.  Pay-related benefit is not payable in any event in respect of the first two weeks of the claim and all such claims are normally processed for payment within that period.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of January, however, some delays have occurred in the payment of short-term claims for disability benefit mainly because claimants have not quoted both their revenue and social welfare insurance numbers on claim forms and medical certificates submitted to my Department, despite an extensive press and television advertisement campaign in December and January requesting them to do so.  In addition, all existing claimants who had not furnished the two numbers were written to individually, but approximately one quarter of them failed to reply.  It is hoped, with the co-operation of claimants, to have this problem resolved as soon as possible and to resume prompt payment of benefit.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy is aware of any cases in which he considers that claimants are experiencing hardship through delay in payment I will arrange to have the cases investigated and payment of benefit issued as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am glad the Minister concedes that there have been delays in regard to sickness and disability benefit payments. <Col N="1188" /> The Minister gives the reason that people had not supplied either the revenue or the insurance numbers.  Surely where one number is supplied it would be a comparatively easy matter for an official to ratify one number with the other by a phone call or some other means and not to be keeping these people out of benefits for weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a total change in the scheme &mdash; there is complete modernisation going on in regard to the payment of benefits, computerisation.  From 6 April 1979 the RSI number came into being for new claimants and other entering the scheme at that stage.  Gradually all the claims will be on the RSI numbers. From 1 January last all claims are being processed through manual transfer to the computer of all existing claims, of which there are 67,000 to 68,000 a week to be handled.  At some time that had to be done and I gave advice about the transfer in the House before the process was begun.  Once the transfer has been done it will become a matter of referring to the computer.  By the end of this week all claims will be renumbered under the RSI numbers which will be the number henceforth. This major transfer work means a tremendous amount of overtime for the staff.  It means an enormous amount of extra work generally.  Because of the difficulties involved, we have advised people through television and newspaper advertising to quote the two numbers-during the transition period.  That process will have been completed in the near future and from then on it will be possible to deal with claims much more quickly &mdash; a matter of reference to a computer.</P>

      <P>It takes a lot of time.  At some stage we had to decide whether to computerise or not.  The day when even the most efficient commercial enterprise <Col N="1189" /> decides to computerise brings an enormous transfer of files.  That transfer is taking place in the Department and has been in the past few weeks.  Once that has been done, reference will be to the computer rather than the files.  It will all be there on the press of a button, unless there is some very early information which had not been given in individual files when they went into the computer. This is part of major modernisation which had to be done sometime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Power) Patrick Power">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>A State grant was provided <Col N="1190" /> some years ago for dredging the harbour at Renard Point pier, Cahirciveen, to a depth of 12 feet at mean low water of spring tide to meet the requirements of the local fishing fleet.  Kerry County Council who have responsibility for the harbour agreed to maintain this depth as a condition of the State grant.  Grants are not available from my Department for maintenance dredging.</P>
      <P>A request was made to my Department last October to provide berthage at the pier for a freighter which would be taking on frozen mackerel.  From inquiries made, my Department ascertained that the vessel in question is 200 feet in length and draws 18 feet of water.  My Department have requested the Office of Public Works to report on the feasibility of providing sufficient depth to give the freighter berthage at the pier without endangering the structure of the pier, and to estimate the cost of such a proposal.</P>
      <P>Until this report has been received, my Department will not be in a position to decide whether such a project would be feasible and economically justifiable in the fisheries interests.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are 37 jobs at stake there?  A number of employees have already lost their jobs because of factory closures in the area.  Would the Minister do everything in his power to see that something will be done quickly to clear this berthage? The clearance of the silt will require much more work than the maintenance job done by Kerry County Council.  It is vital that something be done, at a time when we are talking about the development of the fishing industry, to re-employ those who lost their jobs through factory closures.</P>

However, studies of wildlife species are undertaken as their conservation requirements dictate and as resources permit.  A recent survey of grey seals along the north-west coast produced an estimated population of 1,200 to 1,600, a continuing census of the Greenland white-fronted goose on its wintering grounds at Wexford shows an average population of 5,300 and 52 rare flora species have been identified and protected by statutory order.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Fish statistics are not available in relation to the 200 mile zone but rather are based on ICES &mdash; the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea &mdash; statistical zones which are internationally accepted statistical areas. The 200 mile zone forms only a portion of ICES zones VI and VII in which there is no constantly resident mackerel stock. However, the western mackerel stock <Col N="1199" /> which is found in ICES zones VI, VII and VIII was estimated at 1.8 million tonnes by ICES in 1980.  The total allowable catch fixed for this stock by the EEC Council for 1980, on the basis of ICES advice, was 350,000 tonnes of which 307,000 tonnes represented the share available to the Community.</P>
      <P>There was no agreement at EEC Council level on quotas for 1980.  There are no figures available as yet on the estimated mackerel catch taken by other countries in ICES zones VI and VII during 1980.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that this represents a very serious situation? We had no agreement on what should be taken in 1980.  According to Irish fishermen an enormous amount of mackerel was taken from that area and they are very concerned that the stock is endangered because of over-fishing.  Does the Minister feel that there should be agreement and that there should be precise quotas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>An effort was made to arrive at agreement and it went on through 1980 into December.  We had almost reached agreement on quotas for 1980 which would have had a certain sticking power for the coming year as well.  Our quota for mackerel was something in the region of 45,000 tonnes.  It was regretted that other matters such as access and structural matters were linked in with the quotas and agreement on the final package was not reached.  With regard to the Deputy's worry as to the stocks being endangered, fishing off the west coast would not endanger them half as much as fishing in the spawning grounds off Cornwall and elsewhere. While the information available to me is not complete it does not indicate that stock is in danger.</P>

      <P>It is accepted policy that, taking one year with another, the postal service should pay its way, and postal charges are fixed on that basis.  Concessions in charges for particular users can, therefore, be granted only at the cost of higher charges to other users of the service.  Much of the postings by organisations of the type mentioned by the Deputy already qualify for the reduced charges applicable to printed papers, and if further charge concessions were made, it would be impossible to resist requests for similar treatment from other organisations pursuing praiseworthy aims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to take Questions Nos. 17, 18 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>The quality of the service is monitored on an extensive and continuing basis by my Department.  The methodology employed differs from that described in the review groups report, the Department's tests being much more extensive. I am satisfied that the Department's methods are adequate for present purposes and I do not propose, therefore, to have surveys of the kind carried out for the review body undertaken at present, at any rate.</P>
      <P>Summary results of the Department's tests are made available regularly to the Post Office Users' Council.  These show some improvement in the quality of the service generally since the survey was undertaken.  Operator staff numbers have been increased over the last year or so, and additional &lsquo;10&rsquo; lines have been provided at a number of centres in both Dublin and the provinces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out, however, that until congestion in the trunk network is relieved according as the improvement schemes in progress and planned under the Government's accelerated telephone <Col N="1205" /> development programme are implemented significant improvements in the quality of the service cannot be expected in those aspects in which it is unsatisfactory at present.</P>

      <P>The categories of applicants to whom priority is afforded are determined on the basis of their need for telephone service in relation to other applicants.  Factors taken into account in considering whether priority should be accorded include:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contribution the applicants make to the welfare of the community either by way of service such as members <Col N="1207" /> of the Oireachtas, hospitals, certain doctors and clergy, local authorities and national unions give or by the employment the applicants afford.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Having regard to the fact that free rental is made available to elderly people would the Minister not think it would be reasonable to include elderly people on the priority list especially as time is more important to them than to younger people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. When old age pensioners live alone we give them a certain priority.  Normally when telephone installations are going on in a district and if there are applicants in the old age pension group or the social welfare group in great need, as was shown in my original reply, consideration is given.  It is not always easy to do what the Deputy asks.</P>

The Department will license the radio authority to use the transmitters and they in turn will make contracts with various organisations selected in various areas. The applications before us are not relevant at this time because all we will be doing is passing them on to the independent radio authority for their consideration.

      <P>As regards the Safety of Life at Sea Bill, Government approval has been given to me for the drafting of legislation which will enable Ireland to accede to this convention thereby requiring tankers over 20,000 tons to be inerted.  This legislation is currently being drafted by the parliamentary draftsman and I expect to introduce it in the House next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recommendations 18 to 32 relate to questions of navigational safety at the berth at Whiddy in the event of the terminal being rebuilt and will be made conditional on any permission which may be granted for the rebuilding.  The Department of Labour and the local fire authority, who are Cork County Council, would also be concerned with the implementation of these recommendations in so far <Col N="1222" /> as they relate to fire or safety precautions. When the Bantry Bay Harbour Authority became operative they would take over certain responsibilities from the Department of Transport.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 9 is the completion of check lists by tankers before port entry and the EEC has already drawn up a directive to this effect.  Ireland has forwarded to Brussels a draft order implementing the directive to confirm that it covers the position.  The draft has now been cleared in Brussels and the making of the order is in hands.</P>
    <P>I also announced, when the tribunal report was released, that the full powers of the harbour authority would be transferred to the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners. The tribunal made no recommendations to this effect but said that the failure to establish a harbour authority at Bantry had serious consequences. Mr. Justice Costello had been advised in writing, before preparing the report, that the Minister intended to give the commissioners full powers.  At present the commissioners do not wish to receive these powers since they will have no funds to discharge the appropriate responsibility until such time as a decision may be taken to reopen the Whiddy terminal.</P>
    <P>I think that fairly well covers the scope of the recommendations that are within the competence of the Government.  The Department of Labour would have certain functions in relation to implementation, under their jurisdiction and they have been notified to take whatever action they deem necessary in relation to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been talking about the adverse effect on companies in the private sector who might have been those expected to provide whatever additional employment could possibly be hoped for this year, in particular, the moving forward of the payment date of company taxation, so that there would be three instalments of company taxation in one 12 months period, which obviously will cause a liquidity problem for a number of firms.  I was contending also that the increases brought about by the budget, such as the increased petrol and diesel charges, will have a crippling effect on small firms and might well have the effect of accelerating or mushrooming the unemployment syndrome about which I spoke earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was remiss in not giving particular attention to labour-intensive industries.  If the general premise I put forward, that one of the main aims of a properly framed budget ought to have been the creation and maintenance of employment, then those firms in the private sector which were labour-intensive <Col N="1235" /> were those which are, and have been for a number of years, under threat because of trends in world markets, inflation and high wage costs.  They are major employing groups within the private sector, groups that are under particular threat. The <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 1 February 1981, contained remarks attributed to Terry McSweeney, chairman of the Apparel Industries Federation and a director of the ailing Dublin rainwear exporter, Janelle Ltd. to the effect that his company had actually discussed the possibility of taking militant action against the Government to highlight the neglect of the industry.  The relevant article, written by Martin Fitzpatrick continued:</P>
    <P>This militancy could take the form of a refusal to pay over social welfare contributions and PAYE payments.</P>
    <P>Then Mr. McSweeney was quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>We are simply acting as tax collectors for the Government and getting absolutely nothing in return.</P>
    <P>The article continued:</P>
    <P>Like the other &ldquo;labour intensives&rdquo;, the clothing sector was urging the Government to provide for a continuation of the £5 per week temporary Employment Subvention or to construct other devices &mdash; perhaps a reduction in their social welfare contributions &mdash; to compensate for its loss.</P>
    <P>Mr. McSweeney is further quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>But the industry got no help, despite assurances at all levels, including at Taoiseach level, that it would be helped out.</P>
    <P>In the same paper another spokesman of the labour-intensive sector, Denis O'Neill of the Winstanleys shoe firm said that he was staggered by the budget.  He was quoted as saying that he was quite appalled at the burden the non-protected must shoulder.  It was contended that he <Col N="1236" /> too was extremely worried at the fact that nothing was done to replace the temporary employment subsidy.  He was quoted as saying that it was a disgraceful budget and was quite irresponsible.</P>
    <P>If I revert to the premise I was putting forward that the main aims of the budget and proper budgetary policy should have been to curtail and contain the growing unemployment level &mdash; if new employment could not be created &mdash; to contain inflation, by reducing the balance of payments deficit and current budget deficiting, if one accepts that they were reasonable aims of the budget surely particular attention should have been given to these industries under threat for a considerable number of years now and which have suffered large job losses in the textiles, footwear and leather industries?  Surely the case put forward by those industries should have been given some attention by the Minister.  But, as has been exemplified by those quotations, they have been absolutely ignored.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious also that the so-called old reliables are no longer old reliables.  One would have thought that Ministers would have realised at some stage that the point of diminishing returns would arrive, that the indications were that that point of diminishing returns in respect of indirect taxation on the brewing and distilling industry had been reached during 1980 because of the falloff in volume of sales.  But once again the Minister turned to what he apparently felt was a bottomless pot into which he could dip, and provoked &mdash; as a result of this increase on the distilling industry &mdash; the quite extraordinary response of a group like Irish Distillers issuing a news release after the budget commenting on it, unheard of before, in which they pointed out that the home market, already feeling the cumulative effect of two duty increases in 1979 and again in 1980, must now contend with a further large duty increase which means that in under 24 months the duty on spirits has been increased by 108 per cent.  Old reliables they may be, but I do not think there are very many industries in any sector that could tolerate having a Government impost increased by over 100 <Col N="1237" /> per cent in two years.  Further on in the course of their news release Irish Distillers Group Ltd. give an example of what that means in cash terms when they say:</P>
    <P>Fourthly, consumers should be fully aware of the new price make-up of a bottle of whiskey costing, say, £9 &mdash; Government £7.06; Distiller and Retailer £1.94.</P>
    <P>I must admit, even for someone who would endeavour occasionally to support Irish Distillers, I was not conscious that the levels had reached those proportions. Irish Distillers Group Ltd. conclude their remarks with this sentence:</P>
    <P>It is with great regret, therefore, that we feel we have now been impeded in our expansion programme and it is a matter of grave concern, not only to our employees and shareholders, but also to our many suppliers of goods and services.</P>
    <P>Would one have thought that one would see the day when one of the old reliables &mdash; and I have condensed their statement because of the few minutes remaining to me &mdash; would have had to issue a statement in those terms?</P>
    <P>In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 1 February 1981, to which I have referred, the managing director of the Guinness Group is also quoted as saying that the effect of the budget would be to effect a drop in volume sales of some 5 per cent to them during 1981.</P>
    <P>The law of economics has been turned topsyturvy in the last decade through the attitude of those supplying our energy sources.  Nonetheless there are fairly accepted tenets, one of which is the law of diminishing returns, and it does not require a scholar of world renown to come to the conclusion that the law of diminishing returns has been reached, and was reached during 1980.  Once the point of diminishing returns has arrived, one must step back; otherwise one begins to penalise oneself as well as the person on whom one is seeking to impose the additional taxation.  It is quite obvious that the old reliables are no longer old reliables and cannot be expected to bear <Col N="1238" /> the increases any longer.  The point has been fairly made by Irish Distillers Group Ltd. and by the people in the brewing industry.</P>
    <P>I endeavoured, before Question Time, to confine my remarks very much to those of a non-party political nature, to dwell instead on the prospects for the economy, the employment situation and indeed the question as to whether democracy would stand the strain we are all placing upon it.  Because of our failure to provide employment opportunities for those still at school, because we are mortgaging the employment places of our children through our irresponsible attitudes in insisting on the continuation of deficit budgeting to the level at which it has been over the last number of years and which is doing nothing except jeopardising the employment opportunities of those who have not yet joined the labour force, we are placing democracy at heavy risk over the next decade or so, just as it will be at risk throughout Europe because of the failure of the European countries to provide employment opportunities particularly for young people.</P>
    <P>We all bear a heavy responsibility in that regard and that means not only Government and employers but also the representatives of organised labour.  The appeal must go to all of those people to realise that the onus is not upon us any longer just to fight for our selfish sectional interests at times of recession because that can only be to the short-term advantage of our members.  But any of us who represent any group also represent the sons and daughters of the members of those groups and they have an equal responsibility to ensure that a standard of living is provided and maintained for the sons and daughters of our adult members. We have, all of us an equal responsibility to ensure that we provide a market place, job opportunities, for those who cannot yet speak for themselves because they are still either in the kindergarten or the primary or post primary schools or, indeed, perhaps in the overcrowded third level institutions here.</P>
    <P>At a time when high technology and inflation and changing attitudes are threatening established employment <Col N="1239" /> places, it behoves all of us to examine the alternatives that I outlined, the suggestions such as collectively exploring a move towards earlier retirement, shorter working hours, work sharing, massive retraining of people.  I did not dwell on it earlier but it is one of the other important options now.  Even throughout their adult life people should be given the opportunity to retrain for other areas of employment that they might not originally have had the opportunity of entering into.  If this sort of thing is not entertained and explored by all of the representatives, whether of employer, employee or Government, then, by our neglect in looking at the alternatives and in seeking to provide employment for those who have not yet become old enough to sign on the dole, we are placing democracy at risk, we are threatening democracy and the democratic institutions and threatening the continuance of this House.</P>
    <P>Budgets such as we saw this year cannot be blamed entirely on the Government. I blame the different pressure groups and the forces throughout our society that make Governments and political parties so sensitive to bringing about any reform or bringing about order in the public finances that they are afraid to move in the way that they know, collectively and privately, is the proper way for the management of the economy.  If all of those groups who bring about those pressures, employers, employees, individuals, farmers, the unemployed, politicians, trade unions and so on, do not accept that the good times are over and it requires sacrifice and a proper approach for the future of our children, then democracy as we know it will not survive either in this country or in any other known democratic institution.  The type of budget that was brought about by all of those forces this year and last year is the sort of budget that is placing at risk the continuation of a free democratic system, where people in the exercise of their franchise can elect democratic parties. Whatever faults and failures that system has, I would far prefer to see it continue than to see any of the very few alternatives that are about to replace it.  Consequently <Col N="1240" /> I can only appeal to everyone to realise that we may be mortgaging a little bit more than our electoral success at the next contest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome an opportunity to participate in this budget debate.  One thing that consoles me is that as time goes on this budget seems to gain both in substance and in significance.  I think the message is now getting clearly across to all the people concerned that this budget is realistic.  It is a bold and daring attempt to face up to the economic problems that confront this nation.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to hear Deputy Boland speak in the manner he did.  It is a clear indication that he at least is conscious of the day-to-day problems facing this nation; he is conscious of the existence of this nation as a democracy and realises that there is no soft road to prosperity or economic stability.  I was pleased to hear his comments.  They were the comments of a realist, the comments of somebody who is showing concern for the well-being of the Irish people and for the nation as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My contribution will be brief.  First I would like to deal with the major concessions that have been granted in this budget.  I would like to deal with the social welfare payments which have made a positive and significant effort to eliminate poverty from Irish society.  Let me say here and now that it has always been the aim of Fianna Fáil to do their utmost to try to improve the lot of the weaker sections of the community, people who are not organised into strong pressure groups, who have no trade unions to take industrial action in their favour.  They realise that they have a Government in office that is determined to look after their needs.  I feel that the people who spoke against this budget did not take the time to analyse and study it closely and to examine its contents in the light of our overall national economy.  The message has now seeped through that this budget has gone a long way towards helping the weaker sections of the community.  Every old age pensioner, widow and orphan, every unemployed person, every person who has a disabled person's allowance <Col N="1241" /> has been fully recognised in this budget as being part of a community and equal in society.  I believe that these people who will benefit will show their appreciation of the work that is being done for them whenever an opportunity comes their way.</P>
    <P>Social welfare recipients are not the only sections of the community to benefit. The farming community have benefited a great deal from this budget, despite what is being said by certain members of farming organisations, by political commentators, and by members of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I would like to give a few figures for County Westmeath.  As a result of Fianna Fáil's budgets down the years farmers with holdings of £20 and less enjoyed complete derating.  This year a significant step forward has been taken by including in that category all farmers with valuations up to £49.  In my county alone 1,800 small farmers will benefit from that decision. There are already 820 small farmers in the derating bracket and they will be joined this year by a further 1,800 small farmers reputed to be working their holdings. This means there will be over 2,600 small farmers in my county enjoying complete derating in 1981.  That is a concession those farmers will appreciate.</P>
    <P>There is another category of farmers who will benefit from this year's budget, those in the valuation bracket from £50 to £70.  In my county we have 700 small farmers who will benefit from the 50 per cent derating.  That is an added advantage, and they recognise it.  They know the Government are aware of the problems they had to contend with over the past two years.  They know this is a bold and determined effort to improve their lot and to ensure that the maximum number of small farmers stay in agriculture. In County Westmeath, which is regarded as a rich agricultural county, we have only 700 holdings over £70 valuation.</P>
    <P>When these figures are analysed in every county it will be freely admitted that this Government have made positive efforts towards improving the lot of small farmers.  Almost 3,000 holdings in my county will benefit from this derating programme. Many will argue that more <Col N="1242" /> should be done, because the farming community were neglected, but they would do well to recognise the value of the concessions they received since the end of 1980.  They should realise the Government of the day saw the necessity for the introduction of a fodder scheme and a fertiliser scheme and they also saw the necessity for introducing grants for the making of silage.  These are worthwhile schemes which were never properly analysed, unlike the situation in 1974-75 when 10,000 cattle died from starvation because of Government neglect.  We had the Coalition Government in office then. At that time I was surprised the farming community did not realise they had a crisis on their hands.  It took the veterinary association to highlight the fact that there was a fodder shortage.  Neither the Government of the day nor the farm leaders realised they had a crisis on their hands.</P>
    <P>This Government realised before anybody else that there was a need for winter fodder in 1980.  Fortunately we had a comparatively mild winter and ample fodder was available.  The farming community are enjoying enhanced prices for cattle.  That is a point which is being ignored by the people who condemn the Government for their lack of interest and investment in agriculture.  A Government cannot put all their eggs in one basket.  They must try to spread their resources around the entire population. This budget is clear evidence that we are prepared to spread our natural resources as far as possible.</P>
    <P>Has anybody on the Opposition benches told us the alternatives to increased tax on spirits, beer, imported wines, tobacco, petrol and diesel?  The previous speaker said there were alternatives but he was not going to tell us what they were.  Is there any other method by which this revenue could be provided?  I would like our political commentators who write so glibly in magazines and certain newspapers to tell me the alternatives.  I am convinced there is no immediate alternative to the present method used to provide additional revenue for those in greatest need.</P>
    <P>People talk about the savage and brutal <Col N="1243" /> increases imposed on beer, spirits and tobacco.  Where else would the Government look for revenue but from luxuries? The people can do without alcohol.  We have the highest rate per head for alcohol consumption in Europe.  If this budget acts as a deterrent and reduces the amount of alcohol consumed, considerable progress will have been made.  I am convinced we have been drinking too much beer and spirits.  We all know many homes have been broken because of excessive drinking.  If this budget goes some of the way to remedy this situation it will gladden the hearts of every Irish person who is concerned with real progress.</P>
    <P>It has been said that there will be redundancies in the distilling and beer industries.  This claim has been made repeatedly, yet those industries seem to be able to exist and to develop their markets. In my view they have a duty to develop markets abroad and to try to help the balance of payments by exporting as much as possible.  They should not depend on the home market for all their products.</P>
    <P>Perhaps before the end of this debate we will be told the alternatives for raising extra revenue.  I would like to know where we go from here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Another argument was put forward about the savage increases in the duties on petrol and diesel.  We all agree it is a very unpopular decision to impose additional taxation on petrol and diesel, because we realise that, one way or another, those increases are going to filter right down through the economy and will have an effect on day-to-day living costs.  There is another aspect of the situation which must be borne in mind &mdash; our huge bill for imported oil.  If, as we were led to believe, there was a reduction in oil imports in 1980, we should look forward to further reductions in the import of this costly product in 1981 because it is creating an enormous drain <Col N="1244" /> on our reserves abroad and on our balance of payments.</P>
      <P>We are not as energy conscious as we should be or as all other European countries are.  It is appropriate that the Tánaiste embarked on his nationwide tour this week to encourage people to conserve energy.  The sooner everyone realises the need for conservation, the better. The increased taxation on petrol, diesel and other oils will induce people to become more energy conscious and to use their cars less.  Unfortunately, there is little that can be done about cutting down the use of commercial diesel, because all our goods are transported by heavy diesel trucks.  Therefore, the consumption of diesel oil will continue at a high level because no other means of transport is as economical.  The level of diesel consumption will not decrease to any great extent.  I am convinced the level of petrol consumption will decrease, people will see the need for conserving energy and the increases in duty may prove, in the long run, a blessing in disguise. It will save our balance of payments and our external reserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fuel voucher scheme is a comparatively new scheme which was introduced last year by the Minister for Social Welfare in conjunction with the Government. It is heartening to see that the value of the vouchers has now been increased by 50 per cent.  That is a clear indication that the Government are concerned for the old, the weak, the disabled and invalids.  I am less than satisfied with the way that members of the health boards are administering the scheme. The Minister and the Government should contact the health boards to ensure that people in greatest need are getting the benefit of those vouchers, which are a major concession and a great benefit to the recipients.  I hope the Minister for Social Welfare will review the working of the scheme throughout the health boards.  I often wondered if the scheme should be administered directly by the Department of Social Welfare, through the employment exchanges, as we have social welfare branches in every county who would be competent to administer the scheme.  It would probably be <Col N="1245" /> cheaper, because it complements all the other benefits which are being administered by that Department.  I believe the Minister will review the position to see if improvements in administration can be made and that people in real need get the benefit of this very generous gesture of the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>The increases to disabled persons are another recognition by the Government of the need to look after the weaker section, who are unable to look after themselves.  Nobody can point the finger at the Government and say we are not doing enough for the old, the infirm, the deserted wife and children.  The Government have demonstrated time and time again they are concerned for the welfare of the weaker sections of the community. Sometimes I boil with indignation when I hear people saying that the Government are not doing enough and could do better. Who could do better?  We had another Government in office during a former period of economic recession from 1974 up to early 1977.  It was ironic that that recession also was caused by the huge price increases in oil.  It demonstrates that the economies of most European countries are dependent, in some shape or form, on the importation of fuel. That is the cause of our problems at present. It is the cause of the recession in industry.</P>
    <P>Other European countries are also caught in the grip of the economic recession. Germany was regarded as the economic miracle of modern times in the way its economy advanced and developed. But at present they have 1,000,000 people unemployed and have sent home thousands of immigrant workers &mdash; Turks, Yugoslavs and Indians.  They sent those people home because the economic recession began to bite deeper and deeper and their overall economic strength was affected.  Germany is a typical example because they were an industrious people who worked hard.  By and large, we have come through the economic recession in much better shape than most other economies.  If every section of the community get together, pull their weight and decide they have a contribution to make to the economy, we <Col N="1246" /> will come through this recession with an economy that is stronger than most other countries.</P>
    <P>Our exports have been adversly affected by the recession in other countries. That is something members of the Opposition fail to realise in their contributions to the budget debate.  Apart from the economic recession, we must never lose sight of our competitiveness as a manufacturing nation.  We must ensure that the goods which are produced here can be sold competitively on the world market.  That is one of the advantages we have derived from membership of the EMS.  I would like to see some changes made in the stock exchange quotation which only quotes the Irish pound against sterling and the dollar.  As we are part of the EMS, why not quote us against the French franc, the Deutschmark, the Belgian franc, the Danish kroner or any other currency?  They continually quote the Irish £ against sterling&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;ignoring the fact that we are a member of the EMS.  For that reason changes should be made in the method of reporting stock exchange prices.  One would think we were only concerned with the punt against an overvalued sterling.  When in Belfast recently politicians and businessmen told me that they were demanding something on the lines of a green £ to match the punt because they were losing business in the South as a result of our membership of the EMS.  The EMS aided our industry to a great extent and that fact has not been fully ventilated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thousands more jobs would have been lost today were it not for our membership of the EMS and that must be made clear to all sections of the community. That does not mean, however, that we should permit the sky to be the limit or that we should not make any attempt at controlling inflation.  I was pleased to hear Deputy Boland talk about pressure groups and their continued influence on political decisions here.  A responsible approach is called for from all such pressure or organised groups.  We have too <Col N="1247" /> many greedy and selfish people in our society who demand too big a slice of the national cake.  They are too selfish to give any thought to the other sections of the community or to job losses in other sectors. The time has come for all such people to have a long and hard look at their situation and ask themselves if they can make a further contribution to our society. They must ask themselves if they can do anything more for their local community or those who do not have jobs.</P>
    <P>There is nobody who can dispute the fact that 120,000 people are unemployed but, as Deputy Boland stated, there are too many people holding down two jobs at present.  For that reason it is not possible to have an equitable distribution of our resources.  Those people should take others into consideration before their selfish inclinations.  They should ensure that everyone gets the opportunity of doing a day's work.  The trade union movement and other organisations will have to face up to that because they have a role to play in this regard.  They should do so with courage and a determination to serve the needs of those who are without jobs.  Those people are anxious to make their contribution to society.  They should be given that opportunity and that is one reason why I believe the budget represents a bold and realistic attempt at ensuring the commencement of the maximum number of job creation enterprises here in 1981.</P>
    <P>The national investment plan is another sincere and bold attempt at getting our infrastructure properly organised. I welcome the increased allocation for road improvements.  My county will receive £2.3 million this year for such work compared to £1,100,000 last year. That is a clear indication of the anxiety of the Government to improve our infrastructure. It is the correct approach and my only regret is that those problems were not tackled many years ago.  However, it is encouraging to see that we are tackling those problems in the middle of a world-wide economic recession.  We are one of the few nations geared towards that type of investment and development in 1981.  As the year progresses more jobs <Col N="1248" /> will be created because of the massive investment programme embarked upon by the Government.</P>
    <P>There is a commitment by the Government to do everything possible to create more jobs.  The closures and job losses that took place last year can be blamed on the world-wide economic recession. We cannot hope to escape when powerful economies like those of France and Germany are suffering.  I am pleased with the efforts being made to develop our national resources.  Our greatest national resource is our soil.  I appeal to all farmers to make a special effort in 1981 to increase livestock numbers and output. The markets are available and we have a great variety of them.  Some regard our live store cattle trade as damaging to some of our industries and as being responsible for the closure of many of our meat processing plants but I should like to remind those people that if those meat plants enjoyed a monopoly situation they would operate their factories like the way they did in 1975 when they paid what they liked for live cattle.  At that time there was no other outlet for them.  We must at all times have an element of competition.</P>
    <P>I would like to see every beast produced here processed in our factories but, unfortunately, that cannot happen because many farmers are convinced that without some sort of opposition our factories would cash in on a monopoly situation. It is believed that they would depress meat prices here thereby reducing the income of farmers.  The Government have done a lot for agriculture and the end has not been reached as far as increased prices for the farming community are concerned.  We have a team in Brussels under the leadership of the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy MacSharry, who I believe will succeed in extracting a worthwhile package for Irish agriculture and those engaged in that industry. We have heard in recent hours about 7.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent but we can expect a higher percentage increase and that is going to benefit our farmers.  That is going to be a further boost to the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>Nobody denies and I will be the first to <Col N="1249" /> concede that agriculture and those engaged in that industry have gone through a period of stress and strain. There is no doubt about that, but it is not the first time it has happened.  I mentioned a few moments ago that it happened in 1974 and 1975.  It has been happening down through the ages, but now the outlook is bright in agriculture.  Further price increases are on the way and my message to every farmer concerned for his own future is to increase production in so far as it is possible.  The market outlook is right.  He should avail of the opportunities that come his way and he and the Irish nation will be the sole beneficiaries in the long run.</P>
    <P>A lot more could be said with regard to the budget, the state of our finances and so on.  This budget has been well accepted by the Irish people.  They have realised that it is a realistic document.  It is not an election budget, as many people had thought it would be.  If it was it would be far more popular.  The increases imposed on petrol, diesel, spirits, cigarettes, tobacco and so on would not be as steep if it had been an election gimmick. It is a realistic attempt by the Government to ensure that this country is kept on an even keel, that out economy remains stable and that we will be in a position to move forward in conjunction with every other progressive democratic state when that opportunity comes our way when the world recession lifts.  We as a people will respond much more quickly when the incentives come our way than any other community in Europe.  For that reason I appealed a few moments ago for the support of the trade union movement, the farm organisations and all those engaged in industry to get together and work together for our people and our nation.  If that is done then our future is assured.</P>
    <P>With regard to income tax, again the Government are conscious of the need to relieve as much as possible the burden on the PAYE sector.  On the other hand, the members of that group realise that they have a job while thousands of their neighbours may not have jobs.  They should not begrudge paying the few additional pounds by way of PAYE if they know <Col N="1250" /> that some of that money is being made available for job-creation enterprise, for schemes that will help their weaker brothers along the way.  That is something that every PAYE worker should consider.  Every country in the world has a system of taxation.  Countries raise taxation through the process of levies direct and indirect, PAYE and so on.  No Government have funds other than the funds raised from direct or indirect taxation.  If the Opposition have a new plan, if they have some cards up their sleeves that we have not seen, the public would like to know about them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Deputy Keegan for the past three-quarters of an hour, it does not surprise me that a disastrous budget such as has been produced by the Minister for Finance could emanate from the Government.  If that is the level of contribution a rural Deputy gives to his party and advice to this Minister for Finance, it explains to me why this budget has been perceived and received by the people of Ireland as a complete and utter disaster.  To say that it has stunned the people into disbelief and despair is an understatement, and for the 30 minutes or so which remain to me I will try to edify the Minister and his colleagues with the true perception and reception of this budget in rural Ireland, particularly South Tipperary.  It has come across as a complete disaster.  There is nothing innovative about it, no flair, no dash.  It gives no hope to the various sections of the community, to the farming sector, the industrialist, the hapless unemployed or the PAYE workers.  It is a monument to the Cabinet's incompetence and their aridity of thought on anything original.  It was unveiled on this occasion not by the Taoiseach but by the hapless Minister for Finance whom the Taoiseach pushed into this portfolio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> Indeed, I do not blame the Minister for Finance; I pity him, as do the people of Ireland, This budget is indicative of a Government who are completely bankrupt not alone financially but of ideas also.  It is totally insensitive to what the country needs at this moment and it will go down and be noted for its total mediocrity. Much was expected from the Taoiseach. The people did give him a year's trial run in office.  I suppose this could be regarded as his first budget, because this time last year he had been in office for only a very brief period and the people in fairness waited and gave him an opportunity to see what he could unfold.  I am afraid that they are utterly and totally disillusioned and disappointed.  The slow realisation is coming to the people of rural Ireland particularly that in the Cabinet we have a fifth division team masquerading as a first division team.  I have no doubt that when the opportunity comes this fifth division team will be relegated to the sideline and to the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>When the Coalition were in power the then Opposition had all the answers. They were shouting across to the then Government to resign and get out of office, that they had all the solutions for the problems of the day.  The election was held and the then Government was removed from office.  Fianna Fáil put all their promises into the now totally discredited manifesto of which I have a copy here and they placed this manifesto before the electorate.  Unfortunately, the electorate went for the soft option and returned Fianna Fáil to power with the greatest majority in our history.</P>
    <P>I would have thought Fianna Fáil would have been ashamed to mention the word manifesto but to my surprise last Monday I heard the Tánaiste on the radio refer to it.  Apparently, the Taoiseach has not yet told him that he wishes to stand back from the manifesto and have it buried. He sacked the Minister responsible for it and pulled down the shutters on his Department.  Apparently, nobody has yet told the Tánaiste of the Taoiseach's thoughts on the manifesto.  Perhaps this is indicative of the split Cabinet we have <Col N="1253" /> when the Tánaiste can laud the manifesto while the Taoiseach is trying to forget it.</P>
    <P>I may quote one or two amusing statements from this discredited manifesto.  I think it will go down in Irish mythology, among the fairytales of Ireland.  It should be consigned to the archives.  In the section on the economy, number 6, it talks of the Fianna Fáil prescription for recovery. Apparently they were referring to the economy as it was then but unfortunately the patient, Kathleen Houlihan, has had a severe and almost fatal relapse and is now virtually comatose.  I could take up time quoting some of the promises of the manifesto.  It said that by 1980 we would have 30,000 fewer unemployed. We know that there are at least 122,200 idle, not including those on three day weeks and others who are excluded. We were promised a reduction in prices of 2 per cent in 1979 and no increases in prices in 1980.  Last year inflation ran at 18½ per cent.  This year there are disputed figures as to whether it will be 15½ per cent or 13½ per cent.</P>
    <P>We were also told that in 1980 borrowing would be reduced to 8 per cent.  In fact last year it was 14.5 per cent and this year it is expected to be in the region &mdash; again there are disputed figures &mdash; of either a massive 18 per cent or 13 per cent.</P>
    <P>When the Coalition left office in 1977 inflation was down to single figures. National growth was at 5 per cent or more; last year it was 1 per cent.  Borrowing was at £3,600 million; last year it amounted to the mammoth sum of £7,500 million or more.  This year national borrowing is expected to be in the region of £1,500 million or more.  The then Taoiseach in his honesty remarked, as is written in the records of the House in December 1977, having reviewed the economy after we had left office that this was the basis on which to build the economy. Now after three and a half years of misrule and mismanagement by a succession of Ministers for Finance and two Taoiseachs we find the economy is crippled. In a year when people would have expected some indication of Government policy, some incentive for farmers and <Col N="1254" /> industrialists and for the people to move forward and right the economy, we have this mediocre budget statement that offers nothing.  It has not a new concept or an original idea to offer.  No wonder the people are totally disillusioned and disenchanted by the present Government and are only waiting an opportunity to translate these feelings into votes and relegate this inept Government to the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>Time was when a budget did mean something.  There were good Ministers for Finance even in Fianna Fáil Governments and in their budgetary statements they outlined fiscal, financial and economic policies to be pursued during the year.  Last year the then Minister for Finance indicated that he would take a certain line but midway through the year he totally abandoned that line leaving us with a deficit of £547 million.  This year again we have a deficit budget of £513 million.  That is a disputed figure; some argue that it should be £645 million.  No doubt there will be another succession of supplementary budgets towards the end of the year if the present Government are still in power.  The whole idea of budgets has lost its relevance.  Perhaps it gives the Minister for Finance of the day a moment of doubtful glory on the political stage, gives him his annual gallop.  He then hands over the running of the country perhaps to faceless bureaucrats for the remainder of the year.  Until there is some honest budgeting and until we get direction from the Minister for Finance we cannot make good progress.  The budgets of the present administration in the past two or three years had little significance or relevance.</P>
    <P>I shall deal briefly with some of the points that I think should have been attended to in the budget.  I shall refer to the problems of agriculture, industry, unemployment, the PAYE sector and some other facets of the budget.  It is accepted by all that for the past two years agriculture has suffered its greatest crisis since the economic war.  It is undisputed that in real terms the farmers have had a reduction in income of 43 per cent.  In the coming year their living standard is expected to drop a further 13½ per cent. <Col N="1255" /> It amazes me to hear Deputy Keegan say that the farmers were content.  If so, why were there 40,000 or 50,000 farmers marching in Limerick and Kilkenny? Why did all farm organisations show their dismay at the crumbs they received in the budget?  This indicates to me that the Government are totally insensitive to the problems of the farming community. They do not realise the depth of the crisis in the farming community, the gloom and the lack of confidence.  We know from printed figures that milk production last year fell 2½ per cent, that the total milch cow numbers fell 3½ per cent.  Today we see that artificial insemination fell by 8 per cent, so that next year there will be 8 per cent fewer calves and in two years' time the meat processing trade will suffer accordingly.  We also know that employment on the farms in the year to mid-April 1980&mdash;this is the latest figure available, I think &mdash; fell by 3,000.</P>
    <P>Despite repeated warnings from this side of the House, when we urged the Government to be aware of the problems facing the farming community, the Government did nothing.  Contrary to what we expected, they insisted on introducing levies and taxes on the farming community. It is no wonder there is doom and gloom throughout the country.  Farmers thought the Government would take account of their difficulties but, having listened to the contribution of Deputy Keegan, I know now they could not have done so because they were not informed of the situation by their own Deputies.</P>
    <P>It amazes me that any rural Deputy could be so completely unaware of the difficulties facing the farming community. We know that agriculture is our greatest industry and, apart from our young people, that the wealth of the country is in the top soil.  We know that when we have a strong agricultural industry wealth percolates throughout all sectors because employment is maintained in the processing and ancillary industries and business in general is helped.  Unfortunately there have been closures in the meat plants and in the fertiliser industry. Machinery and equipment plants have also been affected: demand for machinery <Col N="1256" /> and equipment fell by 12 per cent in the past year.  We know that the jobs of 6,000 people in the meat plants are in jeopardy.  Every sector of the community is concerned about the crisis in agriculture. Everyone is aware of what is happening except our Ministers for Finance and Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have promised the farming community that when we get into power we will build up confidence in the farming sector.  We attempted to introduce an emergency provisions Bill but it was not allowed by the Chair.  In Private Members time we introduced what has become known popularly as the Fitzgerald-Bruton six-point plan.  This was an attempt at least to spur the Government into action and to bring the crisis to their attention.  Unfortunately it was voted down by 66 warriors of destiny who marched through the lobby and registered their vote.  That was their response to an honest attempt by the Opposition to give some confidence to the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>Very briefly I should like to refer to some of the points we put forward.  We proposed the abolition of the resource tax and we said we would refund any tax already collected.  We know that only £252,000 of the proposed £6 million was collected.  This was because the farming community had not got the money.  Belatedly the Government, under extreme pressure and motivated by the Fine Gael proposal, announced in the budget that they would remove the resource tax.  We welcomed the move because we were always totally against the tax.  We considered that in a time of crisis there should not be any further taxes imposed on farmers and we urged the Minister to hand back the £252,000 already collected.</P>
    <P>The second point in our plan provided for the abolition of the bovine diseases levy.  Belatedly the Government have seen the light and have decided to abolish the levy.  We welcome this move.  The Government were ill-advised to introduce the levy.  It was penal imposition on the farming community.</P>
    <P>We dealt also with the question of agricultural rates.  This system of rate collection is 140 years old and has no relevance <Col N="1257" /> to the agricultural scene today.  We proposed the total abolition of agricultural rates.  The Government partly took over some of the measures we suggested and gave some relief to farmers.  However, what they have proposed is not sufficient and I have no doubt that in another manifesto that will come eventually from the Government there will be a proposal for the total abolition of agricultural rates.</P>
    <P>We indicated in our Bill that there would be an interest subsidy scheme on loans up to £25,000 that were taken out for genuine family farm development. We were told by representatives of the farming community and by our constituents of the crushing weight of interest rates especially on development farmers. This group have been under severe pressure from the ACC and banking institutions. They took the agricultural advisers and the Government at their word: they developed their farms and negotiated loans at what were then the reasonable interest rates of 11 per cent or 12 per cent.  Unfortunately interest rates have escalated to 21 per cent and all their schemes went awry.  It is deplorable that the Government have done nothing to help in this matter.</P>
    <P>We have been told there is a serious decline in our breeding stock.  From figures available regarding artificial insemination we learn there has been a shortfall of 89,000 cows as compared with previous years.  That will mean there will be a serious loss of beef in the near future.  In an attempt to restore the level of breeding stock we indicated we would treat breeding stock as capital for income tax purposes.  However, this matter has been neglected by the Government.</P>
    <P>In an attempt to encourage people who may be considering transferring land to trained young farmers the Fitzgerald-Bruton Bill proposed the two-year abolition of stamp duty on land transferred to such farmers.  This was to encourage people to transfer land to younger, energetic young farmers.  This proposal should have been adopted but unfortunately the Government decided otherwise and voted it down.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keegan has told us that everything <Col N="1258" /> is rosy.  If he would remove his rose-tinted glasses and see rural Ireland as it really is, he would know, and must know if he is in touch at all with the farming community, that the picture of agriculture is vastly different from the one he would like us to believe.  The Minister must be living in cloud cuckooland if he believes that the farming community are satisfied.</P>
    <P>We have the present Minister for Agriculture going to Brussels with begging bowl in hand, trying to bring some advantage to the Irish farmers.  Indeed, from present indications, which I hope are wrong, a figure of 7.5 per cent is being quoted as the increase.  That, pitched against an inflation rate of 13 to 15 per cent this coming year in Ireland, will be of absolutely no benefit at all to the farming community.  The Minister would be better served in sitting down and discussing the problems with the leaders of the farming community here who understand the predicament they are in and giving them some concessions instead of burdening them with levies and other taxes. I hope for the farmers' sake that his attempts in Brussels will be successful.</P>
    <P>Thinking back to one of his illustrious predecessors, Deputy Mark Clinton, when he was in a position to negotiate he always came back with the goods for the Irish farming community.  He always brought back an increase of 12 to 15 per cent.  Deputy Keegan had the audacity to say that during the time of the Coalition Government from 1973 to 1977 the farming industry was in crisis.  I am informed that the income to the farming community increased from £250 million in 1973 to £950 million when Deputy Clinton left office.  For the benefit of the Minister, I remind him of what was said in the famous manifesto document in which was published the following paragraph on agriculture:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes that Agriculture can and should provide the main thrust for the recovery of the National Economy.</P>
    <P>The volume of farm output must be raised and everything we produce must be processed and packaged through to <Col N="1259" /> consumption stage.  Fianna Fáil will introduce a National Livestock Development programme to prevent short-term cyclical reductions in the breeding herds, improve genetic stock and health status and encourage the retention of cattle under 4 cwt to rebuild the</P>
    <P>All this is gobbledygook, making a complete farce of the farming community. They also undertook, among the promises which were never fulfilled, that they would retain the notional system of farm taxation and allow rates on agricultural land as an instalment of a farmer's tax bill.  The farmers now realise that, by accepting the manifesto they have been sold down, if not the Swanee, at least the Shannon.  Once again they hope to put all their confidence and their trust in Fine Gael in office.  They know that Fine Gael have always accepted the importance of agriculture in the economy and realise that, if we had a sound agricultural industry, the economy was sound.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is well known for his lack of sensitivity towards the farming community.  On one hapless occasion our farmers were lying on the ground in Merrion Row and the present Taoiseach walked across their prostrate bodies and went into Government Buildings, totally insensitive to their plight.  They know that they cannot expect anything better from a Government under this man's leadership. We will have continuing farming demonstrations asking for some concessions. The farming community are not looking for charity.  They are one of the few sections who are prepared to and want to work.  All they are requesting is a realistic return for their honest labour. They do not want hand-outs or charity; they want prices for their work which will give them an average standard of living, and not a falling standard, as has happened in the past two years and will happen this year.  This budget has been a disaster to the farming community.  It has done nothing to give them any confidence in themselves or in their industry.  Doom and gloom still continue in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that I would like to dwell on for a few brief moments is the contribution of this year's budget to <Col N="1260" /> industry.  It amazes me, with industries toppling like ninepins, with closures, bankruptcies and firms going into receivership, that the only thing this budget does for industry is to further penalise it. The Government are seeking to collect one and a half year's capital taxation within the coming year.  It is incredible, when every effort should be made to encourage private industry and help it to stabilise, maintain and even increase the labour force.  It is not alone penalising them financially by insisting upon collecting the one and a half year's tax in one year, but also indirectly penalising them with savage and massive increases in the price of petrol and diesel oil and with the forthcoming third or fourth mini budget with the extra telephone, telex and postal increases.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that the industrialists who are concerned with employment have given up in despair.  Many have come to me and indicated their total abhorrence of this budget.  True, there is an element of hibernisation in the budget, but unfortunately that only affects, to my mind, the speculators and gives hope to the big building contractors and does nothing at all for rural Ireland or the smaller industries in the various small towns.  I am abhorred at the Government's total insensitivity to the plight of industry. Nothing has been done to help them to increase their work force, rather they are being penalised.  Surely the Government must realise that, with the ever-lengthening dole queues, this further imposition on industries will further add to them?  What hope is there for the young boys and girls leaving school this year finding work in industry?  Again I quote from this famous manifesto on what was to be done for industry:</P>
    <P>A revolution must take place in the management of industrial expansion if the essential employment targets are to be achieved.</P>
    <P>A revolution is certainly taking place, but it is not the revolution anticipated by the industrialists and people in commercial life in 1977.  Also, further down it says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> Payments to the State (taxation, social welfare, etc.) will be reviewed periodically to help maintain competitiveness under severe trading conditions.</P>
    <P>Here was a golden opportunity for the Government to give some ray of hope to the industrialists to help them over the present crisis.  They looked in vain to the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this very important local matter which was the subject of not one but three questions to the Minister for Education for written reply yesterday.  The Minister chose to reply to a small part only of the questions asked.  For instance, he did not say whether he had any knowledge of the threatened closure of the schools or whether he had any knowledge of the acute situation that had arisen in the Dominican primary schools in Ballyfermot.</P>
      <P>The Minister replied only to the part of the questions asking what is the total capitation grant.  He did not reply to the part of the questions asking how much did he estimate it would cost to run, heat and to maintain the schools.  We needed that reply in order to help us to understand the problems facing the board of management of the schools.  The board of management are in acute financial difficulties, being under extreme pressure from the banks because the overdraft is nearly £20,000.  That is the main reason for the imminent closure of the schools: they have not got enough money to keep the schools open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the Minister today if he will give an estimate of what it will cost to run and maintain these schools and if he will tell us the difference between that figure and what he is contributing to the board of management.  I am drawing his attention to the fact that these schools had about 4,000 pupils at one time.  They <Col N="1262" /> have now something like 1,600 pupils and this, of course, means that the capitation grant is greatly reduced, although the board of management have to maintain the same buildings and the same number of rooms as when the Ballyfermot population was at its peak.  They are trying to do this from a greatly reduced capitation grant.</P>
    <P>Not only is the capitation grant declining with the reduction of the number of children attending the schools &mdash; the number is still declining &mdash; but the schools are getting older and require more frequent repairs to maintain them.</P>
    <P>I am pointing out particularly to the Minister the special problem in Ballyfermot and asking him to make a special concession to the board of these schools in the form of a cash grant to help them to pay off the overdraft, or something extra by way of capitation grant, or even some cash to pay the interest on the overdraft.  I plead with him not to allow a situation to arise when the children will be sent home because the board of management cannot maintain or heat the schools properly.  I ask the Minister to consider meeting the board of management, the Dominican Sisters and parents' representatives as a matter of urgency to discuss this special problem.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that from time to time the Minister gets special pleas from communities throughout the country and that every Minister is afraid to create what might be regarded as a precedent.  I can assure him a precedent will not be created if he makes a special concession to this school, because of the number of children catered for there and the size of the school.  I doubt if there is outside Dublin a school of this size.  I do not know of any other primary school complex which has catered for 4,000 children at one time. That is a very special consideration.  If these schools cannot be properly heated the maintenance costs increase.</P>
    <P>I represent this area and I am aware that all meetings arranged are attended by a big crowd of parents and others interested.  The Minister acknowledges that education is a matter of great concern at the moment but I do not know of any area outside Ballyfermot where <Col N="1263" /> proper educational facilities are of greater interest.  There are many misconceptions abroad about Ballyfermot whose image is not a good one because of adverse publicity and its size.  That image is false: it is a splendid area to live in, there is a great community feeling and spirit there and the local community associations have had an active education sub-committee.  The parents and people in general are determined to eradicate the disgraceful stigma that has attached to their area.  They are anxious that it will not be applied wrongfully to their children, that their children will have better educational opportunities than they had.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I ask the Minister to give special consideration to my plea.  I am asking him again if he will meet the management boards and representatives of the parents and nuns and if he will visit the area as he did during the last by-election campaign when he was shadow Minister for Education.  I would be delighted to bring him on a guided tour of Ballyfermot and of the schools in the area and I have no doubt his Fianna Fáil colleagues would join us.  He could not fail to be impressed by the attitude and the interest of the parents in this great area.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to deal in his reply with the threat of closure and possible measures to avert it.  I apologise for dragging him away from his very busy office but this is a very important local problem and I hope he will be able to give some ray of hope to the people concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. L. Lawlor Mr. L. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for allowing me a few moments to speak on this very important subject. Last Saturday afternoon I visited Ballyfermot and had discussions with the principal about the plight of these schools and the measures needed to rectify the situation.  Some years ago there was tremendous growth in the areas of Ballyfermot, Drimnagh and Walkinstown and these schools are capable of taking 4,000 pupils.  At present, however, the number of pupils is 1,600 and numbers will probably fall even further in coming years. <Col N="1264" /> The pupil-teacher ratio in these schools is excellent but the cost of maintaining such large buildings is enormous in relation to the capitation grants.</P>
      <P>This type of problem will not occur in the future because we are no longer building primary schools of that type.  I would ask the Minister to make available experts from his Department who could advise the boards of management as to how to utilise these buildings.  The present situation cannot continue and there must be a change of use in regard to some of the buildings.  Perhaps the Department of Education could use them for other purposes which would bring in additional income.  The cost of heating the buildings has become prohibitive.  Decisive action is needed and I would ask the Minister to report next week, if possible, to the elected representatives of this area on the measures he proposes to take to deal with this urgent problem.  We should like to be able to report to the people concerned that assistance will be given.  I would also ask him to meet a deputation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity given by the Deputy to indicate what is being done for these schools and for the financing of primary schools generally.  At the outset the Deputy asked me whether I knew anything about this threatened closure. My reply is in the negative.  The boards of management of the three primary schools operated by the Dominican Order in Ballyfermot have not indicated to my Department that closure of the schools is threatened due to lack of maintenance or lack of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its inception in 1831 the system of national education has been one of local schools under local patronage and management receiving grant aid from the State to supplement local effort.  This very principle is enshrined in the Rules for National Schools under which school management is responsible for the collection of such funds locally in supplement of the State grant as will ensure that school premises will be adequately heated and cleaned and kept in proper decorative condition.  There is also an obligation on management under these <Col N="1265" /> rules to ensure that the schools are adequately maintained.  These are among the most serious and important obligations required of management under the Rules and each member of a board of management is required to sign an undertaking that the Rules for National Schools will be complied with.  With schools in general being able to operate, a board of management which finds itself considering closing the particular school for which it is responsible must consider how effectively it has been managing.  Like everybody else, boards of management must establish their priorities and must adjust expenditure to income.  The first priority must surely be to ensure that sufficient money is set aside to heat, clean and adequately maintain the school.</P>
    <P>The Dominican Order originally operated five national schools in Ballyfermot. Not many years ago there were over 2,000 pupils enrolled in these schools. Due to falling pupil numbers in the area generally, the schools were reorganised, at the request of school management, into three full-range schools at the beginning of the 1979/80 school year and there are at present just over 1,600 pupils attending these schools.</P>
    <P>The school buildings contain 71 classrooms in three main blocks together with an assembly hall and certain ancillary accommodation.  It is, perhaps, significant that when my Department were making efforts to secure alternative accommodation for An Scoil Lán-Ghaelach Inse Chóir it was indicated to an officer of the Department that there was no spare accommodation in these schools.  Excluding the three principal teachers, there are 62 teachers in the three schools of whom nine are engaged in remedial and special class duties.  On this basis there should be at least nine vacant classrooms in the buildings.  It would seem that the school is using all the available accommodation and this may mean expending money on heating accommodation which is not being fully utilised.  Indications are that pupil enrolments in the area will continue to decline and it would seem that the school boards of management should consider seriously the possibility of organising the schools <Col N="1266" /> in two of the existing classroom blocks and vacating the existing 16 classroom block to the maximum extent possible with a consequent saving on heating costs.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I am glad of the opportunity this debate affords me to speak of the achievements of the present Government in improving the financing of primary schools.  When managerial organisations were pressing for the introduction of a system of capitation grants a selection of school accounts submitted to my Department at the time and relating to the school year 1971-72 showed that the average expenditure was £6 per pupil of which parishes provided £4.85 and the State grants £1.15.  There is no doubt that the introduction of the scheme of capitation grants in 1975 by the then Minister resulted in a marked improvement in the aid made available towards the cost of heating, cleaning and maintaining national schools.  Unfortunately however, while the Deputy's party were in Government no steps were taken to ensure that the value of the grant was maintained.  The rate of £6 remained unaltered in the financial years 1975, 1976, and 1977.  Since the present Government came into office the rate of capitation grant payable to national schools has been steadily and substantially increased.  Taking into account the minimum contribution required from local sources the amount of money available to the boards of management of national schools has increased from £7.50 per pupil in 1976-77 to £14.75 in the 1979-80 school year.</P>
    <P>In the Estimates for the Public Service for 1981 a total provision of £7,750,000 has been made for capitation grants for boards of management of national schools.  This is an increase of £1¼ million over the provision in the previous year. I intend to increase the grant further to £17 per pupil in the current school year, the year 1980-81, subject to the requirement of a local contribution of £4 per pupil.</P>
    <P>As I have told the Deputy on a number of occasions, the amount of capitation grant payable to authorities of national schools is calculated by reference to general <Col N="1267" /> regulations and I am not authorised to make grants on an exceptional basis to individual schools.</P>
    <P>The Deputy appealed for special consideration for the Ballyfermot schools. The Deputy mentioned that there is a wonderful community spirit in the area and that the community deserve special attention.  I have very good friends living in Ballyfermot and I know the worth of the people in that area.  That school complex is getting extra special treatment <Col N="1268" /> from the Department of Education as of now.  For example, were the ordinary rules applied for the provision of staff in the schools in Ballyfermot there would be a saving of an estimated £128,000 per annum.  In fact the Department of Education and I as Minister are taking cognisance of the fact that special aids and helps are desirable in the area to the extent of approximately £128,000.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 10 February, 1981.</P>

      <P>Overlapping benefits regulations under the Social Welfare Acts provide that a person who is in receipt of a 100 per cent army disability pension is not entitled to disability benefit unless at least 26 employment contributions have been paid in respect of him since his discharge.  Where the rate of pension is less than 100 per cent this provision does not apply.  According to the records of <Col N="1230" /> my Department the person concerned has no employment contributions paid since his discharge from the army.  In the circumstances it was necessary to obtain from him details of the rate of his Army disability pension for the purpose of his claim for disability benefit.</P>
