      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the extensive and multiplying problem of roadside living especially in the Clondalkin and Blanchardstown areas of Dublin and of the recent <Col N="1972" /> Supreme Court observations, he will appoint a Minister with special responsibility for itinerants as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the acute problem now existing in County Dublin especially in the two areas mentioned? Is he aware of the grave health hazard that people in the area are open to and the grave risk to children living along the side of the road?  In the circumstances and in view of the Supreme Court decision does he either (a) intend to appoint a Minister to tackle the problem as a matter of urgency or (b) intend to introduce legislation to overcome the problems arising from the Supreme Court decision?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there is a problem in suburban areas on the perimeter of the city generally but, the Deputy knows, this problem has been with us for some considerable time and there is no easy solution to it.  The Minister for the Environment, who has primary responsibility in this area, has undertaken a review of all our policies and programmes in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach impart to the House any sense of urgency in this matter?  Is he aware that there is danger, for instance, of an outbreak of fever in the area if something is not done quickly about this problem?  Further, is he aware that the problem has taken on a new dimension in the sheer number of itinerants gathered at one spot in Clondalkin and one spot in Blanchardstown and that effectively shanty towns have developed on the perimeter of the city, to the great consternation of caring people, caring for the safety of itinerant children and for the health of itinerant children and of their own children?  Would he, therefore, agree that this has now reached the stage where something must be done as a matter of urgency to help reduce the problem and to solve it in order to help the itinerants concerned?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, a great deal has been done by concerned people, the local authority and the Department of the Environment.  However, the details of this matter are something which the Deputy should address directly to the Minister for the Environment. His question to me concerns merely the appointment of a Minister.</P>

I think the Deputy would acknowledge that a great deal has been done to deal with this problem, but the implementation of the policies and programmes is more a matter for the Minister for the Environment and for the local authority than for me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have replied to the question put down by the Deputy.  These payments, as the Deputy is well aware, are the interest payments by the Exchequer and by the semi-State bodies on borrowings. I have, many times, outlined this Government's policy on borrowings. There are other questions down on that subject, in case the Deputy is not so aware.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the estimated national debt including State, semi-State or other Government body or agency borrowing at the end of 1981, if he will express this figure as a percentage of our GNP; the estimated cost of servicing the national debt in 1981, if he will express this figure as a percentage of total tax revenue and as a percentage of our GNP; and the action the Government intend to take to reduce excessive borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>National debt means the debt of the Exchequer and does not include the debt of the semi-State <Col N="1977" /> sector or other Government bodies. As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 24 by Deputy Bruton on 24 February, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the national debt in 1981 since it depends not just on amounts borrowed during the year, but on other factors including movements in exchange rates and the extent to which stocks are issued below their nominal value, which is the amount repayable on maturity and thus the figure used in computing the national debt.  For much the same reasons it is not possible to provide an estimate of the debt of semi-State and other Government agencies.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of servicing the national debt in 1981 is £984 million.  This represents 31 per cent of total tax revenue and 10 per cent of GNP.</P>
      <P>The present level of borrowing is not considered by the Government to be excessive but rather as appropriate to the Government's economic policy.  The Government's approach to borrowing was outlined in my Financial Statement in January.  While the Government are committed to reducing the level of borrowing, especially borrowing for current purposes, the speed with which borrowing can be reduced must take account of fiscal, economic and social constraints.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is able to give us an estimate of the cost of servicing the national debt in 1981, how is he not able to give us an estimate of what the national debt will be at the end of 1981?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined for the Deputy the impossibility of providing an estimate of the specific national debt because it depends on a number of factors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must appreciate that the figure that I am giving him has to be an estimate and no more than that.  While I am prepared to give <Col N="1978" /> an estimate of the cost, I am not prepared to calculate the debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that I appreciate that all of these matters are estimates?  But if the Minister is able to give an estimate of the cost of servicing a debt, surely he should be able to give an estimate of the debt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He could not calculate the cost of servicing it in any other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are basically three factors that affect the calculation of the national debt and I am prepared to give an estimate to the House, in good faith, of what we believe it will cost to service this debt.  But I am not prepared to give something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I might add that the Irish version of place names is also listed in the Place-Names (Irish Forms) (No. 1) (Postal Towns) Order, 1975 and, where locations are not listed, recourse is made to the Place-Names <Col N="1980" /> Commission to ascertain the official Irish version when signposting schemes for national roads are submitted for approval by local authorities to the Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 11 to 19, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1982" /> The 1981 Current Budget provides for total revenue receipts of £3,815 million. Actual receipts for the first three months of the year amounted to £871 million, that is, 22.8 per cent of budget.  The corresponding percentage received in the first three months of 1980 was 23.7 per cent.  The lower percentage of total receipts in the first three months of 1981 is due to the fact that certain revenue receipts delayed by the 1979 Post Office dispute were received in the first quarter of 1980, to the 1980 change in the dates of payment of income tax by the self-employed, to the full-year effects of the substantial income tax concessions introduced in the 1980 Budget which applied from April 1980 and to the fact that the increased revenue arising from the 1981 Budget changes will be received mainly in the remaining nine months of the year.</P>
    <P>On the expenditure side, the 1981 Current Budget provides for total spending of £4,330 million, of which £960 million is for Central Fund Services and £3,370 million for the non-capital supply services. Actual expenditure on Central Fund Services in the first three months of the year was £264 million or 27½ per cent of the annual provision.  This compares with 20.2 per cent spent in the first quarter of 1980 and an average of 26½ per cent for the first quarter of the previous two years. The higher than average percentage spent in the first quarter of the present year was entirely due to the technical timing of issues to the capital services redemption account.</P>
    <P>In the case of the non-capital supply services, expenditure in the first three months of the year amounted to £812 million or 24.1 per cent of total budget. The percentage spent in the corresponding period last year was 22.6 per cent. The previous five year average was 23 per cent.  The percentage spent in the first three months of the current year was affected by technical factors which render it difficult to make comparisons with previous years.</P>
    <P>One major factor, for example, which distorts any comparison between this year and last arises in the case of the Health Vote, where a sizeable pay award, including substantial arrears extending <Col N="1983" /> back to 1979, was paid to nurses subsequent to the end of March 1980, with the result that the 1980 March quarter expenditure was artificially low.</P>
    <P>The 1981 Budget provision for Exchequer-financed capital expenditure, including non-programme outlays, is £1,163 million, of which £273 million &mdash; 23½ per cent &mdash; was spent in the first quarter of the year.  There is no established pattern for capital expenditure since it depends largely on dates contracts are signed, progress made on various projects, weather conditions, and so on. The first quarter percentages spent in the previous four years varied from 17 per cent to 28 per cent of the total budget. The Exchequer returns for the first quarter of the year, therefore, do not support the implications in the questions that there has been a departure from budgetary targets.</P>
    <P>Supplementary Estimates will, of course, be required to implement the social welfare increases contained in the budget and the recently announced housing and farming packages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <P>Please, let me finish. I will give it to him on the industrial output, building activity, interest in tourism generally.  I can assure the Deputy that if he only opens his eyes in his own area he will find evidence everywhere of an upturn in activity in our economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister explain how this upturn in economic activity is accompanied by a rise in seasonally adjusted unemployment in the month of April of just short of 2,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very understandable situation.  The Deputy must realise too that obviously during the deep recession through which we have gone it is understandable that there must be considerable upturn before the figures begin to really show on the employment register.  For example, a good factor which the Deputy may have noticed is the cut-down on short-term unemployment. That indicates the truth of what I am telling the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, accepting Government expenditure on the basis of the figures he has given here, expenditure for the first quarter is fully stretched?  What provision has now been made by the Minister for the second quarter, for the food subsidy provision, for the new house grants announced, for the environmental moneys <Col N="1986" /> announced by the Minister for the Environment, for increased social welfare payments, which are continuing at a high rate due to the high level of unemployment, and for the additional capital moneys required by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;all of which must be reflected by at least an additional 25 to 30 per cent of expenditure in the second quarter and if any provision has been made for that in the current budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier when replying to this question, there are many factors which affect or distort figures for any particular quarter.  I, like any predecessor of mine, would not be prepared to take any quarter in isolation from the whole year.  Some of the items mentioned by the Deputy in his question are, of course, covered in the budget arithmetic.  For others which he mentioned &mdash; for example, the subsidies which have been introduced &mdash; I supported the reasons for their introduction. I said that some would, of course, require Supplementary Estimates but I would hope that the upturn in activity and also the buoyancy of the revenue generated by that upturn would contribute towards the provision of these subsidies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <P>&mdash;the revenue expectations may be?  Even if revenue expectations go from 23 per cent to 30 per cent, arising largely out of tourism &mdash; and I accept the Minister's argument on that point, because there has been an upturn there &mdash; would the Minister not accept that we are now facing a budget deficit of £700 million, largely because of the measures decided in Barrettstown Castle, and in other areas of capital moneys?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 23 to 27 inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The White Paper <i>Programme for National Development 1978-1981</i> and the targets contained in it were published in January 1979 before the onset of the substantial oil price increases in 1979 and the ensuing world-wide economic recession. As a consequence, the assumptions concerning the economic environment in the period covered by the White Paper targets were considerably more optimistic than actual events showed.  This was acknowledged in the further White Paper <i>Investment and National Development 1979-1983,</i> published in January 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1996" /> This White Paper also pointed out that the further deterioration in the international environment, then evident, would have an adverse effect on the Irish economy's prospects.  This was borne out by subsequent events.  The prospective situation in 1981 is, however, more favourable for growth and inflation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had asked a specific question to which a specific answer should be given.  The Minister has used flowery language in the most indefinite kind of way and in what he has said has evaded the issues.  What is the present position in relation to the targets set, a very simple question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Not if one is Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Deputy's information, the 1979 White Paper did not specify any targets for registered unemployment at the end of 1981.  Of course this was because of the uncertainty surrounding the level of labour force increase likely to take place over the period which is very relevant and has been proved by subsequent figures. There is not a 1-for-1 relationship between increases in the level of employment and reductions in the numbers registered as unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell the House whether or not there is an improvement in the position, whether or not the targets were reached, or is the Minister saying no targets were set because they could not be set?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying that the targets for registered unemployment were not met mainly because of the uncertainty surrounding the level of the labour force.  Regarding the other part of the question asked by the Deputy, I think it is true to say that the position &mdash; and we cannot bury our heads in the sand in this respect &mdash; between 1979 and 1981 deteriorated substantially internationally. Oil prices increased at an unprecedented rate which surely was <Col N="1997" /> bound to have some effect on an economy as open as ours.</P>

      <P>Informal meetings of the Council of Ministers (Economics and Finance) take place at irregular intervals. The purpose of these meetings is to give Ministers an opportunity to have an informal and frank exchange of views on topics of current interest.  I would, however, stress the usefulness of such exchanges of views which lead to a better understanding all round of the economic problems of the Community and of individual member states and thus pave the way for formal decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proceedings of informal meetings of Ministers are, as are those of formal Councils, considered confidential. Nevertheless, I can inform the Deputy, as already indicated to the press, that we had an exchange of views about the Community's preparations for the IMF interim Committee and the Joint Development Committee of the IMF and the IBRD.  We also discussed at some length the Community's unemployment problems in the context of the Community's macro economic policy.  I stressed the need for a concerted Community <Col N="2007" /> approach to the solution of the problem and warned against the danger of deflationary policies forcing the Community further into recession and thus postponing the expected upturn in the international economy.  I stressed the need for further investment in order to strengthen the Community economy.  Ministers had an exchange of views also on the restructuring of the Community budget and I pointed out, as the Community Heads of State had already done, that any such restructuring could not call into question the basic principles of the common agricultural policy.  I further reminded my fellow Ministers of the need to use the Community budget and its component parts as an instrument to reduce the disparity between the weaker and the stronger regions of the Community.</P>

      <P>The Bill&mdash;subsection (3) of section 28&mdash;as it stood prevented the application of the new limit of compensation for mental distress, that is £7,500, to causes of action which accrued before the Bill commences. The justification for this is that in principle defendants should not be made liable for damages other than those appropriate at the time of the occurrence of the accident concerned.  I have given further consideration to the matter in the light of the debates in the Dáil and in particular, the amendment which Deputy Keating moved which would, in effect, have deleted subsection (3).  I accept that strict adherence to the principle I have mentioned would mean that the limit now proposed should not have effect in proceedings coming before the courts for a number of years to come &mdash; possibly up to four &mdash; and that the figure of £1,000 would remain in force in these cases.  This would, I am satisfied, give rise to hardship and would be clearly out of line with the intention of the Oireachtas as intended in the 1961 Act which set the limit originally.  For that reason I now propose that the new limit should apply to all cases where the accident in question occurred on or after the date on which the Bill was presented, that is 15 October 1980.  This is a fair and just compromise.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for recognising the weight of our argument that otherwise there would be an injustice.  There are still people, I suppose, who will feel a little offended at the fact that their case which might be settled sometime hence still falls a little short of <Col N="2083" /> what we considered to be ideal in terms of the amount of money they should be entitled to in the area of mental distress. The Minister at least has accepted that the injustice initially proposed in the Bill should not prevail.  The compromise which he now offers is better than the initial proposition.  I am thankful to the Minister for being responsive to our representation in that respect.'</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Two main factors have influenced the evolution of the present Bill.  One was the need to improve the organisation and powers of the country's fire service to meet present and future requirements. The other factor was the necessity for strong and detailed provisions relating to fire safety.</P>
      <P>The Bill was at a very advanced stage when the Stardust tragedy occurred in February.  The House will recall that, following that tragedy, I undertook that certain activities would be developed in a short time.  The completion of the processing of the Bill was one of these and, in fact, its presentation now discharges the last of the undertakings which I gave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may remind the House, the other measures which I referred to then were that revised draft building regulations, incorporating amendments, would be published within six weeks and made available for use in their operations by local authorities, industrial and professional bodies, pending the enactment of the necessary legislation to give them statutory force, and that a special task force, reporting directly to me, would be set up with a special budget to augment the <Col N="2084" /> work of the Fire Prevention Council in promoting greater public awareness of fire hazards, especially those associated with places of public entertainment.  I am pleased to report to the House that these commitments have been honoured in full.  Furthermore, I have introduced a scheme of 50 per cent State subsidy on loan charges on fire stations and equipment.</P>
    <P>The present Bill, however, is the most important of the measures involved, both for the comprehensiveness of its proposals to update and strengthen the law and because it fixes the new framework within which the efforts of all concerned with fire safety must henceforth be directed. To set these new provisions in perspective, it is necessary to deal briefly with the history of fire services legislation up to the present time.</P>
    <P>Apart from certain local Acts, this legislation was confined in the 19th century to a number of Town Commissioners Acts, beginning in 1828 and culminating in the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act, 1854.  This meant that fire-fighting powers were the preserve of certain urban authorities only and, even there, the exercise of them was adoptive rather than mandatory.  Part VIII of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907, gave an implied power to maintain a fire brigade to both urban and rural local authorities, but again the measures involved were only adoptive.</P>
    <P>The primary object of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, was to introduce a statutory requirement of fire cover right across the country.  This it did by imposing an obligation on all sanitary authorities to make reasonable provision for the prompt and efficient extinguishing of fires in their areas and for the protection and rescue of persons and property from injury by fire.  Sanitary authorities were free to discharge this obligation either by themselves maintaining a fire brigade or by arranging with another authority to provide this service in their area.  The 1940 Act also laid down the basis of a fire prevention system in the concept which it introduced of a &ldquo;potentially dangerous building&rdquo; in relation to which the sanitary <Col N="2085" /> authority was enabled to serve a fire precautions notice.</P>
    <P>Although the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, was a comparatively brief measure, it enabled local authorities to establish an effective fire fighting system and to operate considerable controls for the prevention of fire hazards.  Accordingly, although the present Bill proposes to repeal the old Act, a number of its provisions are being re-enacted, but usually with such amendments as experience has shown to be necessary.</P>
    <P>Much has happened in the past 40 years to warrant a radical review of fire service legislation.  Industrialisation has been in progress on a scale never contemplated in 1940.  Less dramatic, perhaps, but just as important has been the growth in residential, service and amenity development consequent on our expanding population and increased economic activity. Another factor is that changes have taken place in the methods, scale and style of construction, including introduction of new buildings materials.</P>
    <P>All of these things add to the demands on the fire service not only in regard to fire fighting strength but also in regard to equipment and training.  A new dimension has been added in the need to secure fire safety in buildings and in the contribution which the fire service is called on to make to the operation of planning and development controls.</P>
    <P>It is true that the greatest concentration of buildings is in our urban areas but fire hazards are not confined to these areas.  Many factories, institutions, stores and housing schemes are located outside urban boundaries.  Rural areas share with urban areas the problems which may arise from the transport of hazardous substances, major road or rail accidents and other disasters.  All of these are matters in which the fire service must become increasingly involved in providing emergency assistance.</P>
    <P>The need for a thorough assessment of the capacity of our fire service for its now more onerous role was recognised when the Minister for Local Government appointed a working party in November 1972 with full terms of reference in relation <Col N="2086" /> to the fire service.  In particular, the working party was asked to advise the Minister on the questions of fire resources, fire prevention measures, legislation, financial implications and on staffing and training arrangements.</P>
    <P>The main report of the working party was published in July 1975 and it contained 39 recommendations grouped around the five headings of the operational fire service; fire prevention; staffing structure and qualifications; training, and miscellaneous aspects.</P>
    <P>In addition to this complex set of recommendations, a number of minority reports were also submitted with the main working party report.</P>
    <P>The report on the fire service, and the comments which were received on it have in practice formed the basis of a programme of action which has been under way in recent years with a view to improving and modernising the country's fire service.  I think it important to stress to the House the ongoing nature of this programme and in particular to allay any impression that implementation of the fire service report is only now beginning with the publication of the new Fire Services Bill.  New legislation, important though it is, is only one instrument in a concerted series of measures to equip the fire service for the challenges facing it.</P>
    <P>To remind the House of some of the more important initiatives involved, local fire service reviews, one of the key measures recommended by the working party, were requested by my Department in 1976.  Reports by the local authorities involved have been completed for all areas and they will now have the benefit of these reviews in remedying any deficiencies revealed.  A central training programme for fire service personnel has been developed by my Department to supplement local training.  As recommended in the 1975 report, a Fire Prevention Council was statutorily established by my predecessor in July 1978 to promote greater public awareness of the need for fire safety.  The staff dealing with fire matters in my Department has been substantially expanded and a considerable programme is in train for the provision of advice and assistance to fire <Col N="2087" /> authorities by the issue of guidelines, memoranda and circulars.</P>
    <P>The Government's concern to bring real improvement to the quality of our fire service is probably shown in its most practical form by the greatly increased capital investment in the service which we have authorised since taking up office in 1977.  In that year the capital provision made for fire services by the previous Government amounted to just £694,000. Mindful that a much more realistic allocation was necessary to make a meaningful start on the backlog of fire service projects, the present Government have provided over £2 million each year since 1978.  In all, the £9.2 million made available by this Government in capital for fire services over the four years of our administration amounts to some three-and-a-half times that provided by the previous Government over the five budgets for which they were responsible.</P>
    <P>This priming of the capital programmes of local authorities, which is already bearing fruit by way of new and modernised fire stations and new fire appliances and equipment, is also being matched by an increased commitment to fire services from local authorities' own revenue resources.  This increase may be measured both in absolute terms, with some £17 million devoted to fire services in 1980 as compared to £9.37 million in 1977, and by the greater percentage of the overall revenue resources of local authorities now being devoted to fire services.</P>
    <P>These measures and others, which have been pursued independently of the new Bill, are all contributing in their way to the achievement of an improved and more efficient fire service, but the Fire Services Bill now before us marks a major advance in the comprehensive legislative framework which it proposes for the further development of the service.  If I may try first to avert some possible misconceptions about the Bill, I would like to point out that it has not been necessary to provide specially in it for many general powers which will remain available to fire authorities in their capacity as local authorities.  These general local government  <Col N="2088" /> powers, already contained in other legislation, will underpin the activities of fire authorities in such matters as revenue financing, borrowing, staffing and land acquisition.</P>
    <P>In particular, I am satisfied that an adequate machinery already exists for the development of effective organisational and staffing structures.  Negotiations on the development of such structures, with particular reference to the county fire services, have been taking place for some considerable time under the relevant conciliation and arbitration scheme.  So far, however, it has not been possible to evolve a structure that would meet the differing views and aspirations of the various interested groups which are concerned with the fire service.  There have been, for example, opposed views by the unions on the question of whether chief fire officers should report to county or city engineers or directly to county or city managers.  Similarly, there have been differing approaches to questions involving organisation, staffing and promotional outlets at levels below the chief fire officers, and in regard to the qualifications that should attach to posts at various levels.</P>
    <P>This Bill, with the improvements it envisages, provides an opportunity for all parties to look afresh at staffing arrangements. I am confident that it is possible to develop a staff structure which takes account of the interest of the community and also the reasonable aspirations of the different staff groups involved.  The problem must be approached in this light with a view to bringing it to an early and successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is divided into four parts under which are grouped sections dealing with preliminary and general matters, the organisation of the fire service, fire fighting and fire safety requirements, and, finally, consequential financial and administrative arrangements.  Part I is concerned with preliminary and general matters and contains a number of standard sections dealing with commencement, definitions, procedure for making regulations and certain orders, and the expenses of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The main substantive provisions of</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2089" /> Part I are the repeal by section 8 of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940 and the now obsolete Cinematograph Act, 1909, and the greatly increased penalties for offences under the Bill are specified by section 5.</P>
    <P>Summary and indictable offences are treated separately.  A person convicted of the former will be liable to a maximum penalty of a £500 fine and/or 6 months' imprisonment.  Indictable offences, which may arise from failure to comply with the duties placed by the Act on persons having control of certain premises (section 18 (2) and section 37) or on a persons on whom a fire safety notice is served (section 20), will be even more severely punishable by fines of up to £10,000 and/or imprisonment of up to two years.</P>
    <P>The penalties provided for in section 5 may seem severe when contrasted with the maximum single penalties under the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, of a fine of £50 or three months' imprisonment.  Their severity, I can assure the House, is not an end in itself but a recognition of the right of society as a whole to be protected against any irresponsibility in relation to fire risk.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill proposes a new organisation of the fire service.  The main feature of this will be to concentrate and integrate in 35 local authorities, to be known as fire authorities, responsibility for both fire fighting and fire safety functions. The 35 fire authorities provided for in section 9 are the 27 county councils, the four county borough corporations, the borough corporations of Dun Laoghaire and Drogheda and the urban district councils of Dundalk and Athlone.</P>
    <P>The change involved here is best understood by reference to the Fire Brigades Act, 1940.  Under this, responsibility for both fire fighting and fire safety was, formerly at least, assigned individually to each of 87 sanitary authorities.  In practice, all but the four boroughs or urban districts which I have just named have made arrangements with their county council for the provision of a fire brigade service, so that assigning fire fighting functions to the 35 authorities only recognises the <i>de facto</i> position <Col N="2090" /> which has obtained for some time.</P>
    <P>The situation in respect of fire prevention functions is somewhat different. Under both the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, and a number of other enactments, these functions have tended to be vested in all 87 sanitary authorities.  While statutory agreements have been made by a number of urban authorities to have these fire safety functions carried out by their county council, formal arrangements of this kind have not been the general rule. At the same time, most urban authorities have been relying on county councils, partly at least, to provide them informally with the expertise necessary to discharge their fire prevention functions.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that it is desirable to strengthen and rationalise this structure. Section 11 of the Bill accordingly provides for the transfer to the 35 fire authorities of the main fire safety functions vested in local authorities generally under other enactments.  Section 17 provides, as may be necessary, for the transfer of staff or property dedicated exclusively to fire prevention work from boroughs or urban districts to the relevant fire authority.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the important relationship between fire prevention and planning control.  So as to ensure a full fire safety input into the planning decisions of urban authorities who are not fire authorities, section 13 will allow a fire authority to advise a planning authority on the exercise of their planning control functions.</P>
    <P>The fire fighting functions of fire authorities, which are set out in section 10 of the Bill, are largely a re-enactment of the corresponding provision of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940.  A general duty is placed on fire authorities to make provision for the prompt and efficient extinguishing of fires in buildings and other places, and to establish and maintain a fire brigade.  Fire authorities are expressly enabled by section 10 to make arrangements with each other for the joint discharge of their functions and to enter agreements with any other person or body either to provide or to avail of services.  Section 14 requires fire authorities, as far as reasonably possible, to give <Col N="2091" /> assistance to one another.</P>
    <P>The present Bill, however, does not itself authorise the making of agreements between fire authorities for the performance of the functions of one authority by the other, and, indeed, it actually drops a provision to this effect which was contained in section 2 (3) of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940.  The reason is that an adequate framework for such agency arrangements has been provided by an enactment subsequent to the 1940 Act, namely section 59 of the Local Government Act, 1955. The present Bill does provide, however, in subsection (6) of section 10, for a reserve power of the Minister to order agreements under the 1955 Act to be made between fire authorities where this appears to him to be necessary.</P>
    <P>It will be convenient at this stage to deal briefly with the additional fire fighting powers of fire authorities which are spelt out in sections 25 to 28 of the Bill. Sections 25 and 26 give statutory recognition to the now wider role of fire brigades in coping with emergencies of all kinds.  Section 25 does this by allowing a fire authority to carry out or assist at operations of an emergency nature whether or not a risk of fire is involved. Section 26 requires fire authorities to prepare fire and emergency operations plans.  Sections 27 and 28 develop considerably the provisions of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940 regarding control of operations at a fire, section 27 designating and defining the person in control and section 28 giving this person wide ancillary powers.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill is completed by two important sections dealing with the training of fire service personnel.  While the primary duty in this regard is properly placed by section 15 on fire authorities themselves, the Minister for the Environment is also empowered to assist, both by arranging for instruction and certificates and by the grant of financial assistance. I should say in passing that these provisions are only a logical recognition of the practical involvement of my Department in this area in recent years.  Section 16 allows for the establishment, by order, of a special body to be known as the Fire Services Training Council whose role it <Col N="2092" /> will be to advise the Minister for the Environment on the training needs of fire authorities.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill is concerned with fire fighting and fire safety provisions, the former of which I have already outlined to the House.  An important new principle behind the fire safety provisions of the Bill is to emphasise the responsibility of persons having control over certain premises to take all reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire and to ensure the safety of persons on the premises.</P>
    <P>Section 18 introduces this obligation and specifies the type of premises concerned. Broadly, all premises to which the public have access fall within the scope of the section, which also requires all persons on such premises to conduct themselves in such a way as not to expose any other person to danger from fire.  I regard this as a very important provision of the Bill and it will, I hope, result in greater emphasis by property owners themselves on preventive action.</P>
    <P>The Bill also strengthens the powers of fire authorities to take action on potentially dangerous buildings. Strong powers already exist in the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, to deal with such buildings, as witness the action taken by local authorities following my request to them recently. However, sections 19 and 20 will clarify and widen the powers of fire authorities in this regard.  An appeal procedure to the District Court, on the lines of the existing procedure, is provided for in section 21.  A separate power, however, is being given to fire authorities in section 23, where serious fire risk is involved, to apply to the High Court for an order restricting or immediately prohibiting the use of land or buildings.</P>
    <P>Fire authorities will, of course, continue to have available to them the opportunity under various other codes, including the Licensing Acts and the Public Dance Halls Act, to ensure that adequate fire precautions are taken in such premises. A reserve power is also being taken in section 37 to make regulations prescribing precautions to be taken in premises covered by section 18, to which I <Col N="2093" /> referred earlier.  If the need arises, I would intend, following consultation with the various interests concerned, to use the powers in this section to ensure adequate protection of persons and property against fire risk.</P>
    <P>The ministerial powers being taken in section 37 invite some comment on the degrees of central and local involvement envisaged by the Bill.  As I have explained, responsibility for provision of a fire fighting service and for performance of certain fire safety functions will rest with local authorities.  The role of my Department will be to promote standardisation and encourage and support, mainly by advice and guidance, the efforts of local authorities.  Guidelines on certain aspects of the service have already been issued by my Department.</P>
    <P>For example, in April of this year detailed guidelines on the use of breathing apparatus were issued to local authorities. Guidelines on recruit training were issued in 1980 and on the planning of retained fire stations in 1977.  Recommended fire protection standards were issued earlier.  It is my intention to continue to provide guidance as required on the standard of the service.</P>
    <P>I might mention that work has already commenced in my Department on the preparation of guidelines on various aspects of the service, including recommended specifications for fire appliances, fire safety in high risk buildings, fire drills and medical standards for recruit firemen.</P>
    <P>The remaining major provision of Part III of the Bill is section 22.  This gives wide powers of inspection of any land or building to a person authorised by a fire authority.  In addition to powers of inspection, the section enables an authorised officer to require information to be given to him and to conduct tests and examinations.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill, with the exception of section 37, which I have already outlined, deals with miscellaneous matters of finance and administration.  Section 32 will allow the Minister for the Environment, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, to make annual grants to fire authorities towards the expenditure <Col N="2094" /> incurred by them in providing a fire service. This provision will validate the scheme of 50 per cent State subsidy on loan charges arising on capital borrowing for fire services which I introduced earlier this year and which will greatly assist fire authorities in providing new stations and equipment where these are necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 33 allows for grants from the Minister for the Environment to persons or bodies engaged in fire research.  Section 35 is another financial provision and it makes it clear that, with the exception of urban authorities who are fire authorities in their own right, the expenses of fire authorities will be apportionable equally over county and urban areas.  The section also introduces an important new principle whereby a fire authority will be entitled to charge users or beneficiaries of its services.</P>
    <P>Section 34 makes provision, familiar in local government legislation, for the furnishing of information by fire authorities to the Minister, and section 38 is a technical measure clarifying the means by which notices under the Bill may be served.  Section 36, finally, adapts a provision of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, so as to give immunity against legal proceedings arising from the discharge of their functions under the Bill to the fire authorities, sanitary authorities and the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a long and complex one and will undoubtedly benefit from the detailed scrutiny which this House will be giving it on Committee Stage.  Of course I will be prepared to consider any constructive suggestions for improvement of the Bill's provisions.  I am satisfied, however, that in its general principles it will provide an effective framework within which to harness the good will and interest which now exist on all sides for the improvement of the country's fire service.</P>
    <P>As I have already emphasised, the Bill is being complemented by a number of parallel measures, notably the revised draft building regulations to which I propose soon to give statutory force.  But both practically and symbolically the Fire Services Bill, 1981, stands at the centre of the concerted effort under way for the <Col N="2095" /> renewal of the fire service.  I know that this House will be fully alive to its responsibilities in this regard and I now commend the Bill to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of recent circumstances, and debates and parliamentary questions in the House in the last number of months, I am surprised at what I fear to be a tone of unctuous self-righteousness running through the speech the Minister has just delivered.  I thought that in the circumstances it was less than adequate.  On 19 March last I asked a parliamentary question, reported at column 1933 of the Official Report for that day.  I asked the Minister for the Environment whether legal proceedings had been initiated against his Department by an officer (details supplied) of his Department and, if so, the details of such proceedings and the outcome thereof.  The Minister replied:</P>
      <P>A High Court summons was issued on 15 May 1978 on behalf of the officer concerned.  The plaintiff claimed that the Minister for the Environment was failing to consider or implement advice tendered to him by the plaintiff and was failing to carry out and implement his statutory functions; that the plaintiff was frustrated and prevented from carrying out his functions; and that certain allegations made against the plaintiff by another officer of the Department were untrue and unjustified and made in contravention of natural and constitutional justice.  The plaintiff indicated on 31 July 1978 that notice of discontinuance of this court action was being served.</P>
      <P>A number of supplementary questions were asked.  I asked the Minister to explain the reasons for the withdrawal of the action.  I was told there were changes in the administrative arrangements in relation to that office in the Department. As we all know, the officer concerned is the chief fire adviser to the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the introduction of this Bill and the comments made by the Minister should be taken in the context of that <Col N="2096" /> High Court summons issued on 15 May 1978, because it contrasts rather strangely with some of the self-congratulatory remarks made on behalf of the Government by the present Minister.  It is strange that the chief fire adviser to the Department of the Environment, to the Minister's colleague and to his predecessor in the Department, should have felt obliged two and a half years ago to take High Court proceedings against the Minister and the Department, a procedure which I think everyone would agree is virtually unparallelled in the history of the Irish public service.  As I have said, that contrasts strangely with some of the sentiments expressed in the Minister's speech today.</P>
    <P>In the course of replies to various parliamentary questions in the last few months I found myself obliged to describe the chief fire adviser to the Minister as being akin to the man in the iron mask: he is locked into the Department of the Environment in the Custom House; only certain people will speak to him and he is allowed to speak to certain people only; he is not entitled or allowed to venture out in public for fear, apparently, that this unfortunate man, who has been attempting to perform his part adequately and who made the Department and the local authorities and the public aware of the poor state of the fire services, might bring embarrassment on all of us.  That court action he was obliged to take two-and-a-half years ago in order to have his voice heard and to provide realistic fire fighting, fire prevention and training services is to be commended. His efforts in this matter are in stark contrast to what happened at other levels and are in strange contrast to some of the sentiments of congratulation expressed by the Minister to himself, his predecessor and to the Government generally for the action they have ostensibly taken in the past four years.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Minister's remark that the Bill was at an advanced stage when the Stardust tragedy occurred in February.  Too little happened in the five years from 1975 and too much happened since last February for us to believe that all of the matters referred to were to be <Col N="2097" /> announced and would have been implemented in the two months since the dreadful Stardust tragedy.  It would have been better and more fair if we all had admitted we had been remiss in developing an adequate, modern fire service. We should have admitted we were wrong in not perceiving there were changing requirements in the light of modern developments and we should have stated that we intended to put the position right as soon as possible.  We should have admitted that we accepted we should have acted on the report of the working party on the fire services, the majority report of which has formed the basis for this Bill.  It would have been more acceptable and honest if the Minister had taken that attitude rather than endeavouring to suggest that all the huffing and puffing on his part and all the pronouncements that have been made since February would have been made in any event.  Neither the public nor any Member of this House is likely to be fooled by such remarks by the Minister and they take away from the general discussion that is needed at present.</P>
    <P>The fact is that at the end of March six posts of chief fire officer in various counties were vacant.  The posts in question were in Donegal where a vacancy existed since 28 July 1978; in north Tipperary where a vacancy existed since 30 July 1978; in Sligo-Leitrim where a vacancy existed since 20 May 1979; in Limerick where the post has been vacant since 16 June 1979 and in Roscommon where the post has been vacant since 1 December 1979.  In reply to my parliamentary question on 24 March the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Sanction issued to the creation of a post of chief fire officer in Monaghan on 19 April 1978 but the post there has not yet been filled.  The vacancies in that post and the other posts which have been vacant since 1978 were advertised on a number of occasions by the Local Appointments Commissioners without success.</P>
    <P>I am not sure of the number of occasions on which the posts were advertised but the question must be asked why these posts were not filled.  Was there some <Col N="2098" /> defect with regard to the salaries, the conditions of service or the qualifications sought?  In his reply the Minister stated the following:</P>
    <P>As a result of an agreement reached at conciliation on 18 April 1979 between management and the staff side on the restructuring of engineering and cognate professional grades, including the grade of chief fire officer, in the local authority service, it was agreed at the request of the staff side that recruitment of professional staff at the relevant levels would be suspended pending the assessment through local negotiations of each local authority's requirements under the new structure and its implementation.  Since then negotiations have been continuing with the staff side on the question of the application of the agreement to the office of chief fire officer and the restructuring of that office, but agreement has not yet been reached on this issue with the staff side, differences existing between the different interests on the staff side.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, however, in my statement in the House on 18 February last, I have decided that pending agreement with staff side interests on the restructuring of the office of chief fire officer, arrangements be put in train for the filling of the chief fire officer vacancies on the basis of the old conditions with an addendum that these conditions are at present being reviewed.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in the latter part of the Minister's answer we are getting nearer to the truth as to why the six posts were not filled, some of them for more than two years. Apparently as a result of a secret agreement between the Department of the Environment and staff interests involved, it was decided that the posts should not be filled while negotiations were to take place with regard to conditions of service and other requirements.  Does that reflect well on the Department of the Environment or on the staff side?  I think not.  A change was brought about suddenly by events prior to 18 February and the Minister decided suddenly that the six posts should be advertised on the basis of the <Col N="2099" /> old conditions.  As I stated, perhaps we were getting nearer to the truth when it emerged that the posts had not been filled, including, significantly, the post vacant in Donegal, because of the fact that the Department of the Environment and the staff side made a secret agreement in 1978.</P>
    <P>In reply to Question No. 440 on 10 March 1981 the Minister for the Environment told the House the following:</P>
    <P>As at 31 January 1981 the following proposals for additional posts dealing with fire safety (i.e. fire prevention) were before my Department:</P>
    <P>Galway County Council&mdash;1 Second Fire Officer and 1 Executive Engineer (temporary) from 7.10.80.</P>
    <P>Laois County Council&mdash;1 Second Fire Officer from 16.11.78.</P>
    <P>Offaly County Council&mdash;1 Second Fire Officer from 27.9.78.</P>
    <P>The making of a decision on these proposals has been deferred pending the completion of conciliation negotiations on the restructuring of the fire service.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure the residents of Laois and Offaly feel much more secure in the knowledge that the Minister has deferred appointing fire prevention officers in their counties pending the completion of the negotiations he mentioned.  If one looks back at the reports one sees that various organisations have been talking for the past ten years about the restructuring of the fire services.  That is more relevant than the unctuous tones of self-congratulation evident in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>Since the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, there have been fundamental changes with regard to the operation of fire services and fire prevention measures.  Because there was no updating of the legislation, deficiencies have arisen in relation to the organisation, the resources, the staffing, the training of the staff of the fire service and the provision of finance.  There are deficiencies in relation to fire prevention, the training of fire prevention officers and the implementation of fire prevention control measures.  All those deficiencies <Col N="2100" /> have arisen because the legislation was defective and became obsolete with the passage of time.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the Minister's tone when he implies that the enactment of this Bill is one small part only of a continuing process of improving the fire service. This is the part which has delayed the evolution of a modern, comprehensive fire service with properly trained and properly qualified staff carrying out in-service training courses and implementing the more modern techniques of fire fighting and fire safety.  Because of the absence of a comprehensive up-to-date Bill, these defects have arisen in the other areas.</P>
    <P>Over the past 40 years with industrialisation and the vastly increased use of chemicals and dangerous substances in industrial projects, and the use of complicated chemicals in the manufacture of furniture and fittings for ordinary dwellings, there has been a need for changes in fire fighting techniques and fire prevention control measures.  They were not catered for in the 1940 Act but they were dealt with very comprehensively in the major report of the working party on the fire service whose recommendations were published in 1975.</P>
    <P>As a result of the publication of that report and the major fire in Noyeks in Dublin some years ago, we might have expected the introduction of legislation. A question arises in relation to other aspects of Government services.  Why should a period of six years be allowed to elapse between the publication of a report highlighting major deficiencies in the fire service and an attempt to mend the hand of the fire authorities?</P>
    <P>The general provisions of the Bill are welcome.  It is regrettable that it took the Stardust fire to bring about the introduction of the Bill.  I find it difficult to accept the Minister's assurance that the Bill was at a very advanced stage when the Stardust tragedy occurred in February.  I wonder what other major tragedies will have to occur before necessary changes in the legislative code are made.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects of the Bill is that powers of inspection have been streamlined and strengthened considerably <Col N="2101" /> over and above the powers given to fire officers in the 1940 Act.  That is probably the most important provision in the Bill together with the right of the fire authorities in certain cases only &mdash; and I will deal with this in greater detail later on &mdash; to go to the High Court and seek immediate closure of premises which are felt to be dangerous and to represent a serious fire hazard.</P>
    <P>In the 1940 Act there are delaying provisions which were adverted to by many people in the wake of the Stardust tragedy of which the Minister appeared to be unaware or to have discounted.  They are the provisions which oblige a local authority to serve a fire notice which gives the owner of the property the right to appeal to the District Court within 14 days of the service of that notice.  There will be no decision until the District Court hearing has taken place.  There may be a number of adjournments and the final decision of the District Court may not be made for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>That very inadequate procedure is being re-enacted in this Bill.  It is quite obvious that it is the Minister's intention that that is to be the normal procedure adopted by the fire authorities.  They will still have to serve a notice which allows a 14-day appeal period.  There may be delays in the hearing of public authority matters, and the possible seeking and granting of adjournments in certain cases if sufficient documents and expert witnesses are not produced.  All that is provided again in this Fire Services Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a separate provision that, in certain cases, the fire authority may go to the High Court to seek an immediate closure.  I suspect it is expected that those visits to the High Court will be of such an extraordinary and unusual nature as to be spoken about in awe in fire prevention circles.  I hope that is not the case. Because of the repetition of the inadequate and faulty section in the 1940 Act in this Bill, there may not be the degree of improvement we would like to have seen.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the inadequacies I have mentioned, we should pay tribute in this House to the personnel who operate the fire services and who show an <Col N="2102" /> extraordinary degree of dedication and bravery.  They have earned the respect and admiration of the general public.  If the public realised the faulty back-up service, the lack of training, the lack of in-service training courses, their admiration for the personnel would increase enormously but their respect for the service would be eroded seriously.</P>
    <P>With regard to the notices to be served on people where it is felt that their premises are potentially hazardous from the point of view of fire, I should like the Minister to clarify whether it is intended that, having been served, they should be kept in a register maintained by the fire authorities and available for inspection by the general public.  It is important to have such a register open to inspection by the public.  The fire authorities should also maintain &mdash; in their own interest even if not for public inspection &mdash; a register setting out when inspections were carried out on different premises for fire safety purposes.  I should like the Minister to deal with that matter in his reply.</P>
    <P>It is quite ridiculous &mdash; and it exemplifies the weakness in the 1940 Act &mdash; that the fire protection notices which operate at present do not contain provisions for seeking or making mandatory the provision of such items as fire extinguishers, alarm systems or sprinkler systems in public premises.  It has been suggested that temporary structures such as marquees or timber buildings frequented by the general public are exempt and cannot have a fire protection notice served in relation to them.</P>
    <P>Those matters were highlighted in the 1975 report.  If it is correct, as that report indicates, that a fire protection notice does not apply to marquees set up for public dancing or the like, it is disgraceful. That proves the point I have been making that it was wrong that that situation should have been allowed to continue not just since 1940 but especially since 1975 when attention was drawn to that inadequacy.  The report deals extensively with the matter of fire prevention and points out the importance of fire prevention for a number of reasons not least being the question of cost.  The <Col N="2103" /> report states that compared to the cost of maintaining a fire brigade and the loss that can be incurred through fire the cost of an intensified fire prevention programme would be modest.  The report also stated that it could be expected to yield a material saving of major proportions, not to mention the saving in human lives and suffering.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we can say that there has been anything like a comprehensive programme of fire prevention measures operating anywhere in the country.  I said before that I felt it would be generally regarded that of all the fire services operating the Dublin Fire Brigade is the best equipped and trained and the most professional of the forces.  Yet, it is interesting to reflect on the situation that obtains in the Dublin Fire Brigade.  Until after the Stardust tragedy there was no inspection of public premises at night when the premises were most likely to be occupied or used by many people.  Within the Dublin fire service &mdash; I believe the same applies in other parts of the country &mdash; many of the existing fire prevention officers are non-operational staff with little or no training in fire prevention.  In the Dublin fire service the number of people engaged in fire prevention control measures does not go beyond single figures as opposed to the number of staff utilised for the purpose of fire prevention in cities like Liverpool and other British cities.  The number engaged in fire prevention there could be as high as 40 compared to Dublin where less than ten are engaged.</P>
    <P>The qualification for a fire prevention officer is that he should have a professional degree in engineering.  It is alleged by the trade union that represents personnel employed within the fire service that in the course of the four years it takes to obtain a degree in engineering one spends two hours of the entire course on fire prevention education.  Yet the requirement advertised by the Local Appointments Commission for a fire prevention officer is that the applicant should have a BE degree.  If that is the case it amounts to a serious deficiency in the standard of qualification necessary <Col N="2104" /> for fire prevention purposes.  In relation to the co-ordination of fire prevention matters and the granting of planning permission for the construction of new properties very often one finds that a condition of the granting of permission is that the requirements of the chief fire officer be obtained and adhered to.  If one looks at most of the planning application files one will find that the observations of the chief fire officer on the application amounts to a blank square.  That happens because there are not enough personnel in the fire prevention service and the fire service to make an adequate observation on plans submitted.  In the majority of cases in Dublin involving major public buildings the standard clause inserted in the granting of planning permission is that the requirements of the chief fire officer be obtained and adhered to.  There is no way one can ascertain whether the observations of the fire officer are adhered to.  That situation exists because we do not have the personnel to deal with that field.</P>
    <P>If the fact that I have raised this matter brings about a degree of inspection or emphasis in this area the discussion today will be worthwhile.  There is no doubt that a number of public buildings, especially big lounges built for use as extensions to public houses, have in recent years been converted from places where people met for a social drink to places which operate as cabaret lounges.  People are attracted to such places because of the cabaret entertainment being provided there.  We must all be aware of the number of such lounges which were not constructed as public theatres or places like that but now have hundreds of patrons crammed into them although those buildings were never intended to hold the numbers admitted to them from time to time.  Those buildings cannot have a sufficient degree of fire control measures.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider contacting the fire authorities to draw their attention to the fact that the use of public buildings has been changed over the years from the original intention set out in the granting of planning permission to the every day use they are now being put <Col N="2105" /> to.  The operation of these cabaret licensed lounges should be urgently considered. In the area of fire prevention we had the clearest example of the Government's attitude to this matter prior to the Stardust tragedy.  Two years ago the Federation of Insurers agreed to set up the Fire Prevention Council with the Government. The purpose of the council was, through advertisements and public courses, to make the public, industry and commerce more aware of the need for fire prevention measures.  The council is jointly funded by the Government and the insurance companies.  It has been in operation since 1978 and is still trying to find its feet and decide the areas in which to spend money.  The council suggested that the 1980 budget of £100,000 should be increased to £140,000 or £150,000. This was to allow the council to carry out a vastly expanded series of newspaper advertisements bearing in mind the increased cost of such advertisements. Admittedly, the increase sought was abnormal in percentage terms but not an extraordinary sum to be spent annually by such a body that was set up to advertise nationally the advantages of fire prevention measures.</P>
    <P>The insurers who pay half of the cost&mdash; and whom one might have expected in the private interests involved to have baulked at such a large percentage increase&mdash;agreed on their side to bear 50 . per cent of the cost of the budget which the Fire Prevention Council sought.  The Minister for the Environment refused, and that refusal to meet that increase emanated from his Department within weeks of the Stardust tragedy.  The Minister's Department suggested that the budget for the Fire Prevention Council should be increased all right, from £100,000 in 1980 to £105,000 in 1981.  The comparison between recently alluded to inflation rate increases in the cost of living for the first month of this year and 1980 highlights whether there was an increase in real terms in the amount of money which the Minister decided the Fire Prevention Council should spend, and not only what they should spend before the Stardust fire.  He confirmed afterwards that that was the maximum amount of <Col N="2106" /> money which they should have available to them.</P>
    <P>In that context the Minister in the immediate aftermath of the Stardust tragedy announced that he was setting up a task force to advise on fire matters and that he would ask the chairman of the Fire Prevention Council to head this task force.  He alluded to that task force in his speech today.  I would have preferred if he had explained to the House in some detail what exactly the task force are going to be, what exactly will be the source of finance for them and where exactly he sees them in real terms improving the position in relation to the fire services.  The simple fact of the matter in relation to fire prevention measures at present is that there are no national standards whatsoever and if the task force or the provisions contained in this Bill help in any way to bring about national standards they will certainly represent an improvement.  The situation now is that what could be passed as safe in one fire authority area could be deemed tremendously unsafe on a number of grounds in an adjoining area.</P>
    <P>I welcome in particular the provisions in section 20 of the current Bill which refer to the service of the fire safety notice on the owner or occupier of a building which is considered to be a potentially dangerous building.  The explanatory memorandum says at page 5:</P>
    <P>Whether or not use is prohibited, a fire safety notice can impose requirements as to the provision of emergency lighting, exit signs and fire safety notices, the arrangements to be made for the maintenance of certain equipment and fittings, the power and heating systems, the arrangements for safe storage of certain materials, the measures to be taken to ensure that employees receive fire safety training, the holding of fire drills, the keeping of appropriate records, the assignment of responsibility for fire safety measures and the limiting of the number of persons in the building at any one time.</P>
    <P>Other items are required as well, but all of those requirements were recommended in the 1975 report.  The existing <Col N="2107" /> fire protection notice was not empowered to have included within it the majority of those requirements.  I have to ask now why we are in May 1981 discussing the implementation of proposals of a 1975 report which proposals seem now, on the face of it certainly, to be self-justifying and not requiring any explanation or any delay in their implementation.  Yet is has taken from 1975 until now to see this legislative change being brought about. I have to ask the House if, had the provisions of section 20 been in operation since 1975, more people might be alive today than there are.</P>
    <P>In the area of training the <i>Report on the Fire Service 1974</i> pointed out in chapter ix, paragraph 9.1.1:</P>
    <P>...such a programme is necessary to ensure that the expertise essential to the most efficient operation of the service and the safety of personnel, is developed and maintained at all levels.</P>
    <P>It was essential that that should happen. It is recommended, for instance, in paragraph 9.1.2 that:</P>
    <P>Technical training for firemen in middle grades will be needed in the following respects:</P>
    <P>(i) Induction training with particular reference to practical firemanship, for new appointees;</P>
    <P>(ii)  continuation training, theoretical and practical, to maintain and improve performance standards;</P>
    <P>(iii) courses to deal with specialist aspects and to raise the level of skills generally;</P>
    <P>(iv) courses by which personnel will be assisted in obtaining qualifications for advancement.</P>
    <P>In relation to those four recommendations let us consider the situation with respect again to the example I have been using, the Dublin Fire Brigade.  There is an induction course for recruits entering the Dublin Fire Brigade which goes on for something like four weeks.  However, in relation to continuation training, theoretical or practical, courses to deal with <Col N="2108" /> specialist aspects or courses by which personnel will be assisted to obtain qualifications for advancement, the fact is that, even within the Dublin Fire Brigade Service, virtually none of these courses is in existence.  There are a number of basic drills which are carried out, but the standard which would be required in order to match up with the recommendation of the report are just not in existence in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The report also recommends at chapter ix, paragraph 9.3.5 in relation to courses for wholetime fire brigades:</P>
    <P>Two courses of 12 weeks each for recruit training to cater for about 20 personnel per course.</P>
    <P>Four 1 week refresher courses for all full-time firemen&mdash;20 per course.</P>
    <P>One course, training sub-officers on appointment: to include leadership, station routine, report writing, etc.</P>
    <P>One course for existing sub-officers: to include fire ground procedure, report writing, fire prevention, special services, control and procedure.</P>
    <P>One course for Station Officers: to be at more advanced level than that of sub-officers with emphasis on fire prevention.</P>
    <P>Let us consider how those recommendations made in 1975 compare with what is happening in Dublin.  The course of induction for new personnel entering the service takes place certainly.  The report recommends four one-week refresher courses for all full-time firemen.  Those courses are not carried out in Dublin.  It recommends a course for existing sub-officers on appointment to include leadership, station routine, report writing and so on.  That course is not carried out in Dublin.  It recommends a course for station officers with emphasis on fire prevention. That course is not carried out in Dublin.  It recommends training and specialist courses which would also be necessary for existing personnel within the fire services.  That course to some extent has been carried out in Dublin and the Minister may be aware of it to some degree because I have referred to it in the House previously.  Because of pressure from various quarters a number of <Col N="2109" /> personnel in the Dublin fire brigade service were sent away to train as instructors in the use of breathing apparatus.  Since they returned they have not trained or instructed any of the other Dublin fire brigade personnel in the use of breathing apparatus.  Some time ago I asked the Minister here in the House about that matter in relation to the training of the firemen in what are known as the retained stations, the part-time fire stations in Balbriggan, Skerries, Swords and Malahide which have not for a considerable number of years had the use of breathing apparatus on their fire tenders because they have not been trained in the use of breathing apparatus.  The Minister made out that this was because of a dispute between Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.  I asked the Minister why existing full-time personnel within the Dublin fire brigade service were not trained in the use of breathing apparathus. He chose not to reply.  Apparently within the Dublin fire brigade service now the only personnel who have full training in the use of breathing apparatus and in breathing apparatus procedures at fires are the men who went to Britain to be trained in the use of that apparatus as instructors.  It seems there is no training of the other men in the use of the breathing apparatus, and consequently there is no procedure laid down for using breathing apparatus at major fires.</P>
    <P>Let us take the example of a major fire in an area of public resort where it is necessary to send large numbers of fire brigade personnel on a recurring basis into an inferno where those personnel are using breathing apparatus and where it is necessary to keep track of them to realise for what length of time they will be able to operate properly using this apparatus and take into account what the hazards in relation to noxious or dangerous fumes are likely to be.  There is nobody who has the qualifications or the training in the control of breathing apparatus procedures at major fires operating in the Dublin fire brigade service.  I may be wrong, but I would assume that if there is nobody within the Dublin area, there hardly is in counties like Laois and Offaly.  Perhaps I am doing a disservice <Col N="2110" /> to those two counties.  I would merely say that I would assume that if that training and expertise is not in Dublin it is less likely to be in other services.  In the part-time services, the retaining stations in North County Dublin, there is no breathing apparatus whatsoever because the men have not been trained in the use of it.  In that regard &mdash; and this is something that is regrettable and I hope that I will be proved wrong &mdash; unless firemen are adequately and comprehensively trained in the use of breathing apparatus and in the use of all the backup facilities needed in the fighting of modern fires, especially in view of the degree and the prevalence of dangerous fumes given off by fires such as this, there are going to be deaths in fires and those deaths will be within the fire service.  We were talking generally about providing a comprehensive modern service to prevent fire and to save life in the event of fire, lives of members of the general public.  I am now talking at as basic a level as saving the lives of men operating within the fire service which I believe are at risk at present. I am advised by personnel within the fire service that lives are at risk at present because of the absence of that training in the use of this specialised equipment.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House any further.  I would merely refer the Minister to the evasive replies which he gave on 19 March in relation to the use of breathing apparatus and the rather Pontius Pilate-like attitude which he adopted by saying that it was not really anything to do with his Department.  If the matter of breathing apparatus is not a matter for the Minister's Department, I can only ask him why he has to tell the House now that in April this year detailed guidelines on the use of breathing apparatus were issued to local authorities.  There is a responsibility on the Department in this regard and the Department have not acted up to their responsibilities very well.  Endeavouring to head off the criticism by saying that there is some imaginary dispute between the county council and the corporation &mdash; of course there is not &mdash; in relation to whether or not part-time firemen should use breathing apparatus is doing less than justice to the <Col N="2111" /> firemen in the retaining stations, and it is certainly doing less than justice to the firemen in the full-time service, very many of whom have no training either in the use of breathing apparatus.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that within the Bill the Minister has referred to the provisions which will allow for the setting up of a fire training standards council.  But from the point of view of reassuring the personnel in the service to so great a degree, the Minister might have dealt with the type of courses which he would envisage being provided for fire personnel in the country.  I would have thought that at an administrative level, if not at a technical level, the Institute of Public Administration ought to have been involved in the provision of courses such as this as well as, perhaps, the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards in relation to advice in connection with certain dangerous chemicals and the like.  Again, from the point of view of the personnel within the service, the Minister could with merit deal, in the course of his reply, with the type of courses which he envisages might be provided for men.</P>
    <P>The report of 1975 also dealt with the question of communications.  It is stated on page 80 that as with any emergency service, efficiency in the fire service depends largely on good communications and this applies both to the link between the public and the service, the inter-service links, and to the entire communications within the service.  It goes on to say that in many rural areas telephones are still non-automatic.  Out of charity to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs I will not refer any more to that.  The report goes on to deal with the number of subscribers connected to manual exchanges. Let us compare the situation in 1975, when the working party report saw fit to deal in some detail with the failures of the telephone service and what was necessary to set up a good communications system, with the situation that obtains today in the control room of Tara Street station, the main nerve centre for the fire brigade service in the Dublin region and the main centre in which the major accident plan for Dublin first comes into <Col N="2112" /> operation.  The simple fact is that, in relation to the operation of that control room in Tara Street, the union representing officers and men has, twice over the last couple of years, informed the Dublin City and County Manager that they will not be responsible for any deaths or mistakes that occur in relation to fire occurrences or major accidents arising out of malfunctions in that control room because of its inadequacy. Improvements in the control room the nerve centre of the Dublin fire services in Tara Street, which have been promised for the last two years have not taken place.  In this age of high technological advance, in this era when virtually not a day goes by without some further announcement about improved methods of communications, in this era of the microchip, a senior sub-officer in Tara Street could tell me, in the last month that when he went on duty as a sub-officer in charge of the control room in Tara Street, his single link with the outside world was a telephone, and his single method of utilising that telephone was a Dublin telephone directory with more than half of its pages missing.</P>
    <P>The control room in the Tara Street station which is responsible for the operation of the fire services in the capital city and the Dublin sub-region, has no register whatsoever or no indication of where dangerous chemicals or noxious chemicals are stored, or where hazards of that nature are likely to be encountered in the event of a fire.  That control room, to bring it home to those in this Chamber, is the nerve centre responsible for fighting fires throughout Dublin, including fires in this House.  If a major conflagration broke out in this House, that control room would be responsible for fighting it.  That is the level of its communication or contact with the outside world.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, within weeks of the Stardust tragedy, for the second if not the third time, the men operating that control room notified the Dublin City Manager that they were disclaiming any part or responsibility in the event of any disaster occurring and the control room being <Col N="2113" /> found to be at fault.  The Minister hardly needs to be reminded, for instance, that the fire tender in the retained station in Skerries which falls within the responsibility, again, of the Dublin fire brigade services in the Dublin sub-region and is in an area which he and I personally know well, last year itself went on fire on its way to a call.  Contrast that at operational level with the standard obtainable in the nerve centre at Tara Street, with the lack of fire prevention education measures, the lack of properly qualified personnel as fire prevention officers and one sees the real state of the fire services today. There is no point in endeavouring to present the picture any differently.</P>
    <P>It does not redound at all to the credit of anyone to compare the amount of capital moneys which &ldquo;my Government&rdquo; spent as opposed to the amount of current expenditure of &ldquo;your Government&rdquo;. Simply, the fire service is in a pretty deplorable state, into which it has been allowed to fall by reason of attitudes adopted by the Department over a prolonged period of time.  It has not been allowed to evolve into a modern service because of the absence of modern comprehensive legislation.  It has not been developed to its full potential.  For instance, the chief fire adviser to the Minister had eventually to go to the High Court to have his voice heard, even within the corridors of the Custom House.  That is the situation and there is no point in our trying to present it as being otherwise.</P>
    <P>I have tabled parliamentary questions which will elicit the information requested, but it would be interesting, to say the least &mdash; and I rather fear that it might be frightening in certain instances &mdash; to investigate how often, how regularly and how recently fire drills took place in our major hospitals, institutions, schools, other public buildings generally and within the Government Departments. When was there last a full-scale fire drill in this House?  The simple fact of the matter is &mdash; and we are going to have our attention drawn very forcibly to this area in the coming months &mdash; as I said earlier, the use to such a high degree of chemicals in the manufacture of modern <Col N="2114" /> furniture and fittings has changed entirely the methods necessary for fire fighting and the expertise needed for fire prevention advice.  This country has not adequately comprehended the way in which the fitting out of buildings, whether public or private, has changed in the last number of years.  Apart from the hazards of death through fire itself, the risk of death through poisoning by inhalation of noxious fumes is apparently a very high and very serious risk indeed and a major contributor to death in certain instances. In the light of that sort of situation, we must rethink our entire attitude towards the fire service.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister refer in greater detail to a number of items on which he touched in the course of his speech?  He mentioned that the draft building regulations, with amendments, had been published and that he had asked the local authorities to implement them as if they had the force of law and that he intended to give that force of law shortly.  Would the Minister explain to the House how shortly is shortly?  I hope he will not tell us it is in the immediate or near future but that he will give a more specific date. Since 1976, when the draft building regulations were published, in those areas where there were not already building by-law regulations in operation, the local and planning authorities did operate the draft building regulations as if they had the force of law.  That was happening every day of the week and it did not require a telegram, or letter, or message by pigeon post from the Minister of the Environment to tell the local authorities to do what they were already doing.  As we all know, anybody who wants to tell the local authorities that they have not the power to implement those regulations and that those regulations have not the force of law may do so.  Until the Minister responsible, who happens to be this Minister, gives the draft building regulations the necessary change, titling them the National Building Regulations, anyone who does not want to observe these regulations need not do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister might, with merit, explain to the House, especially in relation to the qualifications for personnel <Col N="2115" /> within the fire services, whether or not he and his Department have finally resolved the conflict in this area.  The report of 1975 recommended, at paragraph 8.10.1, page 69, under the heading of &ldquo;Promotion and Training&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>We support the McKinsey recommendation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that was a recommendation made, I think, in 1972.  Certainly it was the best part of ten years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;that opportunity should be created for promotion to Chief Fire Officer within the service.  Enhanced promotion possibilities are likely to bring improvement in morale and application in the lower ranks, as well as enhancing the prospects of attracting to the service a greater quantity of high quality recruits with an interest in the service as a career.  It will also help to ensure that future heads of the service will come to office with a full range of prior experience and highly developed skills in both operational and prevention work.</P>
    <P>When that was written and when McKinsey made their report a chief fire officer had to have an engineering degree in the same way as a fire prevention officer had to have an engineering degree.  He did not need any other qualifications and did not need to have been an operational officer within the fire service.  He did not need to have any practical experience of fire-fighting.  That was the situation when that paragraph was written.  It is still the situation today.  The Minister might decide to use, as his explanation or apology, the fact that this was the majority report and that two of the 15 members appointed to the working party did not sign the report.  However, the two who did not sign it were the two members representing the Chief Fire Officers' Association and, in fairness to them, this was possibly understandable.</P>
    <P>We have a fire service today in which the personnel fighting fires on the ground can only rise to a certain grade and cannot rise to the senior grade of chief fire officer or second officer.  The only personnel <Col N="2116" /> who can be recruited to those grades are, one can venture to say with a fair level of confidence and certainty, personnel with no operational experience.  It is highly unlikely that any young engineering graduate would leave university and apply for a job as a fireman in any of the national fire services.  Until they do so there will not be officers of senior grade with practical experience except for those officers who gain that experience subsequent to their appointment.  Therefore, the recommendation in the 1975 report and which is not dealt with in the Minister's speech &mdash; it is skirted away from in the Bill to some extent also &mdash; will have to be dealt with too.  We will have to face up to the question of what is to be the promotional structure of the fire service for the future.</P>
    <P>Regarding the penalty provisions in section 5, the Minister said that in some quarters these proposed penalties might be regarded as Draconian.  That was not the word he used but it seemed to be what he was suggesting.  I do not think that these penalties are at all Draconian. They are set at the levels at which they should be set and at these levels they should be a deterrent in terms of the violation of the provisions of this Bill. However, it is wrong to set monetary sums in legislation, whether these sums refer to grants or to anything else.  More than 40 years have elapsed since the predecessor of this Bill was discussed here. None of us is ready to admit to sin and we may expect the Minister to assure the House that another 40 years will not elapse before today's legislation is updated.  We all know that big bodies move slowly and that the updating of legislation is not nearly as efficient as it should be.  When we write a figure into legislation in respect of a penalty or of a grant we are ensuring to a fair degree that that legislation will become obsolete within a relatively short number of years even if inflation is to continue at even half its present level.  Consequently fines ought not to be specified in legislation. They should be set by way of regulation. Whether such regulations should come before the House for ratification would be a matter for debate, but in any case <Col N="2117" /> we should exclude figures in the context of penalties when we are passing legislation.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that I should like to draw attention to relates to an omission from the Bill.  There ought to have been included also in section 5 a provision for a daily recurring fine so that anybody found to be in flagrant violation of some of the provisions of this legislation would be aware that he would be subject not only to a once-off fine but to repeated fines either at the same level or at different levels in respect of every day during which the danger in question to the general public in terms of fire danger was continuing.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the Dublin major accident plan, the central control room in this report is at Tara Street Fire Station. As I have said, that is the first place that is contacted in the event of this plan being put into operation.  It is not my intention to go into detail of the operation of the plan or to discuss the question of whether it is necessary to update it in certain respects.  The responsibility of the Minister for the Environment in this context involves only a limited area, but in so far as he is involved I suggest strongly that there be regular full-scale exercises of the Dublin major accident plan so that all of the component personnel who have a part to play within that plan would be fully aware of their role and that all of the staffs who operate on a shift-working basis would be involved in these regular exercises.  In this way staff on duty at any time would be aware of what would be involved.</P>
    <P>With merit and with benefit the Government Departments involved might examine again at this point the operation of this plan in the light of the information that is available to them following its operation in February of this year.</P>
    <P>In so far as this Bill gives belated effect to the recommendations in the 1975 report, I welcome it.  It meets very many of the objectives of the working party as put forward by them in 1975.  The main area of regret is that it has taken so long for the Bill to reach this House.</P>
    <P>My remarks, especially in relation to <Col N="2118" /> fire prevention measures and to the training of the personnel within the fire service, are remarks that I have thought about very deeply.  I am most anxious that they be given serious and urgent consideration.  The area of fire prevention is the most important area needing attention now.  There is also a very urgent need to deal with developments in the production of chemical fuel by-products in fire fighting.  Since the comprehensive training that is necessary to enable the personnel concerned to deal with these changes cannot be dealt with in detail in the Bill, all those who have an interest in the development of the fire service, including those who work within it, would appreciate the Minister dealing with his proposals in this area when replying to this Second Stage debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of any Bill which proposes to improve the position in respect of fire fighting.  I had hoped that this Bill would have been debated on a totally non-political basis because I have always been of the opinion that excellent legislation can be discussed and put into operation provided that the goodwill of everybody concerned is brought to bear on the proposals in question. However, I must fault the Minister on his introduction of a note of acrimony. He began by talking about the amount of money that this Government have spent in the area of fire fighting compared with what was spent by us while in Government. Since I was the person responsible for this area at that time, I might point out to the Minister something which he is well aware of, that is, that if we take present-day money values and compare them with the values of the days when we were in office, he would be just as well not to go too deeply into that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is very necessary.  My predecessor set up the committee that investigated the whole position of fire fighting. That was in 1972 and the report was presented in 1975.  If I had been in office for another few years this legislation would, I hope, have been enacted.  I am not blaming the Minister for the delay. He has been in charge of the Department for only a relatively short time but his <Col N="2119" /> predecessor should have done something about the legislation.  There is no point in saying that the matter was one for the officials of the Department.  I am sure that the officials worked very hard on this legislation; but it is for the Minister, as political head of the Department, to ensure that the legislation is produced.  It is not any answer to say that the legislation was not ready.  The Minister should know why it was not ready.  He should insist that legislation is ready when necessary.</P>
    <P>I would not go all the way with Deputy Boland on the question of who might have been saved had this Bill been introduced earlier.  Possibly a lot of lives could have been saved.  Nobody knows that and there is no use in saying that it would have saved lives.  We do not know what the effect will be.  All I hope is that in the years to come it will save a lot of lives.</P>
    <P>I believe this is an ideal Committee Stage Bill, a Bill in which the improvements which should be introduced, can be argued on the floor of this House on Committee Stage.  The Minister should take note of the discussion, as I know he is doing, on Second Stage.  Before Committee Stage is reached he should be ready with amendments which will improve the Bill and say whether or not he considers he can introduce such amendments.  That is the way in which legislation can be improved.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a proposal about the fire services.  While Deputy Boland dealt with them on a fairly wide scale, he tended to deal with what he knew best, which perhaps was the right thing to do, the Dublin county and city area.  I have a knowledge of the fire services from two angles, one because, as a trade union official, for many years I represented fire services at discussion after discussion.  I grant that in the main these discussions were in regard to working conditions and wages.  We discussed things that were not happening, things that should have happened and from which I gained an experience of fire fighting which proved very useful to me at a later stage.  In the Custom House I firmly believed, and still believe, that promotion from the ranks <Col N="2120" /> to the top position in the service is something which should be open to everybody who can make the climb.  I entirely agree that having a few academic degrees does not constitute any proof that the person in charge knows more about fire fighting; in fact, the contrary is the case.  I believe that the person who has had to work his way up from the bottom, who knows what he is doing and how it should be done, eventually will prove to be a better fire officer than somebody who, because he happens to be an engineer with knowledge of something entirely different, is put in charge of a fire service.</P>
    <P>I think it is wrong also that, for any reason vacancies should occur at that level or at second level.  Because of disputes between the Department, the local authorities, the fire officers and the service vacancies have occurred over the years, when the second fire officer has been carrying out the duties of the chief fire officer over a lengthy period.  There should be an instant way of solving such problems.  Fire prevention is much too serious to be left in abeyance for a long period while somebody discusses whether or not decisions should be taken in favour of the fire officers or the employers' representatives.  It appears to be the second fire officers who more than anybody else suffer as a result of this, that their grievances are not settled within a reasonable period.  They seem unable to bring their grievances to a head.  It is quite true that for a number of years second fire officers worked day shifts and did not work at night.  Can anybody think of anything more ridiculous than having people, dealing with a service required mainly at night, not on call at night because they were in dispute over a few shillings.  The situation was too ridiculous for words.  There must be a strict arrangement whereby such disputes can be settled, not in six months or 12 months, but within a relatively short time.</P>
    <P>There has been mention here of the chief fire officer in the Custom House.  I believe that if it is his duty to advise the Department then he should do so.  If the Minister wants advice he should be in a position to seek that advice from the chief <Col N="2121" /> fire officer.  Just as in the case of every other official who gives him advice, there is no necessity for the Minister to act on that advice.  But, when advice is given which after mature consideration is considered to be correct, then it should be acted on.  If the chief fire officer cannot do that, what is the point?  Why have somebody &mdash; somebody paid a sizeable amount of money &mdash; not allowed to advise on what he has been appointed to advise on?  When there is a difference of opinion between senior officials in any Department, that is a matter the Minister must straighten out.  He must decide that he needs the advice of these people.  He must insist that he receives an unbiased report on all such matters.  My experience of officials from top to bottom, particularly during my time in the Department of Local Government, was that they were excellent people, prepared at all times to go out of their way to ensure that correct advice was given.  However, from time to time there may be a difference of opinion between people at that level.  I do not believe that should effect the running of the country but that is exactly what it does if allowed to continue.  It is the job of the political head of the Department to ensure that it does not continue.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the type of fire prevention equipment people buy. Breathing apparatus is very important. There should and must be more training in the use of breathing apparatus.  I was rather amused at Deputy Boland's story about the fire engine going on fire; at least they had not to call the brigade and should have been able to put it out fairly quickly.  I am aware of places throughout the country where until fairly recently some of the fire prevention service officers travelled by bicycle, one man with a bucket, another with a hose and yet another with a pump.  Imagine that in the eighties, but it still exists in some areas where there is a very small brigade. There are those people who would contend: what use are they?  Why should they be there at all if they are that bad?  The reason for their existence is that the nearest fire service which could deal adequately with a blaze is so far away there has to be some local service to ensure <Col N="2122" /> that a fire does not get out of hand.  As far as I know, there is only one of them left now.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of where fire engines are bought.  We are told they are bought abroad and are so expensive we cannot afford them.  In County Meath there was a factory built to make the Timoney tank, a tank that was to be sold all over the world.  Some years ago our Army were talking about buying 50 or 60 of them, when there would be a great boom in the industry there.  I was speaking yesterday to the gentleman who owns that firm and I was glad to hear from him that their activities now are devoted mainly to building fire engines.  Might I suggest to the Minister that he should be able to buy fire engines &mdash; Déanta in Éirinn &mdash; at a reasonable cost, made in County Meath.  I pass this information on to the Minister for what it is worth.  It would be an excellent idea.  The building of such fire engines would be more useful to our economy than the building of tanks.</P>
    <P>There has been quite a lot of talk about whether or not the fire regulations are being implemented.  I do not believe they are.  I know there was a great flurry of talk at the time of the Stardust tragedy. But I am aware that people tend to become lax in this respect and this House is one example of it.  At one time I was in a room in the corridor down by the bar. At that time new arrangements had been made about fire fighting.  There an arrow pointing to the door entering the room which said &ldquo;Exit&rdquo;.  There was an arrow inside the door pointing to the window which said &ldquo;Exit&rdquo;.  It was pointed out to us that this was the fire escape in case the rest of the House, the ordinary doors, were cut off.  There were bars on that window and it could not be opened from the inside.  It could not be opened anyway; even if the window was open, it was impossible for anybody to get out.  That happened in this House many years ago. Since then they have made the window easier to open and they have cut the bars and put a hinge on them so that people will find it easier to get out if the need arises.</P>
    <P>There are a number of fire traps.  While <Col N="2123" /> we were very anxious to ensure that something was done when the Stardust disaster occurred, we are forgetting it now.  This House, the Custom House, O'Connell Bridge House and most of the offices in the city are fire traps from which people could not escape in the event of a serious fire occurring.  Schools and hospitals are also badly designed and many old folk would never get out of some of the hospitals alive if a fire occurred.  In a country district where I was a member of the health board I had a hospital closed. It has since been reopened but the top floor to which I objected is no longer used.  The access to the top floor was up a narrow wooden staircase and the only fire escape was by way of a slide down to the lower floor or by a sort of swing chair where people would be swung out over the yard and swung two floors down to the ground.  That was years ago, but some hospitals are still as bad as that.  It is appalling that we should keep old people or ill people in such places.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not go far enough to ensure that these matters are attended to.  Deputy Boland referred to a continuing fine, but that is not much use in punishing a well-to-do business person. Prison terms are the only answer for those who deliberately break the law. The Bill does not lay down in strong enough terms the regulations which will bind the authorities giving permission to use buildings for various types of entertainment. The inspection of places of entertainment should not be carried out at 10 o'clock in the morning but they should be carried out when the building is full of people.  The examinations up to the present were carried out when places were empty and nobody ever knew whether the doors were kept closed or were opened or whether they could be opened in the event of an emergency.  I understand that there has been a change in the procedure now, but it should be written into the Bill.  It should be mandatory if over a certain number of people are in a building to have somebody on the doors at all times until the last patron leaves.  If that had happened in the past many tragedies would not have occurred. <Col N="2124" /> There should be a secondary lighting system; there should be the right type of panic bolt on the door, and there should be a certain number of doors.  All these things should be laid down in the Bill. These things are laid down in the draft building regulations about which we were talking earlier, but they should be in this Bill so that nobody can claim ignorance of their existence.</P>
    <P>There should be an adequate supply of water to a building before permission is granted to allow people to congregate there in large numbers.  There is no point in sending out a fire brigade if the water is not available.</P>
    <P>During Question Time we had a &ldquo;spat&rdquo; about where itinerants live, but the miracle is that more of them have not been burned in the flimsy dwellings in which they live.  How can we tie this sort of thing into a legal phraseology which would ensure that the risk is at least minimised if not entirely removed?  We should also have a regulation to insist on a fire extinguisher in all motor vehicles. In one motor accident a man was burned to death because the fire was not put out and a simple fire extinguisher could have dealt with the matter adequately.</P>
    <P>I have always held and when in Government I suggested that insurance companies are the main beneficiaries when it comes to the question of saving life or property and they should pay a substantial amount towards the maintenance and use of fire brigades.  If a fireplace goes on fire the fire brigade puts it out and the insurance company may save a half a million pounds or more.  However, they are not prepared to pay a shilling towards the upkeep of fire brigades.  If possible this should be written into this Bill.  It would ensure that they paid their share.</P>
    <P>In earlier days part-time brigades consisting of one full-time worker and quite a number of part-time recruits operated throughout the country.  Most of these recruits lived near the fire brigade station and it was hoped that most of them would turn out in the event of a fire.  These people were paid a relatively small sum of money for doing a certain number of practices during the week.  In some places now fire brigade staffs have been overworked <Col N="2125" /> because it has become common practice to call out the fire brigade for a road accident.  Most of the time there is no necessity for the fire brigade.  It is not the function of the fire brigade to go to a road accident unless somebody has to be cut out.  It is not fair to the fire brigade and it is unfair to the people concerned. I understand that it is now the practice under present regulations to collect from the people who call out the brigade.</P>
    <P>When a storm occurs and trees fall down over the road instead of the local authority employees going out with saws to cut them away people send for the fire brigade.  I do not believe it is the function of the fire brigade to do this work.  Great inconvenience is caused to people who are in private employment rather than in local authority employment when they are called out to bog fires.  There may be many of those during the summer.  Those people could be employed a long time trying to put out those fires which often go underground and come up again 30 or 40 yards away.  They have to follow the fire around until eventually it is put out. The onus should be put on the owners of property to do a lot more about putting out those fires instead of asking the fire brigade to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider having more full-time fire brigades.  The cost of running part-time brigades can be very high.  The people employed as part-time firemen run the risk of being unsatisfactory employees in other jobs.  They often have to work with the local fire brigade during the night and have to turn up for work the next day.  I do not know what the cost of this would be now.  In view of the amount of money to be paid out, it might be a good idea to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Special attention should be given to bingo halls.  A number of young people were in the Stardust when the fire occurred and they should have been able to get out with a little co-operation.  We find mainly elderly people in bingo halls. Many of them have been brought in cars and have been put sitting down as close as possible together.  I do not believe fire precautions are satisfactory in some of those bingo halls.  We should ensure that <Col N="2126" /> those people can get out safely in the case of a fire.  I heard recently of a fairly new place of entertainment where the doors open inwards.  Possibly this happens in a great many places.  The people who are responsible for seeing that fire precautions are properly carried out should pay particular attention to places like this. They usually take it for granted that there are proper fire precautions.</P>
    <P>We talk about referring to the fire officer in the Custom House.  When I was a member of Meath County Council I was angry when he closed a number of halls because they could not provide panic bolts and secondary lighting.  I realised some time afterwards that he was perfectly right and that those places were death traps.  I felt at the time that he was very severe on small committees who could not afford to buy the necessary equipment for those halls.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that the fire officers should come up from the ranks but I appreciate that the Fire Officers' Association publicly stated less than a year ago that they felt we were heading for a major fire disaster.  We thought it was scare talk.  While I welcome the introduction of the Bill and feel it is intended to remedy many of the defects in the present legislation nevertheless a lot more can be done only with the assistance of expert advice.</P>
    <P>When we talk about fire fighting, people living around the cities and the towns think of the fire brigade.  They think of the people who always answer the calls, who are on call and within a reasonable distance.  When one talks about the city fire plan or the county fire plan, what about the hall in the heart of the country, the school, the hospital or some old house, like the house in County Clare during the week, where fire brigades are a long distance away?  If something goes wrong when the fire starts it is a long time before the fire service can be made available.</P>
    <P>A great effort should be made to encourage people to provide some type of fire fighting equipment.  It is quite possible that a fire which starts in a small way in a country house, where many people still use open fires, can burn people <Col N="2127" /> to death or they can be suffocated.  There are approximately 600 houses in the area where I live, where formerly there used only be 50 houses, and we have a cover from the Drogheda brigade.  There are two fire engines in the Drogheda station but if one of them is out in County Louth the second one is not supposed to leave the town of Drogheda because it is fairly big.  There used be a small fire station in Laytown and a number of other villages in the area.  An effort should be made to try to cover the small areas with some fire fighting equipment.  If a fire occurs in such an area at the moment in a very short time if the brigade are available they will be there.  As we saw recently, it does not take long for a fire to do a great amount of damage.</P>
    <P>The Bill puts into operation many of the recommendations of the 1975 working party but it still leaves too many loopholes. There are many things which should be dealt with.  I hope that when we have Committee Stage we will be able to tease out a number of those things and possibly arrange to have included matters which people on this side of the House feel should have been included.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies are co-operating to a certain extent with advisory services. I have always felt that since they are the people who save most money when a fire is prevented or put out they should contribute a lot more than they do to the prevention of fires.  This could be done without increasing premiums.  If it were done properly it could result in a reduction in premiums because the fewer fires there are the more the insurance companies are likely to make.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill because in my view an up-to-date Bill had to be introduced and I am glad it has been introduced now. Section 37 covers almost all the matters raised in the debate last March.  No matter why it was introduced, this is a very worthy effort and I hope it will be possible to have this Bill law before the Twenty-First Dáil breaks up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and the speed with which it was brought before the House.  It is easy for the <Col N="2128" /> Opposition to criticise the Minister for the delay in introducing this Bill, but I do not recall any questions over the last four years asking about this Bill or when it was coming before the House.  It is easy to be wise after the event.</P>
      <P>This Bill was almost ready when we had that unfortunate disaster.  I would like the Minister to draft a section where the chief fire officer, if he found a building was positively dangerous, did not have to wait for the District Court order but could close the building down and then go to the District Court for the order. Perhaps the Minister would tell me if this is done in certain parts of the world.</P>
      <P>In America if hygiene is below a certain standard a health officer can close the premises and when the necessary work has been carried out the management must then apply to re-open.  The same type of thing should apply here where fire is concerned because we are not fully conscious of the dangers of fire.  In 1966 I went to America and visited hospitals which dealt with severely burned cases. I saw young children who had been maimed in domestic fires.  They had to undergo many painful operations over a period of years.  Some of those children were lucky and died, but those who lived had to endure tremendous pain.  We will never realise the dangers of fire until we see such scenes.</P>
      <P>Firms should show their staff how to operate fire extinguishers.  Most firms have fire extinguishers but how many staff members know how to use them? They should be told when to use a carbon dioxide extinguisher or a water extinguisher. There should be more fire awareness in these companies.  In many cases fire extinguishers are not regularly examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force should be instructed to carry out a survey to find out how fire-conscious firms are.  I once worked for Marks and Spencers, a very fire-conscious firm.  I remember when a fire officer from head office came to me and said &ldquo;Do not look round and tell me where the nearest fire extinguisher is&rdquo;.  That was the type of training every staff member got.  Each week a different staff member was on duty as fire officer.  He had to go <Col N="2129" /> around the store looking for fire risks, making sure there were no cigarette butts lying around and so on.  That kind of exercise makes people very fire-conscious. Even after this horrible disaster we are not fully conscious of the dangers and horror of fire.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for introducing this Bill but I once again would ask him to see if it would be possible to empower the chief fire officer to close a dangerous building in advance of getting the District Court order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the three speakers who contributed to this debate and who welcomed this Bill.  I agree with Deputy Tully that this is very complex and long legislation and I look forward to a thorough debate on all sections on Committee Stage.  I want to reassure him that I will be prepared to consider any constructive suggestions which will improve the provisions of this Bill.  Between now and Committee Stage I will take into account many points raised by Deputies today.  If, in the light of examination of those suggestions, there is need for amendments, I will be willing to accept them.</P>
      <P>Many points raised in the debate &mdash; improvement of training, fire prevention, emergency lighting, and so on &mdash; are already covered in the Bill and will be dealt with more fully on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Briscoe's horror of the injury that can be caused by fire.  We have re-introduced provisions in the 1940 Act which cover fire notices, the period of appeal to the District Court and so on, but much more important is the provision he is looking for, and which received general acceptance by the media and the public, the power to go to the High Court to get immediate closure in certain circumstances. This is the key section of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully asked about our capacity to produce fire fighting equipment, including engines, at home. I am glad the capacity is there and my intention is that the production ability available in Ireland will be taken into consideration <Col N="2130" /> when we are designing and specifying equipment for fire tenders.  It is also the intention that the 50 per cent subsidy on loan charges introduced to help to equip and maintain fire services will encourage local authorities to improve their equipment and there is hope here for the provision of new jobs.</P>
    <P>Deputies Boland and Tully spoke about penalties, fines and prison sentences. The sections in the Bill on this matter are rigid and strong enough.  We can look into this matter thoroughly during Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I join the two Deputies in praising the work of the fire services throughout the country, full and part-time.  This Bill is designed to assist them in their work.  The Bill provides for evolution to assist in building up a modern fire service.  I have no doubt that the section in regard to training and the provision to set up a training council will assist fire personnel throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland asked about building regulations.  Up to last March the building regulations being operated were unamended.  It was necessary to make 600 amendments to the regulations and the position is that the regulations being operated by the local authorities are fully amended.  Deputy Boland, as a member and former chairman of Dublin County Council will be aware of this.  The Deputy made a good suggestion in regard to the register that will be available of inspections of premises.  There are provisions in relation to recommendations, the numbers of visits and the times of the visits. I will go more deeply into this on Committee Stage.  Deputy Boland also spoke about marquees and so forth.  They are covered in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The funding of the proposed Fire Prevention Council and the task force were referred to by Deputy Boland.  I assure him that the task force are operating now. There is a programme of seminars, conferences and so forth at various centres for managers and proprietors of discos, dancehalls, publichouses, hotels and other places of public entertainment.  I opened the first of them on 22 April.  It is also intended that there will be radio, television, press and cinema campaigns <Col N="2131" /> with the object of educating the public in regard to the exercise of diligence and awareness when attending places of public entertainment.  That campaign will be commenced shortly.  The preparation of leaflets and posters for proprietors and managers of discos, dancehalls, night clubs and function rooms in hotels giving guidance on fire safety procedures is in hand.  Some of them have already been produced.</P>
    <P>Conscious of the need for this type of education, particularly after the terrible tragedy, the Government have allocated £125,000 to the task force.  Many of the points made by Deputy Boland were not relevant to the Bill but more to the internal operations of fire services in local authorities.  He mentioned Dublin County Council and I would remind him that the 50 per cent subsidy on loan charges which I have introduced will be an incentive to the local authority to being their equipment up to date.</P>
    <P>I would refer the Deputy to the magnificent response of the control room in Tara Street on the night of the Stardust disaster.  If that control room needs new equipment the grants are there for them and I would encourage Dublin Corporation, the body responsible, to get on with the work.  The Deputy suggested a review of the general accident plan.  On every occasion when the accident plan was put into operation, no matter which part of the country it involved, the whole working of the plan was reviewed, and any desirable alterations or improvements were made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland made great play of the availability of breathing apparatus, particularly in Dublin city and county.  There are seven breathing apparatus instructors in the Dublin Fire Brigade, all of them full-time firemen.  I personally took up with Dublin Corporation the need for an adequate training programme and the corporation have made arrangements to train fire service personnel in the use of breathing apparatus at Castlebridge training centre in County Wexford pending the provision by the corporation of their own training centre.  I cannot see <Col N="2132" /> any reason why the part-time men should not also have this facility.</P>
    <P>Many of the other points made by the Deputies are more relevant to the detailed debate in Committee.  Once again I want to express my sense of pleasure at having had the opportunity to introduce this major piece of legislation, the first substantial review of the operations of the fire services since 1940.  It is unfortunate that it has taken that length of time by different administrations.  The Bill has been recognised as a comprehensive review which sets down the path of future fire service personnel.  The major industrial and other changes that have occurred are recognised, with emphasis on training in fire prevention.  We will be able to deal in detail with the other points made when we discuss the Bill in Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to improve the law relating to littering and, in particular, to strengthen the hand of local authorities in dealing with litter offences by means which include a fine-on-the-spot system and stiffer penalties.  The Bill also introduces new provisions relating to abandoned vehicles and unsightly accumulations of disused vehicles and other disused articles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure it will be agreed that these are areas in which we badly need to improve standards in the interest of the <Col N="2133" /> environment and the enjoyment of outdoor life.</P>
    <P>The Environment Council, in a report on Litter and the Environment which has been published, described the situation as a national scandal, affecting tourist and development prospects and giving us a bad name abroad.  To change the position, as it must be changed, calls for a radical turnabout in public attitudes.  It would be consoling to think that litter conditions are the work of a few, or even of a minority.  The conditions which confront us all can only come about from widespread carelessness and indifference. Many blame the young, but even casual observation will show that many adults are blameworthy.  The Environment Council in its report has recommended that a strengthening of the law should be considered.  This seems to me to be an obvious and immediate need and the Bill is designed to meet it.</P>
    <P>I hope that this Bill will be non-controversial and that the general principles will get general support from all sides in the House.  It is a fairly radical approach to a particularly objectionable problem that reflects badly on us all, and on the country. The Bill contains no magic formula but what I am proposing should go a long way to improve the litter position and ensure a cleaner and more enjoyable environment for everyone.  When we come to Committee Stage I will be glad to give full consideration to any positive and worthwhile proposals or amendments which will improve the effectiveness of the Bill and I will make every effort to meet Deputies wishes on this matter.  However, if Deputies are considering putting down amendments I would ask them to bear in mind the limited scope and purpose of the Bill.  The limited scope is intentional.  Work in reviewing the statutory provisions relating to other environmental and nuisance-type matters is under way in my Department and I envisage further legislation in due course.  It would not be appropriate to include in this Litter Bill provisions to deal with problems in those other areas.</P>
    <P>There has been a noticeable worsening in recent years in regard to littering and <Col N="2134" /> there is no reason to suppose that this trend will alter unless firm action is taken to bring about change.  Conditions are especially bad in the urban areas &mdash; the bigger the area the worse the conditions generally.  But littering is not merely an urban problem.  In the countryside too, and everywhere people congregate for entertainment or recreation, litter mars the scene.  Scenic areas, picnic places and beaches are scattered with consumer debris&mdash;paper, plastic, tins, glass and all the rest.  Another serious aspect of the problem is the extent of roadside dumping of rubbish in suburban areas, on the outskirts of towns and even in the countryside.</P>
    <P>In these matters we seem to have neither sense nor sensibility.  We should be able to do better, and we must, in the future.  Nobody gains from littering.  The entire community suffers when the habitat is degraded.  It is bad for the morale of people that they should be constantly confronted by litter and dirt as they go about their daily business.  Neither are such conditions an attractive setting for enterprise and economic advancement. It is not surprising that litter and related conditions are among the most common causes of complaint by tourists and visitors.</P>
    <P>Abandoned cars which disfigure the landscape in many areas are an environmental eyesore as well as a resource loss since scrap-metal can be recycled.  A related problem is that of unsightly accumulations of disused vehicles or other disused articles &mdash; household, agricultural or industrial &mdash; in prominent locations along important roads or in scenic areas.  I am sure that all Deputies can readily call such situations to mind &mdash; sites on which disused cars or other vehicles, abandoned vehicles, old cookers, washing machines and the like; ancient tractors, cranes and other agricultural or industrial plant are kept, under conditions in which they constitute a serious blot on the landscape, or a prominent eyesore.  They may be intended for disposal as scrap or for use as spares.  It is recognised that these are legitimate and important purposes.  But it is reasonable to expect that some account will be taken <Col N="2135" /> of the environmental impacts and some effort made to minimise the adverse implications for the local community as well as for tourists and visitors.  With a little thought and a small amount of effort the worse effects of many of these sites could easily be avoided.  The Bill contains provisions enabling local authorities to deal with these conditions.</P>
    <P>I believe that the litter problem must be tackled at the local level mainly and that the local authorities should be the principal agencies for dealing with it and for encouraging the necessary community interest and support.  In line with this approach there will be a duty on all local authorities under the Bill to take measures for the prevention, reduction and the removal of litter.  Apart from collection and disposal work, the local authorities will be empowered to encourage and assist public participation and to undertake publicity and educational measures of an advisory nature.  These are very positive and very important powers, but it would be quite wrong to regard litter as simply a matter with which local authorities have to deal.  This problem will not be overcome by legislation alone or by local authority action alone.  The problem will be overcome when ordinary people decide that they prefer clean conditions to littered conditions in public places and are prepared to put the required effort into bringing about the necessary changes.  The influence of parents, of schools and of community organisations of all kinds in supporting and complementing the efforts of the statutory bodies, and indeed in pursuing their own initiatives, will be of decisive importance. With this in mind I have recently asked local authorities to promote campaigns of environmental care and improvement, seeking maximum co-operation and involvement from local community interests.  I will also be presenting a new environmental award for the area making the best response to the proposed campaigns.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill local authorities will be empowered to facilitate waste recycling. Recycling from waste is a complex and uncertain business.  It is not directly a <Col N="2136" /> local authority function and local authorities cannot be expected to commit public funds to costly recovery schemes of doubtful viability.  There are, however, areas in which they may be in a position to assist recycling by the private sector in the course of their waste collection and disposal activities.  A number of local authorities are co-operating&mdash;for example, in the operation of deposits at which waste oil may be deposited for recycling. There may be scope, depending on the local circumstances, for assisting in arrangements for the recovery of waste paper, glass or other materials.  All local authorities have been asked to designate locations for the disposal of worn-out vehicles and other scrap metal with a view to its collection for recycling.  Under the Bill there will be an obligation on all local authorities to arrange for the provision of such places, whether alone or in co-operation with one another.</P>
    <P>The littering offence as defined in the Bill is a re-enactment in extended form of the provision in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963. The main additions &mdash; and they are important ones &mdash; are that littering caused in the course of carrying on a trade or in loading, transporting, unloading or otherwise handling or processing any substance, material or thing is now specifically included.  There can be a lot of trouble in pinning down a responsible party where litter is caused by disposal of refuse from a vehicle.  The Bill provides that, where a vehicle is involved, the registered owner or other person having use of it at the time will be guilty of an offence apart from the guilt of anyone else.</P>
    <P>At present the maximum fine applicable on conviction for a littering offence is £10.  The provision has not proved a deterrent.  This is partly because of the impact of inflation on the fine but partly also because of the lenient view which the courts have tended to take of litter offences, as reflected by the imposition in many cases of a nominal penalty.  The frustrating experience of some local authorities under the existing law is reflected in a resolution adopted last year by Dublin Corporation calling for an <Col N="2137" /> increase in the penalty to £1,000.  This may be too high, but certainly the time has come for a more serious view to be taken all round of littering and this should be reflected in the penalty provision and, hopefully, in its application.</P>
    <P>It takes very little effort or cost for the individual to avoid littering; to put litter in a bin, or to take it home, or to a dump. But once litter is dropped, or rubbish discarded, the cost of collection and disposal&mdash;the cost to the public who must pay for it through taxes &mdash; is substantial. The polluter pays principle requires that the person polluting pays the cost of remedying the pollution.  This has to be borne in mind when it comes to considering the appropriate level of penalty for litter offences. The new limit which I am proposing is £500.  This is maximum penalty. A litter offence may range from dropping a wrapper in the street to dumping a lorry load of rubbish in an amenity area.  It will be a matter for the courts to fit the penalty to the offence in a particular case.</P>
    <P>I will stress at this point that we are dealing with littering as distinct from legal disposal of litter-type material.  Provision is made in the Bill to allow for the deposit of materials in suitable receptacles for disposal, as well as deposits in connection with recycling, provided reasonable care is taken to prevent the creation of litter.</P>
    <P>Waste disposal is a separate matter and is now governed by regulations under the European communities Act.  Infringement of the regulations in disposing of waste is an offence with liability to a maximum fine on conviction of £600.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, local authorities will have a duty to take measures to prevent, reduce and remove litter. It is just as important that occupiers should keep free of litter any land to which the public have access, or land where the litter would be seen from public areas.  The Bill provides for this.</P>
    <P>Much litter can occur in the immediate vicinity of business premises.  I think it is reasonable to expect that persons engaged in businesses should keep the footpath and immediate environs of their premises free of litter&mdash;as indeed is done <Col N="2138" /> in shopping centres and by many individual shopkeepers.  This is a problem that may be greater in some areas than others and is one where local knowledge and conditions should be considered.  Under the Bill local authorities will have power to make by-laws requiring occupiers, or specified classes of occupiers, or those in specified areas, to keep the immediate environs, as defined in the Bill, free from litter.  I would hope, indeed, that the business community would go further especially in the case of shops and premises which are a direct source of street litter by providing suitable accommodation for the litter which they generate and by posting signs to encourage people to use the accommodation.  My Department have already written to various trade organisations seeking the co-operation of their members in this matter.</P>
    <P>The prosecution of litter offences through the courts is costly and time consuming for local authorities.  To ease the difficulties and to facilitate more speedy and more effective enforcement, the Bill makes provision for a fine-on-the-spot system.  Under this system an offender may be given a notice by a litter warden employed by the local authority and would have 21 days in which to pay a fine in the local authority office.  The fine initially will be £5 but this may be adjusted by regulation.  If the fine is paid there will be no prosecution .</P>
    <P>It will be a separate offence for a person to obstruct a litter warden or to refuse to give a proper name and address when asked for it.  Such a person will also be liable to arrest without warrant by a member of the Garda Síochána.  These are necessary provisions to ensure the co-operation of suspected offenders with litter wardens.  I would stress that no one will be obliged actually to pay a fine.  If a person who receives a fine-on-the-spot notice would prefer to take his chance in court he may exercise an option in that direction simply by failing to pay the fine wthin the prescribed period.  However, I think that most offenders having caused an offence and being caught in the act will prefer to pay the find rather than go to court.</P>
    <P>Littering, as I have said, is primarily a <Col N="2139" /> local problem and it is right that there should be a degree of local discretion and some room for experimentation as to the most appropriate and effective enforcement procedures to adopt in the local circumstances.  It will, therefore, be left to each local authority to decide whether to apply the fine-on-the-spot system in their area, or whether to deal with offenders by way of court prosecution alone.</P>
    <P>There may be reservations, which I can understand, about an extension in the policing role of local authorities.  There are practical difficulties as well in applying a fine-on-the-spot system to littering which do not arise, for example, with car parking offences.  I have taken full account of these considerations.  I believe the stage has been reached when most people want effective action to be taken to deal with this problem.  I believe that the proposed system can make an important contribution in that direction, that it is a fair and reasonable system and that it will have the support of the general public.</P>
    <P>I turn now to abandoned vehicles.  I have mentioned that local authorities will be obliged to provide place where vehicles and other metal scrap may be abandoned. There will be no excuse in future for abandoning those in unauthorised places.  The Bill makes it an offence to abandon a vehicle on land without the occupier's consent.  Provision is made for the removal of abandoned vehicles from land if the occupier consents or does not object and for their disposal in accordance with specified procedures.  These provisions do not apply to vehicles abandoned on public roads or car parks which can be dealt with under existing road traffic legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision also for dealing with disused vehicles or other disused articles if it is in the interests of amenity or of the environment of an area.  This could arise, for example, because of their unsightly condition or arrangement and their prominence.  Very often the necessary improvement in these situations can be brought about by relocating or rearranging the vehicles or articles or by providing <Col N="2140" /> suitable screening or fencing. Local authorities will be enabled to deal with such conditions by arrangement with the occupier or the person keeping the vehicles or articles and on terms to be agreed.  Alternatively, the local authority may serve notice requiring specified steps to be taken including, if necessary, the removal of the vehicles and other articles. There is provision for a right of appeal against such a notice to the District Court.  The local authority will have power to enforce a notice which is in operation and may recover costs and expenses.  It will be an offence not to act on a notice from a local authority or to obstruct the local authority if they are enforcing a notice.  Procedures are laid down for the recovery by the owner of the vehicles or articles removed and, if they are not reclaimed, for their disposal by the local authority.</P>
    <P>The use of land for the keeping of disused vehicles and the like is, of course, subject to planning permission and it is the job of the planning authority, if permission is being given, to see that any necessary conditions are imposed and are enforced.  It would be inappropriate that such a decision should be capable in effect of being set aside by action under this Bill.  Provision is made to avoid this kind of conflict arising.  In these cases a planning permission if it exists and is being observed will prevail.</P>
    <P>The powers which the Bill will confer on local authorities regarding abandoned vehicles or disused vehicles and other articles will greatly improve their capacity for securing the removal of eyesores and improving the quality of the environment in urban and rural areas.  In all cases where offences occur under the Bill, other than the fine-on-the-spot system, there will be a maximum fine of £500.  I believe that this figure is fully warranted considering the extent of the problem that now exists.</P>
    <P>I have explained the context in which I am putting forward this Bill and the main provisions.  I am well aware that there are other ways in which our environmental legislation needs to be improved and modernised.  I have already mentioned that work in reviewing <Col N="2141" /> these needs and in preparing proposals for further legislation is being stepped up in my Department.  I believe that this Bill, confined as it is to litter and certain related problems, is not alone well worthwhile in its own right but is urgently needed to deal with the problems which are immediate and should be tackled without further delay.  The Bill is in the nature of a first instalment of new environment legislation and I have confidence in commending it to the House in that spirit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>While all of us recognise that litter is a major problem, it is difficult to sound meaningful for 13 pages of a script on the subject and it certainly would be beyond my capacity.  Therefore, I do not propose to equal the length of time the Minister has taken to rearrange the litter of the country for the benefit of the environment.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the main difficulties encountered by local authorities in this matter.  Deputy Tully stated that essentially the previous Bill was a Committee Stage Bill.  I am inclined to agree with him and I think that this Bill would benefit even more by discussion on Committee Stage rather than by a general Second Stage discussion.</P>
      <P>All of us agree that litter despoils the environment.  It is essential that local authorities, or whatever group is given the task of dealing with the problem, should be given real powers of control. The Bill introduces the concept of on-the-spot fines on individuals who dispose of litter in a casual and personal way and it also introduces a rather complicated procedure for the removal, storage and eventual disposal of abandoned cars mainly on property adjacent to the roadside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The on-the-spot fine proposal in the Bill is quite wrong.  The figure should be specified in the Bill.  I appreciate that the Minister will have power to vary the fine from time to time.  If, after all these years we have come to the conclusion that one of the deterrents to be employed to prevent people from throwing away sweet wrappers, cigarette packets, and so on, <Col N="2142" /> is an on-the-spot fine, we are deluding ourselves and frustrating the local authorities if we ask them to impose an on-the-spot fine of £5.  The fine should be such that a person will think twice before disposing of a sweet wrapper or a cigarette packet by throwing it away.  If you are unlucky enough to do that while a litter warden is in the vicinity an on-the-spot fine of £5 is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>People who visit foreign countries are very conscious of the fact that if they throw something on the streets they are liable to be fined £50 or £100.  They are very much aware of the fact that there is a monetary penalty.  This intrudes into their consciousness and has an effect on the manner in which they conduct themselves in the public streets.  The £5 fine included in the Bill will not have that effect.  While I welcome the concept of an on-the-spot fine, it is a cod to suggest that it should be £5.</P>
    <P>I want to draw an analogy between the on-the-spot fine being introduced for littering and the on-the-spot fine for motor car parking offences.  I know there has been some change in the recent past, but great numbers of people opt not to pay the on-the-spot fine for motor parking offences because of the length of time it takes before the charge comes up in court and because of the fine liable to be imposed by the court.  It is in the interest of the offender to allow the proceedings to go to court rather than to pay the on-the-spot fine.</P>
    <P>The onus of proof is on the prosecuting authority.  The personal appearance of the individual in court very often seems to influence the level of the fine now imposed for car parking offences.  It is difficult for the local authority to prove the case.  The litter warden who, presumably, will be the chief witness for the prosecuting authority will have to have almost total power of recall of the incident which will be one only of hundreds of incidents as opposed to the supposedly clear recollection on evidence of the offender.  These all point to the fact that it is very much in the offender's interest to allow a court case to ensue, if it always ensues which is probably unlikely.</P>
    <P>If we are to have an on-the-spot fine it <Col N="2143" /> must be at such a level that it will be a deterrent.  People will have to realise that harsh and all as it may appear to be, it will be matched or even higher if they are found guilty in court.  The Minister mentioned the level of fines which might be appropriate.  He mentioned the frustration of Dublin Corporation last year when they suggested that there should be fines of £1,000 on people causing litter problems.  In this Bill there is a fine of £500 following conviction in court.  That would be the maximum amount which the courts could impose.</P>
    <P>The Minister touched upon another very real problem.  When legislation is enacted, penalties for offences are matters for the court to implement.  It is fair to say that, in prosecutions by local authorities, generally the courts are inclined to the view that this is bureaucracy bearing down upon the unfortunate individual.  I cite the example experienced so often by local authorities when court proceedings are taken in relation to planning offences under the planning code.  Especially in cases where individuals are being prosecuted rather than corporate bodies, in the main the court sides with the individual and appears to take the view that the local authority would be better off getting on with the job and providing services rather than harassing individuals.</P>
    <P>That has been the experience of local authorities over the years.  If one accepts that, if a maximum penalty is provided in the legislation a minimum penalty must also be provided.  If the court finds on the evidence presented that the person has committed the offence, they are not given the discretion of fining the offender a nominal £1 or a fine which is so derisory that it involves a considerable financial loss for the local authority and so puny that in real terms the law is brought into disrepute.</P>
    <P>In the area of litter control and in certain other aspects of the local government code, the fines set are such that the courts regularly impose fines of 50p in certain areas.  This derides the legislation and the attempts by the local authorities to bring any order into the situation.  It can also <Col N="2144" /> mean a severe financial imposition on the local authority.  The appearance in court of the law agents, the administrative personnel, and the litter warden, and the notice of proof of the serving of the summons will probably mean that the case will cost the local authority a minimum of £100.  It is quite conceivable that it might cost well in excess of that.  In the event of the person being found guilty, if the fine is to be as minimal as £1 or £2 it is not an encouragement to the local authorities to enforce the law.  That is one of the difficulties in relation to the area of litter control at present.  There are areas within several different Acts on local government that could be implemented. There is no incentive to local authorities to try to carry out an increased level of litter control if the results are to be similar to the sort of outcome that has occurred in the courts in recent years.</P>
    <P>I strongly suggest that, if there is to be a maximum fine set for the courts to impose, those fines be only imposed in cases of flagrant and deliberate violation; but there must also be a minimum fine because otherwise in certain cases it would be in the interests of commercial operators to continue to litter.  If there is not a minimum fine imposed after a case has had to be adjourned on a number of occasions before a conviction was obtained and a fine of a few pounds was imposed, we will get a succession of convicted persons leaving the court and mocking officers of local authorities who have gone to the trouble of taking the prosecution.  Unless that aspect of the Bill is strengthened there will not be any real improvement.</P>
    <P>The Minister's suggestion that business people be obliged to keep tidy the area around their premises is fair and reasonable, but in return for that the Minister should examine the refuse collection service operated by local authorities because in many instances local authorities only operate a domestic refuse collection service.  They are not providing a service for people in business.  That has two disadvantages.  A business person might try to dispose of the refuse by burning it on the premises which often leads to complaints by neighbours in the <Col N="2145" /> immediate vicinity or one can have the regular dumping of business refuse, especially refuse from shops, around the adjoining countryside.  That happens because local authorities are not providing a refuse collection service for businesses. The comprehensive element of refuse collection ought to be examined.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's suggestion that the main area upon which we should concentrate is the instilling in the general public of an awareness of the need for litter control.  It is an area in which we are particularly poor in attending to.  One of the most positive ways in which attention to tidy areas can be promoted is through local authorities holding annual tidy district competitions.  The local authority of which I am a member in recent years endeavoured to introduce additional categories into the tidy districts competition, which started originally as a competition to encourage housing estates, villages and more rural areas of the country to compete for fairly handsome cash prizes which would be used in turn for the further improvement of their area.  That has now been widened and in the last number of years a category for the best presented shopping centre has been produced as has also a scheme of awards for the best commercial petrol station and for the best presented industrial premises.  The concept of local authorities introducing incentive competitions such as those, catering for as many categories as possible, so as to encourage traders and those in business to become actively involved with residents in the presentation and tidiness in the areas is to be welcomed and encouraged.  The main area in which we should be endeavouring to bring about a consciousness of the need for litter control is within our schools.  The onus there falls on the local and educational authorities to bring about among school children a greater awareness of the need for litter control.  I welcome the Minister's proposals in that regard.</P>
    <P>I accept the remarks of the Minister with regard to the collection of motor vehicles which are abandoned and the temporary storing of them for scrap.  That will be an encouragement towards the <Col N="2146" /> concept of recycling.  However, we need to realise that as the situation stands at present most of the recycling procedures are still enormously costly in comparison to other methods of disposal.  There is quite a lot of misapprehension about the relative amount of merit in financial terms in this area.  In relation to the definition of vehicle in the Bill, I note that it includes part of a vehicle or an article on a vehicle which cannot operate at that time.  The Minister refers to items such as old cookers or washing machines that might be stored in areas on the outskirts of town, but I wonder how well they will be covered.  The definition of vehicle should be extended to include any metal object of any type which is being displayed on the outskirts of towns.</P>
    <P>This is a technical Bill, as the Minister pointed out, which deals only with a small area of what is a real problem.  The problem is rather mundane and dull for people to be expected to speak on, to take an interest in or to have a consciousness of. Yet the extraordinary thing is that when an area is litter free and well presented it is highly commended by the public in general.  I am afraid that the same people when they are invited to join a tidy towns committee do not do so.  Such committees are the smallest of all the representative groups politicians meet in the course of their travels.  They are the flag carriers in most towns, but yet they are the smallest committees.  In many towns that I know such committees have fallen by the wayside with a monotonous degree of regularity over the years.  More support should be given to such committees who are endeavouring to improve the appearance of their areas.  The Legislature needs to give support to such voluntary groups.</P>
    <P>The Legislature should also give support to local authorities because they feel they have not got that support or the support of the courts.  They feel that in general they are fighting a losing battle against litter control.  They are criticised for its proliferation and are not assisted in taking effective measures to prevent it.  Insofar as the Bill will help this situation, I welcome it, but its provisions could be improved on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Col N="2147" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Minister would like to get the Second Stage by 7 o'clock and because of that I shall be as brief as possible.  The Bill is very necessary but I was surprised that the Minister left out a lot of things I would like to have seen dealt with, particularly bill posting.  Coming up to election time that is probably not the right thing to deal with, but it must be dealt with because that type of litter annoys those of us who try to keep our countryside clean.  We find that people have no hesitation in putting posters everywhere including on local authority signs and so on.  This must be dealt with and I ask the Minister, if he does not intend to include it in new legislation, to deal with it.  I include also that scrawling on walls which has reached the stage where it is really outrageous.  At one period I got all local authorities to clean the walls in their areas and I suggest that the Minister might do the same again because we are coming into some kind of tourist season with walls which are not an attraction to tourists and which annoy people who live here.</P>
      <P>I ask also that something special be done by local authorities with regard to refuse collections.  Deputy Boland referred to the once-weekly collection from householders only.  We are in the unfortunate position of having had a once-weekly collection for householders for very many years and because of the severe cuts which occurred this year in Government grants our local authority have reverted to a fortnightly collection. This has meant that all over County Meath one can now find bags of rubbish thrown on the side of the road.  It is outrageous and people should not do it. If they made a little effort they would be able to put the rubbish somewhere for the extra week and then get it carried away but unfortunately they do not do that.  Beside villages and towns people who have recently bought houses have very little ground except a small lawn and they are unable to find a place to dispose of their refuse.  They will put it in a bag and when they go out early in the morning, open the door of their car and dump their refuse outside the village.  This is not improving the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2148" /> With regard to bills and posters there should be a law which insists that those who want to put them up should put them on cardboard and tie them to poles from which they could be easily taken down. They should not be stuck on everything so that they are there for generations to come.  I do not know how people who stand for election and never get a vote like to see their pictures there for years, and this has happened.</P>
    <P>The question of cars has to be dealt with.  All sorts of old vehicles and rubbish like that should be taken away.  Who is to do it is the problem.  I knew of one gentleman who was collecting them and he had to be paid £7 per car by the local authority for taking the cars away.  Perhaps he was a philanthropist and not making any money on it himself, but somehow I doubt that.  There should be some way in which local authorities even would be encouraged to put these cars in a central area.  There should be some legislation which insists that those who want to keep car graveyards, as they are generally referred to, should keep them surrounded by a wall or fence of some kind which would render them invisible from the road.  Nothing looks worse than old cars stuck here, there and everywhere, in fields and up beside houses and towns.  They make a show of the whole place.</P>
    <P>The Minister is on the right track.  Perhaps he has not gone far enough but, as Deputy Boland says, we will try to help him when it comes to Committee Stage to make this a better Bill.  Whether the cars were abandoned was one matter which arose in Dublin a few years ago. The other way of dealing with it is that if a car is on the street and it is not taxed &mdash; it is wrong to say &ldquo;taxed&rdquo; now even though the application form says &ldquo;taxed&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If it is not taxed or insured, then prosecute the person who claims to own it.  If the person does not appear, dump the car.  This is one way of clearing the streets of those cars.  My three points are first, local authorities collecting refuse will have to collect it in a reasonable <Col N="2149" /> space of time.  Secondly, there should be a pretty heavy fine for anybody caught dumping litter anywhere, and it is easier to catch such people in the countryside. In a city or town it is difficult to know who dropped the litter, no matter how vigilant the warden is.  It is not easy to prove who dropped the cigarette package or something else in a city or town. It is not easy to follow people, get their names and addresses and arrange either to collect a fine from them or prosecute them.  I am all in favour of forcing people who have not got the decency to dispose of their litter properly to do it at the expense of being fined.  I have a lot more to say, but I will let the Minister in.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful to the Deputies for the welcome extended to this Bill. As I said in my opening remarks, if there is a constructive suggestion made for improvement I am more than willing to look at it on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland spoke of the on-the-spot fine and whether the level of £5 is sufficient.  I have given a lot of thought to this and I have had a lot of discussion with my officials and others on it.  As it is the first introduction of an on-the-spot fine with regard to litter I had to get the balance right between disincentive to pay and go to the courts and a ludicrously low level of fine of, say, £1 or £2 as a first stage to see how the procedure operates without clogging up the courts.  It is not my desire that these fines will not be paid and that they will go to court.  I am trying to encourage people to pay the fines. Really I am trying to encourage them not to drop litter at all.  An argument can be made for increasing the fine to £10 or £15.  However, we can discuss it at greater length on Committee Stage.  As far as the discretion of the court is concerned on the level of fine from £1 to £500, I take fully the point made by Deputy Boland that it would be desirable if a scale could be set down in relation to the amount of litter dropped on the streets or in the areas around the edges of towns.  Again, it is something that we can discuss on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2150" /> With regard to the refuse collection, I accept fully the need for what the two Deputies spoke of, that is some provision for the commercial sector, shopkeepers and others of a collection system. Regarding the car graveyards, included in the Bill is provision for fencing and for general beautification of the site.  On the definition of &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; taking in such things as the cookers that Deputy Boland spoke about, I assure him that that is already included in another section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is the first step along a legislative line of improving the environment in this country for the benefit of the people of this country and of the tourists who visit our land, but specifically for our own benefit and that of our young population. Too often the littering of the streets is wrongly attributed to the young people, and they have a very important role to play.  In any event, we can encourage them and the older generation also to remove this curse and scandal of litter from our society.  This is something for which we should all strive.  I thank the Deputies for the welcome they have extended to the Bill and for giving me Second Stage this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>As a man who has so enthusiastically expressed his support of the Pro-Life Campaign, and further, the <Col N="2151" /> man who so courageously pioneered reform of our laws on capital punishment here in his enlightened 1963 Criminal Justice Act &mdash; Deputy Haughey may recall that I supported him in the House on that issue &mdash; it is surprising to find that the Government of which he is now Taoiseach should decline to amend the existing laws permitting us to kill a fellow citizen as a punishment for murder.  The compulsion to punish delinquence, at its origins, lies in the unconscious emotional levels of the personality and is not in itself the product of reason.  Indeed, punishment inflicted by society on the criminal is in essence the same form of behaviour as that committed by the criminal.  It can be argued indeed that in the case of judicial murder the punishment is even more horrible than is the crime.</P>
      <P>As I have said elsewhere, I have opposed hanging for as long as I can recall.  I had the distasteful experience in the fifties of being in a minority of two in a cabinet which hanged two men, one of whom I firmly believe was mentally defective.</P>
      <P>Abolitionists are at times accused of an indifference to the suffering of the victims of the murder and of those bereaved by the violent death of a loved one.  This is far from the truth.  We simply do not believe in the barbaric principles of the old Talmudic laws that we must &ldquo;take an eye for an eye&rdquo;.  Two wrongs never make a right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On consideration, it must be seen that a law which permits judicial murder is hard to rationalise, unlike the act of murder itself which may be carried out in a moment of fear, jealousy, or uncontrollable anger or hate.  Horrible and indefensible though a murder may be, it is at least comprehensible in terms of cause and effect.  On the other hand, is there conceivable a murder more cold-blooded and unfeeling than that which follows the full process of law, which ends in the employment for a fee of usually a foreign hangman, a total stranger to us all and above all to the man to be hanged.  There can be no animus whatever there to justify <Col N="2152" /> the awful act.  Then with the hanging process there is what must be the painful agony of waiting for death.  There is, too, the possibility of torture involved in the act of hanging in itself.  Through a miscalculation the man to be hanged may be slowly and painfully strangled to death and not have his neck expeditiously broken as is the intention in hanging.  A prison medical colleague of mine has told me of watching a tormented man being hanged and in his agony attempting to climb back up the hangman's rope.  I understand it is for this reason that a wretched prison warden must stand by in order to fall on the victims lower limbs and by his weight break his neck and kill him.  This is surely an obscene and ugly final act of humiliation which, carried out in cold blood on the man to be hanged or by the warden, is unworthy of men in any civilised society.</P>
    <P>Hanging is wrong even if it were a deterrent, and I understand that the bulk of the evidence shows it not to be.  Hanging is wrong because it is possible to hang the wrong man and there are well-documented cases to prove this.  Recall that, unlike any other known penalty, hanging is irreversible; mistakes cannot be compensated for.  In the interests of the community, imprisonment for life is all that is needed.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I remind you that since many of us here profess to a Christian belief, there is a commandment which says with a marvellous terse clarity &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill&rdquo;.  That exhortation from that source should surely matter to such a notoriously self-righteous Legislature as ours, particularly at a time like this when we continue to express our horror at the violence of men and women to one another in the North.  Awful though these crimes may be, they do not include on their statutes this most cold-blooded crime of man again man, the judicial hanging of a fellow citizen by the neck until he is dead by order of the courts.</P>
    <P>If the Government retain the power to hang the four men now under sentence of death in our own jails, is it not fair to say that, when it comes to cold-blooded Prime Ministers, Mrs. Thatcher is well matched by our own Prime Minister, <Col N="2153" /> Deputy Charles J. Haughey.  If, on the other hand, the Government retain this terrible power to give to Deputy Haughey the power to play God and exercise royal prerogative and commute the sentences for electioneering purposes, this would be a particularly callous and cynical decision even for the notoriously cynical Prime Minister, Deputy Charles J. Haughey.</P>

      <P>I want to make the position of Fine Gael clear.  The position of Fine Gael is that the party supports this Stage of the Bill on the basis that the House should have the opportunity of discussing the Bill on its Second Stage. On the Second Stage, if it is taken in this House, as far as Fine Gael is concerned there will be a free vote of the Members of this party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party are supporting this measure in an attempt to do away with the death penalty here. Unfortunately at present our country is best known abroad for violent death.  It has now, by the activities of the Provisional IRA in particular, acquired that international reputation.  There is clear evidence that the death penalty is not a deterrent to murder.  More important, I believe, particularly at this time in Irish history, that we in this House who have continuously and repeatedly over the last 12 years condemned violence and murder, should avail of this opportunity to show that, while we condemn violent death, we do it in all circumstances and without qualification.  In particular we should show that we are not prepared any longer to take human life in the name of Irish society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Descriptions that I have read of the death penalty being imposed and of the <Col N="2154" /> effects that it has had on the people who are charged with the responsibility for carrying out that penalty clearly indicate that it is degrading and dehumanising to them and a continuance of it in our opinion continues to degrade Irish society. The argument will be made that at a time such as I have described, when Ireland is witnessing daily violent death within our island, it would not be appropriate to abolish the death penalty.  I believe the reverse.  I believe that that argument is totally wrong.  There cannot be a more appropriate time for us, as legislators and representatives of our people, to give a clear and an unequivocal indication that we reject violent death in all circumstances and that, while we condemn the right of any individual or any group to take another person's life, we as a society are no longer prepared, in the name of that society, to take a human life.  We support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that Deputy Browne is activated by what appears to him to be the very best of motives in raising the issue of the death penalty in this House at this time.  He is perfectly entitled to regard the carrying out of the death penalty as a form of murder, albeit a form committed by law.  The death penalty has been the subject of rather intermittent debate in many countries for many years and several countries have removed it from their statute books, some of them quite recently.  Such research as has been carried out on the subject suggests that the case for capital punishment as a deterrent to murder has not been proved and I think that the Government, and I myself in particular, are as aware as any Deputy in the House of the relevant facts and arguments.  Nor do we yield to any Deputy in our claim to be compassionate towards our fellow citizens, be they convicted offenders or otherwise.  Speaking for myself &mdash; and I am certain that all members of the Government would agree with me &mdash; I should be glad to be in a position to inform the House tonight that the Government had decided to abolish the death penalty entirely and <Col N="2155" /> to ensure that it is not carried out in the meantime.</P>
      <P>However, I am not in a position to do that.  At the moment, we are awaiting the final decision of the courts in the case of four men who already have been sentenced on capital murder charges, namely charges of murdering members of the Garda Síochána acting in the course of their duties.  The Government may have to take a decision, in any or all of those cases, as to whether the sentence is to be carried out or some other sentence imposed.  Such a decision will be taken, if it has to be taken, soberly and carefully and with due regard to the circumstances prevailing here.  I am not authorised to say anything beyond that. I am prepared to say, however, that, whatever decisions might be taken in relation to any or all of those four cases, I do not think that the present time is a suitable one for the total repeal of the death penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great deal of violence in this country over the last few years and I believe that very many reasonable and compassionate people genuinely believe that, despite the argument to the contrary which we all know and appreciate, the death penalty is a resource which our <Col N="2156" /> society should not deprive itself of at present, particularly when what is really at issue in so far as this country and our law are concerned, is the murder of gardaí and prison officers in the course of their duties.  Many of those reasonable and compassionate people appreciate as well as anybody else the force of the argument that the abolition of the death penalty would be an affirmation of society's respect for human life and, as such, might have a beneficial influence, even on those whose respect for human life is not very great.  However, there are circumstances, and many people think that the present circumstances are among them, when such nice calculations do not satisfy the basic need to ensure that society is in a position to protect itself adequately from its enemies.</P>
    <P>Some people who would like to see the total abolition of capital punishment are very conscious of the fact that, were we to abolish it, and because of the violence of recent years, the pressure for arming the Garda would become extremely strong.  Such a development could, of course, mean added risks to human life. The Government, therefore, oppose the Bill.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann:&mdash;</P>
      <P>deploring the chaos which has arisen in the Department of Social Welfare in respect of the payment of, and applications for, benefit and assistance;</P>
      <P>recognising the totally inadequate level of staff and facilities in the Department; and</P>
      <P>having regard to the unprecedented level of unemployment in the economy.</P>
      <P>calls on the Minister for Social Welfare to resign forthwith in view of his failure, despite repeated requests, to manage his Department efficiently, and calls on the Government, as a matter of urgency, to provide all the resources necessary to enable the Department to discharge its responsibilities fully and humanely towards those who are the most socially and financially vulnerable in our society.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party decided to table this motion having regard to the fact that during the past few months there has arisen in the Department of Social Welfare a situation which is almost unbelievable. Perhaps I have had more contact with this Department than any other Deputy has had.  Down through the years I always found the staff of the Department and the various Ministers who were in charge of it to be anxious to try to facilitate those who were unfortunate enough to be ill or unemployed or old or poor but from the end of 1980 in particular some time towards the end of <Col N="2159" /> December when a change was made in the system of payment, especially payment of unemployment and disability benefit &mdash; week after week matters became worse.  At first there were delays of a week but these delays increased to three weeks and then to four weeks and so on.  Only this morning I received a letter from a lady informing me that although she has submitted 16 doctor's certificates to the Department, she has not received any benefit to date.</P>
    <P>I can well believe this, because personally I have handled several hundred complaints. I have not passed these complaints to the Minister because I do not believe that Deputies should write to Ministers complaining about such matters. Such questions should be taken up with the Secretary of the Department and that is how I have proceeded in respect of these many complaints I have received.  In some instances I got replies fairly quickly but in other cases I have not had replies for several months after making the inquiries while in other cases I am still waiting for replies.</P>
    <P>I understand that the main cause of the trouble was that some time around the end of December a decision was made to change the system of payment.  As a result, instead of paying applicants benefit as they had always been paid under their old social welfare number, when a man whose number, for instance, ended with a 1 would be paid by benefit 1 and, if it was 5, was paid by benefit 5 and so on, that system was completely changed. The decision taken was to pay benefit on the RSI number.  I do not think it was too well thought out.  For a start a doctor's certificate for social welfare has no space on which to put an RSI number.  It does specify &ldquo;insurance No.&rdquo;  On the first certificate a person receives there is a space in which the RSI number can be entered but there is no space on subsequent certificates. The result is that most people omit to give the appropriate number although I understand it was advertised on radio, television and in the newspapers. Of course everybody knows that people who are sick or unemployed buy all the newspapers, look at television, <Col N="2160" /> listen to the radio and therefore should know.</P>
    <P>When it was discovered that the appropriate numbers had not been entered on certificates apparently the Department had instructions to put such certificates to one side until the number turned up. As a result of this, immediately after Christmas, people discovered that they just could not receive payment.  In one case the man's name &mdash; and I think I should use it because it is significant &mdash; was Oliver Plunkett and to make matters worse his address was Eden.  Obviously the Department thought he was dead, was in Heaven.  That man had five children. He had been employed continuously by one big firm of manufacturers since 1937.  He had such a good insurance record he was able to tell me he had been out ill for three weeks in 1947 but had worked every week since.  At the end of December he had a slight accident, went into hospital, applied for benefit and towards the end of February his wife telephoned me asking if I could arrange to have him paid.  She had telephoned the Department on numerous occasions getting no satisfaction at all.  I took their case up with the Department officials whom I have always found to be most courteous. They told me they would investigate the matter.  I wrote numerous letters. Then the Department were to pay him; he was not paid, and there were constant telephone calls to me to the effect that no money had been received. Eventually I was told that it could be several months before payment would be made because there was such chaos in the Department.  I said I thought I could improve on that.  I put a question down to the Minister here which came up for reply on the following Tuesday.  I had a bet with some of my friends that the man would be paid on the Tuesday morning, and he was.</P>
    <P>Deputies putting down such questions in the House is one thing but one must remember all the people who cannot put questions down, who do not know the right way to go about it.  There is no point in telling them they can seek assistance from the local health authority because, in country districts particularly, assistance <Col N="2161" /> from a health authority is still referred to as home help and they do not want to take it.  Such people have stamped their insurance cards, want their benefit, and insist on receiving it.  I heard the Minister on the radio assuring all and sundry that the situation was somewhat chaotic but it had been cleared up, everything was now all right, that people were being paid, that there were now very few complaints, that he knew, because all Deputies contacted him.  I want to make it clear that I never contacted him.  I do not know whether or not others did.  I did a brief count on today's Order Paper and, if everybody has been paid, there are 55 oral questions to the Minister and 27 written asking him why people throughout the country have not received the benefit for which they have applied.  I wonder what is the answer to that.</P>

In respect of both cases I was informed that the people concerned had not entered their RSI number.  I must remain within the rules of Parliament and say that that was untrue.  One of those applicants was my son-in-law and I had entered the numbers myself.  The other was a man who had assured me &mdash; and I believe him &mdash; that he had entered the numbers.  That <Col N="2162" /> being so why should the Minister give me a reply saying they had not entered their numbers?  I have met numerous people who did not at first enter their numbers, did so subsequently, but still did not receive payment.  The usual story was that they had applied, they had not been paid, they then wasted a fortnight, when they wrote into the Minister or the Department, or telephoned the Department. They would be told that the matter was being looked into, that they would be paid.  The next thing is that they would receive an application form on which to re-apply.  One man in particular received no less than three application forms within a period of six to seven weeks.</P>
    <P>Can there be anything more frustrating than a person stamping insurance cards, paying insurance, all his or her working life and when he or she falls ill and applies for benefit, receiving a series of forms from the Department requesting particulars they have given already?  Some applicants have told me that when they applied they were told, after five or six weeks, that their certificates could not be found, and they got duplicates.  One man I know came up and handed in his set of duplicate certificates.  He was informed, when he wrote to the Department a few days afterwards, that those certificates could not be found.  Subsequently he complained to me.  I took the matter up on his behalf with the Department and he was paid.</P>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion that two things have happened.  One is that the staff in the Department are terribly overworked. They must be endeavouring to do two or three people's work.  Secondly I have come to the conclusion that, for some extraordinary reason the money out of which social welfare people are paid, has dried up, making it impossible to pay people the benefit to which they are entitled.  The Minister contended a few minutes ago that I was not talking about social welfare disability benefit, that I was talking about people on pension. Does the Minister not know that very many people who have reached pension age have supplied the necessary documents to his Department, have waited months before being paid, eventually <Col N="2163" /> receiving their pension books pressure having been brought to bear by somebody like myself.  I do not believe I or any other Deputy should have to make representations to the Department to have benefit to which people are legally entitled paid.  When Deputies make such representations payment is made, the applicant concerned receives two or three weeks payment in the book and the balance is not paid.  The Minister may contend that it is not paid for a few weeks, or a few months but eventually it is paid.</P>
    <P>I had experience of one case about which the Minister might know of a man who died and his widow applied for a widow's pension.  Under his insurance she was not entitled to the pension, but under her own insurance she was entitled. There was confusion over the stamps and all the rest of it.  Eventually it was decided that she was entitled to her pension but she was not paid.  In July of last year, the Department agreed that she was entitled to a pension for herself and two children and they paid her from that date.  I pointed out to them that she was still due a substantial amount of back money.  They said first she was not, then they said: all right, she was.  It took numerous letters and telephone calls, with the usual threat that I would raise it in the House with the Minister.  They found it possible, in the middle of December last, 18 months later, to pay her £1,803.  Does the Minister not appreciate that people who are entitled to benefits should receive them when they are entitled to them, and that giving them a lump sum at a later stage is no answer?</P>
    <P>I can give the Minister a number of other cases of people who applied for old age pensions who were told that they were not entitled to it and who were eventually paid months later.  I got a letter this evening from a man who is due several months' pension.  He has eventually come to me.  Many people do not like coming to a politician to get their entitlements but they are reduced to that. I do not know how these people can be expected to live when there is a doubt cast on their entitlement, from the low level where they apply right up to the <Col N="2164" /> offices of the Department.  People receive letters from the Department saying that their insurance cards have not been returned to the Department.  Recently a man employed for 14 years by Meath County Council received such a letter.  I queried it with the county manager, who assured me that his cards were stamped. What has happened in the Department? Why are all these mistakes being made? Is it because there is not enough staff or is it because the Minister has made such a mess in the changeover of the system of payments?  Has it been decided that only a certain amount of money may be paid out and only into the areas where it will prevent a big row?  Working women who leave work to have a baby are often refused unemployment benefit when they wish to return to work and find that their job is unavailable on the grounds that they are unavailable for work, even though they produce evidence that they have somebody at home to mind the child.</P>
    <P>Alternative arrangements do not seem to count.  The Minister is the political head of his Department and it is his job to see that the Department is properly run.  It is no use to blame somebody else. Over the years I have met and written to hundreds of officials of the Department and they have always proved most courteous. I drew to the attention of the Secretary of the Department a matter which has been occurring over the last couple of months and which I resent.  When I make representations on behalf of constituents in relation to overdue benefits and so on, at a very late stage, perhaps a month or so after the benefit has been paid, I receive a letter from the Department saying that it has been paid.  There is no reason except political opportunism why when the applicant is being informed of his entitlement I should not be informed at the same time.  There is no point in my informing the applicant that he will receive his benefit a month after he has received it.</P>

      <P>When the decision to change the system of payments was taken, were arrangements made to ensure that the files would follow the numbers?  It is quite obvious from inquiries I have made that there is no way in which a person who has been paying insurance all his life and who has his cards stamped could be held up in relation to claims unless adequate arrangements were not made.  I know that a huge number of people apply for sickness benefit and for all the other benefits and I know that the officials in the Department have been doing a tremendous job in ensuring that people get paid every week.  Why should it suddenly fall down unless the decision to alter the arrangements was not carried out at the proper time in the proper way?  The Minister is as aware as I am that the last week in December is the week in which most people would apply for disability benefit, but that was the week in which he decided to change the system.  People on unemployment benefit do not sign for it just because they like being unemployed but because they need the money.  It is annoying for them when they have done everything that the book says they must do to find that they cannot be paid.  Eventually, when things are straightened out, payment is made. A large number of people have been complaining that they were not paid because their cards were not in.  This cannot happen with the RSI system unless the employer does not pay the PAYE either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If it happens, how many prosecutions against employers have been taken?  Is it not correct that a number of employers deliberately stop the RSI contribution and do not sent it in, that they do it again and again and that they did it with the social welfare stamps? Is it not true that inspectors of the Department have a job to see that this is not allowed to continue?  Yet when somebody applies for benefit he is told that he cannot get it because of this.</P>
      <P>I had a case of a man recently who has been employed for 15 or 16 years by Meath County Council and he was seeking optical benefit.  He was told by the Department that Meath County Council had not submitted his cards.  There must be some better way of keeping records than the one which the Department decided on at the end of December.  It is not unusual now to find people being left short a couple of pounds per week in their benefit.  It may not be much to the Minister or to the senior officials, but it is a lot to the unfortunate person who is sick or unemployed and who is trying to live on the benefit.  In relation to unemployment assistance, when all the proofs are submitted and the claim is considered people find that they are not entitled to it because they are living with a parent or something like that.  Very often mistakes are made, very often the wrong person is listed and very often the person who is cut off for months, who is left on the breadline and told that he is not entitled to assistance, suddenly, if the person is persistent or I am persistent, is told that it has been discovered that payment is due and the person is paid the benefit.  It is not very funny for somebody who has been working all his or her life to find that the Department of Social Welfare are unable to deal with him or her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us who have been dealing with the Department over the years found it very convenient to ring the Department about certain claims.  It would often save them time as well as saving us time and the matter would be dealt with very quickly.  It has not been possible recently, except in very exceptional cases, to get through to the Department.  The number <Col N="2167" /> will ring but there will be no reply.  When the Minister was asked about this he said that the telephone number was out of order, that it kept ringing and the people in the Department could not hear it.  I understand that can happen.  It has happened in my home and in my office. When it happened to me I got on to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and they repaired the telephone.  It is an extraordinary thing that for several months the Department of Social Welfare do not appear to be able to get their line repaired.  I dialled the number of the Department of Social Welfare 31 times on one occasion.  Eventually somebody answered me.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to accept the Minister's word if he says that the telephone is out of order but I am not prepared to accept that he should have allowed the telephone to be out of order for all that time and done nothing about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that he had made available four lines to his office but those of us who prefer to deal directly with the Department have not been using those four lines.  The people we are talking about cannot carry on without payment for a long time.  For years they have been depending on a weekly wage and have no surplus money.  When they become ill or unemployed they are entitled to be paid.  In case the Minister says that the people who ask him questions want to embarrass him, I have been running my eye over the questions asked and I have discovered that quite a number of them are from backbenchers from his party.  Perhaps they want to embarrass him.  Most of the written questions are from people who are as frustrated, as I am, trying to get a reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the job of the Department of Social Welfare to ensure that when people require payment of the benefits to which they are entitled, those payments are made.  It is not good enough for people to feel that they should be left for an indefinite period.  The one I heard about <Col N="2168" /> this morning was possibly the longest. The lady in question said she has been submitting doctor's certificates for 16 weeks but has not received any payment. She has submitted all the necessary documents and has a good insurance record. I cannot see any reason why that lady has not been paid her benefit.  There seems to be a shortage of money in regard to everything the Government are paying at the moment.  People are coming to me and complaining that they cannot get the money they are entitled to.  Those people will not accept from the Department of Social Welfare or from me that the Department are too busy and are unable to deal with them.  They will not accept that their insurance record does not entitle them to payment of benefit.  I would not feel inclined to persuade them that they should have more patience, having waited for up to 16 weeks for the benefit they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>My experience with the officials of the Department of Social Welfare over the years has been that they were always most courteous and anxious to be helpful. The only thing which has changed over the years is the Minister.  This trouble started since the present Minister became Minister for Social Welfare.  There is no use saying that it is purely coincidental. If the Minister is not able to do the job, if he feels that it is a job that he does not want to do, somebody else should do it. There is no point in giving the impression that it is just a slight snarl-up which has been cleared.  The Minister should remember his radio interview when he assured everybody that matters had gone back to normal.  My post every day contains many queries from people who feel they are entitled to various types of social welfare benefit but cannot get them.  We have complaints from people who say they applied for a widow's pension or an old age pension but did not get it.  We receive complaints from people who say they sent in their books and did not get them back.  When the matter has been brought to the attention of the Department of Social Welfare in most cases the books have been sent out very quickly.  It should not be necessary for a person after five or six weeks to come to a TD and ask <Col N="2169" /> him to write in to the Department about the matter.  It should be possible for the Department to issue the books to those people when they become due.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare worked very well during the postal strike when they had great difficulty in ensuring that payments were made.  In most cases payments were made within a reasonable time.  I know there were some mix-ups but nothing like what is happening now. The large number of complaints which have come to me and to other Deputies about non-payment of benefits is astonishing. The Minister has not even the excuse which the income tax people use. They tell us that it is the Computer's fault.  The Minister does not use that complaint. I used to phone the benefits section. I have been pestering the Secretary of the Department who has been most courteous.  I get an acknowledgement from him within a day or two of every letter I send in.  I know I am increasing his workload but he can solve the problem if he can arrange to have the benefits paid out without people having to come to me.  I do not know how many Deputies are in the same position, but I believe some of them are as bad, if not worse than I am.  It is the people who have very little who are not getting their benefits. There are many men with families of five children who have not received any payment for eight or nine weeks.  It is no use telling a person at the end of that period that a cheque for £450 is in the post to him.  What good is the cheque to that person who has been drawing credit anywhere he could get it?  Those people have lost face among their neighbours. They have not got sufficient money to buy anything.</P>
    <P>There must be an explanation although I do not know what it is.  The Minister being the political head of the Department, must carry the responsibility for what has gone wrong.  Why should a decision be taken to change the system of payment without checking on the people who are to operate the new system and telling them how exactly it should operate in conjunction with the old system?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2170" /> Recently I met somebody who had been out for some time and had not an RSI number.  I sent in his old number.  I was surprised to find that when I sent in a person's RSI number to the Department, but not the old insurance number, I got back a letter asking for the old insurance number.  There is a fabulous index section in the Department.  If you gave them a person's name, address and approximate date of birth, within 30 seconds they could come up with the number. Has all that been scrapped?  Has all that expertise been thrown over board in an attempt to ensure that those who are working &mdash; and I assume this is the thinking behind this move &mdash; and liable to pay income tax are doing so?  Why has that system being changed?</P>
    <P>The Government have an amendment down asking us to agree to all the increases.  I do not want to go too deeply into that but I meet a great number of working class people and I have worked with them all my life.  People who tell me they used to buy two bags of coal and a container of gas every week say that they now cannot buy anything else out of their pensions.  Recently a grocery store manager told me the pattern now is a loaf of bread and a tin of beans.  That is what the poor of this country are living on and tonight we are asked to commend these fabulous social welfare benefits.  Not too long ago I saw a person going into a shop and I was surprised to see him buying one rasher costing 10p.  That was his meat for the week.  We are not supposed to be angry or annoyed about this.  We are supposed to accept it as normal.</P>
    <P>I do not get any pleasure saying this I have no animosity against the Minister because he is a very pleasant person to deal with but when I find that people I have known for years &mdash; decent, honest, hard-working people anxious to earn their living &mdash; cannot get what they are entitled to, there is only one thing to do and that is to put pressure on the Minister for Social Welfare because he is the only person who can alter the situation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2171" /> To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann affirms its confidence in the Minister for Social Welfare, express appreciation of the improvements he has made by way of substantial increases in social welfare payments as well as the extension and improvement of existing services, the introduction of new schemes and the action he has taken to modernise the administration of his Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the original Motion before the House Deputy Cluskey tried to suggest that the Department of Social Welfare under my direction are not fully and efficiently discharging their responsibilities. I deny that suggestion most emphatically.</P>
    <P>I would like to begin by drawing the attention of the House to the actual performance of the Department of Social Welfare in making payments because this is the criterion by which it must be judged.  I will first of all deal with the position over the last few months and in particular with payments made to those people who are claiming disability benefit because it is at this scheme that most criticism has been levelled.  There are an average some 70,000 disability benefit payments, including a pay-related element, made each week.  This has been the level of payments for some time and this number of payments has been made each week throughout the period from the beginning of this year.  These payments alone totalled almost £31 million between January and March.  Since the beginning of April the weekly rates of flat-rate benefit have been increased by 20 per cent as provided for in the budget.</P>
    <P>These are essential facts which must be kept firmly in mind in making any judgment on the performance of the social welfare system and they are to my mind incontrovertable proof of a Department which despite certain difficulties that had to be faced in recent times have continued to provide a very high level of service to the public.  A closer look at the actual expenditure on disability benefit for each of the six weeks up to 4 April will bear <Col N="2172" /> out even more forcibly what I have just said.</P>
    <P>The total amounts of flat-rate and pay-related benefits made by the Department were of the following order:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Week ended 27 February &mdash; £2.3 million involving approx. 72,000 persons; Week ended 6 March &mdash; £2.4 million involving approx. 72,000 persons; Week ended 14 March &mdash; £2.7 million involving approx. 71,000 persons; Week ended 21 March &mdash; £2.5 million involving approx. 72,000 persons; Week ended 28 March &mdash; £2.6 million involving approx. 72,000 persons; Week ended 4 April &mdash; £2.8 million involving approx. 73,000 persons.</P>
    <P>I am quoting these figures so that the House may see clearly for itself that persons claiming sickness benefit are in fact being paid the moneys to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>Of course disability benefit is only one of the numerous services provided.  My Department make some 540,000 payments each week.  On top of this there are some 440,000 children's allowances payments each month.  These are very large numbers of payments which are continually being made without disruption and are proof of an organisation which is functioning effectively.  Any attempt to suggest the contrary is grossly misleading.</P>
    <P>As this motion is directed at me personally, I feel I am entitled to inform the House of my record since taking office as Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>We all know that in the last few years we have been experiencing the worst effects of an economic recession on an international scale in modern times.  This has posed very considerable difficulties for the financing of social security schemes and in fact in many countries deliberate policies have been undertaken to cut back on those services.  We had to face those difficulties in the same way as everybody else, but nevertheless we have been able to achieve very substantial real increases in the levels of social welfare payments.  Since I became Minister for Social Welfare the levels of social welfare payments have been increased by 20 per <Col N="2173" /> cent for short-term benefits and 25 per cent for long-term benefits in each of the last two budgets.  These increases represent the highest allocation made to social welfare services in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>During my period as Minister for Social Welfare there have also been substantial increases in the rates of children's allowances.  Last year these allowances were increased by 28 per cent and this year by a further 30 per cent.  In the comparatively short time that I have been Minister for Social Welfare, children's allowances for a family with three children have accordingly been increased from £14.50 a month to £24 a month, an increase of some 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>The increases given during my time as Minister for Social Welfare not only fulfilled the Government's commitment to maintain the real value of social welfare payments but have brought about a substantial improvement in the level of those payments in real terms, particularly for long-term beneficiaries like widows and old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>The improvements for which I have been responsible during my period as Minister for Social Welfare have not been confined to increasing the rates of payments alone.</P>
    <P>Last October I introduced a National Fuel Scheme which was the first such scheme to apply to the whole country. More then 115,000 pensioners and others are benefiting under the new scheme this year.  The value of the vouchers over the winter months is now £90 per beneficiary, or double what it was when I took office. During Deputy Cluskey's time the number of beneficiaries was 57,500 and the value to each over the winter months was about £25.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are double the number benefiting now.  In December I introduced a special Christmas bonus of a double week's payment to all long-term beneficiaries.  This action gave welcome assistance to those who are most in need at a time of year when it is particularly <Col N="2174" /> welcome.</P>
      <P>Another widely welcomed development for which I was responsible was the recent introduction of a new scheme of maternity allowance for working women. In conjunction with the legislation giving working women a statutory right to maternity leave I provided a new and improved scheme of maternity allowances. I eased the contribution conditions for the allowance, extended the allowance from 12 to 14 weeks and granted an improved rate of pay-related benefit from the first day of maternity leave.  Most important of all I provided for a minimum allowance of £45 per week in order to assist those women who are on low incomes.  I am proud to have been associated with the introduction of this scheme which is undoubtedly a major social advance for women in this country.</P>
      <P>Another measure of major importance was the recent Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act.  This massive piece of legislation embraced all social welfare statutes from the beginning of this century.  It grouped together in a logical and orderly fashion the existing legislation dealing with each topic.  It involved the rewording of old and archaic constructions and the repeal of those provisions which had become obsolete in the course of time and no longer had any validity.</P>
      <P>The task of consolidation was necessary because of the continuing expansion of the social welfare system.  The volume of legislation dealing with social welfare schemes had become so complex that it was extremely difficult to ascertain the provisions relating to a particular scheme.  The Consolidation Act has streamlined all of this law and made for ease of access and clarity.  The Act will prove to be an invaluable aid to Deputies, social and community workers and organisations involved in helping the public in social welfare matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the improvements already mentioned I have introduced numerous other measures since I became Minister for Social Welfare.  I reduced the qualifying age for blind pension purposes from 21 to 18 years.  I removed anomalies in the means test.  I introduced major improvements in the free telephone <Col N="2175" /> rental scheme which I extended to people receiving disabled person's maintenance allowance and British retirement pensions, I removed restrictions on the use of free travel to enable pensioners to travel over holiday periods.  I extended the orphans' pension scheme.  I granted the first increase since the inception of the scheme in the amounts payable in respect of multiple births.  I made new regulations which double the amount of income which certain recipients of disability benefit and unemployment benefit are allowed to earn without affecting their right to benefit.  I modified the way in which land transfers are treated for non-contributory pension purposes to enable claims for those benefits to be dealt with more expeditiously.  I arranged for those in the 65 to 66 age group to receive their unemployment benefit on a four-weekly basis if they so chose.  To help young persons living at home who apply for unemployment assistance, I reviewed the method of assessing board and lodgings and I introduced worth while reforms.  For the disabled I have introduced a number of significant improvements.  The Disabled Person's Maintenance Allowance was increased by 25 per cent this year and provision will be made from next October for their dependants for the first time.  I have increased the domiciliary care and mobility allowances as well as the motorised transport allowance.  The free telephone rental scheme has also been extended to those receiving Disabled Persons Maintenance Allowance.  Finally, in this regard I established a national committee and an advisory council to promote and co-ordinate activities for the International Year of Disabled Persons.</P>
    <P>I would underline this matter further by giving the House some particulars of overall expenditure on social welfare.  In 1976 the last full year during which Deputy Cluskey was in the Department of Social Welfare total expenditure by the Department amounted to some £450 million. The estimate of expenditure for the present year is some £1,110 million.</P>
    <P>These are some of my achievements in the short period of 16 months since I took <Col N="2176" /> office as Minister for Social Welfare. These achievements speak for themselves. Actions speak louder than any words and they are a measure of my concern and of the concern of the Government of which I am a member to discharge their responsibility fully and humanely towards those who are the most socially vulnerable in our society.</P>
    <P>What I have said so far outlines some of the many achievements of my Department in recent years.  Though certain problems have arisen in recent months in relation to the disability benefit scheme, it must not be forgotten that the numerous other services of the Department have continued to operate speedily and efficiently despite increasing numbers of beneficiaries, despite increasing complexity in the schemes themselves, as they are continuously adapted to meet people's needs, and despite the introduction of new schemes.</P>
    <P>All these have placed a considerable strain on the staff of the Department who have always responded without fail to ensure that claimants are given a high level of service.  For example, the budget increases at the beginning of April of 25 per cent and 20 per cent involving thousands of recalculations and adjustments to the payment procedures were implemented in time.  Thousands of new pension books had to be ordered and delivered in the very short period between the date of the budget and 1 April and hundreds of thousands of new children's allowances books are being made available in time for the increases due from the beginning of July.</P>
    <P>This performance bears comparison with that of any other institution, Government or private.  In the United Kingdom it should be noted increases announced in their budget at the beginning of the year are not implemented until the following November.</P>
    <P>The problems in the disability benefit area have given rise to certain delays in payment.  To meet this situation I ordered a range of administrative measures to be taken to deal with the matter.  As a result of these measures considerable improvements have been made and I am pleased to be able to say that the position generally <Col N="2177" /> is not far from normal.  It would perhaps be helpful if I were to give a brief outline of what was involved.</P>
    <P>Since April 1979 the method of collecting social insurance contributions by means of stamped cards was replaced and modernised by the Pay-Related Social Insurance scheme, PRSI, under which contributions are collected by the Revenue Commissioners alongside PAYE deductions.  This system was a major advance from the social point of view on the old system in that it introduced proper pay-related contributions.  This is a fairer system and of considerable advantage to lower paid workers.  It also has advantages from the employers' point of view in that it did away with the need for a separate system of retaining and stamping social insurance cards.  The new system of course involved major administrative changes for all concerned, the dimensions of which can be appreciated when it is realised that more than one million insured persons are involved.</P>
    <P>Since January last disability benefit entitlements have been calculated for the first time by reference to the new PRSI contributions collected during the first year of that scheme in 1979-80.  The Department of Social Welfare was confronted with two major problems which despite the most careful preparation on its part and on the part of the Revenue Commissioners it was simply not possible to overcome completely.  This arose because the problems were largely outside the control of either Department. The first problem arose because a large number of claims and medical certificates were received in the Department which did not quote the relevant insurance numbers that would enable the insurance records of the claimants to be identified immediately and linked with their claims. Secondly, perhaps partly because of the newness of the system, a number of the returns from employers under the PRSI system were defective in one way or another.  Each of these problems created serious difficulties for the processing of claims and because of the size of the operation they gave rise to delays not only in relation to the individual claims <Col N="2178" /> concerned but also throughout the disability benefit system.</P>
    <P>In December and January last an extensive publicity campaign on press and television was undertaken advising claimants of the vital need to quote both their social insurance numbers and their RSI numbers in all claims and certificates. This campaign to remind people to quote numbers has continued in one way or another in the meantime and I am glad to say that it has evoked a significant response.</P>
    <P>In the normal course an appreciable number of claimants &mdash; some 6 per cent to 7 per cent &mdash; fail, for one reason or other, to quote their correct insurance numbers and this is a problem we will always have with us.  At the time of the change-over at the beginning of this year the proportion of disability benefit claimants not quoting the correct numbers had risen to some 25-30 per cent.  Due to the publicity campaigns which I have mentioned, this percentage has fallen considerably and now stands in the region of some 10 per cent, which has helped considerably in the continuing improvement which has taken place.</P>
    <P>The collection of social insurance contributions under the new PRSI system came into effect in April 1979 in the middle of the postal strike.  This factor, together with the novelty of the system, resulted in a number of social insurance records being defective for the first year which is the year governing entitlement to current claims.  This gave rise to delays because inquiries must be made to establish a claimant's insurance record to enable benefit to be paid.  As a result of these inquiries and of special efforts made by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the position has improved.  I think it only right to say here, however, that as long as records are incomplete there will always be some delays in dealing with claims.  Everything possible will be done to minimise the difficulties but in the last resort the responsibility lies primarily with employers and employees to see to it that contributions are properly deducted, that records are properly kept and that returns are made in good time.</P>
    <P>It must also be borne in mind that in <Col N="2179" /> dealing with the large number of claims and inquiries presented to them, the Department must continue to fulfil their responsibilities to ensure that only those persons are paid who are entitled to benefit.</P>
    <P>I must refer to what Deputy Tully said. There is an onus, under the existing legislation, for the officers of the Department to check whether people are genuinely available for work.  Legislation dictates that situation.  He mentioned that particularly in regard to eligibility. That is a problem which will always be there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister misunderstood what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To achieve this, the Department must enforce a range of control measures and institute their own inquiries in cases where there are genuine doubts as to the claimant's entitlement. An obvious form of control in the disability benefit area is that claimants from time to time are referred to the Department's medical referees for examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When delays first came to notice I decided that a wide range of administrative actions would be called for and to ensure quick and efficient action a special group of officials from a number of Departments was set up.  These came from all the major Departments either involved in the scheme or whom it was considered would be in a position to help. This group produced a range of proposals which were put into action almost as soon as they were made.  Among the first measures taken was the diversion from other areas of the Department to the disability benefit areas of staff who had formerly worked in that branch.  It is an area which requires considerable experience.  Staff with experience of disability benefits administration, who had been assigned to other Government Departments, were then sought out and as a result, it was possible to provide an additional number of experienced staff.  I thank the staff concerned.  On top of this a considerable number of extra posts were created to cope with the additional work.  Finally, I have created a team at a high level to <Col N="2180" /> review and streamline the administration of the disability benefits payments system.</P>
    <P>Telephone facilities were increased but this ran almost immediately into difficulties. The staff dealing with claims ceased to answer telephone inquiries because they felt that answering telephones interfered with the processing of claims.  They felt that by discontinuing this activity for a period they could concentrate on bringing payments up to date.  This matter is being kept under review.  In the meantime my office is dealing with inquiries as far as possible.</P>
    <P>Recent developments in the area of staff relations have not, however, been very helpful.  Due to considerations which are related to a civil service-wide grade claim, the staff association involved has refused to allow the use of any additional video display units in the computer system in the disability benefits area for the time being and has not so far agreed to the resumption of answering telephones.  It will not be possible to bring our services fully back to normal until these matters are resolved.  Perhaps this explains some of Deputy Tully's queries.</P>
    <P>I have always been conscious that any organisation, and in particular one which caters to such a large extent for the immediate needs of almost the entire population, must be continually improving and developing to keep pace with the changing needs of claimants and with developments in the outside world generally. I am, therefore, concerned with improving the administrative capacity of the Department as well as improving and modernising the actual schemes themselves to bring them more into line with present day requirements.</P>
    <P>One of the major deficiencies in the social welfare code is the absence of pay-related pension or any adequate social insurance coverage for the large number of our population who are self-employed. Plans for a Government White Paper which will set out definite proposals in both these areas are now at an advanced stage.  These will eventually lead to major improvements in the social welfare services.</P>
    <P>I have also had the whole social welfare <Col N="2181" /> code examined to establish the areas in which discrimination against women still remains and I am at present considering proposals in this area which will be implemented in a progressive manner over the next few years.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious that any delay no matter how short in making payment can result in hardship to the person concerned. The operation of all the various services is subject to continuing scrutiny with a view to ensuring a speedier and more efficient service to the public.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are already well advanced for improving the extent to which computerised methods can be used in the Department.  Deputy Cluskey is quoted as having said that in his time in the Department of Social Welfare children's allowances and pensions were switched over to computer.  Deputy Cluskey is quite mistaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>When did Deputy Cluskey say that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Children's allowances and pensions were not computerised in his time and in fact those schemes have not yet been computerised.  Detailed planning commenced in 1980, is now at an advanced stage and is expected to commence operation during the first half of 1982.  Roughly a further two years will be required to finish the job.</P>
      <P>What happened during Deputy Cluskey's time in the Department of Social Welfare is that in 1973-74 the payment of disability and certain allied benefits was computerised.  This was the flat-rate system which up to that time had been dealt with by clerical methods.  The full information relating to the insurance records of claimants was already available in the Department in manuscript records.  This was a relatively limited operation to which subsequently was added the payment of pay-related benefit with disability, unemployment, maternity and occupational injuries benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A much more extensive operation was undertaken from January of this year.  A more powerful computer system was installed which is capable of taking from <Col N="2182" /> the Office of the Revenue Commissioners computer system the records of PRSI contributions collected by that office in conjunction with the PAYE tax system. This is a major advance and will in time provide a base for further advances and developments in the administration of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>One aspect in which I am most particularly interested in the possibility of regionalising to a greater extent the services of the Department.  The more powerful computers at present being installed will give the facilities which will enable this to be done.  Facilities of this nature are socially desirable and will lead to speedier processing of claims and to a more immediate and humane service for claimants by making it possible to deal with inquiries to a much greater extent at local level.</P>
    <P>I am determined to press ahead with my programme of improving facilities generally.  Over the years as services have expanded the Department has acquired additional office space in a number of modern offices such as those in D'Olier House, Oisín House, Marlboro House, Townsend Street and Gandon House.  In the latter premises I am making available a new public office which will increase considerably facilities for the public.  We are providing new employment exchanges in the Dublin area in Dún Laoghaire, Navan Road and Thomas Street.  In County Leitrim a new employment exchange is being provided in Manorhamilton and will be ready for occupation in the near future.</P>
    <P>Side by side with all of this, staff numbers have been increased.  The number of staff serving in the Department at present is roughly 3,480 while in Deputy Cluskey's time the number was roughly 3030. I appreciate the difficulties with which staff can be faced when large scale developments, such as those that I have mentioned, take place.  I thank the staff for their co-operation and I express the hope that the problems they are having with their grade claim will soon be resolved.</P>
    <P>I have given the House some indication of my achievements during the short time since I took office as Minister for Social Welfare.  I have outlined the on-going <Col N="2183" /> activities of the Department as well as some of my plans for the future.  I am sure the House will agree that this is an impressive record and bears a more than favourable comparison with anything that can be put forward by occupants of the benches opposite.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised the question of the index and asked why it is not possible to cross index immediately when a case comes in.  The old index was the insurance card index and it was a relatively simple matter to check it.  The new cross-checking between the RSI numbers and the insurance numbers has been built <Col N="2184" /> up over this period and is now approximately 85 per cent efficient.  Docket books do include a section for the two numbers.  The Deputy must have been referring to older books&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>(1) During its debate on <Col N="2010" /> Namibia last month, under Ireland's Presidency, the Security Council considered five separate proposals.  One of these related to a procedural issue; the other four concerned draft resolutions relating to mandatory sanctions against South Africa.</P>
      <P>(2)  The procedural vote was on a proposal under rule 39 of the Provisional Rules of Procedure of the Security Council that the Council should invite Mr. Peter Kalangula to supply the Council with information or to give other assistance in its examination of the situation in Namibia.  This proposal was defeated by a majority vote of the Council (9-6).</P>
      <P>Ireland voted in favour of the proposal in the belief that the Council should not be restrictive in its application of Rule 39.  In casting its vote Ireland made clear its view that the Council in hearing an individual under Rule 39 made no judgment as to the representative nature of any body to which the individual belonged and that our vote did not imply that we regard the so-called Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, of which Mr. Kalangula is President, as representative of Namibia.</P>
      <P>(3)  The other votes related to four draft resolutions:</P>
      <P>(a)  a general resolution relating to the implementation of comprehensive sanctions against South Africa;</P>
      <P>(b)  a resolution imposing comprehensive economic sanctions as well as sanctions of a political nature;</P>
      <P>(c)  an oil embargo, and</P>
      <P>(d)  a strengthening of the existing arms embargo.</P>
      <P>(4)  The four draft resolutions were vetoed by the votes of the United States, the United Kingdom and France.  Ireland voted in favour of the oil embargo and the strengthening of the arms embargo; we abstained on the two draft resolutions relating to comprehensive sanctions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5)  The Government believe that the possibilities of achieving a negotiated settlement of the Namibia question on the basis of Security Council Resolutions 385 and 435 have not been exhausted.  During the Security Council debate Ireland, in <Col N="2011" /> its Presidency, sought to avoid a division in the Council and made a sustained effort to reach agreement which would send a clear signal to South Africa of the continuing unity of purpose of the Council and the common determination to see Namibia independent.</P>
    <P>Since it did not prove possible to reach a general agreement the Council voted on the draft resolutions.  In casting its vote Ireland considered that it was appropriate for the Council to indicate to South Africa the seriousness with which it would view further delay but retain for later decision other measures, including comprehensive sanctions, if South Africa should remain wholly intransigent and unwilling to fulfil its clear obligations under international law.</P>
    <P>6.  During the debate in the Security Council Ireland's representative explained in a comprehensive statement the Government's position on the present very serious situation with regard to Namibia.  I am arranging to have copies of this statement together with the draft resolutions and our delegation's explanations of vote placed in the Dáil Library.</P>

      <P>As a result of the tragic events in E1 Salvador the Commission of the European Committees has, within the past two months, approved the granting of 400,000 Ecu (IR£277,000) in emergency financial aid and 2,000 tonnes of emergency food aid in cereals to the people of EI Salvador.  The financial aid and 1,050 tonnes of the food aid is being distributed <i>via</i> the International Committee of the Red Cross, with the remaining 950 tonnes going through the Catholic Relief Services.  In addition the Council <Col N="2012" /> of Ministers on 28 April adopted a regulation cancelling direct food aid in milk products, destined for the EI Salvador Government under the Communities' 1980 programme, and reallocated it to the ICRC and the CRS for distribution in EI Salvador.</P>
      <P>These two organisations are the only bodies which have licences to import food aid into EI Salvador and both were able to give guarantees that they would organise the distribution of the aid on a nondiscriminatory basis&mdash;that is in areas controlled both by Government and opposition forces.</P>
      <P>According to the latest information available from the Commission, the CRS intends to distribute its share of the aid in close co-operation with the Salvador Ecumenical Association Humanitarian Aid Services (ASESAH) of which both CARITAS and the Green Cross are members.  In fact, according to the Commission, the main channels for distribution on the ground will be the European inter-church agencies.</P>

    <P>NOTES:</P>
    <P>1.  The figures of taxable income (i.e. total income less the appropriate personal allowances) for 1980-81 and 1981-82 and income tax for 1979-80, 1980-81 and 1981-82 have been calculated on the basis that the taxpayer is a married employee with no children.</P>
    <P>2.  The estimated increase in average weekly earnings in transportable goods industries in 1980 compared with 1979 is estimated to be 19 per cent.  This percentage has been applied to the given taxable incomes for 1979-80 in calculating the taxable incomes for 1980-81 in the table.</P>
    <P>3.  It is estimated that the increase for 1981 over 1980 due to the effects of the national understandings will be 12 per cent.  This percentage has been applied to the taxable incomes as calculated for 1980-81 in determining the taxable incomes for 1981-82 in the table.</P>

      <P>Following her marriage to a farmer in the tax year 1980-81, the taxpayer submitted a claim to repayment of tax on 11 December 1980.  The inspector of taxes wrote to her on 19 December 1980 for particulars of the valuation of her husband's farm land so that her tax-free allowance position for the post-marriage period of 1980-81 could be established. As she did not supply the required information, the inspector was not in a position to issue a tax-free allowance certificate. On the basis of information which has since become available, the inspector has granted her the married allowance and a certificate for 1981-82 incorporating that allowance was issued on 10 April 1981.</P>

      <P>Circulars 21/80 and 22/80 outline the terms for the employment and payment of substitute teachers in national schools during teachers' approved absences.  This task, which had been the function of the absent teacher up to December 1980 became the responsibility of the school board of management with effect from 1 January 1981.  The duties involve employing and paying the substitute, making the appropriate PAYE tax and pay-related social insurance deductions and maintaining the necessary records.  The substitute's salary and employer's PRSI costs are recouped by the Department to the school board of management and there is provision for advance payments to schools where such payments are necessary.</P>

The legal arrangements for the purchase of a site in Bray are well advanced and it is envisaged that the Department will be in a position to pay the grant in the near future.  A report is awaited from the Commissioners of Public Works on a site offered in Tralee.  It is not possible to state when a grant may be paid.</P>
      <P>Where management authorities are not already in possession of sites, or where existing school buildings are not available for use for such schools, full-cost grants will be provided for suitable sites which may be offered in areas where the need for permanent schools is clearly established.</P>

      <P>I have received representations in this matter on behalf of boards of management of national schools in the Bray Deanery.</P>
      <P>The responsibility for the arrangements for the employment of substitutes for national school teachers absent for certain approved reasons was transferred from the individual teacher to the boards of management of the schools as from 1 January 1981.  The situation in the case of these schools is now the same as that in the case of post-primary schools.  I am satisfied the revised arrangements are appropriate and the most suitable which it is feasible to make to meet the relevant requirements.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection I would refer the Deputy to my reply on 29 January 1981 to questions relating to proposals for the revised composition of boards of management of national schools and of the selection boards for the nomination of assistant teachers for appointment by the boards of management.  I stated that proposals which resulted from discussions between the Department of Education and representatives of the managerial and teacher organisations were to be placed before the Annual Congress of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation at Easter 1981 for approval.  I understand <Col N="2034" /> that the proposals were adopted at congress.</P>
    <P>My Department will, accordingly, be communicating at an early date with the managerial authorities with a view to the introduction of a revised constitution of boards of management and rules of procedure as from October 1981.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit in respect of an an accident at work on 5 December 1980.</P>
      <P>Pending investigation of his claim, his entitlement to disability benefit as an interim measure was examined.  He did not however satisfy the qualifying contribution condition for disability benefit which requires the claimant to have at least 26 weeks insurable employment in the governing contribution year.</P>
      <P>Following inquiries his claim to injury benefit has been allowed from 5 December 1980 and payments have been made in respect of the period up to 1 May 1981. The delay in payment was due to the fact that the inquiries were only completed recently with the receipt from his employer of confirmation of the occupational accident.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes in house purchase schemes which I announced on 10 April 1981 are part of a wide-ranging package of housing initiatives which I have taken. In addition to house purchase, the Housing Package 1981 embraces the local authority house improvement loan scheme, the local authority housing programme, a scheme for financing improvement works to rented local authority houses, tax allowances for the provision of rented residential accommodation, increased financial assistance for voluntary housing bodies, improvements in certain housing grant schemes and the establishment of housing information centres.  A summary of the main features of the package was set out in a prominent advertisement published in the national daily newspapers on 16 April.  An explanatory leaflet on the special mortgage subsidy <Col N="2077" /> scheme was also available to the public on that day.  A comprehensive circular letter giving detailed particulars of all aspects of the package will be issued to local housing authorities and recognised voluntary housing bodies within the next few days.</P>

      <P>In considering applications for work permits under the Aliens Orders, 1946 and 1975, and the EEC Regulations, 1977, I must have regard to the availability of Irish/EEC nationals for the work involved.
