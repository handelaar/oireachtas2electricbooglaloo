    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on 18 December 1980 in the course of my contribution to the pre-Christmas Adjournment Debate, my Department do not have any statutory jurisdiction over the operations of tour operators.  Contracts concluded by tour operators with airlines, hotels and so forth on the one hand and with their customers, the travelling public, on the other are essentially commercial matters for the parties concerned. I do not have at my disposal any funds to reimburse people who suffer financial loss as a result of a collapse of a tour operator, and accordingly no useful purpose would be served in my meeting a deputation representing clients of Bray Travel,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recognising that there has been a significant growth in foreign holidays in recent years, my Department had urged the travel trade to institute arrangements that would safeguard the interests of the public in the event of the financial failure of a tour operator.  The Irish Travel Agents Association, who represent tour operators and travel agents, had established a fund for that purpose and the fund was, in fact, used by the association to help meet the costs of Bray Travel <Col N="1271" /> clients who were already abroad at the time of that company's collapse.  In addition, the airline concerned in this case were required, as a condition of their authorisation, to ferry home any holiday-makers who might otherwise have been stranded abroad because of the inability of the tour operator to fulfil his obligations.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Irish Travel Agents Association now have under consideration new arrangements to make provision against losses that might arise in the event of any further failures and that a number of individual tour operators are introducing bonding arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Bray Travel collapse has highlighted the need for effective protection of the travelling public and I am satisfied that this requires the establishment of a scheme on the basis of law.  For some time past my Department have been looking at what can be done by way of legislation and, as I indicated to the House on 18 December last, it is my intention to seek Government approval as soon as possible for a package of legislative measures to deal with the matter. I hope to introduce this legislation in the current session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Government considered making compensation available for the victims of this collapse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are not making any funds available because if we were to adopt that attitude it would create a precedent in relation to every business that collapsed and we would have people coming to the Government in relation to normal courses of commercial activity which, in effect, this was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Minister has told us he intends introducing legislation which would provide a bonding system, would it be possible to make the new Bill retrospective which would, as happened in the UK, cover something which has already happened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There are special circumstances <Col N="1272" /> in relation to the UK situation. I am not aware of financial houses that would accept a bonding system which would be retrospective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the allegation that the company in question had not prepared audited company accounts for a period of four years? How did this matter go unnoticed in Government Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, like Deputy Desmond, read in the newspapers that accounts were not prepared for something like four years.  The question of company accounts is appropriate to another Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that a part of the contract of the air company was that they had to bring the stranded people back.  Was that due to our legislation or the Spanish company?  Was it as a result of legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a standard condition of airlines charter licences here that in the event of the collapse of a tour operator all passengers taken by them must be repatriated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it under our legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a condition written into the licences given to foreign charter airlines which take people abroad, that they must bring them back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister reconsider his attitude to the question of compensation in view of the fact that there is a precedent by the Government in relation to the Irish Trust Bank where funds were made available on the basis that a breakdown of the company took place?  Would the Minister extend some degree of sympathetic consideration to the people involved and, at least, discuss the matter with them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have expressed my sympathy in every way possible in relation to the people who lost their holidays and money and I had meetings with the <Col N="1273" /> Irish Travel Agents Association to see what they could do as part of their business routine.  I have been told that in one or two cases travel agents who had Bray Travel holidays booked with them have made alternative arrangements for their clients.  In relation to the alleged precedent with the Irish Trust Bank the questiom of the credibility of the Irish banking system was at stake there.  The measures in question were exceptional and it was made clear at the time that the Government's action did not alter the legal obligation, which is that the Central Bank are not liable as a result of the insolvency of a licensed bank.  The Deputy is really inferring that the Government should come to the aid of firms in every particular case of business collapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If I was to adopt the Deputy's suggestion that is what I would be doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has there not been any recommendation from the Minister's Department to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism that peoceedings be initiated against this company for alleged failure to lodge registered company accounts over a period, which resulted in a deficiency of £1 million? Surely there is a departmental and ministerial responsibility in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>When we saw the notice in the newspaper the Deputy has referred to we immediately brought it to the attention of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  I am quite certain they will take the necessary action as a result of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain what he means by &ldquo;the necessary action&rdquo;?  If the company made no returns for four years and due to the dereliction of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism in failing to follow that up, those people have lost their money, does that mean that action will be taken to compensate them for the failure of the Minister for Industry, Commerce <Col N="1274" /> and Tourism to carry out his duties in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said we have brought it to the attention of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism. The Deputy is quite well aware of the Companies Act and the other legislation, and that the appropriate Minister is the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport if he will list all the persons and organisations to whom the McKinsey Report on CIE has been circulated; when will it be discussed by the Government; and when it is expected that a Government decision on the report's recommendations will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>The McKinsey Report entitled <i>The Transport Challenge</i> was published on 5 February 1981.</P>
      <P>The Government have indicated that, because of the fundamental importance and significance of the matters dealt with in the report, it should be the subject of public debate and consultation with interested parties before decisions are taken. Copies of the McKinsey report were circulated to the leaders of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, the Opposition spokesmen on transport from both parties, the Chairman and General Manager of CIE, ICTU and CIE's group of trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated publicly that the report will be acted upon &mdash;if it is to be acted upon&mdash;in September next approximately.  Does he consider this an unnecessarily long period?  Could <Col N="1276" /> the report not be dealt with in a more expeditious manner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct the Deputy.  The Minister did not say the report would be dealt with in September. I referred to a recommendation in the report in relation to road freight and sundries. At the moment Professor McCormack and the transport consultative commission are carrying out an investigation into the operations of road freight haulage. In my view it would be inappropriate to deal with that section of the report before I received the report which I expect to receive in August or September.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, could the Minister indicate to me the qualifications of the members of the McKinsey team so that I can assess the substance and the credibility of that report.  I am reliably informed that one member is an anthropologist and another is a professor of oriental languages.  I should like the Minister to make some statement on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are very concerned about the increasing deficit and the burden placed on taxpayers. They decided on a figure of £65 million. I communicated that to the board of CIE and asked for a reappraisal.  When that reappraisal is carried out it will be forwarded to me.</P>

      <P>Are the Government determined that CIE will keep within £65 million this year?  That is a simple question. If the Government are determined that CIE will get no more than £65 million this year, and if CIE experience increased costs because of increases in the cost of oil or of wages, does it follow that the only way in which that can be achieved is by sacking men or increasing fares?</P>

      <P>As regards the future of the railway, the Deputy will be aware that the McKinsey Report has just been published and that the Government have invited public debate on its contents before decisions are taken.  In the meantime I would envisage that the provision of rail coaches at Inchicore will be necessary.  The scope and extent of activities involved will depend on decisions to be taken by the Government on the long term role of the railway.</P>

    <P>The main function of the committee is to review and co-ordinate marine search and rescue arrangements, which involve the services of a number of bodies including agencies under Government Departments and a number of independent or voluntary bodies.

      <P>The classification of dwellings for the purpose of water charges is by law primarily a matter for each sanitary authority.  I understand that some authorities treat dwellings providing lodgings, whether registered or not, as combined business and domestic premises and apply special water charges to such premises.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that some counties have a different procedure to others, would the Minister accept that it would be proper to have an even procedure throughout the country and, more importantly, does he accept that this is a devious way of collecting money from such householders in lieu of rates which are supposed to have been abolished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that, when the Bill supposed to abolish rates on domestic dwellings was introduced in 1977, it was specifically stated in the explanatory memorandum that the use of a dwelling to provide lodgings would not disqualify the premises from domestic status?  In the light of this, is it not unfair that in some parts of the country people who are providing lodgings are subject to these heavy charges?</P>

Is the Minister further aware that some local authorities are now charging more in water rates than they were charging originally in ordinary rates?

Would he agree that, despite the best efforts of many well-intentioned and good organisations, something more remains to be done?  Would the Minister not agree in those circumstances that some form of inquiry is needed?  I agree with the Minister's views in relation to An Foras Forbartha but that type of publication, good as it is, does not receive sufficient publicity.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that, while a record number of houses was completed in 1980, there has been some decline in the level of activity in house-building in recent months.  However, the continuing high level of investment in building societies, the big expansion in activities under the local authorities' house loans schemes and the greatly increased financial provision for housing in the Public Capital Programme for 1981 should ensure that house building will be maintained at a satisfactory level this year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware that the 17 per cent increase in road grants proposed by his Department for Waterford County Council in 1981 is regarded by both the elected members and the engineering staff of the council as being grossly inadequate for the maintenance of the county's roads at a reasonable standard; and if he will make additional funds available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of increase referred to by the Deputy relates to the total amount of road grants, including grants for improvement works, allocated to Waterford County Council.  Grants allocated to the council this year for the maintenance of national roads total £298,000 and represent an increase of 23 per cent over the corresponding grants for 1980 and an increase of 201 per cent over the corresponding grants allocated by the previous Government in 1977.  The level of expenditure on the maintenance of other roads is dependent largely on the level of funds to be made available by the council from their own resources, supplemented, in the case of main roads, by the block grant provided by my Department. I am satisfied that the improvement grants allocated to the council represent the maximum amount which the council would require in 1981 having regard to the present state of preparedness of its <Col N="1308" /> programme for the improvement of the national roads.</P>

      <P>This outrage is of course being investigated by the Garda Síochána and the only point I think it is necessary or appropriate to make about the investigation is that, as far as the Garda authorities are concerned, <Col N="1309" /> there is no basis whatsoever for suggestions that investigations are inhibited by legal problems about jurisdiction except in the sense that those responsible may not be within the jurisdiction now.</P>
      <P>The immediate practical problem concerning the ship is the possibility that there are unexploded bombs on board. How that problem is to be dealt with is obviously a matter for expert assessment and for a considered plan that will take full account of the need to safeguard human life.  I must make it quite clear that, in so far as the Garda Síochána have any function or role in this context, there can be no question of any pressure being put on anybody to engage in a rushed operation that would involve an unnecessary hazard to life.  As far as the Garda are aware the half-sunken ship in its present location presents no practical danger to other vessels.  Certainly the immediate priority is to avoid any undue risk to human life.  When the possibility of bombs being on the ship has been disposed of, the Garda will have no further function in relation to the ship and I cannot say where the responsibility for its removal may rest.  I can only say, for the information of the House, that I understand that legal questions &mdash; questions of maritime law &mdash; may have to be gone into.</P>
      <P>The question of what measures it may be practicable to take to guard against a recurrence is, of course, a matter for the Garda Síochána.  If the Garda Síochána were in a position to take some special preventive measures in relation to this kind of activity, I do not think that the Deputy could expect that I would be free to publicise them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday afternoon last I was endeavouring to inform the Minister for Finance, and the Cabinet, of how the budget was received in rural Ireland, particularly in South Tipperary. I informed the House that it was met with disbelief and bewilderment.  There was disbelief that a Government could be so insensitive to the real needs of the people or could be so totally out of touch with the realities of the situation.  Those in the agricultural sector, or industrialists, and our young people who are seeking employment are bewildered.  Our housewives are shell-shocked by the everincreasing <Col N="1363" /> prices.  The PAYE taxpayers are also in a state of bewilderment.  It is clear that the budget makes no serious attempt to deal with the various problems in the community.  There is not any new thought, anything innovative or inspirational in it.  There is nothing in it that will indicate to our industrialists or our youth that the problems that affect our economy are being seriously looked at.  I have already dealt with the crisis in the agricultural sector.  Over the weekend our worst fears in relation to that industry were confirmed.  The budget did not do anything for the farmers of the Golden Vale whom I represent.</P>
      <P>There is doom and gloom still in the agricultural sector and any constructive idea that did emanate from the budget came from the FitzGerald-Bruton plan which I outlined last Thursday and which was implemented only piecemeal.  Of the resources that are needed and should be poured into agriculture, the Government in their wisdom have allocated only a miserly £35 million.  That will not stem the lack of confidence, the crisis and the gloom and doom in the agricultural world at the moment.  I ask the Minister when they bring forward the Finance Bill, to implement fully the FitzGerald-Bruton plan which we in Fine Gael outlined.  We introduced it as a crisis measure to meet the emergency in agriculture and we are saddened to note that the Government did not accept it wholly but only piecemeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leading up to this budget there was an air of expectancy on the part of the Irish electorate.  They thought that the Taoiseach and his Cabinet might have something to offer to remedy the very obvious ills in the economy.  After a through examination of this budget the slow realisation has come to the Irish electorate that this Government have nothing whatsoever to offer and that they stand out in their total dereliction of duty and total inadequacy to meet the needs of the economy and of the Irish people.  The most honourable thing that the Taoiseach could do would be to go to the country and seek a new mandate so that he could apply himself seriously to maintaining the <Col N="1364" /> economy and putting it on a direct course.</P>
    <P>Nothing in this budget will give any hope to industry, with industries toppling like ninepins.  With closures announced every day, bankruptcies, industries going into receivership, further redundancies and three-day weeks, the only thing that the Government could offer the industrialists &mdash; and I am speaking about the smaller industrialists of Ireland &mdash; was to gather one-and-a-half year's corporation tax this coming year.  It is unbelievable that the Government should be so insensitive to the needs and the plight of many small industries in Ireland.  One would have imagined that they would have given some assistance, that they would try to inspire industrialists with confidence once more in the hope that new employment would be created.  With the further imposition of the increase on petrol and diesel, other increases due shortly and also the further increases of the mini-budget that will be announced shortly on postal and telephone charges, the industrialists have nothing to hope for.  Young people who were hoping that they might get employment in these industries find that their hope is forlorn. This situation is right across the board and not confined to any particular industry. The textile and shoe industries, for example were always in jeopardy and barely able to keep going, but now all branches of industry are affected.</P>
    <P>I will enumerate a few cases to indicate the depth of the crisis in the industrial world.  In Tuam the sugar factory is in serious difficulty.  In my county of Tipperary we have the Mogul lead and zinc mines with 500 jobs in jeopardy unless some attempt is made by the Government to subsidise the cost of energy.  In New Ross the ship-building industry has gone into receivership.  Pierce's of Wexford who supply farm machinery, textiles in Cashel and the various meat plants in Clonmel, Midleton and Grand Canal Street are in difficulties.  We have news of many closures of industries in the Gaeltacht.  The NET fertiliser industry has also been in trouble.  The Irish Distillers Group have issued a news release in which they state: &ldquo;It is with great <Col N="1365" /> regret, therefore, that we feel we have now been impeded in our expansion programme and it is a matter of great concern, not only to our employees and shareholders, but also to our many suppliers of goods and services&rdquo;.  One would have imagined that the Irish Distillers Group would be able to face the economic challenge, but as a direct result of the further penal imposition of duty on spirits &mdash; the third within 24 months and this has increased the duty by 108 per cent &mdash; this fine industry are in dire trouble with at least 350 on short-time and a danger that the remaining work force will be made redundant.</P>
    <P>We have had also a submission from the ground limestone industry which will give an indication of the lack of confidence of the farming community.  They tell us in the introduction to the memorandum which they have submitted to every Member of the Oireachtas that: &ldquo;Within the last two years there has been a dramatic decline in the level of lime applications.  In 1978 two million tons of lime were applied to Irish soil.  This year it is estimated that less than one million tons will be applied, a decline of 50 per cent over two years.  This dramatic cutback has already led to the loss of 500 jobs by those directly involved in the production and distribution of ground limestone&rdquo;.  This will give some indication of the crisis and the lack of confidence among the farming community, when they will not even apply lime to their lands, and also how dependent employees and workers are on the agricultural industry, when with the reduction in the application of lime 500 jobs are lost.</P>
    <P>It is against the background of this that we should interpret the budget.  I regret to say that in this budget announced by the Minister for Finance, no help, no hope is being given to either the agricultural sector or the industrial sector.</P>
    <P>When we come to prices, I said initially that the Irish housewife is shell-shocked by the daily imposition of mini-budgets, the daily rises in the prices of the most basic items on the grocery list.  I refer specifically to the answer to a parliamentary question given to Deputy L'Estrange <Col N="1366" /> last October when he asked the percentage price change between mid-May 1977 and mid-August 1980.  That last date is six months ago and many of these items have already been increased since then but apparently these are the latest figures available.  Deputy L'Estrange was told that bread increased by 71 per cent, flour by 46.1 per cent, fresh milk 63.2 per cent, cheese 40.3 per cent, tea 42.6 per cent, sugar 58.5 per cent.  The price of electricity six months ago had increased in the three years under the Fianna Fáil Government by a mammoth 62.7 per cent. The price of furniture increased by 46.6 per cent.  Bus fares have increased by 69.3 per cent and train fares by 65.8 per cent. Even the price of a hair cut has increased by 75.8 per cent.  The price of putting heels on shoes has rocketed by 70.6 per cent.  These are increases up to mid-August, 1980.  If we had a more up to date list these figures would show further increases.  All of this is against the background of the Fianna Fáil manifesto, when deliberately they led the people astray and said the impact of the programme which they put before the electorate could be summarised as follows: in 1977 prices would be reduced by 1 per cent, by 2 per cent in 1978 and by 2 per cent in 1979.  There would be no increase in prices in 1980.  Last year we had increases of 18½ per cent.</P>
    <P>We are told in this now discredited but historic document that Fianna Fáil would regard price control as an important matter and would, therefore, revert to a position where a member of the Government would be responsible for it and for dealing with the underlying causes of inflation.  We were told also that the accounting procedures of the ESB would be examined and brought up to date with a view to reducing the price of electricity. In three years, to mid-May 1980, the price of electricity shot up by 62.7 per cent.  Is it any wonder that the electorate, particularly the housewife, are totally disillusioned with the Government, and with politicians in general, when a credible party can put such a document before the people, ask them to support it and then within three short months have a complete turnabout and fail utterly and <Col N="1367" /> completely to implement the promises they made?</P>
    <P>One would have anticipated that there would have been some ray of hope for the unemployed.  This morning we read in the newspapers where the unemployment figure has reached an all time record, the highest in the history of the State &mdash; 125,000.  In one year under the leadership of the present Taoiseach, the unemployment figure has soared by 33,000.  That is the Taoiseach's contribution to solving unemployment.</P>
    <P>There is pessimism and gloom among our youth.  They cannot see any hope of being gainfully employed in their own country.  We were told in the manifesto &mdash; I apologise for referring to it so often &mdash; that employment would be reduced by 5,000 in 1977, by 20,000 in 1978, 25,000 in 1979 and 30,000 in 1980.  From these figures we can readily see that it has failed utterly and miserably to provide any extra employment for our youth.  This is a great matter of concern to people involved with youth.  They feel that unless our youth are gainfully employed they may, unfortunately, turn to unlawful means of obtaining money.  Unless something concrete is done to give them hope and confidence they will turn to antisocial activities.  Any government or political party would be well advised to divert all their attention and the resources of the nation to find employment for our youth.  There is no serious attempt to encourage employment in the agricultural sector or in the private industry. These two sectors have been further penalised.  I cannot understand how any Minister for Finance can be so out of touch with the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>The much maligned PAYE sector, who are carrying the weight of the taxation burden, hoped they would get some equity in taxation.  They must wait for indexation relief.  This year, the Minister hopes to get an extra £130 million from the PAYE sector.  This is a trick-of-theloop accounting.  There are rumblings that the PAYE sector will again take to the streets although the recent taking to the streets by farmers has been scoffed at by members of the Government.  One <Col N="1368" /> would imagine that the farming community was out for a stroll when 40,000 or 50,000 turned up in Limerick and in Kilkenny. The Government failed to react to that.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate for public Services for the coming year the grant-in-aid for general expenses to Muintir na Tíre has been increased miserably.  Last year they were given £28,500, this year they are allocated £30,000.  Coming from Tipperary, the headquarters of Muintir na Tíre, I can inform the House how disappointed members of Muintir na Tíre are.  They look on this paltry increase as an insult. They now realise that the Government are not aware of the great contribution that Muintir na Tíre make to the community. They cannot understand how the Government are so insensitive to their needs and to the needs of the community. A strong community spirit is badly needed in every parish where people, rather than relying on the Government and central funds, tackle problems locally themselves.  This small increase will do nothing to further that spirit.</P>
    <P>I am spokesman for art and cultural affairs.  This year the allocation to the National Museum has been reduced by £195,000.  One would have thought the amount would have been increased but the Government have completely turned their backs on the prospect of further expansion and development of the museum.  I refer the Minister to the latest report of the board of visitors for 1979 and to the abstract they published with that report.  It says that:</P>
    <P>Greatly increased demands on the Museum staff now result in a crisis situation in the institution, and this requires immediate attention. Increased staff and service facilities are needed.</P>
    <P>Storage facilities for the Collections must be centralised without further delay, at a venue where it will be possible to curate and to study them effectively.</P>
    <P>Preservation of important specimens &mdash; e.g.  Zoological types &mdash; has sometimes been in jeopardy owing to the inability of the Museum to obtain <Col N="1369" /> quickly the essential storage equipment. This must be rectified.</P>
    <P>A long-standing mistreatment of the Geological and Folklife Collections reflects tragic lack of responsibility at all official levels and must be corrected.</P>
    <P>It is reiterated that without a well-advised official policy regarding the Museum as a major national institution, and a programme to develop it, further deterioration in its condition must be expected.</P>
    <P>At a future date I shall delve more fully into this report but I felt I should show my abhorrence at the decrease of £195,000 in the amount given to the National Museum in view of this very honest and sincere report of the board of visitors.</P>
    <P>I refer very briefly to the rather generous benefits given under the social welfare code in the budget but it has been brought to my attention time and again that where British or Northern Ireland pensioners here receive increases to compensate for the cost of living, such increases often end with a deduction being made in their benefits from the Department of Social Welfare.  This is totally unfair.  These increases given from England or Northern Ireland are for the purpose of keeping them level with the cost of living and to penalise them by reducing their benefits from the Department of Social Welfare here is quite unfair.</P>
    <P>We had hoped that some allowance or concession would be given to artists but I looked in vain for it in the Minister's statement.  Last year we had a very fine report from Irish Marketing Surveys Limited on living and working conditions for artists.  One would have hoped that the Minister for Finance could in some way have given artists access to social security.  Unfortunately, there is no mention of it.  I hope to return to this at a later date but I felt it was worth mentioning at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Killilea) Mark (Jnr.) Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Killilea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that most critics of the budget now <Col N="1370" /> agree that the first impressions of it were wrong.  After the first day, and particularly after the second and third days after the budget people wrongly interpreted it but now over the weekends that have elapsed since the budget it has become very clear to most sections of the community that in-built in the budget were a number of major priorities.  The Government's first priority in framing the budget was to promote economic growth.  The second priority that has emerged very strongly is the effort in the budget to increase employment.  A further priority which perhaps was not as obvious as the other two was the commitment of the Government and the Minister for Finance to look after the interests of the weaker sections of the community.  It is perhaps fair to say that these points did not emerge clearly at the beginning of the budget debate.  Again, perhaps not as obvious because it has not been spoken about in detail, there was the Government's commitment to the farming community. It is on those points that I wish to comment before I deal with certain aspects of the Department for which I am responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government set out what they intend to do in their 1981 investment plan under which £1,700 million will be spent on capital investment projects here this year.  This will bring about an improvement in the country's basic services such as energy supply, roads, telecommunications, water supplies and harbours.  I think I should in fairness comment on what the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Moore, said.  I should like to reiterate his statement that this was a golden opportunity for banking organisations and for the trade union movement to make an investment in the country.  I am delighted that the Government have given them that opportunity in this plan.  I am optimistic that the amount expected from the private sector under that plan will be of significance and will provide the first opportunity of changing times and finances so that the burdens of the development of the country will not rest solely on the taxpayers.  This seems a sound and logical way to tackle our problems.  A <Col N="1371" /> sum that is not enormous is being asked of the private sector.  I think the money is available if we make the investment sufficiently attractive for them and there is no reason why it should not be attractive.</P>
    <P>Apart from the substantial increase in employment which will result from it the plan itself will provide directly about 10,000 extra jobs most of which will be in the building and construction industry. From what I have said it will be seen that the Government are committed to ensuring an expanded programme of infrastructural services in order further to stimulate economic development.  This is very important because that is Government business.  The important role of the budget is to create the infrastructure for the continuing programme, for example, of the IDA, for people already in industry who want to expand, for the community at large, for the building of houses, for transport and farm work and for telecommunication services which play a most important part nowadays.</P>
    <P>Housing has been spoken about today and on many other occasions in the House.  Provision for housing capital expenditure in 1981 at £242 million represents an increase of 33 per cent on the original provision of £183 million for 1980.  The 1981 provision shows an increase of 34 per cent in real terms compared with 1977.  Expenditure between 1975 and 1977 dropped by 57 per cent in real terms.  New house completions in 1980 reached an all-time record.  Completions increased from 24,000 in 1976 to 24,500 in 1977, to 25,400 in 1978, to 26,500 in 1979.  Private new house completions in 1980 are estimated at over 21,700 and are also a record.  As regards my own county, Galway, in the case of housing loans and grants and SDA low-rise mortgages we have increased from 1977 from a figure of £800,000 made available to the county council and £53,000 made available to Galway Corporation to this year's figures of £2,815,000 to Galway County Council and £180,000 to Galway Corporation. Every Deputy here could break down the allocation for his own county, but it is <Col N="1372" /> important to recognise that there is almost £1 million of an increase in that figure alone.  Last year's figure of £50,000 to Galway Corporation has been increased to £180,000, which in itself is an astronomical figure.</P>
    <P>The building industry is, of course, a key industry, being the second largest employer in the country.  The health of this industry is, therefore, vital to the well-being of the whole economy.  Under our investment plan, building activity will increase on a wide front.  Employment in the industry will be increased, as well as in related industries and services.  This Government will not allow the building industry to sink into the doldrums, as the Coalition Government did when they were in office, allowing public capital investment, output and employment in the industry to fall.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to say that the one sector to realise the philosophy behind this budget was the building construction sector, which gave it a wholesome welcome following on the recognition of its real purpose.  That was the turning point, after the first impressions of the budget, in getting people to realise just what the budget was achieving.</P>
    <P>Other provisions aiding the building industry include £98.5 million for the house purchase and low rise mortgage scheme &mdash; an increase of 44 per cent on last year &mdash; and a proposal to introduce a new special allowance of 100 per cent which would be set against rental income in respect of expenditure incurred in the construction of moderate-cost rented residential accommodation.  Here again, this is a proper philosophy.  The Government is giving a welcome opportunity to private enterprise to move into the important area of giving relief to our growing population who urgently need housing. The times have changed very drastically from not alone ten years ago, but five years ago.</P>
    <P>The increased allocation for roads has almost shocked the Opposition, who do not believe the increases that the Government have allocated.  The question to the Minister produced a figure which they have not yet got over.  During the weeks previous to the budget most Opposition <Col N="1373" /> speakers spent most of their time at council meetings and other fora alleging that this Government did not have &mdash; and this was alleged in my county council &mdash; the price of a single bag of cement &mdash; the old phrase, &ldquo;You have not got a shovel and you have not got a man to carry a shovel&rdquo;. While they were old catchphrases they were true in this instance, and the allocation of this grant-in-aid to the roads section was certainly most welcome.  My own county in 1981 received £3,140,000 and Galway Corporation received £753,000, to be exact, a total of £3,900,000, practically £4 million, compared with last year's figure of £2.3 million. This alleviates any problems concerning roadworkers and those employed under this service can rest easy in the knowledge that an abundance of money is being given to them, an abundance of money to develop an infrastructure not alone in my county but throughout the country.  This service is of the highest importance and the needs of the community can be met.  One can say, with optimism, that not in one or two years, but certainly in three, with this type of expenditure, our road networks programme should be exemplary.</P>
    <P>Sanitary services I need not go into. Again here, the Government have not been lacking and have given freely.  This service has been highlighted in recent years and, particularly, in recent months. By giving adequate water and sewerage facilities, we attract industry and in this connection this increase is most welcome. Water supplies are also important to our agricultural businesses which will benefit from the increased expenditure.</P>
    <P>I come now to my earlier point regarding social welfare allowances.  I do not have to deal with this subject in depth but the Government are committed to weaker sections of the community &mdash; the old age pensioners and numerous people who rely on payments from the health boards and the DPMA scheme.  The increase allocated to the disabled by the Minister for Finance was most creditable and shows to our people and to all that the commitment of this Government to the weaker sections of the community has not been forgotten.  We need only look <Col N="1374" /> at the records of this year, last year and the other years since we took up office, by comparison with the performance of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker mentioned the income tax bands.  Here again, the Government were very realistic in giving almost £90 million in one full financial year.  That is no mean figure, particularly when we take into account the financial constraints on the economy due to the enormous pressures brought about from outside, especially the recession in world trade, high price increases and numerous other causes.  While this increase was praiseworthy, one cannot forget that, in addition, the Government negotiated and paid last autumn a 14 per cent wage increase to our workers and taxpayers. The commentators on the budget outside this House and, to be fair, to a lesser extent within this House, never acknowledged this at all.  The workers have a national wage agreement under their belt and were free movers.  This point was not mentioned when they gave their deliberations on television, radio or in the national press.</P>
    <P>This weekend, I noticed a categorical statement made by Deputy Keating of the Fine Gael party in Mayo, I think &mdash; and indeed, I have heard it mentioned in the secret tunnels and the different places around my constituency and in this city &mdash; that there was too much Government expenditure this year.  It is appropriate that we should ask the Leader and the members of the front bench of the Fine Gael Party to sit down this week and explain, not particularly to me but to the rest of the community, that statement of their front bench spokesman.  What exactly did they mean by this statement? Did they mean, for example, that we should cut the teachers' pay, or the Garda pay or the social welfare allowances?  Did it mean that we should cut the allocation to the building industry and the telephones programme, that we should cut the allocation to the county councils, as regards roads, water, sewerage, that we should cut the allocation of money to the IDA?  How do they believe that the, in their own words, excessive expenditure by the Government should be cut back? <Col N="1375" /> They should tell the Irish people precisely what they mean by that statement.  Perhaps they mean what Deputy Kelly said here last week.  It is a special matter and I will deal with it later.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Fine Gael are telling us we should go back to the old days of embargoes on recruitment to the Public Service, on wage increases so that wages would stay in line with inflation, on conciliation and arbitration procedures.  I should like them to explain to the nation precisely what they mean by what they are saying. For instance, I should like Deputy Keating to explain the precise meaning of what he is alleged to have been saying through the media in recent days.  I am amazed that Deputy Garret FitzGerald has not rushed into the House to explain the difference between what he said and what one of his spokesmen said, and what they meant to say to the decent people of Mayo at the weekend.  I am sure the people of Mayo were as confused as I was at the reports of the two speeches.  I beg of him to come in and explain that point.</P>
    <P>Now I will turn to farming, about which there has been much controversy.  I acknowledge, as every Member of the House does, the severe difficulties farmers have been going through.  However, it is not good enough for Deputies to offer only sympathy to them, because sympathy will not help them to rear their children or to settle their bills or to finance their development programmes. There was acknowledgement of that in the budget and it will cost the Exchequer £35 million in 1981.  The suspension of the disease levies will mean an increase of ½p per gallon on milk and £3 per head on cattle going to slaughter.  These changes will put £10 million directly into farmers' pockets.  There will be full tax relief in respect of increase in stock value, and the two payments dates arrangement for income tax will be continued for a further year.</P>
    <P>These reliefs will reach out directly to most of the farming community and this is most welcome because of the direct aid it gives to farmers.  In view of the difficult income position of farmers, the Government have decided to introduce reliefs on <Col N="1376" /> agricultural rates liable this year.  This will involve full relief from rates in the case of farmers with land valuations of less than £50, and 50 per cent relief for farmers with valuations of between £50 and £70.  This will reduce farmers' rates bills by about £19.6 million.</P>
    <P>For a moment I will look at the position this creates for County Galway farmers specifically.  We are now giving total rates remission to 16,751 farmers in County Galway and 50 per cent relief to a further 384 farmers, leaving a balance of 316 farmers in that county who will have to pay full rates.  I have not seen any of the Galway Deputies rising here to compliment the Minister for this tremendous benefit, again directly affecting the pockets of farmers in the county.  I suggest that individual Deputies should look at these figures in the context of the counties they represent so that the reality of the benefits will be appreciated.</P>
    <P>Of course one would have liked to have done more for the farmers, but one is optimistic of the outcome of the negotiations which the Minister for Agriculture is at present engaged in.  These are all direct aids to farmers unlike the Coalition days when any aids to farmers were indirect, coming through middlemen who scooped most of the cream before the benefits reached the farmers.  I admit there was a recession partly outside the control of the then Government, but what is the difference between that recession and the one we are now enduring?</P>
    <P>There were other benefits given to farmers throughout last year's difficult period, like the £1 per kilo for lamb and the £1.7 per kilo for mutton.  The Minister for Agriculture at all times has said that the income of farmers would be maintained and not dropped if at all possible. We enter a new year with high hopes that when the Brussels deal has been finalised it will be of direct benefit to the farming community, especially the small farmers, those in need of further help particularly.</P>
    <P>The land reform programme announced by the Minister for Agriculture is most welcome, bringing land structures right up to modern times from the point of view of sale and distribution of our greatest national asset.  It is our hope <Col N="1377" /> that the White Paper will bear fruit before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I should like to add a few comments on fisheries, a subject that will interest Deputy White particularly.  The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry is available to speak to the fishermen about their problems but the archaic laws of many years ago are not adequate for present conditions. A valuable scientific input has been made by the universities and others interested in marine aquaculture and the law needs to be updated in order to enable the development of, for instance, oyster beds and other shellfish-based industries. The Minister is aware of this need and I am sure he will take steps to deal with it.</P>
    <P>A significant move made by the Government last year was the arrangement by them of reduced interest loans for agriculture to the amount of £100 million. This fact seems to have been forgotten by many people.  This Government have faced up to their responsibilities and we are lucky to have a man of the calibre, intelligence and understanding of the present Minister for Agriculture, Deputy MacSharry.</P>
    <P>In so far as my own Department are concerned, I can say that since our appointment both the Minister and myself have devoted ourselves to improving the services provided by the Department. I have never denied that there is room for improvement in the service, nor have I ever tried to mislead the public as to what is required to improve the service. We have set ourselves the objective of bringing the standard of our telephone service up to EEC levels and in order to do this we have embarked on an ambitious five-year programme, the first year of which has just recently been completed.</P>
    <P>Firstly, the Government are determined to implement the five-year programme, which as we all know will cost millions of pounds over the five years. The Government are committed to this programme and will make the necessary capital available.  Evidence of the Government's commitment can be seen in the fact that last year we spent £123.4 million on developing the service and this year £220 million have been allocated for this <Col N="1378" /> purpose.  Of this £220 million, £100 million will be raised from private sources. This will further ensure the availability of capital for our programme.</P>
    <P>The European Investment Bank has provided loan finance for investment in telecommunications development on seven occasions since 1973.  Loan finance approved totals almost £175 million, including £75 million for the seventh telecommunications loan project.  Agreements were signed yesterday for the transfer of the latest instalment &mdash; some £25 million &mdash; of the seventh loan to the Exchequer.  The loans received from the European Investment Bank emphasise the Government's priority commitment to extending and modernising Ireland's productive infrastructural base, as set out clearly in the recently published investment plan for 1981.</P>
    <P>The work to be financed by the European Investment Bank loan includes the connection of 86,000 new telephone subscribers and 2,200 new telex subscribers, provision of new electronic and electro-mechanical exchange equipment, expansion of the trunk system by provision of micro-wave radio and cable links and the provision of new buildings at about 50 locations.  These works form part of the Government's programme to expand and improve the telecommunications system throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In recent times there has been criticism in this House and in the media generally of the fact that we installed over 62,000 telephones last year, without ensuring a corresponding improvement in the telephone network which has to cater for all of these additional subscribers.  Wild allegations and statements have been made by Opposition Deputies and Senators. Early last year they said it was lunacy to think that we could install 62,000 new telephones but when at the end of the year they realised that this goal was being achieved they changed their tactic and said that while new telephones were being installed the service was deteriorating. Of course that was not the case. In their original criticism they thought that we had not made provision for 2,500 circuits, a complete new building programme <Col N="1379" /> and the transfer from manual exchanges to automatic working.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that at the beginning of last year the morale of staff within the Department was at a very low ebb, yet not once throughout the year did any member of the Opposition utter any word of praise of the work done by them in such difficult circumstances.  I felt this more than anyone because I was dealing with staff throughout the year and I saw their morale rise day by day.  In January last year 300 new telephones were installed in Dublin city but by December the figure was in excess of 5,000.  That point was missed by the Opposition and by the commentators.  The staff of the Department have the willingness and the ability to meet the targets set for them and they look forward to the challenge during the coming year.  In the first half of last year they needed guidance and a clear indication of where we are going and it behoves the Opposition to congratulate them on their achievements. Instead wild allegations were made as if nothing were being done and I knew that such allegations would ricochet off the staff at the end of the day.  However, they stood firm and met their targets and I offer them my sincere congratulations.</P>
    <P>Just to give an idea of what the programme was: for a start over 100 buildings have been completed, construction is in progress on 142 others, and it is expected work will begin on 184 more in the course of this year.  Some £27.5 million was spent last year on sites and buildings and the amount this year is expected to be of the order of £60 million.  The provision of buildings is of course a first essential towards improving the service.</P>
    <P>Twenty manual telephone exchanges were converted to automatic working last year and 61 new exchanges were opened or existing ones extended at many centres.  This year we plan to convert 60 exchanges to automatic working.  That is about one exchange per week.</P>
    <P>A major new trunk exchange was brought into use at Adelaide Road in Dublin and will be brought fully into use over the next six months or so.  In addition to its capacity to switch trunk call <Col N="1380" /> traffic, this exchange will enable substantial quantities of additional trunk circuits to be brought into use in and out of Dublin, and will ease the congestion experienced on numbers of the new routes out of and into Dublin.  Further relief of congestion will occur when a second exchange being installed at present is brought into service later this year and when a third exchange, which is on order, is installed next year.  This year will see many new trunk exchanges being installed at several key centres throughout the country.  These, when in use, will have a major impact on the trunk service.</P>
    <P>The national network has been further improved by the provision of some 2,500 additional trunk circuits on a number of routes, between some of the bigger exchanges in Dublin and on routes such as Cork-Midleton, Carlow-Kilkenny, Sligo-Manorhamilton and Achill-Castle-bar. This year about 5,000 new trunk circuits will be brought into use.  Major routes to benefit include the Cross Channel one, Dublin-Sligo and Dublin-Ark-low, which are being brought into service at the present moment.  These will be followed during the year by substantial additional numbers of circuits on a number of major routes as well as on a host of somewhat smaller but nevertheless quite important routes.</P>
    <P>As a result of the provision of the new exchanges and trunk circuits that I have referred to, a welcome improvement in the quality of the trunk service is becoming evident now and should become much more pronounced in the second half of the year.  The public are becoming aware of this and it puts a stay on the allegations of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>It should be clear from what I have said that we are providing for expansion of the network side by side with the installation of additional telephones.  The 62,000 additional subscribers brought into the network last year were catered for at centres where there was spare capacity available in the system.</P>
    <P>Other ways of improving service to our customers are in hands, such as the pressurising of large subscriber cables to prevent damage by flooding, and the re-organisation of our fault handling systems. <Col N="1381" /> A computerised directory inquiry service will commence in Dublin soon and will be extended to many parts of the country during the year.</P>
    <P>Within the next few months, too, a new telex exchange at present being installed in Dublin will be opened.  This, with sub-exchanges being opened in a number of centres throughout the country, will provide the necessary exchange capacity to meet telex applications for several years ahead.  The business community will clearly benefit from this.  The Department will be helped in achieving more telex connections by the use of new carrier systems to be delivered later this year.  One of the problems in providing telex services has been that the necessary cable had not been available.  The new carrier systems will allow for the installation of telex machines by superimposing a telex line on an existing telephone line without interfering with telephone service.  When delivered in the second half of this year these systems will enable telex service to be provided to applicants who cannot get service at present because of lack of cabling.  This is a very welcome innovation.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, trunk calls from public telephone kiosks in automatic areas have to be obtained at present via an operator.  This is not altogether satisfactory from the callers' viewpoint as well as being costly in the time of the operators handling these calls.  It is proposed to introduce later this month new telephone systems in public kiosks from which it will be possible to dial trunk calls.  One thousand of the new coinbox telephones will be installed intially in the more heavily used kiosks but will be extended over the next two years to all public telephone installations.  These will be available too for renting to users where they opt for this type.  The use of these new payphones, as they are described, will help to raise efficiency and reduce costs in course of time.</P>
    <P>We have been conscious, too, of the difficulties that, with rising costs, some of the less well-off telephone subscribers have in paying their quarterly telephone accounts.  To ease their problems it is proposed to introduce shortly a telephone <Col N="1382" /> account stamp system which will enable them to save-as-they-go towards the cost of meeting their telephone accounts.  I would hope that this would be helpful to numbers of subscribers and ease a social problem.  I would appeal to all subscribers who find difficulty in paying their quarterly bills, to old age pensioners and to housewives to include this new stamp on their weekly shopping list and use this new facility which will shortly be available at all post offices.  I look forward to seeing this facility being used to its full potential.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of any large nationwide organisation like the telecommunications service is clearly influenced by the structure of the organisation and, in particular, on how close decision-making is to the user of the service.  A review of the organisation of the telecommunications service has been undertaken and the conclusion has been reached that it would be beneficial to make substantial changes in the existing structure involving transfer of work and responsibility from headquarters in Dublin to a number of provincial centres and a re-organisation of the local staffing structure designed to give a better co-ordinated service to customers in meeting their needs.  Discussions have begun with the staff interests on the changes proposed.  It will take time to implement some of what is proposed as it will, for example, involve substantial extension of computer operation to deal with telephone account inquiries, but it should be possible to make worthwhile progress in at least some aspects even in advance of the establishment of the State-sponsored body that will take over the operation of the service.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned here only the more important aspects of our achievements to date and our plans for the future.  A lot of work remains to be done &mdash; we are only now entering the second year of a five year programme &mdash; but I can assure this House and the general public that no aspect of the service and no area of the country is being neglected.</P>
    <P>The telecommunications service is big business.  I welcome this aspect of it.  In the budget we were asked, as a Department with a broad base and the ability to <Col N="1383" /> do the job, to pay our way.  It is only right that those who have the service should be asked to pay their way and not be dependent, as they were in the past, on the taxpayers who had not this facility but who paid for it.  It was significant to me in the budget that the Minister for Finance asked those who can pay to pay their way.  I am sure the public at large realise that the Department are giving a service.  A large amount of money is being ploughed into the department to give as efficient a service as possible.  I believe the Department could pay their way.  One could imagine in some years' time the Department being a big profit earner.  It should be the number one company in the country as an earner for the State and for those who have invested money in the Department.  I believe this will happen provided the necessary finance is provided to carry out this five year programme.  Perhaps the programme will be completed in less than five years.</P>
    <P>In addition to the heavy capital investment involved the telecommunications service employs about 17,000 staff directly as well as supporting some thousands more in the building industry and in firms supplying equipment, goods and services to the Department.  The investment to be made in the service this year alone will enable some 2,000 more to be given employment in the Department. While it is hard to quantify reliably the extra employment that will be generated in industry by the programme it is believed it will be of the order of 2,000 in the construction industry and a further 400 in industries supplying goods and services to the Department this year. That is our outlook for 1981.  This is a substantial further benefit to the economy, additional to that which will result from improving the quality and the availability of the telephone service.</P>
    <P>The Department have been concerned to increase employment opportunity at home to the maximum extent practicable and to create an environment in which manufacturers of electronics and other high technology-based products are encouraged to set up.  For example, the <Col N="1384" /> two agreements for the supply of digital telephone exchanges provide for their manufacture in this country giving rise not only to employment directly in these industries but also encouraging the manufacture here of other high technology equipment.  The Department buy substantial quantities of stores for use in the telephone development programme almost half of which are imported.  In an effort to stimulate the home manufacture of at least some of these stores the Department displayed this range of stores in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Donegal, Longford and other centres throughout the country.  We are very hopeful that this will lead to at least some of that money being kept at home and thus provide good employment.</P>
    <P>I believe our idea is the correct one.  I want to take this opportunity to encourage those who wish to know what they can do or what contribution they can make towards that programme to contact the Department.  We will let them know specifically what they can do.  We will show them in our stores the quality and type of article which we need and have to import.  The programme has been very successful to date with significant contracts being given at home but there is still a long way to go.  I want to encourage industrialists to have another look at what we have on offer.  Every £ we can keep at home and give to them is money well spent.</P>
    <P>The postal service has sometimes been seen as a stagnant service but this is not the case.  Traffic has grown progressively over the years.  The volume of mails has doubled over the past 40 years.  The number of agency transactions at post office centre counters has doubled in the last 20 years.  Further growth of business must be expected, particularly as a major postal development is now planned.  This programme will comprise the introduction of new services and a greater marketing effort of the existing services.  The nationwide post office network offers a ready made base for the transaction of business throughout the country.  Financial services operating in conjunction with the post office savings bank, are particularly suitable for handling in this <Col N="1385" /> way.  The giro services are operated profitably by post offices in many other countries throughout the world.  Economic development over the past 20 years has greatly increased the number and variety of payments of goods and services by the average household.  Many of those payments, particularly by persons who have not got bank accounts, are still made in cash.  However, more and more transactions are being paid for by credit transfers of one form or another.</P>
    <P>The development of telecommunications is strengthening this trend.  All of the existing financial institutions are conscious of this trend and are seeking to benefit from it.  The post office is no exception.  Giro is one system which can take advantage of this trend.  It is an efficient means of getting bills paid, sending money and receiving pay.  It also provides an alternative service to the commercial banks and helps to reduce the amount of cash in circulation.  The examination of the feasibility of giro shows it can be profitably provided here.  The post office could readily meet the challenge of introducing it.</P>
    <P>Then we have the other aspect, high speed delivery.  Mail services are to be developed by catering for the special needs of large scale users such as mail order firms and direct mail advertisements and by the development of specialised services related to the needs of different users.  Expansion in these areas will lead to a greater rate of return from the mail's infrastructure and from the staff resources employed.  Among the specialised areas there may be scope for expansion in the area of high speed conveyance and delivery services.  This is the area in which the great challenge to the traditional mail service arises.  The developing telecommunications sector and the increasing value of time in all businesses and economic transactions creates a pressure within a relatively small part of the mail market for a quicker service.  We are looking at ways of meeting this need.  We expect to be able to make an announcement of our findings in the very near future.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to undertake postal building works in a number of <Col N="1386" /> centres throughout the country.  The need arises primarily from the inadequacy of existing postal buildings in these centres.  They lack the space and facilities necessary for an efficient postal operation. The buildings also are not capable of meeting the increased demand on them resulting from a postal development programme.  Arrangements are being made to provide new or extended buildings in the most urgent of these cases.</P>
    <P>This budget faces up to our problems and points the way forward out of our present difficulties.  It gives assistance where assistance is needed, but not as much as we would have liked.  It is an indication that the Government are committed to giving assistance where it is needed.  The message has come through to the public at large that there were four major priorities in the budget.  Day by day we see the turnabout in the original comments made on the budget.  It provides the right formula for the needs and the circumstances of our young and growing population.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few comments on the budget and I will be as brief as possible.  The first area on which I should like to comment &mdash; and the Minister of State commented on it at some lenght &mdash; is the agricultural industry and the farming community.  I have with me some reports which bear out something I have been talking about for a very long time.  I have before me the report of the Irish Livestock and Meat Board which says that the exports of live cattle in 1980 were 45 per cent higher than they were in 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people might consider that a good thing, but it must be considered in the context of the Fianna Fáil manifesto which stated clearly and unambiguously that we would process all our food.  Our live exports have gone up by 45 per cent and our meat factories are closing down because of a shortage of cattle.  Therefore something has gone radically wrong with that bold statement in the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  Something serious has happened in the meantime.  It is common knowledge that meat factories are closing <Col N="1387" /> down for many reasons.  The principal reason is a shortage of cattle.  It is not a shortage of markets.  It is not that they are unable to compete.  They just cannot get cattle.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons why our herd diminished by 450,000 head last year. The estimates in all the reports are that this decline will continue.  In those circumstances I cannot agree with anyone who suggests that our agricultural industry is being looked after and dealt with properly.  If we want to create employment from our agricultural industry this is most important.  The agricultural industry is very important not only to people directly employed in it, but also to people in the spin-off industries.  Before the redundancies started, over 1,000 people in my constituency were employed in the meat processing industry.  We know that the meat factory in Grand Canal Street has closed because of a shortage of cattle. The meat factories in my constituency, in Tipperary, in Monaghan and all over the country are closing because of a shortage of live cattle.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Gibbons was Minister for Agriculture I pointed out to him that unless something was done to stop the export of calves we would be in difficulty. Anybody who knows the agricultural industry knows that this has being going on for the past three years.  I do not often quote figures but in this report I have the figure for the increase in the export of calves.  At that time there was an explanation as to why they were being exported.  There was a subsidy in Italy on these calves.  The least I expected for the farming community in this budget was a substantial subsidy on calves to protect our industry and the workers in it, and to enable the mature beef beast to survive. We know they are not available now and we know why.  Nothing has been done in that regard.  Any Deputy who allows such a situation to arise does not deserve to be Minister for Agriculture.  I am not talking about farmers only.  I am talking about people employed in what should be our best processing industry.  Yet, in their manifesto Fianna Fáil said we would <Col N="1388" /> process all our own food.  It is evident that no attempt is being made to do this.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the amount of capital being provided according to the Capital Programme published a few days before the budget.  The provision for agriculture is substantially less than it was in the previous year.  Attempts have been made to explain this away by saying fewer people will be looking for farm modernisation grants this year.  I accept that. Because people were persuaded by advisers to make big outlays and to avail of grants they borrowed money at 10 or 11 per cent and now find they have to pay 17 or 18 per cent.  Because of the static position of their industry they cannot make their repayments.</P>
    <P>These were modern and progressive farmers who were prepared to borrow and spend money.  Now they find themselves looking for maintenance from health boards and so on.  They spent the money and they are now unable to make their repayments.  We hear much talk about plans for interest subsidies but, so far as I know, no definite plan has been put forward.  Because these people were progressive, because they borrowed to take advantage of the potential output of their industry, they are now being crucified.</P>
    <P>Farmers have lost confidence and are reluctant to proceed with schemes so there will be less demand for the farm modernisation scheme.  They are unable to meet the increased rates of interest. We are told we can expect a great deal from Europe.  I hope that is the case, because if not our primary industry, which employs 40 per cent of the people, is in serious trouble.  We will be in serious difficulty if the terms of the packet &mdash; there is more in a packet than price increases &mdash; which comes from Europe does not give substantial relief in this area.  In negotiating a deal the Minister must ensure that it will no longer be profitable for people to bring cattle across the Border.  This is happening, as those involved in meat processing have stated. With the way the EEC works it can take a long time to get action, but it is up to the Minister to act as quickly as possible. People can bring cattle across the Border <Col N="1389" /> and gain £100 per head.  We must stop that so that the meat processing industry can survive.</P>
    <P>Herd numbers are down.  We allowed our calves to be exported to countries within the EEC which provided subsidies for calf rearing.  We have no such scheme of our own.  In Carlow we had a vegetable processing plant, Erin Foods.  They have given notice to the workers that they are closing down in a month or two.  The Minister for Agriculture wrote to me and said he noted the decision of Comhlucht Siúcre Éireann to close the plant but that he was sure every effort would be made by the IDA to put jobs into Carlow to take up the slack created by the 200 people who will be made redundant.  If that is the attitude of the Minister to the food processing industry, I take a poor view of it.  We have a State company which has given valuable employment and now it has to close down for want of sales organisation. The farmers who supplied under contract in that area never welched on their contracts.  Every target set by Erin Foods was met by the work force.  Either they were producing a product that was not marketable or we did not have any idea of the way to market it.  The decision to close down has been accepted by the Government.  As spokesman for agriculture in my party, I condemn the budget out of hand because there is nothing in it to solve our serious problems.  The Minister knows what is necessary, but on the agricultural issue the budget stands condemned.</P>
    <P>The most important problems facing us are unemployment, the rate of inflation and prices.  There is nothing in the Minister's statement that will create employment.  I know what has been said about the creation of jobs and so on, but there is nothing in the budget to do this. I am an ordinary man and not one to talk about the various aspects of finance, but as far as I can see a child of ten going to school could have written the budget. There was an increase in direct taxation on three items that are in no way original. They have been taxed ever since I was a child.  To tax cigarettes, beer and petrol is an easy way to raise money.  The amount used for the relief of PAYE tax <Col N="1390" /> was negligible and was only barely what was guaranteed under the national understanding.  Social welfare benefits were improved and I acknowledge that. However, Fianna Fáil have been in power for most of the life of the State and never once did they do what is so badly needed in social welfare and that is reduce the qualifying age for old age pension and retirement pension.  If a decent retirement pension was given to workers who had the required number of stamps, people would be encouraged to retire and make way for younger people to get employment.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil adhered to the 70 years qualifying age.  Indeed, they have adhered to that for almost 40 years.  Yet when they were relieved of Government by the National Coalition there was a four years' reduction in the qualifying age effected in four years.  It must be remembered that the qualifying age has to be reduced by one year only to be in line with the rest of Europe.  It is even more important to reduce the retirement age in order to encourage people to retire when they reach 60, if it were brought into line with the old age pension qualifying age.  But Fianna Fáil will not do that kind of thing.</P>
    <P>Neither do they want to hear anything about the poverty existing in our community. Last year they made their greatest blunder ever in winding up the Combat Poverty Committee which was comprised of professional and religious people who were concerned with nothing else but the alleviation of poverty.  Fianna Fáil in effect disbanded that committee. They said the work would continue but they did not want these people criticising Fianna Fáil or any Government.  Therefore there is that type of attitude even with regard to social welfare.</P>
    <P>I started off by saying that the question of employment was one of the most important facing this community.  Certainly the figures released last evening support what I am saying.  They constitute an all-time high for unemployment in this state &mdash; 125,000 able-bodied people offering themselves for work who cannot get any.  Yet we have nothing to say to them nor is there any hope of an <Col N="1391" /> offer of any kind of employment for them.  We are all aware that we are now within three months of another 40,000 coming onto the labour market when the school term closes in June next.  People talk about plans but there is nothing that I can ascertain in the budget that will tackle that problem.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the former Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, said publicly in a radio interview &mdash; I was listening to it &mdash; that any Government during whose term of office unemployment exceeded 100,000 deserved to go out. That was his statement and it was quoted recently on another radio programme to a former Minister, Deputy Martin O'Donoghue, who promised in this House full employment by 1982.  Of course, nobody takes Fianna Fáil promises seriously any longer, particularly bearing in mind that kind of record of 125,000 registered unemployed.  These are people who have been accepted as genuinely entitled to benefit.  From representations made to me by people who feel they are entitled to benefit and are not receiving it, I believe there must be at least another 20,000 people going to labour exchanges.</P>
    <P>There is an all-time high record of people on short-time.  We are all aware of factories in our constituencies on short-time, if not ready to close.  There are 10,000 people now on short-time, bringing the total figure to 135,000 people who are at least partially unemployed.  By the time the 40,000 or so school leavers come onto the unemployemnt market in June next, unless there is some Government policy to commence public works or some other activity we will have then a situation of some 200,000 unemployed, double the figure at which the former Taoiseach said nobody deserved to be in Government.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words now about health.  The Minister appears to be becoming a television and radio star.  At least I cannot turn on either without having him there in person, even perhaps singing a song &mdash; and a nice singer he is. But that holds no merit if there is insufficient money provided for essential <Col N="1392" /> health services.  I know it may be a political advantage, and he has been masquerading on seven different programmes within the past fortnight.  I do not know who he has a leg of in RTE but he is certainly getting some publicity, and fair play to him.  I have had some experience in health committees in my constituency of the way unfortunate people are trying to carry on, people who have six, seven and up to ten certificates sent into the Department of Social Welfare without receiving any reply.  Every Deputy in this House knows of these people because they are coming to us in their hundreds.</P>
    <P>The scheme introduced by Deputy Frank Cluskey gave people the right to receive money from the health boards in certain circumstances by way of what are known as supplementary welfare allowances. However, genuine beneficiaries cannot even find the people who are supposed to give it to them, because they are hiding, and the health boards have not sufficient money to do so.  That is the truth.  It is not something that anybody would want to make political capital of. I was speaking to a woman last evening whose husband worked for some 25 years without a break.  Almost a year ago he became ill.  He had been receiving social welfare benefit regularly but for some reason, best known to somebody in one of their offices here in Dublin, he received no money for the past two weeks and he has been unable to locate the health board officer who should give him the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance merely to keep body and soul together.  At least it would be something for himself his wife and six children.  If that example is not indicative of no progress in the Department of Social Welfare I do not know what it is.</P>
    <P>I spoke in the House against the motion to increase the price of petrol. That was the only motion in regard to increases against which I spoke because I feel that if something is a luxury then it is legitimate to tax it, provided always that one does something useful with the money so yielded.  I accept that the provision of increased social welfare benefits constitutes a legitimate reason for taxing <Col N="1393" /> luxuries.  However, an increase of 15p on the gallon of petrol does not constitute a tax on luxuries.  Rather is it a tax on one of the most essential commodities for the greater proportion of the population.</P>
    <P>I have spoken here before about unfortunate people from my constituency who commute regularly on a round journey of 50 to 60 miles.  The Taoiseach answered my statement on that evening by saying that such people could motor less and save a little.  Possibly that is true.  Despite several appeals to Ministers for Finance in this House these people get absolutely no tax allowance for the increase in the cost of their going to and from home to work.  This should be done.  Case after case has been made here.  If a man takes out his car to drive 30 or 40 miles to and from work he should be entitled to a tax allowance on the cost of that car and on the cost of the petrol.  But there is no allowance for that and the Minister for Finance and the Government are well aware of these people's problems.</P>
    <P>In their manifesto Fianna Fáil promised these people that they would take the tax off cars, but in this budget they put 15p per gallon on petrol.  That is very substantial.  In many cases the increase is so substantial that the people concerned would be better off financially if they stayed home from work and drew unemployment benefit.  That is a sad thing to have to say, but it is a fact.  These people go to work because they want to and they feel it is better for them to be in a job and working than to be at home on the unemployment list.  But if they were wise or careless and did not want to work they would stay at home, because when one takes into account the upkeep of a car, the increase in the cost of petrol and the increases in social welfare benefits they would be better off financially if they stayed at home and did not work at all. I sincerely ask the Minister to give these people in the Finance Bill, tax relief on what it is costing them to travel to work. They have not got one penny of tax relief, but if they were employed by a big company that supplied a company car they would have a tax allowance for that.  But there is nothing for the ordinary worker.</P>
    <P>That is the standard of a careless Minister <Col N="1394" /> just adding up figures.  Why anybody would want to sit down for months and months to prepare a budget statement like that I do not know.  There were the ordinary increases that we have been getting for the last 50 years.  There was not one bit of imagination about the whole budget.  The previous Minister, now our commissioner in Europe, told us last year that there would be a 10 per cent drop in our borrowing for the current year.  We know that that did not work out and we are given many reasons why it did not work out.  But we know there was a rise to 14 per cent.  Now we have the Minister coming in here on budget day and telling us he is going to reduce it this year to 13 per cent.  Who is the Minister codding? We know from the Estimates that there will not be enough money.  We had the example of the Minister for Education coming in here last week and, in answer to a question, telling us he was going to increase by 10 per cent the amount payable to voluntary schools per pupil.  We also know that in the Book of Estimates it cannot be discovered where that increase is, so we know that more than likely Supplementary Estimates will be coming in before October to meet this. We know the figures given by the Minister are just farce.  We know there will not be enough and that borrowing has to increase a lot more than 13 per cent.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker spoke about the £35 million being granted to reduce rates. I expect that that may bring the benefits he describes to the people in his constituency. But the £35 million provided to take the rates off the land will be met in large part by the payment of tax, because farmers were allowed to set off the rates against the payment of tax.  Therefore, for a lot of farmers this reduction in the rate load means nothing at all because they were allowed to write it off against their tax.</P>
    <P>It is fairly evident that, despite what may be said or what may be thought, the budget did not tackle any of the real problems.  There must be some straight talking done here by somebody.  Fianna Fáil have no notion of doing that because there is no way they can reduce borrowing. I am willing to predict here and now <Col N="1395" /> that the amount borrowed for current expenditure will be increased.  Despite the fact that the Minister insists he is going to cut back on public spending, he will have to bring in Supplementary Estimates. He will have to borrow a good deal more than he did last year.  Anyone who has done any study of the situation knows that is true.  They are putting off the evil day until after the election.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is right or not, but in the papers on Sunday I saw that the grant for houses is to be increased.  That is capital, I suppose, and all this will be announced at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis.  We will probably have a better idea then whether this really was an election budget or not, but I do not see where the money is coming from for house grants.  I am told that last year many local authorities were not able to pay loans that had been promised because they did not have the money and there was no indication from the Government when they would get it.  Therefore, they had to stop payments of loans.  Now we are being told that we will get treble the amount this year, but it is not apparent in the Book of Estimates where it is coming from.  So I would think there is some little bit of twisting around of figures. As far as I can see there is less for housing in our capital programme this year than there was last year.  If there is less, I do not know what will happen.</P>
    <P>The capital programme envisages the spending of a certain amount but it is totally dependent on a huge contribution from the private sector &mdash; half the amount.  Every day we see industries failing and hundreds of people made redundant. Under these circumstances how any Minister can expect that kind of contribution to the capital budget I am at a loss to know.  I am not a financier but I do not know from what source this major investment will come because as far as I can see business and industry are in a shambles. I do not know of any industry which would have money to spare to invest.</P>
    <P>A few years ago the Fianna Fáil Minister for Economic Planning and Development told me that when he gave tax reliefs to the private sector they would <Col N="1396" /> create jobs and do what he should be doing.  What happened?  He gave those concessions but the private sector either did not or could not fulfil his hopes for job creation.  We have an all-time high in unemployment.  Over the past two years, the reason given for industries failing, rising transport costs and so on was the increase in oil prices.  If a Minister for Finance were really anxious to boost our industrial arm he would reduce the cost of petrol and oil.</P>
    <P>There are other ways to raise this money.  I could not introduce a Bill to impose a tax, but with the knowledge and expertise we are told our Taoiseach has in the economic field, surely he could have found a better way to raise the necessary finance than by completely crippling our transport system by imposing such increases in the prices of petrol and oil?  Here we have a Taoiseach with all the answers, a Taoiseach many people thought, even outside his own party, was some kind of economic wizard who would cure all our economic ills.  He has been in power for over a year and his only solution was to keep up our rate of inflation, grab the extra money and increase inflation further.  If that is the only contribution to come from this alleged economic wizard it is a very poor show.</P>
    <P>Other increases, we are told, will be introduced later.  I would like to know how much will be the increase in the PRSI contribution.  Has the percentage been announced?  I am told the increase will be substantial.  This will be an extra tax on everybody in the PAYE sector. Many people will not benefit from this but they will still have to pay.  Will this offset the small increase given in the budget?  Is it another way of getting round the national understanding?  This budget did not give anything to the PAYE worker but what was laid down specifically and agreed on in the national understanding.</P>
    <P>The increase in postage rates to 18p and in phone calls to 15p will have a very serious effect on our industries.  The increase in the cost of petrol will affect people on milk rounds, driving bread vans and so on.  These people will have to be compensated for this rise because <Col N="1397" /> there is no other way they can survive. What effect will this increase and the increase in the PRSI have on our cost of living, our ailing industries and so on? Nobody can say our industries are not ailing, especially if they look at last year's redundancy figures and the number of people on short time.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance increased the cost of oil and petrol.  This was a deliberate action of the Government.  They do not have any idea how this money can be raised by any other means.  When I raised this matter, the Taoiseach said there was no other way to get this money.  I was amazed at that statement from a person I was beginning to believe had some magic, because I had heard so many people say he would settle our economic ills.</P>
    <P>I have made some points which should be taken into account by any Minister for Finance if he means to help our industry, to keep down inflation and rising prices and increase job opportunities.  As I said at the beginning, job opportunities, employment and unemployment, the rate of inflation and the cost of living are the most important problems facing this country.  I respectfully submit that the budget has seriously aggravated those problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to take up too much time on this resolution because, as in other years, so many arguments and angles have been advanced about the same questions that duplication results and, for most of those who have to listen, the debate becomes boring. While the budget is the statement made by the Minister for Finance it must be remembered that the documents issued about that time all form part of the overall policy being followed by the Government. Opposition Members tend to leave out such major facts as the investment plan and the public capital programme. Having omitted to mention those facts they draw the attention of the public to taxes on a few of the old reliables and the few pence extra paid to the social welfare classes.  I should like to adopt another course and refer to the benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all agreed that the budget was introduced in a difficult economic climate. <Col N="1398" /> Most countries have experienced that difficulty in the last two years.  Nevertheless, the objectives of the Minister are clear, to maintain economic growth and development, increase productive investment and protect the living standards of the under-privileged and less well off in difficult economic times.  The latter was tackled by the significant increase in the health and social welfare fields.  We are all aware that those hardest hit in a recession are the less well off sections and if they are not helped they suffer.  The support of such people must remain a major priority of public policy.  It is inevitable, therefore, that to obtain that money there must be direct taxation of one type or another.</P>
    <P>Those who have drawn attention to what was not included in the budget must accept that at least the Government did not adopt the policies pursued in other countries, deflationary policies which would involve a cut in investment.  The Government did not neglect their obligation to the poor and needy.  They did not go that much overboard in the direct taxation increases.  Existing services were not disrupted because allocations to the various Departments were maintained. Our investment is one of the highest in the EEC, if not in the OECD, and our exports, in spite of all the difficulties, were marginally up last year while imports were down slightly.  Job approvals have not shown any decline.  We are all aware that up to 40,000 people annually seek first time employment and that figure is likely to rise.  That represents a difficult problem for any Government, particularly one working off a small economic base.  All possible is being done to maintain jobs with grants and investments in industry and the Government have achieved a job approval target no one thought possible last year.</P>
    <P>It was unfortunate that we ran into a recession so soon after the one we experienced in the early seventies.  That has made it difficult to maintain the overall job figures and unemployment has increased.  The investment plan of the Government is unique.  It covers many areas and it is unfair of Members to suggest that the Government have not done <Col N="1399" /> anything to keep down unemployment. The main point of the investment plan was to divert unused resources to something productive.  The increasing of the Public Capital Programme by 30 per cent will go a long way towards achieving this. We all understand the hardship that is inflicted on a family when a breadwinner cannot find work.  In a significant way the Government have tried to maintain the living standards of such people by granting increases in unemployment benefits and that is as far as a government can go. Money is being poured into all areas to maintain employment but where that is not possible the next best thing is to ensure that those who cannot get work are able to maintain a fair standard of living.  Last year, and this year, substantial increases in benefits were given to such people.  Many Deputies ignore that fact.</P>
    <P>We all accept that the amount of our foreign borrowing is a matter for concern. It is also a matter for concern in other EEC countries and was an election issue in Germany recently.  It appears that there is not the same interest in such an issue here and that is probably due to the fact that there are so many other issues to catch the eyes of politicians.  The Government have told us that the money borrowed abroad will be used for productive purposes and not to pick up the deficit tabs in any Department.  While we all agree that the amount of foreign borrowing is high we must consider the alternative. In my view the alternative would be to return to the policies of the fifties when the wealth of the country was spent abroad.  We were exporting our wealth and our people.  We had one of the highest credit ratings <i>per capita</i> in the world in those years and we were probably one of the worst developed countries in Europe.  The growth rate for the fifties amounted to about 1 per cent.  We had phenomenal unemployment, large scale emigration and our natural resources were not developed.  We would not be doing our young people any favour by returning to such policies.  Surely it is better to borrow at high interest rates to <Col N="1400" /> get the country back on a sound footing. The Government are not trying to buy themselves out of the recession.  If they adopted that attitude they would have to pay huge amounts in unemployment benefit so you are better off to borrow for productive investment reasons.  That clearly is what this Government are doing.  The investment to achieve the employment that the Government are talking about should, it is hoped, produced about 40,000 jobs per year in the private sector, which now seems to produce about 10,000 jobs a year.  This is very substantial as it goes a long way towards providing employment for young people who come out of secondary and third level institutions every year.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, job losses affect every area.  The one that affects my constituency is the car industry.  It seems that some years ago there was a commitment that the difficulty would fade out under the EEC and that the industry here would have reached the viable stage in 1984.  At that time we had the Protocol 7 agreement but, unfortunately, this slice of the market is gone.  One thing that I cannot understand is that Japanese cars seem to be allowed to flood the market here.  My understanding was that the agreement was one in four, that is for every four cars produced here one car could come in. Maybe I have that back to front as I have heard so many different arguments about it, but the fact is that Japanese cars seem to come in.  Surely when Japan is outside the EEC a large tax of one kind or another could be put on them, at least in this time of recession where we cannot swallow up the job losses of the motor assembly industry into any other industry. Some means should be brought in to stop the Japanese flooding the market. Maybe there is an agreement.  I am sure there is because Britain has exactly the same problem and it has hit them much worse.  I would like to know the position, and the workers in that industry cannot understand it either.</P>
    <P>The second main objective of this Government, after employment and economic growth, is to improve the social conditions and income of the less well off.  The large increases &mdash; they have been <Col N="1401" /> mentioned here time and time again &mdash; that have been received by social welfare recipients, the aged, the disabled, the unemployed, the people with large families, have been very significant.  I know that they do not go all the way to cure the ills of unemployment but they do go a long way down the road.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert on farming.  In my first few years in this House, when large increases were given under the heading of farmers' income, I was critical of the farmers.  However, I want to be fair, and it is obvious in the last 18 months that the farmers' losses have been pretty widespread and everyone in this House understands the difficulties which result.  However, it is unfair to say that nothing has been done.  In the budget alone the resource tax has been abolished.  The Minister has stated that the resource tax due last year which has not yet been paid remains due and will be collected through the Revenue Commissioners.  Obviously, great pressure has to be put on the collection of that as in the PAYE sector. The accounts basis for the computing of farming profits is to continue and a system of income averages which is under discussion with the farming organisations will be introduced in the Finance Bill. The threshold of £40 rateable valuable continues for this year and for the two years following, as promised in last year's budget.  The income tax payable will fall due in two instalments in October and January.  Full relief from rates will apply to farmers with farm valuations under £50 and 50 per cent relief of rates will apply to farmers with farm valuations of £50 or over but under £70.  Yet people say that absolutely nothing has been done for the farming sector.</P>
    <P>The Government made it very clear that they are trying as hard as possible through the EEC, the Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament to achieve increases for the farming sector.  We acknowledge fully the difficulties that face the farming community and we are tackling them in a positive way.  It is unfair to say that the Minister does not care or does not seem to notice.  Remarks like that can be made easily and perhaps some people will <Col N="1402" /> believe them, although I doubt it.  I heard an interview the other day on the radio where the interviewer chased the farming organisations down the line and asked them to be precise about what was and was not done.  It was obvious that he was on very shady ground and the arguments did not hold up very well.  The Government realise the problems and they are doing what they can about them and putting on all pressure.  The Minister has been several times to Brussels trying to achieve the increases which he wishes to get.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy aim is to rectify the position and to obtain an adequate return from farming by securing realistic price increases under the CAP, to obtain special aid from the EEC for farmers and to encourage higher agricultural output through farm investment. The investment plan which came out just before the budget allocated £140 million for agriculture in 1981 together with capital funds of £12 million provided directly by the EEC to the Farm Modernisation Scheme, and provided for arterial drainage through the ACC.  These things, plus a number of other items which were done through the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, should help to alleviate some of the problems which the farmer has and the rest are being followed through actively by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The last speaker said that he was not going to quote any figures on the public finances.  He claimed that he was not too well informed on the subject, but he seemed to hit on all the items that were damaging to the Government and he left out those that tried to rectify the problems, the constructive suggestions and attitudes put forward by speakers on this side.  That is his prerogative but I am sure that he understands as well as well as anyone else that this recession is no ordinary one and that this country and the whole of Europe are going through it.  I am sure that he understands the increases that have taken place in oil prices in the last few years and that these cannot be alleviated by a Minister waving a wand and coming up with the necessary £ billions almost that are needed to rectify the problem.  The impact of the oil price increases and the monetary and fiscal policies <Col N="1403" /> pursued in the major countries of the OECD meant that growth fell to about one per cent and we have stayed more or less in line with all the other economies.  We did not achieve last year the significant figures which we had achieved before that because it became so much more difficult to export and we were not competitive because of the high wage increases which were necessary and which were granted by the Government under the national understanding.  We became less competitive and we could not expect to get the same foreign markets.</P>
    <P>As I have said in the budget debate and in other debates, a lot more could be done under the Buy Irish campaign. There seems to be an attitude of mere lip-service to it.  You do not have to go too far in this country to see where money could be diverted from imported to home produced items.  People argue that Irish firms are not competitive, that they do not market, that they have not the same PRO, but even where they seem to achieve all of these, people will say to each other that it is terrible that my Johnny or your Jackie is unemployed, he is out of work, the clothing industry down the road has closed down, and then they will go into the supermarkets and buy imported items clearly marked that are not very much cheaper than similar Irish-made goods.  The biscuit and the clothing industries are two areas of high Irish employment where there are now many redundancies probably connected directly with the fact that the ordinary man in the street has refused to support the Buy Irish campaign and to pay perhaps a little extra to keep these industries viable, feeling that he is saving money when really he is putting up his own taxation to help to pay people who are unemployed because of his own action. I have made that point before and it seems that it does not get across.  That is a pity because, as the Taoiseach has said, there would be a fantastic increase in employment if there was only a 1 per cent or 2 per cent switch from imported to home-produced items.  An example of that was where 150 million of the products <Col N="1404" /> being used in the building industry were imported &mdash; this from an industry that cries so loudly about the lack of investment and money.  They could improve that position.</P>
    <P>The last speaker said there was nothing done about unemployment.  One thousand seven hundred million is to be poured into economic investment over a number of years to enlarge output and export capacity and to provide infrastructural investments for the basic services such as roads, telecommunications, new factories and the social investments which are so important to cities &mdash; health, education and social services.  It is clearly set out in the investment plan exactly where the Government are putting money and why they are putting it into those areas.  A large amount of money has been allocated to industry, particularly manufacturing industry, to set up a goods producing sector which will maintain a high level of goods over the next few years.  By doing that we will build up industries which will absorb the large numbers of school leavers over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The IDA have been the main source of creating jobs in recent years.  They have projects with employment potential of 30,000 to be approved this year and 15,000 to 16,000 new manufacturing jobs are to be provided also as a result of projects already approved.  There was also money approved for construction workers for direct employment in the IDA programme of building factories. That document sets out exactly the kind of potential laid out for entrepreneurs and the industrialists to allow them to make a profit from industry.  Opposition members will agree that, if one tries to tax entrepreneurs out of the country, it affects the ordinary citizen rather than the so-called wealthy.  If he is put out of business, he will stagnate.  Entrepreneurs should be encouraged if everything is not to be State-owned.  We must give some incentives to the person who puts his livelihood at risk to create employment.</P>
    <P>The last speaker credited the Minister for Health with being only a good singer. I credit him, in difficult circumstances, with being able to continue fighting under <Col N="1405" /> both his briefs to get substantial increases of 25 and 20 per cent respectively for people getting long and short term social welfare benefits.  He has maintained a reasonable and adequate building programme for hospitals and health boards. Some specific references to funds not being available for various institutions do not surprise me, because usually it is half way through a year before they are required.  It always amazes me that health boards and organisations which look for money cannot make a proper forecast of their requirements.  It is easy for Opposition spokesmen to pick on things like that.  Items are required during the year and somebody expects to put £1 million here or there for something which was never budgeted for by the Department.</P>
    <P>The main features of the budget are to try to hold the investments, the employment and the productive capacity that is at present here and to be ready for the time when the recession ends.  We will be ready to take off from a proper base, not like in the fifties when we were totally on the ground and not able to get up.  If we have to borrow to do that, so be it, it is borrowing for productive purposes.  In 1974 a tax of 15p was put on petrol.  By today's inflation rates we should have put on a tax of 30 pence.  I know the petrol price increase will affect certain industries and will filter through the economy. At the same time we have to conserve energy.  There is no petrol here.  If people want to use petrol they have to pay tax; if they do not want to use it, we save on the balance of payments.  When a Government are concerned with deficits, national debts and the balance of payments, it is a good idea to tax petrol.  It is the same with other luxury items.  If we want large colour televisions, whiskey, pints or cigarettes, we must pay for them. The tax on those items will be used to pay social welfare increases.  The farmers get their increases from Brussels, the PAYE workers get increases under the national understanding, but the social welfare recipients have to wait for budget day to get their increases.</P>
    <P>The two main elements of the budget were to increase the capacity of industry and to provide a base for employment for <Col N="1406" /> the future.  The Government clearly defined what they did to provide a proper programme to maintain job creation.  It has been a successful budget, although we have not done all we would have liked to do.  No other country in Europe foresaw the increases in the price of oil.  Even Japan, one of the most industrialised countries in the world, did not foresee this increase.  If highly sophisticated countries could not foresee these increases, how could we be expected to? We have managed to keep our balance of payments pretty much in line.  We borrowed for productive reasons.  We managed to get into new areas of industry and set up training schools for people to work in these industries.  This will ensure that they will be Irish firms, staffed by Irish people and Irish expertise.  All these things have been achieved by a positive policy of pouring money into the IDA and into training programmes.  It is a job well done by the Government.  People on this side of the House are not afraid to face a general election, whenever it comes.  We cannot eradicate all the problems, but we have gone a long way towards solving them.</P>
    <P>A country's economy has to be taken as a whole and the job of the Minister for Finance is to look after social welfare recipients as well as business people.  He has to do a balancing job.  In a small economy like ours which is trying to expand you cannot put the cake on the table and eat it and still have it on the table.  You can only take so many slices. You cannot spend the money here, there and everywhere.  There must be specific priorities.  This Government has adopted those priorities and they will be seen to be correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Budget time is a time for stock taking.  It is only right that we, as representatives, should take stock of where we feel the country is going right and where it is going wrong.  I would particularly like to deal with four specific subjects, industry, fisheries, forestry and tourism, and perhaps point out where I think the Government can improve their performance and where I think they have failed particularly in the past year.  Listening <Col N="1407" /> to the Minister of State, Deputy Killilea, I wondered if we live in the same country.  We live about 70 or 80 miles apart but things in Galway must be much rosier than they seem to be in the remainder of the country.  Certainly, one of us goes about with his eyes closed.</P>
      <P>I would describe the budget as the same tired Fianna Fáil budget that we have come to expect in the past three years.  As some previous speaker said, it is the easiest thing in the world to put 15p on petrol, 10p on cigarettes, 6p on the pint, 12p on spirits and increase car registration to £20 and keep going on that basis year in, year out.  I was disappointed, now that we have a new Minister for Finance, that we did not get some new thinking in the budget proposals.  I had hoped for some new ideas and particularly for some new incentive to develop national resources.  We have heard different speakers complain about unemployment, about factories closing down but if we are to be fair perhaps the first reason for many factory closures is that they are not based on native raw materials that can be and should be developed. We have the workforce and on that sound basis, even in a recession, this type of industry would not fail.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay the Government a few compliments.  One is on the score that the Minister for Energy is bringing in the Turf Development Bill, something I have talked about for the past three or four years and have suggested time and again.  It is about time that we developed this tremendous national resource of energy, the peat deposits we have, particularly in the midlands, in the west and north-west.  Repeatedly I have asked the Government to give grants to develop this resource and I wish to compliment the Minister for Energy publicly for bringing in this Bill which I hope will be debated in the very near future.  The Bill gives a 65 per cent grant for co-operatives for the development, drainage and cutting of turf and also towards turf machines.  It gives a 45 per cent development grant for private individuals. That is the type of thing we need at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" /> I should also like to compliment the Minister for Finance on the fact that he said there was £250,000 for the encouragement of the seed potato industry.  In the past couple of years the potato industry has taken a severe knock and while the Minister did not spell out exactly that is intended he did say that there would be £250,000 to encourage proper grading and storage of seed potatoes so that we could have the proper basic stock to plant for the next potato crop.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I wish to compliment the Minister for Fisheries for making available a grant of £350,000 for mariculture, the latest thing in the fishing industry whereby we can develop oyster, mussel, scallop and clam beds and I hope develop salmon and trout farms also.  There are three areas in which I think encouragement should be given and we should give credit where it is due.  As regards mariculture, while I have complimented the Minister on the £350,000 I think much more is needed in this highly intensive industry.  It is only right that local fishermen and small farmers should get the chance to be educated in this business.  I know there is a course in Galway University but there should be courses also in the regional colleges particularly in coastal areas so that people can be educated in this new and sophisticated way of farming shellfish.  They should also be encouraged to develop the sheltered bays that we have in such abundance around our coast and to develop markets not only at home but abroad.  That is as far as I can go as regards kudos.</P>
    <P>Last year our tourist trade was hit by a petrol strike near the end of the season. Early in 1980 Bord Fáilte and the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism prophesied that 1980 would be one of the best tourist years we ever had.  Instead it was one of the worst tourist years with the lowest number of tourists arriving.  I think the first cause of that was that we are gradually pricing ourselves out of the tourist market.  Even if we take the most expensive European countries, we find that when their tourists come here they complain about high prices in Ireland. This applies even to the Swedes and Germans. I visited Germany recently and it <Col N="1409" /> amazed me to see how cheap things are in Germany compared with Ireland and Germany is said to be an expensive country. This budget has hit the tourist trade probably harder than any other industry. Absolutely nothing has been given to help the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>In one of the national papers today or yesterday the chief of Bord Fáilte stated that he hoped the tourist trade from Britain would increase by about four per cent.  We heard these predictions last year but they were not fulfilled.  His reason for forecasting the increase of about four per cent is the devaluation of the IR£ to 74p in the last 14 months.  In that period no matter how you take it our punt has been devalued by 26 per cent.  I know some people say that is only because sterling has risen in value but when any of us go abroad and try to change an IR£ into German or Spanish currency or any other European currency, we find ourselves getting a lot less for our IR£ than others are getting for the £ sterling.  There has been, to my mind, an IR£ devaluation of 26 per cent in the last 14 months.</P>
    <P>The Minister brought in a further increase in the price of petrol, following that in autumn of last year.  If my memory serves me right, the autumn increase was 10p.  Now he puts an increase of 15p a gallon on petrol which will affect dramatically the tourist trade.  The petrol operators say that before four or five weeks have passed the price of petrol will again be increased by another 10p a gallon by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, bringing the petrol price in Ireland to practically £2 a gallon. I cannot understand how anybody from Bord Fáilte can state that we are going to have more English tourists in this country when they can travel to Europe, where they are sure of the sun, where the prices are cheaper and their motoring costs certainly a lot less than they are here at present.  Apart from that, the English still feel a threat to them because of the troubles in these islands.  They have not forgotten that it is only 18 months since Lord Mountbatten was murdered.  I have been talking to many people in London and I am amazed how many still ask, &ldquo;Is it safe to come to Ireland for holidays?&rdquo;  Everyone <Col N="1410" /> of us must say that of course it is safe to come to Ireland on holidays.  Twenty times as many people are killed on the roads than are injured, maimed or shot in Northern Ireland.  I hope the increase in tourists which Bord Fáilte expect will come to pass, but I doubt it very much.</P>
    <P>The taxation on cigarettes, on the pint, on spirits all affected the tourist trade last year and the increases this year will affect it even more.  I was very disappointed that the Minister for Finance, in this budget did not include, to counteract the fact that we are pricing ourselves out of the tourist market, some type of petrol or other subsidy to encourage more tourists into this country.  The tourist industry is the second largest in this country and I am particularly saddened, coming from the north-west and travelling so much around the west, to see how the hotels and guesthouses in these areas are declining because of lack of business.  If they got good business they could improve and enlarge their premises, but they are very disappointed that the Minister has not given any extra grants to the hotel trade.</P>
    <P>The only Bord Fáilte grant available at present is a grant towards the cost of installing a bathroom or of building an extension.  This industry could help our balance of payments and has great potential.</P>
    <P>The increase is not only on petrol, it is on postage which is going up from 15p to 18p per letter and the cost of telephone connection, which is going up from £100 to £140.  The telegram and telephone charges are being increased also and all these things affect the tourist trade.  I would have complimented the Minister for Finance, as I complimented other Ministers at the outset of my speech, if he had done something for this very important industry but he has failed miserably.</P>
    <P>Now I come to deal with fisheries.  The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, speaking last week in the budget debate, told the fishermen that he was delighted to be able to secure for them a 2p rebate on a gallon of diesel oil.  As I understood it, and as the different fishermen's organisations understood it, the promise made <Col N="1411" /> to them was 7p per gallon.  If we analyse it, the 2p means that the entire Irish fleet, according to the figure given to me, would save £300,000.  It means that the fishermen, instead of paying 87p per gallon, now pay 85p.  The rebate would buy them one-and-a-half extra gallons of diesel fuel per year per boat.  At present the Scottish and English boats are tied up because many of their catches have not been up to the mark and because of the third countries dumping fish into the EEC.  I hope this does not happen here. The fishing industry is in dire straits at present.  We are being priced out of the chance of selling fish cheaply abroad; 1980 was probably the worst year for our fishermen for a long time, certainly since we took this industry seriously.  I was, therefore, amazed to hear the Minister half laughing at and half mocking the leaders of the fishing industry and saying that they were a lot better off than they made themselves out to be.  This, despite the fact that of the 450 boat owners in this country, three-quarters are behind in the repayments on their boats.  If the fishermen were that well off, most of the 450 boat owners would be on time with their repayments and not six months in arrears.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in Brussels at present trying to sort out the fishing policy for the Irish fleet.  A word of warning should go out from our fishermen and the fishing industry that they will not accept anything less than an exclusive 12-mile zone in which they have the right to determine the amount of catch and the type of fish to be caught within these waters.  In one of this morning's papers it is mentioned that the French are looking for traditional rights within our 12-mile fishing zone.  Is there any other nation in the world, an island nation like ourselves, which would think of giving the French fishermen the right to fish within 12 miles of its coasts? The Minister should be warned that we cannot accept French, Dutch, British, or any other nation fishing within 12 miles of our coasts.  The fishing industry has had great problems in the last 12 months. We would all welcome a policy which would treat our fishing industry fairly. <Col N="1412" /> We have not had such a policy.  We have Canadian trawlers, whose diesel bills are only one-third those of our fishermen, catching fish and dumping that fish in Iceland, Norway and elsewhere.  The time has come for the leaders of the Irish fishing industry, and the Minister in the EEC, to stand up and say that our fishing waters are not for sale and that we demand the right exclusively to catch this fish ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that quotas are the most important safeguard for our fishermen.  I say quotas are the second, because the most important thing for our fishermen is to have an exclusive zone where only they will have the right to fish.</P>
    <P>On BIM, there has been a cut of £280,000 in this year's Estimate and I hope this is not the first nail in BIM's coffin.  I hope it does not mean that BIM are not to be allowed to continue on the lines they have been following.  For instance, they have been allowed to spend only £1,500 at the boat show next month.  The Department will spend £10,000 on their stand but apparently BIM are not to be given enough money to have a stand.  Like the Minister, I intend to visit the show and I will try to find out if BIM development is to be curtailed.</P>
    <P>Tourism may be our second largest industry but our fisheries represent an industry that can be developed.  It has been neglected for too long.  For instance, I hope that when the Minister comes to speak about harbours he will tell us that ample money will be provided for harbour development everywhere in the country.</P>
    <P>All will agree that there has been a shortage of capital for the development of fish processing.  In years gone by we saw cattle leaving on the hoof for England. How much fish do we now see being exported whole to Scotland, England and other markets, instead of being processed here?  If we were able to process half the fish we catch we would give employment to more than 7,000 people.  Bremerhaven is not the largest fishing port in Europe but it manages to employ 14,000 in fish <Col N="1413" /> processing.  This is one type of development I had hoped to see money spent on.</P>
    <P>Borrowing money to spend to make money should be our catch cry, not simply borrowing money to spend.  I am disappointed that the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry has not got a programme for restocking our rivers with salmon and trout.  It is a programme which deserves capital investment.  We should be doing it in such a way that in three or four years our salmon stocks would be back in such numbers that we could be exporting salmon.  It is worth noting that in Norway they have an intensive programme in this field and they are exporting seven times more salmon than we succeed in catching along our coasts in an entire season.</P>
    <P>The budget displays a sad lack of thinking. Any child could put 15p a gallon on petrol, 10p on cigarettes, 6p on the pint, 12p on spirits and 100 per cent on the car registration fee.  What should have been in the budget is a plan to develop our natural resources, many of which could be developed profitably.</P>
    <P>The third subject I will deal with is industry.  Of course I am very concerned with the unemployment figure of 125,000, plus 10,000 on short time, but what concerns me more is the type of industries that are being closed down throughout the north-west and the west, not small, inefficient industries but large, good ones.  For instance, there is Snia in Sligo, supposedly one of the major achievements of the IDA a few years ago. We were told then that people from south Leitrim, Donegal and Mayo would be employed there.  Recently we had the case of GT Carpets in Gweedore in Donegal, and of Courtaulds in Letter-kenny, neither of which is going the way it should be.</P>
    <P>These multinational firms are not being closed down because of the policy in the last three years but because of the expensive way we are running the country.  I do not think any rational person will deny that gradually we are pricing ourselves out of industry, and there is no point in bringing in industries unless we can encourage them to stay, first of all by giving incentives and then by providing reasonable labour, low taxes and a good <Col N="1414" /> communications system.  We cannot state honestly that we are offering these things to industry.</P>
    <P>As I said, I am extremely concerned to see good, efficient factories being put on short-time or being closed down.  I can count ten factories in the Donegal Gaeltacht which have been closed down in the last 18 months.  I could count another six in the west and the north-west regions, disemploying people who have been working in them for a long time.  I ask the Ministers for Finance and Industry, Commerce and Energy, to study the reasons for these closures and to try to come up with a remedy.  All of us will suffer in the long term if factories are closed in areas such as the north and north-west which most need industry.  Perhaps we could give these people some kind of transport subsidy or an interest-free loan to tide them over the recession.  My forecast is that unless something is done to help these industries more factories will close within the next six months.</P>
    <P>I started by saying that the first priority is to encourage industries which are based on our natural resources, but many of the factories which are now at risk use imported materials which are now costing very much more due to the loss in value of the Irish pound.  They are also paying a high price for diesel and the travelling expenses of their personnel are very much higher than comparable costs in Northern Ireland, Britain or even Germany. Industry here is being badly affected because basic costs are higher than in most other European countries.</P>
    <P>I am not attempting to criticise the Government but rather to give my view of what might be done to remedy the situation before it is too late.  Much money was spent on attracting these industries to Ireland and on grants for machinery and staff training.  At present all we see for this expenditure is more and more closed doors.</P>
    <P>The unemployment rate in County Donegal is over 25 per cent, probably the highest rate of unemployment in any of the 32 counties.  We often hear from across the water about the bad situation in Northern Ireland where the unemployment rate is almost 20 per cent, but in <Col N="1415" /> County Donegal one in four people willing to work cannot find a job and these people are becoming very disheartened.</P>
    <P>Forestry has been our most neglected industry since the foundation of the State.  When asked last week about the export price of our timber, the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry said that his Department received £1 per tonne for exported timber.  During the past two years I have drawn the attention of the Minister to the closure of one timber processing plant after another.  I said that the time would come when even the thinnings from our forests could not be used and that time has now come.  I read this morning in the <i>IDA News</i> that a sawmilling study has identified an import substitution opportunity worth £30 million a year.  This is only the tip of the iceberg.  The grants totalling £4 million have been given only to a very few sawmillers and there is only one major sawmill here at present.  Time and again I have asked the Minister what he is doing to encourage more sawmilling using new technology.  The answer he gave last week is that he is working on it and hopes within the next three or four months to announce that a major firm is coming to this country.  We probably need ten such firms.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that between 1978 and 1990 the amount of timber available in this country will be two-and-a-half times the present amount.  This means that our present surplus can be greatly increased over the next eight years.  The Government should make every effort to get more people involved in this industry.  It is also estimated that, if we processed the timber now available for cutting, between 7,000 and 10,000 new jobs could be generated.  Again the Fianna Fáil administration have failed to think ahead in regard to forestry development.  I could talk about the development of forest roads and other aspects of the industry but the important point is that there are four different ways by which more employment can be achieved, namely, tourism, fishing, industry and forestry.  I am trying to be constructive in putting <Col N="1416" /> my views on the development of these sectors.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I wonder whether the EEC have been as good for Ireland as the pundits say.  There is no doubt that agriculture has benefited but I come from a Border county and I am aware of the many industries which have suffered since our entry to the Community.  I refer to the electrical industry, the textile and footwear industries, the clothing industry and the engineering industry.  One has only to go into a supermarket to see the huge range of imported foods such as biscuits.  I understand that all these goods can be imported without the payment of any duty and can compete with goods of home origin.  Is it right to import foreign goods and put people on the unemployment register because the Government have failed to come to some arrangement with the EEC whereby duty can be charged on these imports?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, aware of the growing and frightening problem of abuse of alcohol, especially among teenagers, demands the urgent introduction of appropriate legislative measures to ensure that young people are not enabled to purchase alcohol with the ease which at present obtains, and further demands that the Minister for Justice enters into discussions of an urgent nature with the professional bodies involved and takes all other steps to ensure that this enormous problem is curbed and that loopholes in existing legislation are ended.</P>
      <P>The amendment in the name of the Minister reads:</P>
      <P>1.  To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and add:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dáil Éireann, aware of the widespread concern at the abuse of alcohol, particularly by young people, <Col N="1417" /> welcomes the initiation by the Minister for Justice of an urgent review of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts with a view to the introduction of amending legislation to help in counteracting this abuse and notes that consultations have taken place in this connection with a wide range of interested bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion, which I move on behalf of Fine Gael, will, I am sure, have the support of most thinking people in the House.  I consider it a singular honour to have the opportunity, for the first time in my memory, to debate in this House the question of the effects of the abuse of alcohol on our way of life and particularly on our young people. For long we have skirted this issue and have not dealt with it honestly here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the abuse of drink constitutes a major threat to the wellbeing of this country.  I appeal to all sections, to parents, pastors of all denominations, politicians and publicans, and to all whose responsibility it is to be concerned about the way in which our future is shaped, to join in launching a campaign to dissuade young people from believing in the fabrication of fantasy which is so much of today's promotion of alcohol.  I have no doubt that the massive manipulative skills of the advertising media and of major industry is having a detrimental effect on the welfare of young people and is causing damage to Irish family life. Drink in itself is a good thing, as are most things used in moderation.  However, when drink is associated with a massive campaign to promote drink not as a good thing in itself but as a panacea for all ills, as something that will facilitate young people in not just having an evening out but in enjoying a whole new way of life, the time has come for us to say that the other argument must be put regardless of the consequences and the effects it might have on the industries affected.  No parent, politician or publican could not but be concerned.  The vast majority of people are responsible and cherish the welfare of the country.  As always, some people are not interested in the welfare <Col N="1418" /> of young people and they put profit first. It is our job to say that, in view of the increasing tide of misery, damage and destruction which the abuse of alcohol is waging in Irish homes and among young people particularly, we must counteract this trend.  That must be done on a number of levels.</P>
    <P>I consider the problem to be very serious. It is fortunate that we have many voluntary organisers and leaders among young people's organisations who have manfully endeavoured in difficult circumstances to create a fun ethic, a place of enjoyment, entertainment and leisure activity, outside of drinking areas, which too often are purported to be the places in which young people must be if they are to be with the in-crowd.  We are obliged to say to people involved in voluntary youth organisations that they are doing a very good job.  One of the planks of the campaign which I hope to outline to tackle this problem is support and enhanced prospects for all the organisations which are doing their job as well as possible. Without their input, their patriotism, and their caring for young people, this battle will be lost.</P>
    <P>Available research shows that the drinking patterns of young people give us some cause for concern.  During this discussion I am not concerned about pointing the finger at young people because most of these people who are being exploited are basically children &mdash; teenagers and, in some instances, not even teenagers.  They deserve our protection and care and I hope that that is what they will get as a result of this debate.  According to surveys carried out we know that something like 80 per cent of boys and 73 per cent of girls have taken alcoholic drink at some stage.  We also know from these surveys that 43 per cent of boys and 39 per cent of girls consider themselves as occasional drinkers, that 13 per cent of boys and 10 per cent of girls consider themselves regular drinkers and that, while the majority of those who described themselves as regular drinkers were aged from 16 to over 18, there was a small but significant number from under 12 to 15 years.</P>
    <P>Those figures are out of date because <Col N="1419" /> they relate to the early seventies and the most up-to-date statistics show an increasingly disturbing pattern.  In a survey carried out some years ago by Miss Joyce Fitzpatrick, M.Sc., of the Department of Social Science, UCD, we are told that 72 per cent of males and 40 per cent of females had taken their first drink before the age of 18, that is three-quarters of the young men and almost half of the women had taken their first drink before they were 18.  About 37 per cent of the boys and 15 per cent of the girls had taken their first drink before they were 16.  These figures are now almost ten years out of date.  What is the consumption pattern like at the moment?  A recent study by Mr. Brendan M. Walsh, <i>Drinking in Ireland</i>, shows that unfortunately that trend is being consolidated. As Mr. Walsh says, it is notable that the rate of growth of alcohol consumption in Ireland has in recent years outpaced that recorded in neighbouring countries.  We have now drawn level with the UK in terms of consumption per person aged over 14, whereas in the mid-sixties our consumption was about one-quarter below the British level.</P>
    <P>We know from the statistics on the rates of admission to psychiatric hospitals in relation to alcohol related problems, from statistics available to people concerned with absenteeism from industry, from the impressions and the amateur statistics provided by people involved in voluntary organisations, from our own common sense and from the meetings we attend that more and more young people are drinking at an earlier age and, unfortunately, they are drinking irresponsibly. They are doing that because we are not helping them to educate themselves towards the positive and negative sides of drink.  We are not showing them proper standards of example in our homes and in our public places.  We have not outlawed the employment of children in lounge bars, public houses and places of entertainment.  We are increasingly providing easy access to late night drinking by virtue of granting licences whenever they are applied for.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="1420" /> Doherty, has already expressed concern about this as about many other areas.  I accept his integrity in this respect and there is no suggestion of party political treatment of this topic this evening. We are all concerned about it.  I hope we will have ventilated this evening our concern and our expression of hope that something will be done and some positive commitment that something will happen in the near future.</P>
    <P>We know in relation to tables of alcohol consumption per head of the population, age 15 and over, that the figures show a gradual increase which is doing the country significant damage.  We know from comparative tables in other countries in relation to the consumption of alcohol per head of the population that Ireland does not have any cause for rejoicing.</P>
    <P>The approach to tackling the problem must be comprehensive and concerted. The statistics are shocking and point to the need for the most urgent implementation of measures at a number of levels to combat this growing evil.  Publicans and others involved in the licensing trade should be among the people involved in this.  Those people are also parents and they are very concerned about excessive drinking of alcohol among young people. It is always the minority in any walk of life who cause damage and who do not care anything about our young people. We must exorcise those people from among us in order to ensure that the great damage inflicted on our homes is no longer a feature of our society.</P>
    <P>Do we realise what it must be like for the young person who is obliged to look forward evening after evening with fear to the prospect of alcoholic parents coming back into the home, incoherent, fighting, possibly abusive to the children and neglectful of them?  They deserve our pity and our support in relation to every measure we can take.  I commit our party this evening to the introduction of measures which will bring about a change of public attitude in this respect and the urgent introduction of law reform proposals designed to ban the sale of drink to people under 18 years of age and to ensure that the easy access which young people <Col N="1421" /> have to drink will be denied them.  We have seen great tragedy in relation to cider parties in which in my constituency young people lost their lives.</P>
    <P>I believe the measure of the moral welfare of our civilisation often resides in our ability to protect the weakest and most vulnerable in our community, who are surely our young people.  The Minister and everybody else in the House knows that we can walk 100, 300 or 1,000 yards from this House this evening and find young people serving drink who should be at home doing homework or in bed.  We can find young people drunk in this city at the moment.  We know from Dublin Corporation, and possibly other local authorities, and the teacher organisations, that the spectre of alcoholism and drunkenness among school children is now a problem.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder when they have no difficulty getting drink?  When they turn on the television they are bombarded by an artificial world in which drink is the door to all good.  We can only try to restrict those campaigns.  It would be against what many of us stand for to be over censorious in that respect.  The right approach to balance these campaigns is a positive campaign in schools to educate our young people, in the homes to have the highest possible standards of example and parental attention and discipline, and on our media by ensuring that there is a balance kept between exploitation in this regard and the need to look after young people.  The Health Education Bureau are doing a good job as far as their resources will allow them.  If we are to cope with the multinational giants in this field it is important to give the Health Education Bureau proper facilities and sufficient resources to carry out their great work.</P>
    <P>We know it is not merely a question of reacting to statistics.  We know that in many cases drink is a symptom of some greater problem.  The development of non-drink social activity centres, leisure facilities and amenities in our cities where there are none is very important.  We cannot neglect this.  The few yards of carpet in the lounge bar for many people is the nearest they will ever get to some <Col N="1422" /> peace and tranquillity because their lives are so full of the grimness and sordidness of life in our cities.  We need to be able to show young people that there are other places they can go to where they can entertain themselves.  This is why the work of youth organisations must be the pivot of the campaign I speak about.  We must provide them with adequate resources.  Is it not a shame that those youth organisations and many organisations concerned with psychiatric help have to beg for funds to do their good work?  I am not denying that there is a role for voluntary work and that we all like to contribute to those organisations, but we must think again in relation to the pattern of our resources if we are to tackle this real problem.</P>
    <P>We know that in many cases loneliness and shyness and the comfort and friendliness of publichouses and lounge bars are factors which encourage young people to spend their time in those places. There is nothing else for them to do.  We know there are many towns all over the country where the only activity or a break of any kind is a visit to the local lounge bar.  I am not saying that all lounge bars are anathema to the good of the country, that drink is an evil.  I do not believe it is, but I believe that we lag very far behind in explaining to young people how important it is to respond maturely and in an educated manner to the potential for good and the potential for evil which lie in alcohol.</P>
    <P>In Belfast there are many areas, which one would expect to be drab and at a disadvantage, but are streets ahead of us. In places like Andersonstown and other areas in Belfast there are wonderful leisure centres with swimming pools, cafes, sports facilities, tuition facilities, evening class facilities and study centres.  We are lagging far behind in this regard.  A major investment of resources is essential if we are to get away from the present spectre of a few drinks being the main outlet for many young people with the exception of the voluntary youth clubs which are usually struggling to exist.</P>
    <P>I believe the time is long overdue to launch a major campaign in this regard. It must be a comprehensive campaign <Col N="1423" /> and I suggest ten points as central to any reasonable campaign of reform in this respect.  We must ask our schools to do more in this area.  We must seek to introduce in schools courses of instruction and education which will expose the evils of abuse in those respects which will be anti-addictive in nature and which will show up the fallacy that happiness and fulfilment are to be found in drink or in drugs.  We have not counteracted that propaganda.  We have not given the resources to our schools.  We have not made the necessary curricula changes. Those who are promoting the other side of the picture have vast resources at their disposal, and are using them very effectively.</P>
    <P>We should consider very strongly banning the sale of alcoholic drink to people under the age of 18 years, in any circumstances, at any centre.  We are told people are sent on a message and, in our day, many of us were sent on messages.  Those who want to send young people on this message will have to be discommoded slightly to protect young people.  It should be an offence to sell drink to people of tender years.  We can discuss or argue about the age of 18 years, but there should be a ban on the sale of alcoholic drink to young people.  In that context we should deplore those people who are abusing young people.  Some people, sadly perhaps due to their own addiction, use young people for the purpose of procuring drink when they feel they would not be welcome in a particular establishment. I understand there is also a converse side to that point, and that there are some young people who pay adults to get drink for them.  Obviously that is to be deplored.</P>
    <P>As a third point, the employment of children in any public place where drink is available should be banned.  I know it is supposed to be outlawed at a certain age, but it does not work.  There is not adequate supervision, and I call for a tightening up of the legislation in this respect, and the enforcement of the existing legislation.  It is very sad indeed to see many pale-faced 14 year olds serving drink in lounge bars.  I do not care <Col N="1424" /> whether they are members of the owner's family or whether they are working to make a little money.  It is wrong, and we all know it is wrong.  Let us stop it.  How can we expect a young person to grow up properly given that example?</P>
    <P>Fourthly, off-licences, particularly those associated with supermarkets, should have a separate entrance.  It should not be possible for a mother with young children to be able to procure drink in the same area where she buys normal household goods.  Off-licences could be attached to supermarkets, but there should be a second entrance.  I am supported in that view by the Licensed Vintners' Federation and by others who are concerned about present abuses.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, I should like to see a national authority set up to conduct a counter-campaign, involving representatives of the concerned organisations, be they parents, Members of this House, the Churches, the Garda, the vintners and others with a legitimate interest.  Young people too should be well represented on this body which would have the will and the resources to counteract the propaganda to seduce people into believing that drink is the be all and the end all.</P>
    <P>As a sixth point I should like a massive advertising campaign to be undertaken to put the truth about alcohol into perspective. Like many other things, there are very good points about it.  In moderation, drink is probably of great benefit but, in view of the effect it is having on our young people, the other side must be shown up.  If necessary, this campaign could be funded in part by the companies who derive a living from the sale of drink. The economics of it would have to be considered carefully.  I see nothing wrong in those, who even if they do not intend to so often contribute to this tragedy in Irish life, being obliged to subsidise a public educational campaign about the facts in this area.</P>
    <P>The whole approach should be positive. It should show people that a balanced, mature, sensible approach to drink is the right way to go about it.  It is important that we should be wary about being over-repressive.  I am not in favour of a response which would seek to build <Col N="1425" /> up drink as a myth available to the few and as if it were something we wanted to hide.  We should be quite honest about it. An argument is put forward in other countries that, if people are introduced to drink at an early age, they may be more amenable to a sensible approach to it.  I am far from convinced by that argument, but I am willing to look at it.</P>
    <P>The Health Education Bureau are doing their job.  I want the Minister to answer a specific question.  Will he give £ for £, or as near as dammit to £ for £, to ensure that the other side of the story is put forward?  These advertising campaigns are extremely carefully contrived. I do not blame the advertisers for this.  It is their skill and their job.  The very rubrics of RTE regulations in this respect are of dubious value in some cases.  I question whether they are fully implemented.  If you look at the code &mdash; and these points are the minimum standards to be observed &mdash; you will see statements like: &ldquo;Jingles or music scores with vocal accompaniment are unacceptable as is the use of sound effects of drinking&rdquo;; &ldquo;excessive product displays, bottles, cans, filled glasses or point of sale material must be avoided&rdquo;; &ldquo;The advertising of alcoholic drink should not be linked to sexual attraction or physical prowess either by word or allusion&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Those codes are being broken.  I can name the advertisements if necessary in which they are being broken.  Even the minimum standards for protecting people are not being implemented.  If I am wrong about that, I hope I will be corrected because I feel I am taking a slight advantage of RTE in saying that without having someone on other side to argue back. If the Minister tells me that advertisements for certain well-known drinks do not link sexual attraction and physical prowess either by word or allusion to alcoholic drink, I suggest we must be looking at different stations.</P>
    <P>There is no point in our pretending we can twist the advertising industry to meet our needs.  The way to do it is to counteract it and give the other side of the coin and let the mature young people, in whom I have great confidence and faith, and to whom I believe great credit is due <Col N="1426" /> for the manner in which they are dealing with the problems we foist upon them, make up their own minds with a bit of help, guidance and counsel.  Therefore, a strong campaign is necessary.</P>
    <P>As a seventh point I suggest the positive development of amenities and recreational facilities where the fun and the leisure ethic is central, and where drink is not the central theme.  It is sad that so many functions and so many meetings of branches of party organisations, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, have to be held in or over lounge bars.  We are all guilty in this respect.  That is because we have no choice.  For some extraordinary reason, apparently schools and public buildings are anathema to politicians, or vice versa.  We are not allowed to have meetings there.  They can be used for bingo and various important purposes while apparently a young group of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour politicians are not entitled to the same facility.  That is an aside.</P>
    <P>We must develop these amenities. There is no substitute for them.  The very good, sensible, responsible youth organisation structure which exists, and which is represented here this evening, needs our support, our care and the investment of resources to let them get on with the job.  We do not want to squeeze out the role of voluntary organisations or to take over the job.  We should take up the lead they have given and facilitate them by providing them with the resources necessary for them to do the job.  It is a tragedy that youth organisations are obliged to appeal month after month for grants, large and small, to do work which, if it is not done, will deprive many young people of the potential to fulfil themselves in a normal walk of life and will cause enormous damage to the State and cost us millions.  Let us, therefore, respond generously and involve youth organisations in our campaign in this respect.</P>
    <P>There is a variety of law reform measures and they are matters about which we cannot pass responsibility to any other forum but here.  The Minister and all parties have an opportunity of saying how soon they will introduce law reform <Col N="1427" /> measures in relation to a variety of important issues.  Some of these issues have been pointed out by the Gardai, by caring organisations, by the Irish National Council on Alcoholism, by individual youth organisations, by politicians and by various sections of the media.  I should like to spell out in more detail the need to change the law in certain areas.</P>
    <P>The law in relation to the age at which young people have access to drink needs to be reviewed and rewritten.  We need to ensure that young people do not have the facility of getting their hands on drink when they are in their early teens.  If it fell to be my lot, that is the way the law would be.  I know there are counter arguments and other points of view that may be put, but the greater good of the majority of young people demands that we get tough in this respect.  A consolidation of the present liquor laws could be argued for.  Provision for a much tighter control on the sale of drink to young people is essential.  That would include the restriction of access to young people, particularly in respect of off-licences attached to supermarkets.  There would be a separate entrance and young people would not be allowed to enter.  There is need to update the law and penalties for offences related to control of access by young people to drink.</P>
    <P>We should discourage people from drinking for the sake of it and encourage them to drink only as an ancillary to other social activities.  There are many responsible members in the licenced vintners and publican trade at present who are endeavouring to create a certain amount of leisure activity apart from the pure drinking hole that many places are.  We might question the motivation, but it is a healthy development and shows that drink in itself is not the reason for existence which on occasion it is purported to be.</P>
    <P>The question of opening hours needs to be looked at.  There are two views on this.  One says we should have reduced opening hours while the other says that if we have them open all the time there will be less of a rush to drink.  I am not sure about that point, but some consistency <Col N="1428" /> regarding opening hours would be good.  The abuse going on in relation to late night drinking allegedly with a meal &mdash; we all know the contents of some such meals &mdash; needs to be curbed.  The Minister knows of the growth in the number of such licences over the last few years. We do not want to take away the right of voluntary organisations to raise funds or have social functions without careful consideration, but the doubling of the rate of licences granted is something that should be looked at.  It is very hard to explain unless our pattern of evening entertainment has changed radically, which I do not believe.</P>
    <P>The Garda are seeking the abolition of the need for a search order or other authority to enter and inspect registered clubs.  That should be considered.  The registration of such clubs and the way they operate is a matter which falls slightly outside the ambit of this, but it is relevant to the degree of access those whose job it is to enforce the law are entitled to have.  The creation of an offence for persons found consuming intoxicating liquor in a registered club during prohibited hours is another matter which should be considered.  We could make provision requiring persons found in a registered club during prohibited hours to give their names and addresses, which they do not have to do at present.  We could create the presumption that drink having the appearance of intoxicating liquor found in the possession of a person in a licenced premises or a registered club is intoxicating liquor.  We could give power to the Gardai to confiscate any such intoxicating liquor found in the possession, in a public place, of a person believed to be under 18 years of age.  That cannot be done at present unless the garda has a warrant.  If a garda comes on a group of teenagers having a cider party it is not unreasonable that he should be entitled to confiscate that drink.  It is totally impracticable, and therefore does not happen, that we should suggest that they would have to go off to obtain bureaucratic approval, though I do not wish to downgrade the importance of getting proper authorisation for certain measures.  The reality is that, if we insist <Col N="1429" /> on such a measure here, there will be no cessation of such parties by young people.</P>
    <P>We could provide for proof of age of persons found in possession of intoxicating liquor in public places.  The suggestion was made that identification cards for young people should be introduced. I am not overenthused by that idea.  I am not sure how practicable it is, and it is slightly odious that people, particularly girls, who can look very young and be well over the age of 18, will have to produce evidence.  A compromise might be that if you get someone about whom you have a doubt, you ask them to produce evidence of their age.</P>
    <P>We could tighten up on the law of liability of master for actions of servant, especially relating to offences arising from supply of intoxicating liquor to young persons.  What that would mean is that in a situation where one comes across children of tender years taking alcoholic drink the parent is legally responsible. Ultimately much of the responsibility we are talking about rests with the parents. It is not right that the State should take that away.  At the same time we must point out that that responsibility is not met on occasion.  We should consider the degree to which we can insist on legal responsibility in situations where a parent is found to be aiding and abetting a person in possession of drink they are not entitled to.</P>
    <P>This campaign must involve the whole community.  It must involve parents, priests, politicians and so on.  This is the kind of goal that can mobilise people.  It does not call for a major transfer of resources.  If we organise a campaign for young people, they would play their part and respond and say: &ldquo;We want to be able to use drink sensibly&rdquo;.  I am not calling for the abolition of drink but for it to be utilised sensibly and seen to be a good thing in itself.  At present it is woefully abused.  In relation to absenteeism in Irish work places, figures indicate that companies have found alcoholism accounting for 10 to 25 per cent of absenteeism. We all know the Monday morning syndrome.  In pure mercenary terms, let us think of the damage it is doing. <Col N="1430" /> Think of the many homes tonight in which there is a frightened bewildered child having to witness the spectre of two parents, in many cases helpless victims because it is a drug we are talking about, who are unable to look after them, perhaps beating each other up, swearing and unable to meet their responsibility.  I thank God I did not have a home like that but I care deeply about ensuring that such homes are, as soon as they can be, a thing of the past.  Young people need our protection and care in that respect.</P>
    <P>We must do more about the treatment of people who are too deeply involved with alcoholic drink.  The question of providing detoxication centres in places of penal servitude is a matter for the Minister for Justice.  We find voluntary organisations very much to the fore in providing proper remedial help and care.  We need to do more in that respect.  We are investing in our young people and in our future by these measures.  We are not asking for charity to be given to these people.  We are asking this evening &mdash; and, I hope, committing ourselves to a concerted ten-point plan of action &mdash; that alcohol, which is presently eroding the very basis of our society, will be the subject of a completely new campaign by the Government with the full co-operation of all parties and all sides of the community to ensure that we have a proper balanced approach to the matter and that young people get the protection, counsel and help they deserve.</P>
    <P>There is much more one could say, but my time is up.  I feel deeply about it and I appeal to the Minister listening to give me a guarantee that before this session is out we will see at least a beginning to this campaign about which I speak.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and add:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, aware of the widespread concern at the abuse of alcohol, particularly by young people, welcomes the initiation by the Minister for Justice of an urgent review of the <Col N="1431" /> Intoxicating Liquor Acts with a view to the introduction of amending legislation to help in counteracting this abuse and notes that consultations have taken place in this connection with a wide range of interested bodies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment Deputy Keating on his very helpful and non-party approach this evening.  I look forward to a constructive and useful debate over the remainder of the period.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I should like to explain why I am moving this amendment.  I am doing so notwithstanding that I agree with the Deputies who have proposed the motion that the extent of the current abuse of alcohol, especially among our young people, is giving rise to concern and that we have a duty to do what we can to help to minimise the damage being caused and reduce the risk of addiction at an early age.</P>
    <P>First of all, there is, I think, an implication in the motion that alcohol abuse can be halted or even eliminated by legislative action alone.  This would give a wholly false impression of what the law can do.  Many other countries with similar problems have found out just how ineffective, or even counter-productive, legislative restrictions can be.  The reality is that changes in the licensing laws cannot by themselves have more than a limited effect.  Indeed, experience of this type of legislation has shown that whenever a change was made with the object of reducing availability of drink through particular outlets or outside particular hours, very often no significant decline in general consumption resulted.  People tended to get the same amount of drink from other sources or at other times. These facts should not of course make us any less anxious to make any changes that are likely to contribute to improving the present situation.</P>
    <P>I would say that what is really required is a change in our attitudes to drink. Family and community guidance and example may be the most important factors in determining the drinking pattern <Col N="1432" /> of the next generation of young Irishmen and women.</P>
    <P>Before we can make any impact at all through legislation there must be an informed public opinion about the dangers of drink abuse.  I would even go as far as to suggest that instruction about alcohol, particularly its effects on the nervous system and the hazards of its misuse, should be regarded as part and parcel of the adolescent's formal education. There is a pressing need to promote and develop a positive approach to leisure activities among the young, and perhaps the not so very young, to take the emphasis away from drink and the places and functions where it is dispensed as being a necessary or desirable focal point for social activities.  This is a point that was frequently stressed by the representatives from community associations and groups whom I have met in recent months.  It is also a view expressed by organisations such as the Irish National Council on Alcoholism, the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Medico-Social Research Board.</P>
    <P>There may also be an implication in the motion that an examination of the law has not commenced or that there have not been consultations with the various professional bodies and groups concerned. In fact, a review of the licensing laws has been under way for some time. Detailed submissions were invited and received from interested parties.  I have had discussions with many organisations representing the groups I have mentioned as well as a wide range of professional interests.  The examination has reached an advanced stage and I expect that proposals for amending legislation will be submitted to the Government shortly.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I think it would be inappropriate for me to indicate the nature of the proposals that are likely to be put forward.  Nevertheless.  I would like to make some general observations based on the consultations I have had as part of the review.</P>
    <P>First of all, I think there is now ample evidence from ordinary observation that the level of alcohol abuse has increased substantially over the last decade.  The <Col N="1433" /> statistics available tend to be confusing, if not contradictory.  But there is no gainsaying one set of figures published by the Revenue Commissioners in their Annual Reports.  These relate to the quantities of spirits, beer and wine released for home consumption.  There has been a doubling of those quantities between 1969 and 1979.  If I take the figures for 1962 &mdash; the last occasion that this House reviewed the licensing laws &mdash; the increase is all the more remarkable.  Consumption of spirits has almost trebled since then.  Beer consumption has almost doubled.  Four times more wine in now being drunk.</P>
    <P>Moreover, there has been a striking increase in the number of special exemption orders granted by the Courts, particularly in the category which provides for hotel dances or discos on what are called special occasions.  These orders have jumped from 6,000 in 1967 to 42,000 in 1979.  I think this increase is particularly significant from the point of view of drinking by young people because these functions are designed to attract them. The increase in exemption orders reflects in turn a growing demand for this type of function.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt also about the increase in alcoholism and related illnesses. Admissions to psychiatric hospitals from these causes have risen from 1,600 in 1965 to 7,300 in 1978.  This is a disturbing increase, even when allowance is made for such factors as greater awareness of alcoholism as a disease and greater willingness to accept treatment. Alcoholism is now the most common cause of admission.</P>
    <P>I must also refer to road accidents.  A recent Foras Forbartha Report reveals that one in three fatal or injury accidents occurred between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m., the hours most associated with alcohol-influenced accidents.  Statistics of casualties for 1977, 1978 and 1979 clearly show that Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays carry the highest risk between the hours of 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. Eight in every ten pedestrians killed and six in ten of those injured in night time accidents had been drinking heavily.  The persons killed or injured were mostly those in the 20 to 24 and 25 to 29 age group.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> The role of drink in the break-up of marriages and in absenteeism needs no underlining from me.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind of course that the proportion of young people in the population has also increased and that there has been a very great change in their lifestyle.  Undoubtedly young people can more readily afford to buy enough alcohol for an evening's drinking than they could say five, ten or 25 years ago. They are much less closely supervised by their parents, have a greater individual freedom, own or have access to some form of motorised transport and have a shorter working week.  All these factors may exercise as much, if not more, influence on their drinking patterns today.  In a wider context, the use of alcohol is so much bound up with our modern way of living that its dangerous properties as a potent and addictive drug are often disguised by comforting rationalisations.</P>
    <P>I have been careful to refer to under-age persons rather than teenagers because under our present law it is, of course, permissible for an 18 or 19 year old to buy and consume drink in a licensed premises.  It has never been seriously suggested that there should be a change in the law in this respect, such as, for instance, a raising of the minumum age limit to, say, 21.  Also it is permissible here for a youngster beween 15 and 18 to be in a licensed premises.  In Northern Ireland, incidentally, no one under 18 years of age is allowed.</P>
    <P>I have been urged by many responsible bodies to tighten the existing provisions about the presence of minors in licensed premises and the sale of drink for consumption by them either on or off these premises.  I am bound to say that I think they have made out a good case.  However, a major obstacle in enforcing any such change is the genuine difficulty people nowadays have in knowing whether a young boy or girl is over or under 18. That difficulty is aggravatdd by the fact that young people are physically maturing at an earlier age.  A State-run scheme of identity cards has often been suggested as a possible solution.  I doubt if such a scheme would be feasible.  It would be open to several objections.  For instance, <Col N="1435" /> it would raise wide questions of principle for a common law country such as ours, and I am cerain that it would be costly to establish and maintain.  I consider that the responsibilities of all the parties involved&mdash;the parents, the licensees and the young persons themselves&mdash;should be clearly and unequivocally stated in the law.</P>
    <P>So far as the presence of young people in licensed premises is concerned, there are of course a number of aspects which must be borne in mind.  Under the present statutory provision, which is in the Children Act, 1908, the offence is committed by the licensee where he allows a child to be in the bar of a licensed premises. A child in this context means a person under the age of 15 years.  The question immediately arises as to whether the age limits should be higher than 15 and also whether some responsibility should be placed by statute on the parent or guardian, as well as on the licensee.  Then, again, it must be considered whether a blanket prohibition on the presence of youngsters under 15 years of age in bars is reasonable.  There are certain exceptions under the present law relating to the case where the child is resident on the premises, or merely passing through.  In common sense terms, the degree to which the presence of a youngster of under 15 years in a bar is objectionable depends on the location of the bar, the nature of its clientele and, perhaps, most of all, on whether or not the young person is accompanied by his parent or guardian. Thus while it may be wholly objectionable for a young child to be present in a crowded bar late in the evening, it may be reasonable for a child to be so present during the day if accompanied by his parent while the parents are for example in a remote country area waiting to catch a bus or get a lift.</P>
    <P>I mention these points because it illustrates the fact that in considering the imposition of restrictions under the licensing code we must bear in mind the requirements of the average reasonable citizen and what has always been regarded as normal and reasonable practice throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1436" /> The presence of young people in the bars of licensed premises is, as I have said, dealt with in the Children Act of 1908.  The question of the purchase and consumption of intoxicating liquor by young persons is, however, dealt with in a separate statute&mdash;an Intoxicating Liquor Act of 1924.  The latter provision makes it an offence for a licensee to &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; sell intoxicating liquor for consumption by a person under 18 either on the premises or off the premises. Sending a person of under 18 as a messenger for liquor is prohibited, except where delivery is to a residence or working place, or where the licensee uses a relative or employee as a messenger.  Liquor may be sold to a person aged 15 to 18 if it is in a corked and sealed vessel of not less than one pint capacity.</P>
    <P>Under these provisions, the offence is committed by the licensee; no offence is committed by a person under 18 years of age who purchases or consumes intoxicating liquor.  In considering these provisions, questions will immediately arise as to whether the present age limit is the correct one and as to the degree of responsibility to attach to the licensee in connection with the offence.  We may reasonably ask whether a degree of responsibility should not also attach to the young person who purchases and consumes the liquor, as well as to any adult who may purchase intoxicating liquor for use by an under-age person.</P>
    <P>In examining all these aspects I must bear in mind the question as to what reasonable provision can be made having regard to the earlier maturity of young people today.  Any new provision now put forward on this, or any other, aspect of the licensing code must be such as to be readily enforceable by the Garda.</P>
    <P>I am also looking at sales of drink from off-licences, particularly in relation to sales to under fifteens.  The present law, which goes back to 1924, provides that persons between fifteen and eighteen can buy drink for consumption in licensed premises irrespective of whether they are publichouses or off-licences.  There is evidence from the gardaí and other sources that this has led to a practice of drinking by groups of young persons, some little <Col N="1437" /> more than children, on waste ground or in derelict houses, particularly in Dublin. There is no provision in the law at present which would empower the Gardaí to seize and remove drink from these youngsters.  A difficulty about drinking by the under-fifteens is that the drink can be got for them by an older person.  sometimes the persons who are dealing with customers in off-licences are young persons themselves and cannot be expected to behave in doubtful cases with the same sense of responsibility as adults.  It has been suggested to me, and I am considering, whether a minimum age requirement should be imposed for persons serving in off-licences.</P>
    <P>I am looking at the sales of drink from off-licences particularly in relation to persons under fifteen.  On a number of occasions I have spent a considerable amount of time on this point with various groups and bodies whom I have met and there are, generally speaking, very mixed views about this.  Suggestions have also been made to me that young persons in proper control and guardianship might benefit by being in licensed premises in a proper environmet.  It is a view that has been expressed, too.  I just mention it for the purpose of the debate here this evening.</P>
    <P>I am conscious, too, that under-age drinking extends beyond sales in public houses and off-licences during the normal opening hours and that there may be a case for further control on the sale of drink during extended hours of opening. For one thing, I do not believe that the Oireachtas could have envisaged in 1960 and 1962 that special exemption orders would have been granted on the present scale.  The exemption orders I am particularly concerned about are those relating to exemption for late night functions in hotels and restaurants and, to a lesser extent, for special events such as a fleadh ceóil.  As regards the latter, I have had various suggestions for amendment, from limiting the bar extension to one day at a time to limiting the extension to a specified maximum period after normal closing time.</P>
    <P>The other type of exemption order is that which clearly has caused the greatest concern.  It confers an extension on hotels <Col N="1438" /> or restaurants for special occasions which may include private functions, functions run by particular organisations or groups or simply a dance.  In each case the law requires that a substantial meal be served.  I have had persistent reports of drink abuse at these late-night dances, and have been asked to limit the number of special exemption orders or to reduce the maximum period of extension to, say, 12.30 a.m.&mdash;or, indeed, a combination of both.  There have been numerous complaints about what passes as a substantial meal and I am told that these complaints unfortunately are often only too well-founded. Another complaint relates to the grant of extensions for the early hours of Monday morning.  In fact this is an aspect of the present review which presents a great deal of difficulty.  I may add that a Supreme Court decision is awaited on a case stated which will have a bearing on the approach to be adopted in dealing with this question.</P>
    <P>The present permitted hours are not, I think, a major factor in drink abuse by young people.  In any event, they could not be significantly reduced without unnecessarily restricting the facilities available to moderate drinkers.  Nevertheless the possibility of changes in the hours cannot be entirely excluded from the scope of the present review, at least in so far as these hours could be affected by changes in some of the other provisions. In this connection there have been proposals for increasing the present wintertime week day closing hour to 11.30 p.m., reducing summer time closing to 11 p.m., making various changes in the hours of Sunday opening, including an extension of the closing to 10.30 or even 11 p.m.  I have been asked to increase the drinking-up time of ten minutes to half-an-hour. As regards the present &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; in Dublin and Cork, there are suggestions to abolish it completely; to keep it but to change the time; and even to extend it to the whole country.  Clearly it will not be possible to satisfy everyone, so far as the hours of opening are concerned.</P>
    <P>It may be also that the penalties for certain liquor offences should be altered to take account of present-day conditions. <Col N="1439" /> The monetary penalties were fixed when the real value of money was much greater than it is now.</P>
    <P>Because of the importance of effective enforcement and of their practical experience of the operation of the licensing laws, I have maintained a close liaison with the Garda Commissioner and his officers throughout the review.</P>
    <P>I think the House will agree that there has been a positive Government reaction to the calls for changes in the drink licensing laws to help, in so far as legislation can help, in curbing the unwelcome trends that have emerged in recent years. As I have said, I expect to have definitive proposals for amending legislation to place before the Government shortly and I shall of course take into account the views expressed by Deputy Keating and other Deputies in the course of this debate.  I hope that the legislation, when it is circulated, will commend itself to the House.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a number of points raised by Deputy Keating.  He made suggestions for tackling the problem of temptations for young people because of mass advertising campaigns.  He suggested campaigning to counter the seductive pro-drink propaganda.  These are areas for the Minister for Health and I am satisfied that the Minister is actively interested in all of the aspects raised by Deputy Keating and will take every possible action to improve the position in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate.  I have the highest praise for Deputy Keating, not only for raising this issue but for having notified my friends, and his, from the Catholic Youth Council to come here this evening.  Many young people have a particular interest in this subject because it <Col N="1440" /> is a source of great concern.  I am satisfied that listening to what is being done about this problem will make this a most useful evening for them.</P>
      <P>I am more than gratified to hear the Minister announce that his proposals are well on their way to completion and that they will be with the Government shortly. The Minister is prevented from announcing the kind of proposals he has in mind because the Government must vet and agree to them before they come before the House.  I am satisfied that when they come before the House not only will Deputy Keating and I be pleased but so will everybody concerned about the abuse of alcohol, particularly young people.</P>
      <P>I led deputations to the Minister for Justice of the Coalition Government expressing our concern about the easy access young people have to alcohol.  We know the problems there are getting people to give evidence that they saw somebody serving an under-age person in an off-licence premises.  Unfortunately, among the culprits for selling drink to under-age people are our supermarkets where in a less personalised service it is very difficult to vet customers.  If the Minister is not already considering that this situation&mdash;allowing supermarkets to sell alcohol to under-age people &mdash; should not continue, the time has come to tell the supermarkets that selling beer, cider and so on must be controlled.  I suggest that this matter be looked into.</P>
      <P>The tragic part of our way of life is that any organisation, whether it be a youth club or a community organisation, must serve drink to get the adults to attend. Very often young people while trying to serve the community have to make drink available to raise funds.  It is a vicious circle.  Nothing makes me madder than to go into a pub and see young children drinking minerals while the parents drink pints.  Nothing prepares a child more for a life of heavy boozing than growing up in this environment.  The Minister should make it clear that this kind of behaviour is undesirable and should be banned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keating said that 14 year olds and younger serve in bars.  The law states that no boy under 16 and no girl under 18 can serve in a bar, but this happens. <Col N="1441" /> Where it happens the community have a responsibility to bring it to the attention of the local gardaí, the Department of Labour, the Department of Justice, or the local Deputy.  If such a matter is brought to my notice I will certainly bring it to the attention of the proper authorities. I am not aware of children of 14 or under serving in any bars I frequent. These are very emotive statements but if these things are happening they are against the law and these people can and should be punished.</P>
    <P>The community's unwillingness to come forward and give evidence to the Garda leaves a great deal to be desired. We all know of certain off-licences which sell drink to teenagers but nobody will come forward and give evidence.  We have a tradition that we do not like to inform.  This is part of the reason why we have this canker, this awful running sore in our society.  We know it is against the law to drink in a bar or pub after hours but we all do it.  In Ireland that is a socially acceptable crime.  If a person's name appears in a paper and he or she is fined for drinking in a pub after hours, nobody will take it very seriously.  We have this attitude of being sympathetic to the drinker while at the same time deploring excesses.</P>
    <P>I have always said there is nothing wrong with drinking in moderation.  I enjoy a drink as much as the next person but I do not enjoy drunkenness.  Drunkenness reduces the human being and takes away his dignity.  There is nothing wrong with somebody being merry or in good form, but when people stagger along the streets and get sick I consider something should be done about the situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating mentioned drink advertisements.  I deplore the way advertising is done, not just on television but through big advertisements or hoardings. There is pressure to drink; you are not one of the crowd unless you drink; you are not acceptable unless you drink.</P>
    <P>Statistics published recently showed that the people of Ireland drink less than other EEC countries.  I knew this was not a real figure because in this country more than any other as a percentage of the <Col N="1442" /> people, there are more total abstainers. A lot of people do not drink.  I am talking about an average per head of the population, but I have yet to see such a figure. I should like to know the percentage of the population who do not drink.  Those who do not drink help by lowering the statistics to reduce the guilt of those who do.  Last week I mentioned that figures cannot lie but that liars can figure.  One can do anything with figures one wishes but the statistics about drinking habits here are not accurate.</P>
    <P>The onus in relation to serving under-age persons rests on publicans.  It is the responsibility of a publican to ascertain whether the person being served is under age or not.  There are no party differences in regard to this matter.  We have a responsibility to our young people to set the example for them.  I hope the Minister in his proposals will do something to prevent parents leaving their children in a car outside a licenced premises while they drink inside.  It is sickening to see unfortunate children left in a car while their parents drink in a pub.  Somebody should be held responsible for such acts.  A lot of people do this.  When driving with my wife we have often noticed cars outside pubs with children in them.  To us that is unthinkable but yet it is a common occurence with many people.  It is possible that the reason for this is because the parents were treated in that fashion when they were young, but their children when they grow up will accept that as part of life and continue such bad behaviour.  We must adopt a responsible attitude to such children.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that all concerned people, young and old, want action in relation to teenage drinking.  The Minister should not be hesitant in over-reacting because he can always pull back.  Something should be done to remove this blight from our nation.  A short time ago I was horrified to see youngsters between 15 and 16 years of age swigging out of a bottle of cider as they walked down a city street.  The major cause of vandalism in the city, and throughout the country is the consumption of alcohol by young children. Physically and mentally such young people do themselves a lot of harm if they <Col N="1443" /> start drinking when 14 or 15 years of age. It is said that an alcoholic does not want to know a person who does not drink with him because he considers such a person an embarassment to him.  The same applies to most young people who drink; one does not belong to the gang unless one takes alcohol.  It is easy to be accused of going overboard on this subject and for that reason I was delighted to hear the contribution of Deputy Keating. Many of his liberal statements suggest that we should tolerate and allow certain things in the interest of the freedom of the individual; but I was glad that as far as drink is concerned he recognised, liked most of us, the destruction and the breaking up of homes an abuse of it can cause.</P>
    <P>Almost all the young people in our institutions can blame their condition on drink.  Community organisations should have another look at the way they plan their activities.  The Minister has told us that there was a striking increase in the number of special exemption orders granted by the courts particularly in the category which provides for hotel dances or discos on what are called special occasions. He pointed out that the number of such orders jumped from 6,000 in 1967 to 42,000 in 1979, a phenomenal increase.</P>
    <P>Another area of deep concern is the increase in alcoholism among young women.  That has led to an increase in the number of admissions of young women to psychiatric hospitals from 1,600 in 1965 to 7,300 in 1978.  As a teenager I was aware that young girls did not frequent pubs but it is now an accepted part of our social life that young girls and young women do so.  I am not against women drinking, because they are as entitled as any man to a drink, but I am anxious to stress the point that there has been a huge rise in the number of admissions because it is now socially acceptable for young women to drink in pubs.  I am deeply concerned about the number of young girls served drink in pubs and other places.  It is tragic that so many young girls must get treatment for alcoholism. The Minister should consult with the Minister for Health with a view to <Col N="1444" /> requesting the Health Education Bureau to counter the advertising campaign carried on by the brewers on television. Many people felt that when cigarette advertising was banned on television it would lead to a huge drop in income for those stations but that did not happen. The Minister should urge the Minister for Justice to set about dismantling the advertising of drink on television.  What other channels do is not our responsibility and it is something over which we do not have any control, but that does not mean that two wrongs make a right or that we have the right, therefore, to advertise. There is no use in allowing this money to be spent on advertising because such advertising is coming in on UTV, Welsh Television or any other stations being fed into us.  In 15 or 20 years God knows what will be coming over the airwaves into our homes with the new types of receivers being developed daily as technology is improved and new discoveries made throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I would like to suggest that maybe the Health Education Bureau would take a specified period, say two, or three or four months, and have a special programme on drink.  Their advertising on smoking has been highly successful and they have done a wonderful job there.  I wish we could see a programme on drink similar to the programme which I saw recently by the <i>Horizon</i> team of the BBC.  They did a marvellous film on cigarette smoking and its dangers and what has happened to people as a result.  Viewers should be introduced to some of the people who drink to excess and see some of the results of drinking, the brain damage that it has brought about, the damage it has caused to unborn children.  Youngsters have not had a fair chance in life because the parents were drinking when the mother was expecting the child and should not have been drinking, and that child has to bear the results of that for the rest of its life.  Not only does it leave the mother with a guilt complex, but the child's life is destroyed.  These effects are due mainly to excesses, not because the people concerned drank a little.  We are talking about alcohol poisoning, about people who are being poisoned by alcohol. <Col N="1445" /> If I wake up in the morning and have a hangover, technically I am suffering from alcohol poisoning, and people are not made sufficiently aware of the dangers. The Health Education Bureau have a huge task before them and I urge the Minister on the basis of the statistics which he has given to the House here tonight to take some action on this.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the change in lifestyle of young people from that of the young people of about 25 years ago and of the money which they earn that they would not have dreamt to have earned then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to allow a few minutes for whoever is going in next to get his foot implanted into it.  Parents have less control over their children than they had 20 years ago, there is no doubt about that.  The consumer society has made it very much more difficult for parents to keep control over their children and it falls more than ever before to the youth organisations to step into the parents' role.  Many people connected with youth organisations are acting as parents to the children because the real parents are not too concerned about where their children are and what they are up to.  The youth organisations in fact are fulfilling that function many times over.  I am glad that we have poured so much money into the youth organisations in the last two years through the office of the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Tunney.  The money given to the youth organisations for full-time youth work and so on should be bearing fruit in creating a situation where it is possible for those people on the ground to do something, but they cannot win the battle if we are not supporting them and backing them up with legislation to control the kind of abuse that we have been talking about here this evening.  I hope that the Minister will continue to take representations from any organisations and individuals who wish to put forward their ideas.  That is very important at this <Col N="1446" /> stage.  I hope also that we will have the pleasure of seeing the kind of legislation that we are talking about coming in here fairly quickly.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I think it was well worth while that we have had this debate and I look forward to hearing further development from the other side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker, I am glad that we have this debate in the House but I am sorry that it has to be from 7.00 p.m. until 8.30 p.m. when, with respect to our colleagues in the media, not a great deal of attention is paid to what is said during this hour and a half in the House.  We are dealing here with a very important matter which I am quite sure most of us are concerned with.  I would say that more and more of us are learning more and more of what is happening in this area.  Many of the schools, certainly in my area and I am sure in others as well, have in recent times been so concerned about the problem that they have organised meetings of parents and have invited some guest speakers to meetings in the evenings to discuss this very problem.  It is quite alarming and I would welcome some swift legislation to deal with it.  I know that there are parents in every area who are very concerned and are prepared to spend quite an amount of time and do what they can not only to highlight the problem but if at all possible to put forward suggestions as to how it can be dealt with.  However, no matter what is done outside this House, it will not be successful until the nettle is grasped here and we have some supporting legislation for those who are showing such concern about the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not take a great deal of alertness to witness the number of young people drinking, some of them under age.  To blame those who serve it or the publicans really is only passing the buck because as the law stands it is not easy for a barman who may be employed by a firm, an individual, or the owner, the publican himself, to determine whether a young person is under age.  However, my concern is not so much that there is under-age drinking and that a person is 16, 17, 18 <Col N="1447" /> or 20 but that there is so much drinking, even if a person is within the law in ordering drink and taking it on the premises or taking it home and drinking it elsewhere. It is very alarming and we should be as concerned as those parents who are calling these meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you for allowing me to raise this important question on the adjournment this evening. This question is not only an important local matter but is an important national one.</P>
      <P>It is a deplorable practice that information on important matters of this nature have to be dragged out of the Government in the House.  <i>The Irish Times</i> reported last week that CIE had placed an order for a number of coaches with a German firm.  Neither CIE nor the Minister for Transport has denied or affirmed those reports, either to <i>The Irish Times</i> or other newspapers, nor would they deny or confirm them to me.  It is disgraceful and cowardly behaviour on the part of the Minister and his Department. At the very time unemployment has reached one-eighth of a million, we hear that a number of coaches &mdash; it is reported as 20, we do not know the exact number but I presume we can drag that out of the Minister also &mdash; are ordered to be built in Germany when they could have been built at Inchicore, where there is a tradition of coach building for well over a century.  They are not being built at Inchicore because of the failure of the Government to decide on anything of a long-term nature as far as transport is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a long tradition of bus and rail coach building in Inchicore.  Inchicore, where I was born and reared and now, happily represent, was developed around both CIE works.  Every family in the area is deeply concerned by matters affecting CIE.  Inchicore has already gone through the major trauma of losing the bus building industry, not because of any lack of <Col N="1448" /> skills, or because of anything wanting on the part of the work force, but because of the disgraceful Government decision to dispose of the bus building industry to a private enterprise firm, whose major partner was from Belgium.  The net result was that it went totally wrong.  Van Hool McArdle caved in after a few years, the workers were left high and dry and the bus building industry closed down, never to be brought back to Inchicore.</P>
    <P>A new bus building industry has been created in Shannon but is lost to Inchicore, where the skills still exist, either among unemployed men or among men otherwise employed but not using those skills.  Ever since losing the bus building industry, there has been deep fear in Inchicore railway works about its future. At present, in Inchicore there is deep despair and anger.  The Minister has managed, on the very day that record unemployment is announced, to create, I do not know how many jobs, for Linke Hofmann Busch in Germany.  We cannot totally quantify the amount of job losses there will be in Inchicore and elsewhere in CIE as a result.  Fianna Fáil stated in their manifesto that they would create 10,000 new jobs from what they called import substitution.  They would make a transfer of 3 per cent from imports to home produced goods.  What has happened in the past four years is that we have increased imports by 2 per cent.  We are now buying from the Germans what we could produce at home.  We have a large work force of skilled men who are ready, willing and able to do this work. It is a disgraceful situation.  It is an appalling fact that not one of the Fianna Fáil Deputies for that area has ever raised this question in the House or is present for this debate.  That shows their concern for the fate of the work force in Inchicore.</P>
    <P>Not only is there despair and anger over this terrible decision and the way in which it was dragged out of the Minister, there is fear because of the uncertainty about the future.  There will be no reassurance in the reply that the Minister gave today to my question and to that of my colleague, Deputy Austin Deasy, shadow Minister for Transport.  The Minister said that in the meantime he would <Col N="1449" /> envisage that the provision of rail coaches at Inchicore will be necessary.  He uses the unusual word &ldquo;provision&rdquo;.  He does not say that the building of rail coaches is envisaged.  There is a total doubt about what the Minister said.  Will the Minister spell it out, loud and clear: is there a future for Inchicore works?  Is the CIE proposal to recreate a new coach building industry in Inchicore under their own aegis, in association with Linke, Hofmann Busch, going to be implemented. I do not want the Minister to fob me off or to fob the work force of Inchicore off by saying he is awaiting the McKinsey Report.  He has already put enough jobs on the long finger.  He has put 20 coaches, which could have been manufactured here, on the long finger.  The time for procrastination has long since gone.  The Minister has an absolute duty to the workers at Inchicore and their families, to make the provision about the future clear.  Will there or will there not be work?  Will rail coaches be built there? The Minister can, as is his wont, waffle in his reply but that reply will be circulated to every worker in Inchicore within 48 hours of this debate.  Let them judge whether the Minister is in the least concerned about them or their future.</P>
    <P>A most distressing thing about this whole matter is that the Minister's word is already totally devalued.  A commitment was given to the trade unions representing the Inchicore workers as part of the deal to get acceptance of the transfer of the bus building industry to Bombardier at Shannon, that there would be a rail coach building industry at Inchicore. That guarantee was given by the chairman of the CIE Board to the unions and to me personally when I headed a deputation to meet him.  This was the sop to get the unions to withdraw their opposition to the removal of the bus building industry from Inchicore to Shannon.  Not only that but it was guaranteed that this work would be done by CIE themselves using jigs and designs of Linke Hofmann Busch and not as previously proposed, have a rail coach building industry owned or controlled by Linke Hofmann Busch.</P>
    <P>This is all gone now or certainly put <Col N="1450" /> greatly in doubt by the disclosure here today dragged from the Minister.  In his reply to my supplementary questions and those of other Deputies the Minister said he was not aware that the chairman of CIE had given a commitment.  I do not believe the Minister, and if it is true that he was not so aware, he should resign in any case.  If he was not aware, it shows how unconcerned he is about the fate of Inchicore and its workforce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly have a very deep interest in representing the people of Inchicore and that general area and if the Deputy had any sense he would have an interest in it &mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash; because his own constituency is not a million miles from Inchicore works.  I want the Minister to clarify this point, whether he knew of the commitment given by the chairman of the Board of CIE that a rail coach building industry would be set up at Inchicore under the aegis of CIE, using jigs and designs of Linke Hofmann Busch provided the Government gave its approval. The Minister told me in reply to a previous question that such a submission had been made by CIE but that he had not made any decision on it.  That was a few months ago.  That is why I do not believe that the Minister did not know.  The Minister knew all right.  The Minister is laughing&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am laughing at the audacity of the Deputy in trying to twist words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is grinning at the fate of the workers of Inchicore and of that whole area.</P>

    <Col N="1451" />
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This decision will have much wider social implications than the survival of the Inchicore works.  It has major social connotations for the whole area, and Ballyfermot on the other side of the Inchicore works, out in to Drimnagh and Bluebell and so on where most of the workforce live.</P>
      <P>With unemployment so high here, it is a very sad day when we have to order from Germany coaches that could have been built here if a decision had been made in time by this careless, unconcerned, drifting Government and this careless, unconcerned, drifting Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the delay in issuing the findings of or the Government decision on the McKinsey Report is a legitimate reason for postponing the building of railway carriages so badly needed for our main railway lines.  It is now a legitimate reason.  I say in all sincerity that rail passenger coaches must be built for the simple reason that there is no way in which sections of the railway will be closed down as public opinion will not allow any further reduction in the present rail system.  It will not be tolerated and the Government know that.  Long ago they should have begun the construction of rail passenger coaches at Inchicore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that there are 343 rail carriages in use on our rail system and 207 of them are more than 20 years old.  I believe that the last time a railway passenger coach was delivered to CIE was in 1973, eight years ago.  The time for a construction programme is long overdue irrespective of the findings of the McKinsey Report.  No matter what the Government say one of their decisions will not be to reduce the railway system which in my opinion will have to be left in its entirety.  So that is not a valid reason for postponing construction of the coaches. Must we have another Buttevant train disaster before the Government realise that the rolling stock is in such a dilapidated condition?  If so, the Minister for Transport and the Government as a whole will be held responsible because there have been warnings time and again <Col N="1452" /> from CIE senior management that they have not sufficient rolling stock to operate the railway system properly.  Last summer the rail service between Cork and Youghal had to be discontinued because CIE did not have enough passenger coaches in service to run that scheduled summer operation.  In 1960 there were over 600 rail passenger coaches in operation in CIE; at present there are 343 and 207 of them are over 20 years old.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile there is a startling statistic which backs up my contention that any further portions of the railway system cannot be closed down.  In 1970 the railway system carried nine million passengers. By 1980 the number of passengers carried had doubled to 18 million and in the face of statistics like that, no Government could reduce the railway system any further.  The rail system must be retained in its entirety.  The Government are duty-bound to provide the rolling-stock which, as Deputy Mitchell said, was guaranteed to be built at Inchicore.  That is what we are asking tonight and what we asked today at Question Time, that there be a commitment and a definite time schedule for the construction of these locomotives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the cheap political gimmickry used in this debate tonight.  Every question asked today at Question Time was fully answered, and left no room for doubt in anybody's mind and for Deputy Mitchell to come in here and try to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; say that neither the Fianna Fáil Party nor I have any concern for the people of Inchicore.  We have a great deal more concern for them than the Opposition Deputies have and did not have to employ cheap political gimmickry in relation to the Inchicore situation.  To say to this House that my word is devalued is an insult.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>My word has never been devalued by anyone outside this House before I came into it or within it as long as I am here.  Neither Deputy Mitchell nor any other Opposition Deputy will come into this House and try to cast any reflection on my word.  My word, throughout my business career and in the other aspects of my life, is my bond.  No Deputy using cheap political gimmickry will undermine that situation, in regard to myself, the management of CIE or the trade unions.  I know a lot more about what is going on and if the Deputy bothered to find out the situation he could. The Deputy said such an assurance was given.  No such assurance was given.  The Deputy did not say where he got the assurance.  He certainly never got it from me and cannot talk about my word being devalued.  The Deputy must not try to mislead the House or, as he probably will, circularise the workers of Inchicore. The Deputy is trying to undermine the secure jobs which are there.  What I said today regarding the situation in Inchicore was quite clear to everybody.  The Deputy, however, is not interested in the truth and never was.  He is more interested in cheap political gimmickry like the circular he sent around to the people in Inchicore last July.  In that circular he did not say, as he has said tonight, that he got that assurance.  I am sure if he had had that assurance then he would have spoken about it.</P>

Never at any time was there any question of any rolling stock being unsafe as regards CIE or anybody else.</P>

I face up to the realities of life but the people opposite do not face up to them.  I heard Deputy Deasy accusing this Government of what they do or do not do.  All I have heard is muddled, woolly and double thinking.  The Opposition Deputies say to me &ldquo;what do you want to do, give <Col N="1455" /> away all the good parts of CIE to private enterprise?&rdquo;  That is on the record of the House, and the fact that I was told to do what I liked with the rest of CIE.</P>

I have plenty of evidence in the records of this House to show the thinking in relation to this.  I never heard a comment from the Deputies in relation to the McKinsey Report.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies want to sit there but do not want to engage in public debate.  Listen to this statement and I will give the Deputies a copy if they cannot understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say at the outset that the original CIE proposals in 1977 for the electrification of the Howth-Bray suburban services envisaged that the rolling stock would be supplied under an agreement with the German firm Linke Hofmann Busch which provided <i>inter alia</i> for the establishment of a coach-building industry at Inchicore.  The continued viability of this industry would have been dependent upon CIE acquiring 500 mainline coaches within the next ten years or so, including stock not only for the Howth-Bray service and the mainline services but also for an extended rapid rail service for Dublin.  CIE's definitive proposals for the extended rapid rail system have not been received.  The transport consultative commission, in the report dated March 1980 on passenger transport services in the Dublin area, recommended further evaluation of the extended rapid rail system having regard to the scale of the expenditure involved.  A working group under the auspices of the Dublin Transportation Task Force is looking into the question, along with other rail and road transport investment proposals for the Dublin area in order to get a complete picture of needs and priorities.  Similarly, <Col N="1456" /> CIE's proposals for new mainline coaches which envisage a total of 242 units in the period up to 1987 could not be considered, pending the outcome of the McKinsey study of CIE which was initiated in late 1979.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The long finger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should listen, or he will not be able to understand this as well.  It will be appreciated, therefore, that decisions on CIE's original proposals for the establishment of a coach-building industry at Inchicore were preempted by a number of factors.  In addition, the trade unions were opposed to the proposals, in so far as they involved Linke Hofmann Busch as a principal.  In the meantime, decisions had to be taken on the acquisition of rolling stock for the Howth-Bray line.  The conditions of the existing suburban coaches, allied to the growing number of passengers, is making it increasingly difficult for CIE to maintain its services.  The total number of coaches required for the electrified service is 80, comprising 40 electric units and 40 trailer cars.  Even under the CIE original proposals, it was not envisaged at any stage that the 40 motor units would be built here.  Moreover, the Linke Hofmann Busch proposals were based on the development of a manufacturing facility by first building the mainline stock and following with the suburban trailer cars. It will be clear, therefore, that the question of supply of some of the rolling stock for the Howth-Bray line from Inchicore hinged on CIE's original proposal for a package agreement with Linke Hofmann Busch.  Since that package agreement could not be proceeded with, the only way to ensure that the rolling stock for the Howth-Bray line would be available in time for the introduction of electric services early in 1983 was to get it from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in this House today, CIE have placed an order with a German firm for the provision of the rolling stock.  The placing of an order does not, of course, mean the disemployment, as was suggested, of any people at Inchicore.  I am, of course, anxious to ensure the creation of as much employment in this country as <Col N="1457" /> possible.  As far as rail coach-building is concerned, I indicated in my reply today that I envisaged that the provision of rail coaches at Inchicore would be necessary. What remains to be determined is the scope and extent of the activities which will be involved.  Naturally, this will depend on the Government's considerations of the McKinsey Report and on whatever decisions are taken regarding the long-term role of the railway.  The capital allocation for CIE in 1981 is £49 million, which is double the allocation for 1980 which, in itself, represented a 60 per cent increase on the previous year.  So much for the accusations of no capital allocations.  The allocation of £49 million represents a huge sum of money in any one year for any undertaking and it contains adequate provisions for CIE to proceed with the acquisition of new mainline coaches in 1981.  As Deputies will be aware, the Government have stated that the McKinsey proposals on CIE are to be the subject of open debate.  I indicated quite clearly in my reply here today that nobody sets up a business until he, first of all, quantifies what he needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter will be the subject of discussion between the trade unions and myself in the very near future and with the board of CIE in the very near future.  Let me tell the Deputies that the scares which the Deputies are trying to put around here today are totally unfounded.  I could quote as many newspaper reports as Deputy Mitchell did that would give a totally different view.  I know the game that the Deputy is playing here tonight.  It is to undermine the confidence of CIE workers in Inchicore and indeed, in Deputy Deasy's allegations, to undermine the total confidence of the CIE work force in this Government.  That is not going to happen.  The Deputies will, at some stage, have the opportunity to put it to the test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say to Deputy <Col N="1458" /> Mitchell that all the factors which he mentioned here this evening, I have no doubt, were taken fully into consideration by the CIE board when they reached their decision in relation to the procurement of mainline coaches for the Howth-Bray electrification.  Is the Deputy seriously suggesting that the carriages which are there should be left there? Does he ever travel on that line?  I have travelled on it and I know the state of the carriages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>All the factors which the Deputy has mentioned here today and tonight would have been taken into consideration by the board of CIE in relation to their decision in the final analysis. Job creation will be maximised and I have always said it would be maximised. I have told CIE that, in relation to the Howth-Bray line.  The Deputy may not be aware that 70 jobs are being created down in Tralee in relation to it.</P>

      <P>The record is clear.  I do not fob off anybody.  I do not stand away from questions and never did.  I keep answering them, but if people cannot understand, or if they are not getting the answers that they want, well I cannot help that.  There was no assurance given by me.  My word is my bond and I stand over that.  If the Deputies have assurances from anybody else, I say, go back to where they got them and do not try to mislead this House or the constituents or anybody else by saying they got the assurances from me, because they did not.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the Government's Investment Plan 1981 which indicated that the Government have decided on a programme of small airports to serve particular regions.  As stated in the investment plan an airport is at present under construction at Sligo and Waterford and two further airports are planned for the West and North West, one in County Mayo and the other in County Donegal.</P>
      <P>Work on the first stage of the development of the Sligo Airport, which is situated near Strandhill, began in November 1980 and is expected to take up to 1½ years to complete.  It is hoped that the new runway facility will be completed by the end of April 1981.</P>
      <P>In so far as the proposed new airport for County Mayo is concerned I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave on 17 December 1980 to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Robby Molloy on the subject.</P>
      <P>In relation to County Donegal, a site at Big Isle near Letterkenny has been selected and negotiations regarding the acquisition of the necessary land are at an advanced stage.  Pending completion of these negotiations I am not in a position to indicate when construction work will begin or when the proposed airport will become operative.</P>

      <P>Statistics supplied to me by An Bord Pleanála show that in 1980 almost 30 per cent of appeals were decided in 20 weeks or less; 60 per cent were decided in 30 weeks or less, and 90 per cent in 50 weeks or less.</P>
      <P>As An Bord have pointed out, the time taken can be affected in a major way by procedures, and by factors outside their control, such as delays in submitting grounds of appeal, requests that appeals be held in abeyance, awaiting documents from local authorities, circulation of documents, new issues arising and, in some cases, inadequate plans submitted with original planning applications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if the refund of the second moiety of rates to farmers between £40 and £60 rateable valuation applied to farmers within urban areas; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Relief of the second moiety of rates in 1980 was granted in respect of all land holdings which had valuations between £40 and £60, and to which the provisions of the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Acts, 1939 to 1980 apply. These Acts, which provide the statutory basis for the agricultural grant, apply to land in county health districts and to land in areas added to county boroughs, boroughs and urban districts since the 2nd March, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relief of the second moiety thus applied to all holdings whether situated in rural or in urban areas which would otherwise have lost relief in 1980 by reason of the change from £60 to £40 in the valuation limits applicable for the purpose of the agricultural grant rate reliefs. The agricultural grant rate reliefs, including the relief of the second moiety for holdings in the £40 to £60 valuation category, <Col N="1313" /> have no application in relation to other land in urban areas.</P>
    <P>Such land continues to benefit from a separate statutory scheme of reliefs which is not affected in any way by changes in the agricultural grant allowances and under which the land is rated on a fraction only of its valuation.</P>

    <P>(1) 311 persons arrested and 301 convicted; (2) 4 persons arrested and 4 convicted; (3) There has been no change in the practice of the Garda Síochána in regard to such arrests.  Arrests continue <Col N="1316" /> to be made for soliciting and, in fact, the number of such arrests increased in 1980. (4) I received from the Deputy a list of men and women alleged to be, respectively, pimps and prostitutes and I forwarded it to the Garda authorities.  The Gardaí indicated that many of the persons on the list were known to them and that prosecutions are brought where sufficient evidence to justify prosecutions is available.  In some cases, the women whose evidence would be essential may be unwilling or afraid to give evidence. Moreover, some of the men and some of the women named in the list are believed to be married couples.  (5) The Garda authorities state that allegations of male prostitution which came to their notice in recent days are being investigated but that apart from that they have no evidence on the matter.  (6) No complaints have been received by the Garda authorities in regard to soliciting in massage parlours.  Three persons were convicted in 1980 as a result of a prosecution brought in connection with the operation of a brothel.</P>

      <P>The following table shows the numbers of persons on the Live Register at the local employment office in Tipperary town at dates at the end of June and December for the years from 1934 to 1980.  It must be borne in mind that changes made in the administration of the social welfare regulations and other changes in the coverage of the Live Register affect the comparability of these figures over time.  The following are the principal considerations which should be noted in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  The figures for the period from 1966 to 1980 exclude persons on systematic short-time and persons aged 65 years and <Col N="1317" /> over &mdash; thus providing, in this sense, a series consistent with the revised coverage of the Live Register as introduced in January 1980.  Such persons are included in the figures for earlier years.</P>
    <P>2.  The conditions under which persons are eligible for social insurance cover have been changed from time to time.</P>
    <P>3.  Following the introduction of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965, smallholders were excluded from the Live Register as from January 1966.</P>
    <P>4.  The operation of Employment Period Orders from 1935 to 1966, and again in 1971, which excluded certain persons from the receipt of unemployment assistance between March and November in each of these years.</P>
    <P>5.  The condition which applied to single women and widows who were applicants for unemployment assistance were relaxed as from 1 October 1978.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;a long service soldier&rdquo; i.e. a soldier who is specially re-engaged for such further period of service in the Forces as will when added to the period already served by him in the Permanent Defence Force before such re-engagement make a total period of 21 years or more, in the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>Gratuities to long service soldiers are calculated by taking a week's pay at the date of retirement and multiplying it by the number of years service.</P>
    <P>A gratuity is not payable under the scheme to any soldier if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  being a short-service soldier he is discharged or transferred to the Reserve on compassionate ground prior to the termination of his Army service.</P>
    <P>(b)  he is discharged as a result of his conviction by a Court Martial or a civil court, or</P>
    <P>(c)  he is discharged as of &ldquo;bad&rdquo; character, or</P>
    <P>(d)  being a short service soldier he is discharged by purchase.</P>
    <P>(e)  he is discharged for general misconduct.</P>
    <P>2.  The number of short service soldiers discharged in 1980 who received gratuities was 821.  The number of long service soldiers totalled 237.</P>
    <P>Officers' Gratuities:</P>
    <P>3.  A flat rate gratuity of approximately 80 per cent of a year's pay is payable to an officer who retires voluntarily after 20 years' service (in addition to retired pay).</P>
    <P>Flat rate gratuities of lesser amounts are payable to officers retiring voluntarily with 12 years or more service and less than 20 years (in addition to retired pay).</P>
    <P>Where an officer retires within five years of the age limit prescribed for his rank the gratuity is pay-related; the maximum gratuity, equal to 1½ years' pay, is payable to an officer retiring on age grounds or within 2 years of the retiring age for his rank (in addition to retired pay).  A short service gratuity (20 days' pay for each year of service) is payable to an officer who retires voluntarily and whose pensionable service is five years or more but less than 12 years.</P>
    <P>A minimum gratuity of one year's pay is payable in the case of an officer who dies in service.</P>
    <P>Seventy-one officers who retired in 1980 were paid gratuities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1327" /> Gratuities for extension of service:</P>
    <P>4.  (1) The following gratuities are payable to a non-commissioned officer or private who is permitted to extend his current period of Army service (three years):</P>
    <P>(a)  to complete 6/7 years from date of original enlistment £300 (£400 Naval Service).</P>
    <P>(b)  to complete 9 years from date of original enlistment £150.</P>
    <P>(c)  to complete 12 years from date of original enlistment £120.</P>
    <P>Where the original period of service was 6 years and that period of service is extended the following gratuities are payable:</P>

      <P>In July 1980 the EEC Council of Agricultural Ministers adopted a new Regulation 1820/80/EEC which provides for the stimulation of agricultural development in the less-favoured areas of the west of Ireland.  These areas include the Counties of Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo and parts of Counties Cork and Limerick.  Pursuant to the new regulation a programme has been submitted to the Commission and, if it is accepted, I hope to announce the implementation of an improved grant structure for group water schemes carried out within the framework of the approved programme.  I am hopeful that the proposals will be approved in the near future, particularly since I understand that any scheme commenced prior to EEC approval of the programme will not qualify for the grants under the western package.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he has received representations from the Meath Trade Union Council regarding delays in the Labour Court; the action he proposes to take in the matter; and if he is satisfied that claims are dealt with sufficient speed by the Court.</P>

      <P>I have received the representations referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In the absence of specific information I am unable to comment on alleged delays in any individual cases which the Deputy may have in mind.</P>
      <P>However, the full operation of four divisions of the Labour Court has helped to reduce any delays which may have occurred in the periods between the holdings of conciliation conferences and formal court hearings and in the periods between those hearing and the issues of court recommendations to parties.</P>
      <P>Difficulties, which cause delays, have been encountered by the court in arranging hearings with parties to disputes. During 1980, at the request of parties to disputes, some 60 postponements of cases listed for hearings by the court were granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1362" /> During 1980 the court issued 802 recommendations, determinations and decisions. The corresponding figures for the two previous years are 576 (1979) and 545 (1978).  If the Deputy will let me have particulars of any individual complaints of delay, I shall be happy to inquire into it.</P>
