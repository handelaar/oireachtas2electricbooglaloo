      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 4, 1, 12 (resumed), 13 (resumed), 14 (resumed), 15, 2 (Order for Second Stage followed by Second Stage), 5 and 6.  I propose to make a statement to the House at 3.30 p.m. on the recent Summit Meeting of the EEC Heads of Government in London.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach give us some information about the proposed legislation dealing with rent controlled dwellings following the Supreme Court decision earlier this year?  He will agree that this will be fairly complex but important legislation.  I would like to know when we will have this Bill because I understand it is necessary to have the legislation passed before the recess, and we are prepared to facilitate the Government in having it so passed.  It is very important that we have the Bill at an early stage and on this occasion I would ask the Taoiseach to let us have, with the Bill, a very comprehensive Explanatory Memorandum.</P>

    <P>(7)  That five members of the Joint Committee shall form a quorum of whom at least one shall be a member <Col N="777" /> of Dáil Éireann and at least one shall be a member of Seanad Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation was first established in 1973. It is dissolved when the Dáil and Seanad are dissolved, and must be re-constituted by orders passed by each House of the Oireachtas after a general election.  An expediency motion to this effect has already been passed in the Seanad, and Dáil Éireann is to-day called upon to do likewise, in order that the new committee may be set up and commence work as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It was decided when we joined the European Communities to set up a committee to examine Community legislation, and to supervise its implementation in Ireland.  It is vital that such a committee should exist in order to monitor this body of external law which is now a part of our national system.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the joint committee, as formulated in 1977, give the committee authority to examine Community legislation at three stages in the process of its adoption.  It may examine legislation at the draft stage, it may examine Community Acts, and, finally, it may examine ministerial regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972, and instruments made under other statutes in order to implement our Community obligations.</P>
    <P>The new joint committee will consist of 18 Members of Dáil Éireann, and eight Members of the Seanad, thus totalling 26, which is the same number as its predecessor. I should like to pay tribute to the work of previous joint committees, all of which have done vast amounts of work with very little public recognition. Much of the Community legislation is of a highly complex and technical nature, which makes the task even more demanding. The committee select for examination those draft Acts which they consider of particular importance to Ireland and they examine all statutory instruments made to implement Community laws.  Reports to the Houses of the Oireachtas are then prepared.  During the last session 94 reports were prepared by the joint committee, nine of which were <Col N="778" /> considered by the Seanad.  Of these nine, two were also considered by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>When constituting the joint committee in 1977 the Government took into account the recommendations which the first committee made in their 55th report, published in March 1977.  Among the recommendations taken on board were: provision for the appointment of substitutes to act for members who are unable to attend particular meetings, and provision that Members of either House of the Oireachtas though not members of the committee be allowed to attend their meetings and take part in proceedings without having a right to vote.  The proposed terms of reference for the forthcoming joint committee remain largely the same as in 1977, apart from two recommended changes which I will briefly mention.</P>
    <P>In a report of March 1980 the committee recommended certain amendments to its orders of reference taking cognizance of the fact that the European Assembly is now a directly elected body.  The first of these has been incorporated in the motion before the House, that is, that the phrase which provided that &ldquo;delegates to the Assembly of the European Communities be notified of meetings and be allowed to attend and take part in the proceedings without having a right to vote&rdquo;, be amended to read that &ldquo;representatives in the European Assembly, who are also members of either House of the Oireachtas&rdquo; have the privilege set out above.  The effect of this change is merely to formalise an existing state of affairs, namely, that members of European Parliament are no longer appointed by the Dáil, apart from those filling casual vacancies, but are elected by direct universal suffrage.</P>
    <P>The second recommendation concerns the question of membership of the joint committee by MEP's.  Before the 1979 European elections Members of the Oireachtas nominated as members of the European Parliament were <i>ex-officio</i> members of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation.  This arrangement was not in practice a success and the terms of reference of the committee appointed in 1977 expressly stated that <Col N="779" /> members of the European Parliament would be precluded from membership of the joint committee.  They would, however, be notified of meetings and be allowed to attend and take part in the proceedings without having a right to vote.  The committee also recommended that the phrase which precludes members of the European Parliament from membership of the committee be deleted.  This suggestion has not been adopted.  Rather, the whole question of the relationship between MEPs and the Dáil and Seanad will be examined by the joint committee. Provision has been made for this by an addition to the terms of reference of the committee which gives them a mandate &ldquo;to examine the question of dual membership of the Dáil or Seanad and the European Assembly, and to consider the relations between the Irish Representatives in the European Assembly and the Dáil and Seanad...&rdquo;.  The Government consider that the joint committee, which has already touched on aspects of this question of the dual mandate and the overall relationships between the Oireachtas and the European Assembly, is the proper forum for the examination of these questions.  The House will recall having debated and agreed on this point on 28 October last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion primarily reconstitutes the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities which has been in existence since our accession to the EEC, and we support that move.  The joint committee have done excellent work and operated in a flexible manner since their formation in the sense that they have allowed non-committee members who are Members of the Oireachtas to attend and contribute without a right to vote.  A similar situation has existed with regard to members of the European Parliament.  I regard the attendance of members of the European Parliament as an important factor because they can bring to bear at meetings up-to-date information on matters that have come before the Parliament. They can give the up-to-date and current advice on deliberations of the <Col N="780" /> joint committee in relation to regulations and Community legislation.  I take it that the precedent that was established in 1973 whereby the chairman of the joint committee was selected from the Opposition will continue.  That situation obtained from 1973 to 1977 and from 1977 to 1981 when we had different Governments. The new addition to the mandate referred to by the Minister of State concerns paragraph (1) (b) of the motion, which states:</P>
      <P>(b) to examine the question of dual membership of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann and the European Assembly and to consider the relation between the Irish representatives in the European Assembly and Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann and to report thereon to both Houses of the Oireachtas;</P>
      <P>During a debate on a motion put down by us concerning the dual mandate the Minister said rightly on 28 October that this whole aspect of the dual mandate was raised by me.  We had a constructive debate on that occasion and the Government intimated that the whole question would be examined in detail and that there was merit in the point of view put forward by us on that occasion.  They intimated that the whole question of dual membership of the European and national assemblies was an appropriate question to be examined by the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  I am very pleased that the two aspects of dual membership are included in the mandate to the committee.  First there is the question of dual membership itself.  Having argued the pros and cons of that matter I am strongly of the opinion that the dual mandate has resulted in a situation in which, by reason of the complexity of the work involved in the European Assembly, it can no longer continue as a suitable way in which Irish interests can be represented within the European Assembly by Deputies who at the same time are working members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I take it that that will be the nub of the examination by the committee of the question as to whether that proposition of mine is valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of the mandate is to <Col N="781" /> consider the relations that are to exist in the future between representatives of the European Parliament and their position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Oireachtas.  The two are related but slightly different.  If my proposition in regard to the dual mandate having ended its usefulness and its being a bad situation is accepted, I would urge that as a <i>caveat</i> on that proposition there must be a connection between membership of the European Assembly and membership of the Oireachtas.  It would be wrong and a very serious situation if one adopted the proposition that dual membership was no longer sustainable and provided for a situation whereby a member, on election to the European Parliament, would cease to be a Member of the Oireachtas without there being some provision for maintaining the connection between the two bodies.  That is the important aspect in the second leg of the mandate.  I am confident that the proposition in regard to the abolition of dual membership will be accepted, and following that there can be constructive examination as to what is put in its place in order to maintain the connection between the European Assembly and the national Parliament.  It is essential that this be done.  It would be very unwise to do otherwise from the national point of view because Ireland would then be electing members to the European Parliament who would have no connection with or no say in the working of this Parliament and its committees.  If we break the system of dual membership it is vital that we replace it with some more refined type of connection.</P>
    <P>There are various other options open to us in this respect.  For instance, the right of audience for members of the European Parliament should be considered here in the context of debates in both Houses concerning aspects of the Communities, whether these debates be at six-monthly intervals or otherwise. However, I understand that there are constitutional and legal difficulties in that regard but at least the prospect should be examined.  I am not suggesting that these people would have the right to vote here but they should have the right to put forward their points of view in both <Col N="782" /> Houses of the Oireachtas during debates concerning the Communities.  In that situation they should be automatically <i>ex offico</i> members of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities because it would be very important that that be the position. It is at that committee level that they could bring their particular expertise to bear especially having regard to the fact that the committee is largely an expertise-type exercise.  Most of the real work of the European Parliament also is committee-type work.  I hope, therefore, that in reconstituting this committee it will be found possible to include as fully <i>ex officio</i> members those people who are members of the European Parliament. To sum up, therefore, I am very much against the dual mandate but equally I urge the maintenance of a connection in some form between the members of the European Assembly and this Parliament.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter, though this is one for the political parties.  So far as we are concerned we devised our own structure to ensure continuing membership of the party so far as European Deputies are concerned.  The dual mandate does not obtain so far as our party members in the European Parliament are concerned but they are members of our parliamentary party is composed of three tiers, the Dáil tier, the Seanad tier and the European Parliament tier.  In this way we help to maintain the important and vital connection of which I have been speaking. I am sure the other parties will do likewise.  I welcome the motion on behalf of this party and would like to hear from the Minister that the precedent of having a main opposition member as chairman of the committee will continue and that the excellent work in which the committee have been engaged since their setting up will continue in the Dáil session ahead.</P>

      <P>The Minister has told us that it was decided when we joined the EEC to set up a committee to examine Community legislation and to supervise its implementation in Ireland.  I understand that this committee we are talking <Col N="783" /> of is one set up for the purpose of interpreting European legislation and ensuring that it is implemented here in accordance with EEC directives.  Having regard to the amount of important legislation that passes through the European Parliament, this must be one of our important committees.  A point that I have made many times before is that I would much prefer us to have a committee who would examine legislation before it was passed in the European Parliament rather than merely to examine it afterwards and to interpret how it should be implemented here.  There is a certain irrelevancy.  We get a directive from Europe and we have to implement it and the committee have to be quite expert in interpreting directives. On the domestic front we have examples of differences of opinion where the implementation of legislation is concerned. Take, for example county councils who adopt a county plan.  When it comes to implementing that plan the question of interpretation arises and nine times out of ten there will be disagreement. The same situation can arise on the interpretation of directives and legislation passed in Europe.  My worry is that we might be too strict in our interpretation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lenihan said the committees in the past did great work and I agree with him but I wonder if we are too good Europeans when it comes to interpretation. I agree with Deputy Lenihan that MEPs should be automatically members of this committee.  We are against dual membership but I think all of us would be in favour of MEPs being on this committee because they would know more about the legislation passed in Europe.  I referred to the difficulty of implementation and interpretation where county councils are concerned.  Differences of opinion between officials and county councillors can arise as to what constitutes an amenity.  In the case of the European Parliament there could be a totally different interpretation as between those enacting the legislation and those who are called upon to implement it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important committee. <Col N="784" /> We should have an opportunity to discuss proposed legislation in the European parliament before it is enacted and there should be flexibility in interpretation of both legislation and directives.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to put on record my appreciation of the constructive approach adopted by the Opposition on the establishment of this joint committee.  Its two predecessors did excellent work and it is certainly in the interests of the country that this committee should get under way as quickly as possible to continue the excellent work done by its predecessors.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lenihan raised a point about the chairmanship of the committee.  I am not in a position to give a final answer on this.  He referred to the precedent established and I will recommend to the Government that that precedent should continue. He raised the question of the dual mandate.  We debated that at the end of October and I agree with him it would be very unwise to abolish dual membership and put nothing in its place.  The mandate still exists in eight of the ten countries in the Community though it is being phased out gradually.  The possibility &mdash; I would say the probability &mdash; is that it will be phased out here in the future.  There will always have to be some linkage because MEPs who are so involved in the running of European affairs have a great deal to offer from the point of view of holding a brief here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best option to ensure that the greatest benefit accrues to the country must be considered by the committee and this is a question that must be considered on an all-party basis.  There are a number of options.  There is the possibility of the right of audience here and in the Seanad and whether that should be confined or general.  Constitutional problems may arise and this is an area that will need very careful examination.  Another option is the possibility of <i>ex officio</i> membership of the joint committee.  There is too a possibility of a consultative committee as between the joint committee and MEPs.  There may be still others and it will be a very important part of the <Col N="785" /> work of the new committee to examine this very serious question.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Callanan that this is a most important committee.  It will, of course, have the power to examine draft legislation.  It is a very important part of the work of the committee and I want to put on record now a tribute to the staff of the two preceding committees.  I was a member of the last committee and the volume of paper they had to sift through to ensure the committee got all the relevant documentation was simply enormous. I pay tribute to them for their excellent work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I spoke about the importance of training our young people to enable us to make the maximum use of the resources we have.  Imported industrial technology will not be as easy to find in the years immediately ahead as it has been in the past. On the last occasion one speaker talked about a preference by young people for white collar jobs.  He quoted some studies which went to show that this preference has its origin in parental attitudes.  There should be no mystery about that.  It is quite obvious to us why parents want to get their children into this type of job.  It is as obvious as 60 or 70 years ago when a mother wanted her daughter to marry the man with the big business or the big farm.  Parents always wish their children to take up the type of jobs that will give them higher rates of pay, a greater level of security and less pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what this preference is about. It is not an unexplainable social phenonenom that people want to get into this type of employment.  We have only to look at the rates of pay applicable to apprentices and compare them with the wages available to young people joining county councils, health boards or the civil service.  We can easily see why parents <Col N="786" /> want their children to get those types of jobs.  The average young person earns £50 a week if he becomes an apprentice welder or an apprentice technician.  If a young person of the same age with a similar standard of education joins a county council as a clerk typist that person will get £89 a week.  If a young person with the leaving certificate joins a county council, a health board or the civil service that person will get almost £100 per week. We recognise those people have sheltered and comfortable employment. They have absolute security because it is almost unheard of for any person who gets into the public service to have any difficulty in retaining that job.  It is very questionable if they have to compete for their promotion and their increased rates of pay in the same way that people in trades and industry must.  They do not face the prospect of redundancy or collapse of their employment.</P>
    <P>Labour is like any other market which affects people.  Over the years when it was realised that there was an overwhelming preference for jobs in county councils and the civil service that should have been balanced out by an evening out in the rates of pay in the different sectors, but this has not happened.  The gap has tended to get wider.  Those most sought after jobs are the more highly paid jobs.  The fact that those jobs are sought after by everybody does not seem to encourage any sort of reduction in the rates of pay or the preferential situation those people have.  I accept it is not easy to do something about this.  We should plan deliberately to make the various occupations attractive to everybody.  We have a habit, as politicians, of saying that the Army, the Garda Síochána, the civil service and the health boards are vital to society.  All jobs are of equal importance and the Government, who are the referees in all this, should try to create some sort of equality in conditions and payment to try to prevent this overwhelming preference for one sector over another by young people when they leave school. The Government should seek to correct this trend before a situation develops such as we have today when a young person in a health board starts off getting <Col N="787" /> double the rate of pay that a person in industry or an apprentice gets.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to regional employment and regional opportunities.  I am sure the Minister will take into consideration the employment of people in regional areas. In many rural areas there are no jobs for people in county councils.  Our young people answer advertisements for employment in the east of the country. We would like the Minister to do everything he can to redress this imbalance. The most important thing is to create jobs in rural areas for our young people.  It is obvious that we have a serious drift of young people from the land.  It is very hard to get precise figures for this but in the EEC in 1960 we had 3.8 million people between 14 years and 24 years, or 25 per cent of the active agricultural population, employed in agriculture.  In 1971 this was down to 0.9 million young people between the ages of 14 and 24, or 10 per cent engaged in agriculture.  I know there was a greatly reduced population in agriculture in 1971 but nevertheless there is a serious drop in the number of young people engaged in agriculture.  This is very noticeable in rural Ireland at the moment.  A qualified agriculturalist who went into a particular area could see only one successor for every ten people at present engaged in full-time employment on the land.  That is a worrying aspect of what is happening in rural Ireland.  It is a great pity, considering there will not be in the immediate future sufficient jobs available for all our young people, that we cannot replace employment in agriculture by young, competent trained people.</P>
    <P>I know it may not be the job of the Minister dealing with this Bill to deal with the whole problem of agricultural training and agricultural education because there is a separate body which deals with that.  I am very worried to see such a very large amount of money being raised while at the same time the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture may not be increased.  Agriculture represents a very large section of our total economy and if we are able to increase by £60 million or £70 million the amount of money available <Col N="788" /> for retraining and providing for young people in employment I believe that agriculture deserves something out of this expenditure or at least an equivalent expenditure in another area.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also consider that only 2 per cent of full-time farmers have had the benefit of one full years' training in that industry.  This is an important element in what has gone wrong in agriculture. We cannot go ahead in the agricultural industry with the level of training and education we have had in the past and get that industry to grow and be competitive.  I would like the Minister to comment on the regional aspect of this problem.  If there must be unemployment among young people it is more important to train the young people from rural Ireland in their own rural environment rather than to take them into the large towns and cities.  It is dangerous to establish all our training centres in the larger towns and cities.  We must do something about the drift of young people into the cities where they will remain unemployed for a period of time where, as was pointed out by Deputy Higgins and some other people, they are more likely to get into trouble than people who have full-time jobs.</P>
    <P>A very important element, which we did not foresee when we lifted the marriage bar and allowed wives to continue in employment, is that this has contributed to the problem we have today.  I am not suggesting that we should reverse this but we must recognise that the rise in unemployment has been contributed in part by the fact that very many young married couples are both working whereas 20 years ago both were not working and did not have the opportunity to work.  There is every evidence that the number of unemployed will increase in the near future in Ireland and in Europe, although studies indicate that after seven or eight years there will be more jobs than there are people available for them in Europe because of the low birth rate.  However, in Ireland in the foreseeable future the situation will be different.  It worries me that in ten years' time there may be many vacancies for jobs in Europe and if we do not succeed <Col N="789" /> in training and employing our young people here the cycle of emigration will start again.  That trend exists to some extent even now.</P>
    <P>In the short-term we will have to come to terms with the problem of the high proportion of unemployed.  There has been talk about work-sharing but I have always held that work-sharing in Ireland is not a solution.  It is not an answer to our economic problems to take people out of their place of employment and reduce their working hours.  We will not solve our economic problems in that way. We will solve them by getting people to work longer hours, to reduce the costs of production and become more competitive.</P>
    <P>I have no hang-up about work-sharing. Already we have gone more than halfway towards that because we have decided to share income.  If a person has no job it is accepted that that person will benefit from the fruits of the labour of those who are working and also from the fruits of his own labour when he was working.  Perhaps the best solution would be to use the money we are paying the unemployed to put it back into industry and to give people jobs even if it means subsidised employment.  It should not be too difficult to work out some such system. I do not believe industry has run out of work even though it may have run out of finance to create capital structures.  We need more telephones, more roads and more houses.  We have not run out of work.  We must find some way of training our young people and giving them employment on such work.  The amount of money spent on unemployment would go a long way towards employing them in the areas I have mentioned and we could get the cycle moving in another direction.</P>
    <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister for doing something about this matter. Everyone has been talking about this serious problem but this is the first significant effort by a Minister to come to terms with it.  I have warned him of where I think it could go wrong, by creating unreal employment that cannot last or by creating any kind of major administrative structure.  I want to see this money spent <Col N="790" /> in educating, training and preparing young people to do the work that is available and which needs to be done.  I congratulate the Minister on his major effort to obtain the resources to do the job.  The resources he will command are significant. I am sure that industry and individuals in employment will respond and will see this as a positive move by the Minister that will have the right effect on our prospects for the future.  I am confident that the Minister will use the money in the most appropriate way to solve the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to welcome the Minister and to congratulate him on his appointment.  This is his first Bill before the House and I should like to congratulate him on the presentation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>We support the Bill.  I especially support it provided the Minister excludes old age pensioners from the 1 per cent levy and that he excludes those people on the very lowest incomes, and here I am thinking of the impact on families.  He will have our support provided the money is used to create additional employment and additional training, apprenticeship and work schemes and also provided the Bill will include the disabled.</P>
      <P>At Question Time we had an opportunity to raise the matter of old age pensioners and the Minister told us he will exclude them.  I am very happy with that aspect.  He is considering what might be done in relation to those on the lowest incomes and I am happy with that.  I am very concerned to ensure that additional employment will be provided and we will be looking closely at different aspects of the Bill and its implementation to ensure this is done.  I was disappointed the disabled were not mentioned in the Minister's speech.  I urge him to include them in a very positive way.  I know he mentioned people in particularly disadvantaged conditions and circumstances that arise from their local environment but I ask him to include specifically the disabled. They should be referred to very clearly in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no mention of a fund in the Bill.  I should prefer to see a fund established however it was operated.  It is mentioned <Col N="791" /> that the operation of a fund can be complicated and technical but if a fund were established we would be able to see what happened to the money.  In addition, I think the agency should have a fund available.  I should prefer also to see a separate agency free from the undue influence of the Department of Finance. Some speakers have pointed to the many references in the Bill and in the Minister's speech to the function of the Department of Finance in relation to the agency.  I should prefer to see it based on the concept of a development corporation. There are many examples of attempts to establish such a concept and this is one area where it should be applied.  Further, I should prefer to see a list of some of the new jobs and the kind of jobs proposed in the Bill.  The Minister has not told us anything about that.  He has said the Bill will co-ordinate activities and support them but he has not given any indication of the new activities and the ideas that might be introduced in this area.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to see a more equitable form of collection.  There is reliance on the easy way out of putting it on people paying PAYE and PRSI.  I know it is on health charges, which extends it somewhat. I asked a question in the House in July about the distribution of the new health charges and found that, of the £86 million to be collected under them, £76 million will come from those paying PAYE and PRSI, £5 million from the farming sector and £5 million from self-employed. Taking that overall it means that the PAYE sector will pay 88 per cent of this.  We know that it is very difficult to collect money under the health system. The Minister cannot deny this.  We hear from farmers recently, particularly in their statements last week, that they are thinking of withholding health charges totally.  Hopefully they will not.  At present there is considerable difficulty and inefficiency in collecting health charges.</P>
    <P>While the estimated figure is set within £63 million, the actual collection will be considerably less than that.  I have no doubt that those paying PAYE and PRSI will contribute over 90 per cent of the cost.  This kind of inequity is in too many <Col N="792" /> of the Government's schemes.  It will bear too heavily on the PAYE sector.  Most people would be happy to contribute 1 per cent for specific purposes as long as they can see where it is going and are satisfied it is not being absorbed into the Government coffers.  I am not happy about the way the Minister is going about this.  I am unhappy about the omission of the disabled.  I am sure the Minister did not intend to omit them, but he should make it clear, especially in this year of the disabled, that this Bill is for them also.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to previous performance and I am happy to note that he agrees that the position has improved. He said it was encouraging that unemployment had been rising more slowly in recent months, with the rate of increase since the end of April being under 1 per cent per month as compared with 2½ per cent per month between December 1979 and April 1981.  This must be related to the investment programme.  The whole purpose of the £1,700 million investment programme at the beginning of the year was to stimulate employment in a range of areas.  This could not have had any effect until the May period.  It can be seen from events subsequently that it did have an effect.  That is important because it shows that, if we invest money in areas of creative and productive employment and in general areas of infrastructural development and housing, that will help the situation in a real way.  The Minister indicated clearly what had been happening in that regard.</P>
    <P>Despite what is in this Bill we know that the Minister for Finance has been clawing back some of the funds which were made available.  In the Department of Health I know that a number of projects have been stopped.  I asked a question about this and got an answer giving a list of the projects which were stopped at contract stage.  They would have created 500 jobs.  This represented a £2.5 million clawback on the capital budget announced in the Estimates the week before last.  We find difficulty in dealing with the Government because on the one hand we are talking about an agency which is supposed to be creating jobs <Col N="793" /> and, on the other, the Minister for Finance is stopping projects and the building industry is suffering as a result. This worries us and particularly so when we hear the leader of the Labour Party say that he is pessimistic about the future in this regard.  Unless he agrees to further cutbacks on a capital basis, I do not see why he has to be as pessimistic as he is. He said he did not see unemployment falling below 125,000 and mentioned a figure of 145,000 in the not too distant future.  Other commentators visualise a figure of 200,000 unemployed.  We must act to reduce unemployment.  The Minister has shown what the investment programme can do.  Unless we invest substantially we will not create jobs.</P>
    <P>I am aware, and the Minister also said in the House a few weeks ago, that there are 3,801 jobs in the public service which have been held up.  On the one hand, the Minister for Labour says that we must create jobs and, on the other hand, the Minister for Finance puts an embargo on jobs.  That makes it very difficult to believe in the Government.  I am concerned that the Minister has taken the easy way out of putting the main burden on the PAYE sector, who are already under siege.  They are beginning to realise that.  The Minister could have chosen other ways to raise the money.  It could have been collected from banks, insurance companies, or the luxury VAT rate. These groups will benefit from the increased apprenticeship schemes and the fact that more people will be available for employment through the Youth Employment Agency.</P>
    <P>A disadvantage of putting it on the PAYE worker is that a single person who earns £120 per week will pay £1.20 at 1 per cent.  A married man with three or four children who earns £120 a week will pay £1.20 also.  This is inequitable and indicates the weakness of going for the easy, quick method of collection without considering the social consequences of the measures taken.  One might ask what about employers?  Have they no contribution to make?  Is there an undue influence of the Fine Gael side within the Coalition in relation to the way this <Col N="794" /> money will be collected and the levy applied?</P>
    <P>As regards job creation, we all agree that the IDA are the principal authority and the one on which we rely most.  The Minister expressed some concern about their activity, which I shall come back to later.</P>
    <P>The NRB are the body who deal with the disabled.  This body have been reorganised during my period in office and their arm has been strengthened for the purpose of creation of employment and placing people therein.  It was heartening recently to see a 30 per cent increase in the employment of disabled this year under NRB schemes.  However, there are a lot of other works at the moment, and the Minister could have said that he would see some of the money going to increase the moneys available to these other works.  For instance, Dublin Corporation give tremendous employment and it would be good if they could be told now that they will get some money from this scheme to enable them to create employment right away.  Painters, journeymen and other skilled people who are out of work now are looking for opportunities and are prepared to take on apprentices and give them work.  For example, a number of our schools, community centres and public buildings are in need of painting.  Surely, on the old Keynesian approach, it is better to give some of these skilled people support from schemes such as this.  After all, this money is coming from my pocket, your pocket and the pockets of other PAYE people to solve short-term problems and to help improve the situation on a short-term basis.  It would be worth while to make some of this money available and let some of these people get on with work.  I know plenty of people on the north side of Dublin who could give employment to youth if this kind of work was there.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not given some indication of the kind of things he might do.  It is important to get people working now.</P>
    <P>It is particularly disillusioning and disheartening, and becoming increasingly so to realise the increasing numbers of unemployed.  In a survey of one of the <Col N="795" /> communities on the north side of Dublin it became clear that in many cases three, four or five people in the one family were unemployed.  It is bad enough to have one child unemployed.  Anyone who has a son or daughter will know that to have that child complete his or her education and then sit at home with nothing to do is very upsetting for that child, whose disillusionment is heartbreaking.  For that to continue for any length of time is a great upset to the whole family.  I would like to see the introduction of some special measure to deal with such situations. In some cases the father has been made redundant at perhaps 50 years of age because of present economic circumstances and he has two or three good grown-up boys or girls who at present are not working either.  Indirectly this brings us into the disadvantaged situation mentioned by the Minister.  I have some direct experience of that and it is not a very pleasant experience.  I would like to see some of this money applied very urgently in such areas.</P>
    <P>In my practice as a TD I find the work of AnCO in relation to work experience and apprenticeship programmes is first class.  The main problem is the question of having sufficient opportunities and places and consequently enough money to create these.  They have the mechanism to do the job and in trying to find places for the people such as I have mentioned earlier AnCO are a tremendous aid and the National Manpower Service likewise.  If they can be given additional funds they will do the job.</P>
    <P>One thing is happening in Britain which we should be very careful to see does not happen here.  We do not want to see the father's job being taken by the son.  A case was recently reported in Britain where the father was made redundant and the son was taken on through one of these schemes.  We must be careful about that, and here is where we come back to the expertise of the agencies.  The people in Manpower and AnCO have been working with these companies for some time, they know the situation and, generally speaking, they will be able to prevent that sort of thing happening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> We are talking here about additional money or, if we are not, the Government should be honest and say that they are just trying to sidle some of this money into the coffers of the Minister for Finance.  I am working on the basis that we are talking about additional money and we will be pursuing it on that basis subsequently.  I warn the Government that any shred of credibility they have will be lost if it is not seen clearly that this money is used in an additional sense.  Of course, this money could be used to extend the numbers in the Army, the Garda, the health services or the Naval Service for cadets, or in the State agencies such as B &amp; I, Bord Fáilte and so on who are employing people.  A number of these young men are very keen to get into the Army where, in the first instance, the training is very good for them.  It is to be hoped that some of the major investment programmes will have progressed by the time they will have done their Army service.  I would like the Minister in his reply to say how he envisages some of this additional money will be spent. He has given us no plans so far.</P>
    <P>Why have a new agency?  Does it mean that AnCO, the National Manpower Service or the IDA are defective in some way?  In relation to the IDA the Minister said:</P>
    <P>While some efforts have been made to remedy this imbalance they have lacked real conviction and consequently their impact has not been significant.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take that out of his speech and throw it away.  I would not like to have that on the record of this House in relation to the activities which have been undertaken by the IDA, AnCO and the National Manpower Service. It is not our experience either on the ground or in Government and I do not think that the Minister really believes that.  If he feels that there is a need for an additional agency he should talk about the value of the additional agency and not denigrate the activities of the existing bodies who have been working hard to try to meet a very difficult situation with considerable success, especially in comparison <Col N="797" /> with our European partners, in these recent years.</P>
    <P>Further on the Minister referred to the same theme and I quote:</P>
    <P>While the present and future activities of the IDA and other development bodies will go some way towards the necessary expansion in our productive capacity and in exports, the Government are convinced that further initiatives are needed.</P>
    <P>He said &ldquo;some way&rdquo;.  We must be very clear that the activities of the IDA must be our mainspring activity here to create productive employment.  They have gone a lot more than &ldquo;some way&rdquo; towards meeting the situation.  It is a suggestion that their efforts and operation have been defective in some way, and I do not agree with that.  We can all do with improving personally our own effectiveness in this House in Government, as backbenchers and so on.  By any standards the IDA have made a major contribution to solving the problems facing us.</P>
    <P>With regard to the whole question of the semi-State bodies in relation to the National Development Corporation the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The work of the corporation in promoting efficiency in this area will help develop a professional, vigorous and successful State sector which can contribute greatly to the growth of the economy.</P>
    <P>There are suggestions in the Minister's speech that these bodies are not pulling their weight or being effective.  If that is the case, then it is not desirable to make that kind of reference in a general way. The Minister should be more specific about where he believes this to be the case.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned that in this Bill and in these statements there might be a conspiracy between the National Development Corporation and this agency to take back the semi-autonomous powers from AnCO and the IDA, whose real virtues were their freedom from bureaucracy. We may disagree with some of the things they do, but the Minister should bear strongly in mind that it was their <Col N="798" /> very freedom which gave them that flair to attempt new projects.  It is well known that AnCO were most successful in developing our segment of the European Social Fund.  In the first instance it was their go-getting approach which set that under way.  Indeed they surprised everybody by the amount of money they were able to recoup from the European Social Fund.  I would be most concerned that the independent and autonomous nature of those activities might be affected in any way.  The Minister should take particular care that this new agency will not interfere in any bureaucratic way with the activities of those valuable organisations.</P>
    <P>I note that with regard to this agency that, right from the point of setting up, the Minister for Labour is dependent on the Minister for Finance for consent for action, change and so on.  Of course the Minister for Finance controls the finances down to the last penny.  Presumably, even if they want to buy toilet paper, they must get some form of clearance.  That is a dangerous sort of situation.  It is important to ensure that they be given the independence previously given to AnCO which they used successfully in tackling the tasks assigned to them.</P>
    <P>There is a danger also of some conflict of interest in getting funds from the European Social Fund &mdash; the Minister referred to this also in his introductory remarks &mdash; where the European Social fund will be involved in funding the programmes concerned.  Presumably this will be done through the agency.  AnCO have been especially successful in getting funds in this respect.  There is the danger of conflict arising between the agency, AnCO and the Department of Education and, on the other hand, the Department of Finance, who will be controlling the agency and its funding.  I would be most concerned about that aspect also, which is something the Minister should consider carefully.</P>
    <P>Of course we will be watching the Estimates to ensure that the normal increases are given to these agencies, such as AnCO and the other training activities that come under the umbrella of this agency.  We should see an increase <Col N="799" /> in the Estimates anyway for these activities and there should be additional moneys granted.  We will be watching carefully to ensure that that money is granted. I am addressing these remarks more perhaps to the Minister for Finance and his colleagues rather than to the Minister for Labour directly, because I am sure the latter will be glad to receive as much money as he can.</P>
    <P>We will be watching carefully for the necessary increase along with these additional moneys, which I am sure the vast majority of people will be prepared to pay provided they can see them being spent on additional activities.  We will be scrutinising these Estimates to ensure that any additional moneys granted are not used in an attempt to collect money for the Minister for Finance, thereby evading his responsibility in this area. There have been examples of this in Britain where the autonomous powers were taken from their training boards and given over to their Department of Finance, leading eventually to approximately 16 of them being abolished recently.  This is something about which I would be most concerned.  It would be better that this agency be established more as a semi-State body attached to the Department of Labour, affording them the freedom to get on with the job. trusting the people who will be involved, allowing them to do the job on our behalf.  Let us talk about general policies but let us allow them get on with the job on a day-to-day basis.  Let the Department of Finance say how much money they will or will not give them and then allow the Comptroller and Auditor General ensure that it is spent in accordance with the wishes of this House.  If the Department of Finance must have a say in all of their activities, that can have a stultifying effect.</P>
    <P>Of course the Minister is not here giving a guarantee of a job.  He has said that he hopes all of these things will lead to a much improved atmosphere for job creation. I have said that I would particularly like to see work carried out on the environment and in the caring professions where there is tremendous scope.  I know <Col N="800" /> that some Members of this House have said that these caring jobs are not as productive as are direct, productive investment in industry or agriculture. However, I believe that their contribution to the economy and to the social fabric of our society is productive and important.  Indeed there are many young people keen to look after the handicapped, old age pensioners and so on. Therefore I would hope a proportion of these funds would be used in the caring professions.  The Industrial Development Authority can make a huge contribution in the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the question of the disabled and usage of the funds specifically for them.  The first step here is their assessment, now being undertaken by the National Rehabilitation Board on a very limited budget and numbers of personnel. One of the features of this International Year of the Disabled, becoming increasingly clear, is that disabled people themselves have felt more prepared to come out and look for work because they have discovered there is a place for them within the environment.  Speaking about the 30 per cent increase in placements under the National Rehabilitation Board this year, it should be said that they brought out this point: the disabled themselves feel happier in coming forward, it is not all a question for the employer directly, whether that be in the public service or elsewhere.  The disabled themselves seem to feel sufficiently confident, wanting to come out and become involved.  In such an environment there is the opportunity of further stimulation, affording the disabled and handicapped a real place in our society.  Certainly I should like to see a proportion of this money being used specifically for that purpose.  Following assessment by a National Rehabilitation Board team, a large proportion of the disabled will be integrated into normal employment, as has happened in other countries.  Indeed it is happening increasingly here, even if slowly in relation to the numbers over all.</P>
    <P>There remains then a minority who must attend community workshops, vocational training units or engage in sheltered employment of one type or <Col N="801" /> another.  They need money also.  The Minister will be aware from his experience travelling around the country that the provision of such community workshops and sheltered employment units constitute a priority at present.  This is an area which could receive a boost from this fund which would be welcomed throughout the country.  The third category consists of disabled people with multiple handicaps who need special facilities. They should be kept in mind and given some additional aid under this scheme.</P>
    <P>In regard to employment of the disabled, I raised the question of the civil service examinations with the Minister recently.  The Minister may have discovered since that there is considerable concern about the view taken by the Civil Service Commissioners in that regard.  I would like the Minister to put it clearly on the record that there is a welcome for the partially sighted and those with impaired sight of varying degrees within this 3 per cent in the civil service.  The degree of disillusionment is growing considerably. This should be a welcome opportunity for the Minister to put it on the record that there is a welcome for these people.  It would allow those concerned with educating the blind and those with impaired sight to look towards the civil service as one of their objectives. Blind people and visually impaired people have taken very high posts in the public service in England, even to the post of assistant secretary, and on the commercial side here a number of such people have taken high administrative posts and can handle them very competently. We can open up whole new vistas for the disabled.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill with some reservations about the way in which it is being done.  I hope that what I have said will be useful to the Minister when he is considering the Committee Stage of the Bill and in the subsequent implementation of the Bill.  I certainly hope it will be useful in creating additional employment and training which is needed.</P>

      <P>Os é seo an chéad <Col N="802" /> ócáid dom labhairt i láthair an Aire, ba mhaith liom mo chomhgháirdeas a dhéanamh leis as ucht a cheapacháin agus guím rath Dé ar a shaothar.  Chomh maith leis sin, ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeas a dhéanamh leis as ucht an Bhille seo.  Níl aon amhras ar chor ar bith ná gurb í an fhadhb is mo atá againn ná fostaíocht a chur ar fáil do aos óg na tíre.  Tá fadhb an-mhór ann atá ag cur buartha ar an Rialtas, agus ba chóir an Freasúra agus gach Teachta Dála a bheith buartha faoi staid na fostaíochta faoi láthair, go háirithe faoi mar a bhaineann sé le aos óg na tíre.</P>
      <P>Is Bille an-mhaith é an Bille seo.  I gcomparáid leis na hiarrachtaí a bhí déanta sna blianta atá thart is é mo thuairimse, agus táim cinnte de go n-aontaíonn an chuid is mó de na Teachtaí liom, gur céim mhór ar aghaidh é an Bille seo ó thaobh fostaíocht a chur ar fáil do aos óg na tíre, agus os rud é go bhfuil mé ag caint i nGaeilge deirim go bhfuil súil agam go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht san áireamh maidir leis an mBille seo, mar tuigim go bhfuil údarás forbartha uile don Ghaeltacht.  Chomh maith leis sin, tá sé fíor-thábhachtach ó thaobh na Gaeltachta agus ó thaobh na teanga agus an chultúir de, go gcuirfear fostaíocht ar fáil, go háirithe do na daoine óga san Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of congratulating the Minister on this Bill.  It will be recognised by most people that this Bill is a major step forward in tackling, in a realistic and practical way, the problem of providing full employment for a growing young population which has had better educational opportunities than previous generations.  This has major implications not just for the Government but for every party and every Deputy.  It is our job to try to create full employment of a range and variety and of a quality that will satisfy the aspirations of young people leaving schools, colleges and various educational institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thinking behind this Bill reflects the Minister's own considerable experience as a vice-chairman of the committee for youth in the European Parliament over the past six or seven years.  In <Col N="803" /> introducing the Bill he referred to the experience in other European countries and the approaches adopted to tackle the question of youth employment.  From the limited amount of knowledge I have, both from listening week after week in Strasbourg or Brussels or at meetings of our own political groups in Europe, I know that there is great concern in all the member states about youth employment. The Minister referred to the Scandinavian experiment which is generally recognised in Europe as being an excellent model.  I welcome this approach.  I cannot refrain from comparing this very practical and realistic approach to the problem of the youth employment with the puny efforts that have been made in recent years and the various schemes set up which were totally ineffective and amounted to a situation where nothing but lip-service was being paid to this problem.  Coming from a constituency which includes the third city of this State, Limerick, I am concerned about providing employment for our young people. We should not lose sight of the fact that our situation here is uniquely different from that in most other Western European countries.  We have a growing population. We have to create new employment to ensure that we can make the best possible use of this tremendous human resource that we have in our young people.  The Minister and other people have pointed out that other countries have the opposite problem, a declining population and not enough people to man the industries in the various sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>I welcome this new Bill.  I agree with the Minister's decision to set up the agency on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis at the beginning. Some of the people who have spoken in this debate have asked the Minister to spell out the type of projects that will be undertaken.  But I am pleased that the Minister envisages a widely representative board to operate this new agency.</P>
    <P>The Minister was wise to set up this board on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, let it find its own feet, decide its own projects and determine over a period of time the best <Col N="804" /> approach.  I welcome wholeheartedly this new approach to the question of youth employment.  The Minister referred to two very important dimensions in the creation of employment opportunities for the young.  The solution to the problem must be looked at in the context of national development and overall employment.  We must honestly face facts.  If we are to tackle the daunting challenge of creating full employment in the eighties for our growing young population, new strategies and approaches and completely new attitudes to the question of national development must be formulated and implemented.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the Government to establish the National Development Corporation.  I sincerely hope that this new corporation will not be just another semi-State body but will work in isolation, and perhaps in competition and rivalry with the IDA and other semi-State bodies.  There is a multiplicity of organisations, perhaps too many, involved in youth development at national and regional levels and a dire need for marshalling the input of the different agencies into a properly integrated national development programme. A National Development Corporation will, as the Minister said, assist, and indeed facilitate, the work of the new agency which is invisaged here.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this whole question, which has been referred to by a number of speakers, is the relationship between education, training and employment.  It is vitally important to have a rethink on the whole thrust of our educational system, to see that it is geared towards ensuring that young people leaving our educational institutions will be qualified in the skills and disciplines for which there will be a demand, whether it be in industry or in the service sector.  I agree with the Minister that there is too much emphasis on the academic aspect of education and this has been referred to by other speakers.  I know of three cases of young people in my constituency, each of whom holds a BA and a Higher Diploma of Education, but cannot get a job.  Jobs in the post-primary sector are very scarce, particularly in our secondary <Col N="805" /> schools.  I know also of three young ladies employed in industry in manual jobs and very glad to have them, because they cannot get the jobs for which they are qualified.  Another young person in my constituency has had for four years an academic qualification from University College, Cork, but has now started on a 12 months computer training course. With proper career guidance at school level this situation would not obtain.</P>
    <P>There is in my constituency a tremendously successful development in the National Institute for Higher Education &mdash; a completely new concept in technological education.  There was a lot of controversy in the past when the demand in Limerick was for a traditional university. I had public and private discussions with my late lamented colleague, Deputy Donogh O'Malley, who was then Minister for Education, which Deputy Brendan Daly will also remember.  The National Institute for Higher Education was established to provide a special type of education and training to prepare our young people for employment and gradually the idea sank in that adequate traditional ivory tower education was available in the universities but that a move forward was needed in the light of the rapid industrialisation which took place in the sixties and seventies.  There have been tremendous strides made with the co-operative education system in which students spend two terms of a four-year course working in the businesses to which their studies are related.  This education is producing an excellent type of graduate who will find it relatively easy to get a job in industry.  This may be what the Minister had in mind when he dealt at some length in his introductory speech about the relationship between education and employment.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have this opportunity of paying tribute to the tremendous development of the regional technical colleges.  Of recent years there have been more unique developments, such as the IDA, the CII, the IIRS and other agencies with a function in industrial development and employment creation.  These cater for the complex needs of industry and development.  Young people are <Col N="806" /> assisted in pursuing their academic courses at Plassey, thus ensuring that they are equipped with the skills and disciplines which will be demanded by future industry in the region.  We have an enterprise centre there and the point I am about to make is not irrelevant in the context of what we are doing now, setting up a youth employment agency.  It is appropriate that we should emphasise that the agency should encourage enterprise. There is great need to emphasise enterprise to encourage young people to use their initiative and their talents in entrepreneurial efforts to create new businesses and so forth.  There is great need for entrepreneurship, for the encouragement of youth enterprise, for thinking up new ideas and applying them in a practical way.  I hope this new agency will bear this in mind.</P>
    <P>The new agency should consider particularly the development of youth enterprise with particular emphasis on the utilisation of youth talents.  There is tremendous scope for the encouragement of youth co-ops, the encouragement of young people to form co-ops.  Of course side by side with that adults should be encouraged too.  The role of the co-operative movement in the field of employment creation has not been fully realised here.  We have a highly developed co-operative movement in the agricultural sector, particularly dairying, but my point is that the co-op movement offers tremendous scope for the creation of youth employment for which this Bill is specially designed.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am bordering on the fanatical on the subject of co-operativisation because when I was Minister for the Gaeltacht I became involved in this and I tried to the best of my ability to push the development of co-ops.  I saw the tremendous work of Father McDyer in Glencolumbkille.  He created employment virtually out of nothing in a remote parish on the western seaboard.  It grieved me to read recently that problems have arisen there.  I would never be daunted or upset by problems and I hope Father McDyer will get co-operation and assistance so that the Glencolumbkille co-operative will solve its problems and <Col N="807" /> continue with its tremendous work. When I left office there were about 300 people in full-time employment in various projects in that parish, most of them young people.  Therefore, I hope the Minister will bear in mind the potential of the co-operative movement in relation to the work of this agency.</P>
    <P>It is important that we acknowledge the tremendous amount of voluntary work being done in the field of catering for youth.  We have a wide variety of organisations, such as the National Youth Council, catering for young people.  In nearly every constituency there are voluntary groups concerned with and working for youth.  I hope this agency will be given flexibility and discretion to assist and to encourage such group experiments and pilot projects.  For example, there is a group in Limerick, one of hundreds throughout the country, who look after St. Martin's Centre.  The centre was set up in 1976 and its objectives were to provide facilities for the education, rehabilitation and training of teenage children of travelling people and underprivileged children from the settled communities in Limerick.  There are contributions by AnCO and by the VEC, plus an enormous voluntary contribution by a local group.  That group do an enormous job raising funds locally to help to finance that project.</P>
    <P>I hope that experiments and pilot projects of that kind in such situations will be helped by the Youth Employment Agency, that the agency will have sufficient flexibility to do that kind of work. Those voluntary organisations are doing first class jobs but the work cannot be done completely by voluntary effort.</P>
    <P>This whole problem is complex and wide.  I listened to part of the debate last week and I had an opportunity to read some of the speeches made, and I found it significant that speakers from all sides of the House expressed great concern about the magnitude of the problem confronting us, the daunting task to be faced by the nation throughout the eighties to create full employment of a kind and a variety and a quality that will meet the aspirations of our growing young population <Col N="808" /> who have better educational opportunities than all previous generations. It is a daunting and frightening task but we must tackle it if we are to survive as a nation and if we, the present generation of politicians, are to prove worthy of the trust handed down to us.  If we are to be worthy of the sacrifices made for the foundation of this State we must make a superhuman effort to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to possible sources of finance <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC.  The Minister validly will be expecting a substantial contribution from the social fund. That is only right and proper because if the EEC is to have any meaning at all for a small country on the periphery of Europe it is logical to expect that the EEC will recognise the magnitude of the problem confronting us, particularly in relation to employment creation.  We should also look seriously at the possibility of subventions from the EEC Regional Fund in this context.  All Deputies who have spoken viewed this as a serious situation which needs new thinking, new approaches, new strategies.  This Bill represents a major step forward.  I hope sincerely that the agency being set up will live up to the Minister's expectations. I have no doubt about the personal commitment of the Minister to the great national task of providing employment for our young people.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one final comment. When he was speaking last week Deputy Higgins dealt at length with the concept of and the need for planning. Unfortunately, the word &ldquo;planning&rdquo; has a bad connotation.  If you advocate a planned economy, you will be called an economist.  We have to be realistic. Deputy Daly agrees with me that the word &ldquo;planning&rdquo; can be misconstrued in relation to economic planning.  There is a dire need for proper national economic planning, but there is also a need for regional planning.  As I understand it, a plan is in course of preparation for proper national, economic, social and manpower planning, but there is equal need for regional planning.  We must get away from a situation in which there is a multiplicity of organisations in every region <Col N="809" /> with no overall co-ordinating agency to formulate a plan and be responsible for the implementation of a development programme.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom mar fhocal scoir comhgáirdeas a dhéanamh arís leis an Aire, agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go h-an-mhaith leis an eagras nua seo.  Guím rath Dé ar an obair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I wish the Minister well in the Department of Labour.  I also wish the staff well.  In the short time I was in the Department I found a hard-working and dedicated staff, fully committed to the work in hand.  We must all recognise that there are no easy solutions to the problem of youth unemployment.  There is no solution which any Minister or Deputy, or any politician in Europe today, can pull out of a hat for the growing problem of youth unemployment.  If the Minister and the Government feel that introducing a measure of this nature will in some way paper over, camouflage or window-dress this problem, I warn them that is a very dangerous attitude to adopt.  It is dangerous especially from the point of view of young people who may often sound or appear to be outrageous, but are seldom stupid.  If an effort is made to evade the problems by creating a structure which has not got the necessary power and finances, the young people for whom this Bill is designed will see through it and the blame will fall on the shoulders of the Government and it will be a heavy one.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives us an excellent opportunity to discuss the whole complex area of youth unemployment and the steps necessary in the short-term and the long-term to find solutions.  For some time, and especially since 1976, Governments were faced with this alarming increase in youth unemployment.  Most Governments were taken by surprise and believed the problem would go away when the economic recession eased.  Five or six years later most countries are beginning to see that the problem has worsened.  It is now apparent that different and long-term measures are called for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the risk of boring the Leas-Cheann <Col N="810" /> Comhairle I should like to deal with some of the strategies adopted in other countries to cope with the youth unemployment problem to see if it is possible for us to adopt and adapt some of them to suit our circumstances having regard to our different population structure compared with other countries and some of the members states of the EEC.  Recently I read many speeches made by the Tánaiste about the usefulness of an early retirement scheme and the effect it might have on creating employment opportunities for young people.  In Germany an early retirement scheme removed about 300,000 people from the workforce in the first year in which it was introduced.  This was done mainly by giving partial pensions and a voluntary age for retirement. The bulk of the jobs created was filled by young people.</P>
    <P>This is a very expensive scheme to operate.  Anyone who looks at the cost of pension schemes today will see that, if an early retirement scheme is to be meaningful and worthwhile, it will cost an enormous amount of money.  Also this is a once-off situation which cannot be repeated after the first year.  Despite the fact that the German scheme was successful and could probably be implemented here, I feel the effects of such a scheme here would be limited, would be once-off and would be frightfully costly. At the same time, the agency should direct its attention to it to establish whether or not the money an early retirement scheme would cost could be put to better use.  The Danish Government introduced an early retirement scheme which took about 50,000 people off the workforce.  The experience there was that the bulk of the jobs created was filled by young people.</P>
    <P>Another scheme mentioned recently related to shorter working hours.  This scheme could create extra jobs, but it would be a very limited number of jobs. Shorter working hours are concerned mainly with the improvement of working conditions rather than a worthwhile job creation project.  If there is a possibility of creating employment opportunities through the re-arrangement of working hours, flexi-time, and so on, it should be <Col N="811" /> looked at.  The experience in other countries could be examined and adapted to suit our circumstances.</P>
    <P>Looking at the United States one sees that they have struck a very real balance between basic academic knowledge and practical experience during school going years.  They have a type of apprenticeship built into or incorporated into the educational system.  This makes for a smooth transition from school to working life and in many cases proves to be the most effective way of dealing with the transitional period.  During my time in the Department I found that to be one of the most difficult periods for young people.  I am very interested in the developments which have taken place and, as Minister of State at the Department of Labour, I participated in a worthwhile exercise which took place in Drogheda&mdash;the schools-industry link scheme.  A meeting was held between parents, students, industrialists and career guidance personnel aimed at, and succeeding to a very large extent, improving the attitude of young people to industrial employment. We will have to pay far more attention to this vital area in future.  Just before I left the Department of Labour we found, and it is probably still the case, that there was a mismatch between the jobs available and the skills of people seeking employment. When unemployment rates were very high there were 3,000 vacancies on the books of the National Manpower Service for skilled workers which they were unable to fill.</P>
    <P>There is an attitude here to industrial employment which will have to change very quickly.  Educationalists, industrialists, schools, career guidance people, parents and pupils will all have to work together to see how these attitudes can be changed.  It is evident to anyone who looks at the situation that the main thrust of employment opportunities in the future will come from industrial projects and ventures, which are already starting. Unless there is a change of attitude towards industrial work we will continue to have high rates of unemployment of young people and manpower shortages of skilled workers.  We should encourage <Col N="812" /> the further extension of schools-industry link schemes which are taking place today in a number of centres.  They should be put on a firmer footing and young people should be encouraged not to think of industrial work as something to drift into. They should go into industrial work because of the opportunities, the satisfying career and the bright prospects of promotion and return for their labour.</P>
    <P>There is evidence to show that wage rates for women are something like 50 per cent less than the average male income.  There is also evidence from surveys done in the west that young women drifted into industrial work because they felt there was nothing else for them to do.  They worked in industry until such time as an alternative job became available, either in the public service or as a trainee nurse.  We will have to think very carefully about the way in which the whole curriculum is suited to young women.  The only way to redress the imbalance which exists between men and women's pay is by getting women into highly-skilled jobs providing opportunities.</P>
    <P>During 1978 and 1979, when industrial growth increased substantially shortages for highly qualified and skilled labour emerged.  The experience of our EEC partners, the United States and Japan shows that when the links between education and work are strong, the country is better equipped to deal with the challenge of providing satisfying work for its young people.  The question of links between industry and schools, parents and career guidance people cannot be over-emphasised.  I should like to take this opportunity to direct the attention of educationalists and pupils to the opportunities in this whole area, encourage them to look at these areas in the future and to see how problems can be solved.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the attitude, mainly of Government Deputies, that nothing was done during the past few years about dealing with the problem of youth unemployment. When we were in office we took a number of successful measures.  I do not want to go into them in detail, but the evidence is there.  The commitment, the will and co-ordination were there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> While I welcome the agency, there has been during the past number of years very close co-ordination and co-operation between all the agencies involved in this field.  Anyone who looks at the success of the various schemes will see that very successful youth employment schemes were operated.  They need to be updated and reviewed, but a very high-powered team of the National Manpower Consultative Committee dealt with the co-ordination of the various schemes.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the financing of the agency.  The opportunity is here for the Minister and the Government to hive off to the agency much of the responsibility &mdash; and probably the blame &mdash; for some of the problems and for not finding solutions to them.  It is easy to say you have X number of millions available through a levy for this Youth Employment Agency which will enable it to do far more than is being done at present. Take, for instance, the scheme announced by the Minister for Finance some time ago.  He provided £200,000 to establish the youth employment service scheme and the youth employment enterprise scheme.  In reply to a parliamentary question on 25 November the Minister for Finance told me:</P>
    <P>The youth employment services scheme and the youth employment enterprise scheme will be administered by the proposed Youth Employment Agency, under the aegis of the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>This is the first indication we had that schemes which are supposed to be administered by the Departments would be moved to the agency.  The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>While a number of inquiries have been received by my office, no applications have yet been received.  It is hoped that the Youth Employment Agency will be in a position to invite applications under these schemes in the future.</P>
    <P>The general public believe we have a youth services scheme and a youth enterprise scheme with £200,000 to spend and <Col N="814" /> normally it would be expected that this money would be spent before the end of December.  Not a penny of that money has been spent yet, in spite of all the speeches we have had since the change of Government about the desirability of dealing with the youth employment situation.</P>
    <P>There is no way the Youth Employment Agency will be established before 1 April.  We are at the Second Stage of this Bill and Committee and Final Stages have to be discussed in this House, and then it will have to pass through the Seanad.  This means there is no way the agency will be working before April. What will become of the £200,000 which the Minister for Finance announced with a great flourish?  will it be carried forward? Will there be £500,000 available next year?  The Appropriation Accounts, 1980, show the money which has been spent under various headings by different Departments.  Will the grant for voluntary organisations for the employment of development officers be directed to the Youth Employment Agency?  Will the grant aid fund for youth and sport organisations&mdash;£1.5 million &mdash; be operated by the agency?  Will the grant aid fund for youth employment &mdash; £500,000 &mdash; be operated by the agency?  Will all the schemes presently operated by the Department of Labour &mdash; for example, career information, the grant for the training of personnel in the Irish Management Institute, the training of young people in the hotel and catering industry, the employment incentive scheme, the employment maintenance scheme from which many young people benefited, the work experience programme &mdash; be hived off to the agency?</P>
    <P>If the Government transfer all these schemes to the agency the levy will be very quickly swallowed up and there will be no additional money.  I can see many Departments trying to transfer areas for which they have responsibility at present to the Youth Employment Agency.  At that time we will not be better off but worse off because less money will be available.  There will be a slowing down of the drive towards the creation of temporary employment opportunities for <Col N="815" /> young people.  This was very useful because it provided training and experience for young people and in many cases provided facilities which were not previously available, such as sports complexes and projects of this nature.</P>
    <P>I am very worried because on 25 November the Minister for Finance told me £200,000 would be provided for these schemes but not one penny has been spent yet.  If the Government have a commitment in this area, why not spend that money now rather than carry it forward to next year?  Many young people will not be able to avail of the opportunities which should have been available before the end of this year.  This gives me cause to doubt the Government's sincerity in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that representation will be given to outside bodies, especially the National Youth Council of Ireland who made a submission to the Government setting out what they considered to be problem areas which needed to be dealt with.  Youth organisations should be encouraged to put forward their views and they should be represented on this agency.  Earlier I hinted at the need for long-term strategies because many of our existing schemes deal with short-term problems.  The statistics on youth employment are poor and need to be improved.  This is an area where the agency have a big part to play.  It is important that the National Youth Council of Ireland be represented on the agency.</P>
    <P>I would like to touch on the future technological advances and changes that are taking place.  Some experts have estimated that in the area of knowledge of technology that will be available in the year 2000, only about 25 per cent is known today and 90 per cent of the engineers and scientists who ever lived are still alive today.  A recent survey carried out among European executives by an international management magazine found that the two leading obstacles to management doing the most effective job possible during the eighties was (1) the lack of adequately trained personnel and (2) keeping pace with new technologies.</P>
    <P>We are entering into an era of technical <Col N="816" /> culture, and widespread technical knowledge will be needed in the population as well as highly trained personnel.  These people will have to be competent in a wide range of business functions, research, development, design, manufacturing and marketing and in different technologies.  More young people must embark on technological careers.  Deputy Higgins, in the course of his contribution, touched on this.  He expressed the view that technology needed to be controlled. In my view technology needs to be managed very carefully and it will need the direction of the educationalists here immediately to see in what way we can maximise the benefits of the new technological advances which are taking place all round us.  We can be involved in this and get benefits from it and our young people will be able to avail of the job opportunities that new technology will provide for us in the future.  Rather than control technology we need to exploit it in a more vigorous way than we have been doing.  We can do this by changing our attitudes towards technology in many respects, having our curriculum developed in a way in which it will be flexible so that when people embark on careers they will know what they are taking on. We should ensure that in the event of opportunities fading in one area our children will be quickly adaptable to take up opportunities in other areas.  It is because this area is so broad and complex that we need to direct more attention to it than we have done up to now.</P>
    <P>In the electronics field in January 1975 some 5,000 people were employed in it but by June 1979 the figure had doubled to 10,000.  The number of professional and technical workers employed in industry had grown by almost 50 per cent between 1971 and 1977 while at the same time a sharp decline had taken place in the opportunities for unskilled people.  In fact, we had to embark on recruitment campaigns in the United Kingdom to get skilled personnel over here.  We had to do that to attract mechanical and electrical engineers and electronics technicians back to Ireland.  We had to pay them substantial grants to resettle here at a <Col N="817" /> time when there was a lot of unemployment among our young people.  Expectations for employment in the coming years are for an increase in the industry sector.  There will be some increased employment in the services and I should like to encourage this and to encourage employment opportunities in small industries.  That is why I welcomed a commitment when the mid-west region was initiated by the development agencies towards the promotion and creation of small industrial projects.  I also welcomed the direction given to the Shannon Development Company to engage in a pilot project in my region to encourage small companies to get off the ground and create employment opportunities.  Millions of jobs were created in the United States by small industrial projects.  In the United States small is beautiful and it is beautiful here also.  The opportunities for small industrial companies are unlimited if we had the drive and the finance for them. I should like to direct the attention of the agency to this whole area of the promotion and encouragement of small industrial projects where one does not have the same difficulties as experienced in large industrial complexes with personnel and industrial relations.  While one does not get those problems in the small industrial operation at the same time a substantial number of jobs can be created by them.</P>
    <P>More attention will have to be paid to those areas.  I welcome the opportunity the Bill affords us to discuss this whole complex area.  I welcome the decision to establish the agency provided it is not used by other Departments to hive off their responsibilities and save money under various subheads which will be shifted to the agency.  The debate gives us an opportunity to review policies and plans for the future.  It would be foolish of the Government to believe that there is an easy solution to this problem.  The Minister will see this as he goes ahead and I hope he directs the attention of the agency to the variety of ways we can make it more meaningful and attractive for young people to get worthwhile jobs. If that is done our young people will be able to stay at home.  We must stop the <Col N="818" /> move away from Ireland now, and the new agency has an important role to play in that regard.  The agency can be assured of encouragement from this side of the House in its work.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo mar ta sé anathábhactach fadhbanna fostaíochta a laghdú díreach.  I should like to welcome this Bill in my first contribution in the House.  It is a highly imaginative piece of legislation and one which is long overdue because we, unlike other countries, face unusual problems.  The trend in most industrialised countries is for the population to drop.  The birth rate is not keeping pace with the mortality rate but in Ireland the problem has changed in recent years.  As we all know immigration has replaced emigration and our young population is growing.  It has been said that the unemployment figures at present are in the region of 130,000 and that the number of unemployed who are under 25 years of age is about 45,000.  Unfortunately, with the present economic situation not only are jobs being lost but we are also experiencing a decrease in the rate of job creation.  Taking that into context we must look at the problems facing our young people, even from primary school age.  Our children face problems when they enter secondary school because there is pressure on them to obtain a certain number of points if they wish to enter university or other third level institutions.  Young people who decide to pursue a third level education course face enormous problems.  In Cork such young people not only face a high standard but they also have a problem in trying to find accommodation in the city. Such pressures are over-burdening our young people.  Having reached a certain level of education or having acquired a skill, our young people are justified in expecting a certain quality of employment; but unfortunately we are failing them in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently there have been statements from some people whom one would expect to know better.  These statements were to the effect that if we fail to provide employment for young people they may <Col N="819" /> resort to violence.  We are all aware that this has happened in other places but the danger is that, if the fear is expressed often by people in responsible positions, young impressionable people may regard such activity as excusable in certain circumstances. Therefore, the less said about that the better.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to be political in my first contribution, but the questioning of the commitment of this Government to the provision of jobs for young people must not go unanswered.  The previous Government in their job-creation programme laid too much emphasis on the public sector in this context with the result that a great strain was put on the public purse by way of the creation of those non-productive jobs.  If that policy had not been discontinued we would have found ourselves in a bankruptcy situation.  I must refer also to the lack of commitment on the part of the previous Government to the provision of jobs in the past four years.  The 1980 national understanding envisaged a net growth in total employment of 7,000 jobs.  Instead of the predicted growth of 5,000 on the manufacturing side, there was a loss of 5,000 jobs in that area.  Spokesmen on the other side of the House must accept that the previous Administration reneged in particular on the Irish trade union movement so far as the terms of the previous national understandings were concerned. I would go so far as to say that they reneged on their commitment to the extent of 40,000 jobs.  This can be backed up by the CSO in their report of May 1981 in which they say that the guidelines for ensuring employment during 1980 were outlined to the extent of 14,400 jobs.</P>
    <P>In the first national understanding the previous Government committed themselves to an effective planning strategy for industry which would require careful monitoring of changes likely to influence employment levels.  They said that parties to the agreement accepted the desirability of establishing sectoral industrial committees which would assess the implications of technological marketing and related developments for future employment <Col N="820" /> and for the efficiency and growth of the sector, and that the understanding was that these committees would be established before the end of 1979.  However, no such committees were appointed either in 1979 or in 1980 and it was only in the run up to the 1981 election that there was any movement in that area.</P>
    <P>Clause 5 of Part 1 of the 1980 agreement reads:</P>
    <P>The Government undertake to prepare a comprehensive statement of the proposed measures and the necessary requirements for the achievement of full employment and greater social progress.  An initial draft will be produced by the Government around the end of November, 1980 and will be discussed between the Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Employer and Industry Organisations....</P>
    <P>In other words, an initial draft was to have been produced before the budget of 1981 whereas it was only in March, some months after the budget, that such draft was circulated.</P>
    <P>In July, when the present Administration took over, unemployment was going out of control and the present estimates are that it could reach the appalling figure of 200,000 within the next 12 to 18 months.  What is required now is a representative system of industrial planning and this is something that the Government intend introducing within the coming months.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the IDA, a body which I do not consider to be above criticism either.  Down through the years they have produced highly optimistic estimates but all too often these estimates have been off target.  In many instances the IDA have been too rigid in their approach to Irish people who seek grant aid for the purpose of setting up small businesses.  From my very limited dealings with the Authority I have found that their approach varies, depending on who is seeking the subsidy. The IDA must become more flexible in respect of the needs of the service industries. Cork Corporation, for example, have produced a very detailed programme for inner city development.  In <Col N="821" /> the local plan for the Shannon area it is envisaged that small industries would be introduced into this part of the city thereby creating work and giving people the opportunity of coming back to live and work in the city.  In the past number of months I have observed that the ESB and the IDA have discouraged the setting up of certain types of industries in these areas.  Because of a rigidity in their approach the IDA cannot give grants since they are governed by statute or regulations.  At the same time the organisation say they will do all they can to encourage employment in inner city areas.  There is a vast potential in these areas for the creation of jobs for young people.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome, but it will not cure the problem of youth unemployment.  It has been said that this could be an expensive way of creating jobs but we must look at the Bill as a companion to the economic and social policy to be published. This is a scheme designed to introduce young people to the concept of work pending an improvement and upswing in our economy.  From that point of view it is very important, because if young people are left without jobs for too long they become disenchanted and are thereby psychologically injured.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill. It is an umbrella under which to co-ordinate the work of the various agencies which are doing such excellent work in the Departments of Labour, Education and the Environment to provide training, employment and so forth for our young people.  Having heard the Minister's introductory statement is there, I wonder, much that is new in the Bill?  As I see it, it is an extension of existing employment incentives, existing training programmes based on the agencies already in existence.  The Bill is more or less a copy of what is being done in other European countries with a problem of <Col N="822" /> youth unemployment.  There is nothing wrong with a copy if that copy is designed to benefit our young people.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about the 1 per cent levy.  Levies have never been popular with any section of our community. The Minister will remember we had a 2 per cent levy on the farmers and a 1 per cent levy on someone else and, in the light of that experience, we know levies are not an acceptable form of taxation. While the Bill is to be welcomed as a co-ordinating measure it is quite obvious people have not properly considered the major problem of financing.</P>
      <P>This is really a mini-budget designed to collect a sum of £63 million.  There is the 1.5 per cent levy, the PRSI and we have heard about the 3.75 per cent levy on all incomes in excess of £89,500.  Is it now proposed that every Bill that comes before the House will not be financed in the normal way through the annual budget from money collected by way of VAT, excise duty and taxation generally? That will be a new system for financing which will have a very serious effect and I am more than surprised the public generally have not so far adverted to this. Possibly the farmers had other problems last week organising their protest march to advertise their non-ability to repay loans and the high cost of input into their farms and did not realise what was happening here.  I believe a good deal will be heard about this in the not too distant future and I would like the Minister to convey to the Government our disapproval of this method of financing.</P>
      <P>In the short period during which I was Minister for Labour in the last Government we were very concerned about the problem of education.  We are spending a colossal amount on education.  It is my belief that our educational system is not run as it should be run.  I have some experience of business and if one produces an article which is not required by the public one either goes bankrupt or one very quickly changes over to producing what the public want.  In our educational system we may possibly be producing too many people with arts degrees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many arts degree people are today working as labourers?  Deputy <Col N="823" /> Daly referred to this.  As far as the micro-chip is concerned we have had to import people with technical know-how. Prior to the change of Government the Minister for Education, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I and others met many people in the educational sphere.  We set up a pilot scheme in Athlone whereby parents, people from the regional colleges, the vocational and secondary schools were brought together in order to familiarise people generally with education and what is required.  We got management to go into the regional colleges and schools once every six months to lecture the young people.  I hope the Minister will continue this.  I would also like to see co-operation between industry, the trade union movement, parents and students. I would like to see students given some practical training on the factory floor so that they would know exactly what the work is like instead of just sitting at desks all day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister stating that no phone tapping whatsoever took palce? I am talking about tapping rather than overhearing because phone tapping was the allegation made at the time.  Would the Minister take into account that in a statement given by the general secretary of Fine Gael at that time, who is now in a high-ranking position in the Government he made allegations and named people?  Is there any foundation for that allegation?  That report was made to the police.  What does the Minister now propose to do to stop those wild and irresponsible allegations being made against the staff of the Department, particularly the technicians?  What steps will he take to prevent this type of wild allegation made at that time by the secretary of Fine Gael, led by the posse that came into the House of Deputies headed by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, who is now holding down a responsible ministry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree with me that any subscriber is entitled to make the complaint that was made and the Department would expect that a complaint of this kind would be brought to their notice so that it could be fully investigated.  That is what happened in this case.  There were bona fide grounds for complaint.  The complaint was made and it was investigated.  After full investigation all that is possible is to say it was not possible to establish by whom or in what circumstances the overhearing complained of had been carried out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister define the difference between a complaint and an allegation?  A wild allegation was made at that time and it was carried daily in the national press as though some people had tapped the phone.  The then secretary of the Fine Gael Party gave names of people who actually listened to the phone tapping. He said this in a statement given on the issue to the Garda Síochána.  What protection does the Minister intend to give to the staff of the Department of Posts <Col N="825" /> and Telegraphs, particularly the technicians, against those wild allegations? That is a separate question to the normal complaints the Minister is answering me on.  I am not satisfied with the Minister's answer.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Deputy is not satisfied but the facts are that any subscriber who has a legitimate cause for grievance is entitled to complain to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It is a matter of semantics whether you label the communication a complaint or an allegation, depending on the sensitivity of the recipient of the allegation or complaint. The Deputy's sensitivity on this matter might cause me to think &ldquo;he doth protest too much&rdquo;.</P>

Would he have the honour and integrity to tell the House there was no alleged phone tapping taking place such as was stated in the allegation made by the then secretary of the Fine Gael Party, Mr. Prendergast, who is now a high-ranking official and adviser to the Government?  Is the Minister trying to insinuate in his reply that that allegation was not made?  It was emphatically made and it was made here by a posse in this House of Deputies headed by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, aided and abetted by the present Minister of State in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, who is now silent on this issue.</P>

I refer to phone tapping being carried on without the sanction of the Minister for Justice.  In view of the seriousness of the situation has the Minister any plans to alter the regulations and rules covering phone tapping or to abandon the practice altogether?  In view of the seriousness of the situation, could the Minister assure the House that there are no journalists, politicians, members of the Judiciary or any sensitive posts like this involved in any phone tapping at this time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have no knowledge of the technicalities of the operation described by the Deputy.  I am aware that crossed lines lead to overheard conversations from time to time and there is a lot of misunderstanding because of that.  Noises are sometimes <Col N="827" /> heard after dialling numbers and people misinterpret them as suggesting that something is happening to the line but these are normal technical consequences of a service which is not of a standard we would like it to be.</P>

Would he now be honest enough to admit that there was no reason at all for unease at the time this complaint was originally made?  Would he accept, having seen the files, that this allegation in the first instance was no more than a scare propaganda-seeking exercise, in view of the fact that tapping was supposed to have taken place on 11 November and that the official complaint from Fine Gael was not lodged in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs until 5 March last?</P>

    <P>Will he now tell the House openly and honestly, having seen the full records of <Col N="828" /> this investigation and having said that it was carried out impartially and was instigated at my request, that the time factor from 21 November 1980 to 5 March 1981 surely bears out the view that it was no more than a scarce propaganda exercise? Will the Minister admit from the other side of the House that this is what it was and will he explain why there was such a long delay from 21 November to 5 March in making a complaint?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy felt there was an undue delay in making a complaint and that, as a result, the complaint was frivolous he should not have had it investigated.

      <P>I will not accept the word &ldquo;complaint&rdquo;.  I want the Minister to comment on the following.  On 21 November the alleged phone-tapping took place.  On 5 March in the following year a complaint was lodged officially by the Fine Gael organisation to the Department.  However, on three occasions in this House when Dáil questions were on the Order Paper concerning the alleged phone-tapping, the Fine Gael Party who were then in Opposition said their investigations were not complete.  They withdrew their questions until their investigations were complete and then they lodged a complaint with the Department.  Until they lodged their complaint the Department could not take any part in any deliberations concerning the alleged phone-tapping. What the Minister has said is ridiculous. The whole matter was a public relations exercise, degrading to the staff, and in particular the technical staff, of telephone exchanges in the country and causing grave concern to many phone users who believed and still believe that their phones are tapped.</P>

      <P>The type of statement now made by Deputy Killilea could tend to heighten unease on the part of the subscribers.  I want to remove that unease by saying I am satisfied that nothing illegal can be proved to have happened. With regard to the suggestion that there was a delay in making the complaint, it is odd that this point was not taken up when Deputy O'Keeffe was given a reply. I will quote from the last paragraph of a letter to him:</P>
      <P>While the examination is still continuing, I am not hopeful at this stage that it will be possible to establish by whom the listening was done.  If, however, there is any further information that you or Mr. Prendergast could give that you think might be helpful in tracing who might have been involved I will of course be glad to receive it.</P>
      <P>That is in stark contrast to the suggestion here today that the complaint was frivolous. If the Deputy thought at the time that it was frivolous, as he appears to think now, he should have said so in his letter in answer to the complaint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to the former single channel area is that my <Col N="833" /> Department have organised competitions in respect of the issue of exclusive licences for the provision of multi-channel cable television systems in the cities of Cork and Galway.  Letters of intent to grant a licence in respect of Cork and Galway cities have been issued to Cork Communications Ltd. and Tele Electrics Ltd. of Galway respectively.  In both cases the companies in question must comply with certain requirements before a licence can be issued.  It would be premature to give any undertaking regarding the issue of licences in respect of smaller towns until it is demonstrated that a satisfactory multi-channel service will be available in Cork and Galway.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has not yet arranged a competition for an exclusive licence for a multi-channel cable television system in Limerick.  Upon the issue of exclusive licences in respect of Cork and Galway, the licensees will be expected to provide an aerial and associated head-end equipment at the site stated in their respective applications and a trunk cable from there to the cities to be served as well as the normal cable network in those cities.  The detailed design of the networks will be a matter for each licensee, subject to compliance with the technical conditions laid down by my Department under the Wireless Telegraphy (Wired Broadcast Relay Licence) Regulations, 1974.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there are technical objections to doing that.  There is also a belief that transmission by microwave could have copyright implications. There is a suggestion that that doubt has been removed but I do not know if it has been removed entirely.  The broadcasting review committee in 1974 recommended that microwave link systems should be owned, controlled and maintained by the Department on an integrated basis.  If permission was given to individual applications the technical end could become confused and lead to difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not the cable vision system of transmitting this television network also give rise to copyright problems?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there appears to be a contradiction, but I am advised that there is a distinction between retransmitting by microwave and by cable.  I admit I cannot see the distinction but it was held that there was a distinction.  Another view seems to be gaining support and that is that rebroadcasting by microwave does not infringe copyright.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider the question of Limerick shortly but I have no immediate plans to do so.  Galway and Cork are both fringe areas for broadcasting and it might be more prudent to wait and see the experience of the contractors in those cities before giving a licence to Limerick.  I will keep the matter under review and when I consider it is in order to invite competition for Limerick I will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that by issuing the letter of competition he would get the project under way more quickly?  At the end of the day the decision will be taken on the basis of the technology to be used and the technical data submitted with tenders for the project.  Surely that is not a real excuse for not going ahead with Limerick.  It had already been decided on and I should like to know if it is going ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of inviting competition is not as simple as the Deputy suggests because the people who will compete will have to go to considerable expense in preparing submissions.  It would be unfair to put them to that expense if it was not technically feasible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flor Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if the employment of the sixty telephonists at Bantry Exchange, County Cork will be affected after it goes automatic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the intention to <Col N="838" /> close Bantry manual exchange once all the exchanges in the group had been converted to automatic working, and to provide all operator services from Cork. However, having reviewed the position generally in regard to the number of operator centres planned under fully automatic conditions nationally, it has been decided to retain operator services in Bantry on an interim basis to deal with calls in the area needing operator assistance.</P>
      <P>The volume of operator assisted traffic to be handled at Bantry exchange when the exchanges in the area are converted to automatic working will, of course, be greatly reduced and there will, therefore, be a substantial reduction in the number of operating staff to be employed there. The number will, however, be maintained at a level sufficient to ensure a good operator service.</P>
      <P>Employment at other exchanges will be available for full-time day staff who opt to transfer.  Arrangements which will apply to other staff have been agreed on a national basis with the staff organisations concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Flor Crowley Mr. Flor Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flor Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the present Taoiseach gave an undertaking to the people of Bantry during the election that all of the operators would be retained in the exchange and that none of them would have to seek employment elsewhere or go to any other part of the services of the Post Office, and that this is another of the broken promises?  Will the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs endeavour to implement the promise given by the Taoiseach and ensure that the 61 girls who are operating the telephone exchange in Bantry will be left to work there?</P>

      <P>I understand that the promise was made in the context that the action group had been assured earlier by the then Minister of State, Deputy Killilea, that he had plans within his Department for alternative employment for the operators in the Bantry area and on the basis of that Departmental plans were made which could have enabled them to be employed locally.  The Taoiseach indicated that he would be prepared to implement those plans.  However, I have discovered that no such plans existed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is no and I would refer the Deputy to my reply to the debate on the Supplementary Estimate for my Department on 12 November (Vol. 330 No. 11 Col. 1975).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister propose to supervise and implement his proposals in relation to the licensing of CB radio when there is a generally accepted figure of 40,000 to 50,000 sets in the country whose owners, I am sure he knows, do not accept the regulations he is proposing?  How does he, with the small staff available to him, hope to supervise it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me what was the cost of operating the licensing system.  I indicated the cost which would include a system of inspecting which will obviously have to be made of <Col N="846" /> the apparatus in use.  I imagine the people operating this apparatus are law-abiding citizens who will not seek to evade their legal obligations, will not seek deliberately to break the law and will co-operate with the officers of the Department.  I am sure Deputy Reynolds is at one with me in urging that co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept it is a physical impossibility for his staff to supervise this operation?  Would it not be more logical to go along with the system which I introduced and which he reversed, to give a two-year transition period with full co-operation from the CB users who number 40,000 to 50,000 to try to get a better solution than the one he is now proposing?  His solution is bureaucratic; it was proposed to me earlier on and I did not accept it for the reasons I am now stating.  If this system is going to be self-financing at a cost of £20 per annum for a licence, and he expects all CB users to get a licence, that will yield about £800,000 to £1 million.  Where is the half million gap?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider the two-year extension for AM is unduly long, having regard to the high level of significant interference being experienced by a great number of people from the present use of AM sets.  They are interfering with telephones, television and licensed radio telephones.  Because of that, I do not think it right that something which is essentially a hobby should be given an extended life.  Consequently, I have decided that there should only be a one-year transitional period.  I expect the people who are using these sets to dispose of them within the year.  It is a generous length of time and that year will be used by my Department for policing and inspecting sets in operation.  The scheme will be self-financing and, as the Deputy said, the monitoring of the scheme may be a larger task than first envisaged.  In that event, any extra funds will be very useful to pay for extra inspectors if we do not get the co-operation which I hope will come from users of this equipment.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, we all accept that there is interference there, but there is also interference on the FM system.  I am sure the Minister has studied the technical reports that are there.  Would he accept that there is interference on FM but that initial reports show that AM is slightly worse? Would he also accept that much of the interference is caused by bad connections on piped television and surely it was a more logical approach to have the two-year transitional period there so that most of the interference could be eliminated to give the opportunity to CB users to prove that AM does not cause any more interference than FM?  I know the staff which is available to the Minister in trying to monitor that licensing system and I know he will not have the resources at his disposal to do that.  I hope he will use the half million pounds extra to recruit extra technical staff into that area rather than pass it on as revenue to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>I am no more technically competent than Deputy Reynolds to assess the relevant merits of AM and FM. Both of us have to rely on the advice of people who are technically competent.  It was a question of whether I preferred the advice of the technical officers of my Department to the representations from CB users.  I preferred the technical advice from the officers in my Department. Deputy Reynolds obviously prefers the representations from the CB users.  That is where we differ.  I am satisfied, on the advice available to me, that the level of interference by AM is well nigh intolerable and must be ended as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I recognise that there has been a substantial degree of change in development in the Dublin area and in the direction the Minister of State is seeking to move, but I should like to know if it would be possible for him to give an indication to us as to when he might be able to make this information available on the telephone exchanges. Does the Minister hope to have it in the near future or will it be available in the new year?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that telephone instruments were installed in hundreds of homes in south county Dublin about four months ago but have been sitting in hallways and in sitting rooms unconnected since?  That situation exists in spite of the fact that contracts have been signed and deposits paid by those people.  Will the Minister have a look at that aspect of the telephone <Col N="856" /> service in south county Dublin?  I have received dozens of letters from constituents who have paid their deposit but have not had their new telephones connected. Is the Minister aware that in the Kilternan area of county Dublin the telephone system has been out of order intermittently for long periods of time and that there has been no improvement in the situation?  Is the Minister aware also that the only hotel in the district has one telephone connection and that it is intermittently out of order?  In spite of all the representations to the Minister's Department, action has not been taken to repair those telephones.  The lack of a proper service there is doing great injury and harm to the district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the points made by Deputy Andrews.  I am not aware that telephone instruments have been installed in houses without connections for the last four months.  In one such case that was brought to my attention today the telephone instrument was installed last week and I have asked for a full inquiry into it.  If the Deputy gives me the information he apparently has, I can assure him that the matter will be fully investigated.  On the general position of Dublin city I should like to state that other necessary services were developed to cope with the increase in population, but the former Administration did not recognise the need for the infrastructure for telecommunications and that is what has caused the problem. The laying of cables and the provision of telephone exchanges may not be seen as progress within the Department but a telephone cannot be installed without a cable being laid and a telephone exchange erected first.</P>

Taking those two things into consideration, I should like to ask the Minister when we can expect leadership and a statement from the Government on what is probably the most important national economic issue. Will the Minister for Labour, a sensible and experienced man, accept from me and agree with me that the main problem to achieving a pay settlement was the committee proposed in the Fine Gael document and the inflation created by the July budget?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that for more than a decade when the negotiations in respect of pay settlements have got under way a very positive contribution towards solutions was always made by the Government of the day who were prepared on all occasions in the past to offer something to the social partners from the Government side, a contribution that would facilitate a successful outcome? <Col N="861" /> These inputs were known as the non-pay elements and in the past they have had a substantial influence in securing the successful outcome of pay agreements and national understandings.  Can the Minister tell us whether on this occasion any such contribution was made by the Government or whether the Government indicated that they would be prepared to make some contribution on the non-pay element side if a successful outcome could thereby be achieved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

In my area I have had discussions with the unions and we achieved a measure of agreement on a number of iniatives that I will be taking in this House on what might be regarded as non-pay issues.  I have already taken action on some aspects, for instance, the measure that I have brought before the Dáil today.</P>

Would he agree that on all previous occasions these negotiations took a certain form whereby in the first instance the social partners negotiated on pay, that separate from that the trade union side negotiated with the Government on non-pay elements and that this represented a substantial contribution to successful outcomes?  Did such negotiations between the trade union side and the Government take place on this occasion as an integral part of the entire negotiations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to make a statement on the European Council which I attended, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in London, on 26 and 27 November.  The Minister for Agriculture also came to London with us to advise and assist.</P>
      <P>The items for discussion by the Council were:&mdash; (1) the Mandate of 30th May, 1980; (2) the economic and social situation; (3) European Union, including the German/Italian proposals; (4) Enlargement of the Community; and (5) Political Co-operation items including an account of the discussions which the German Chancellor had with President Brezhnev, President Reagan's disarmament proposals, as enunciated in his speech of 18 November, the CSCE negotiations in Madrid and the situations in Poland and Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>There are presidency notes or conclusions on these items which, in accordance with normal practice, I have had laid before both Houses, for the record, including a presidency revision on one point which came in at noon yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I go on to describe in detail the discussions at the Council, I would like to make two points in relation to it which have an immediate and vital bearing on this country.  The first concerns the <Col N="902" /> assessment by the Commission of the economic prospects for the coming year. In its report the Commission highlighted the fact that unemployment in the Community is still rising very fast with the average rate at Community level now above 8 per cent and that the only way out of our difficulties is to pursue a disciplined fiscal and monetary strategy while, at the same time, limiting increases in incomes and wage costs.  This will, they say, lead to an improvement in employment prospects, a fall in interest rates and, therefore, a rise in investment on which economic growth and employment depend.  I need not stress the importance to this country of following the Commission guidelines in relation to both budgetary and incomes policies if we are to achieve the levels of growth necessary to reduce, if not to solve, our basic economic problems.</P>
    <P>A second major concern at the Council was the future of the CAP.  Much of the work of the Community in recent years has been concerned with this policy which has come in for considerable criticism. The operation of the policy is vital to Ireland where about 20 per cent of employment depends directly on agriculture which is also responsible for about 14 per cent of gross national product &mdash; indeed out relative dependence on agriculture is one of the highest in the Community. Farmers' incomes in real terms here have fallen by about 50 per cent since 1978 and are now lower than at the time of our accession to the Community. These considerations are of overwhelming importance in determining Irish attitudes to proposals for changes in the CAP.</P>
    <P>The debate on the mandate, which has profound implications for the future of the Community, centred around the three chapters in the Presidency's document dealing with: &mdash; (1) Development of policies other than the CAP; (2) The Common Agricultural Policy itself; and (3) Budgetary problems.  In an attempt to establish the areas of agreement, our discussions were very lengthy and detailed to a point which I feel was probably unique for a European Council.</P>
    <P>During these discussions I pointed to <Col N="903" /> the fact that we were now engaged in a major review of Community policies, initiated on 30 May 1980, with the primary aim of dealing with what were conceived to be unacceptable situations for one or more member states.  I emphasised that on the basis of certain proposals before the Council there was a danger that it might find itself seeking a solution of what was being called unacceptable budgetary situations &mdash; a concept which I believe to be fundamentally alien to the entire philosophy of the Community &mdash; at the risk, even the certainty, of creating situations which would be unacceptable to other member states through the distortion and emasculation of basic established Community policies, primarily the CAP.</P>
    <P>I said that what was all the more regrettable was that there is now no objective reason to take any major new initiative to reform that policy.  The Community's agricultural policy has gone a considerable distance towards achieving its basic objectives.  It has provided the peoples of the Community with the essential security of food supplies at a cost no greater than that incurred by other major countries and almost certainly at less cost to member states than if they had to support their agricultural individually on a national basis.  The policy has benefited producers and consumers alike.  The prudence of Community pricing policies and the stringency of market management in recent years have had quite a remarkable effect on the percentage of the Community budget taken by agriculture which, as defined for budgetary purposes, has fallen from 74 per cent in 1977 to 63 per cent in 1981.  But this figure of 63 per cent is, itself, unjustifiably inflated.  Excluding concessionary trade items which, in my view, represent derogations from, rather than part of, the CAP, that percentage falls to approximately 55 per cent; and if food aid and MCAs, which are not in logic part of the CAP or properly chargeable to funds for agriculture are excluded, the figure is still lower.  In this connection, I emphasised that the total cost of the CAP is about 0.5 per cent of Community GDP.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> The management of the CAP over the last few years has gone so far towards attaining the objective of restraining expenditure that it is already creating an unacceptable situation for Ireland.  Farming incomes have fallen so drastically, I pointed out to the Council, that Irish farmers are quite unable to see how the Treaty objective of guaranteeing a fair standard of living to farmers is currently being achieved.</P>
    <P>I added that against the background of an increasing world population and the increased opportunities for agriculture exports which that will provide, as recently pointed out by, for example, the US Department of Agriculture and, indeed the UK Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Walker, it would not make good sense to weaken further and perhaps fatally the basis of the Community's continued capacity to contribute to an expanding world trade in agricultural products.</P>
    <P>It is a long established part of the argumentation on the mandate that the benefits and costs of Community membership cannot be measured by reference to the budget alone.  To speak only of Ireland, I remarked how on accession to the Community we agreed to pay a heavy price in the industrial sector on the basis of an assurance of equivalent benefits in agriculture on the same basis of comparative advantage.  Ireland is in all sectors a developing economy.  We have a particularly great dependence on agriculture, the output of which for historical reasons has been held down to an artificially low level for a century and more.  The only way in which our farmers can move forward by their own efforts is through their being allowed the capacity to improve their productivity.  It is for this central reason, I said, that we would be quite unable to accept any artificial limitation on agricultural production whether sought through limitations on agricultural expenditure or by the modulation of guarantees through production targets. I emphasised, in particular, our total opposition to the concept of a super-levy in the milk sector.</P>
    <P>In short then, my fundamental approach in our discussions on the CAP <Col N="905" /> was to oppose any measures which would work against the already dire income situation of our farmers and impede the undoubted development potential of our agriculture sector.</P>
    <P>The debate on the other two chapters of the mandate was less detailed and less protracted than that on the CAP.  In our discussions on chapter 1, we virtually reached agreement on the continuation and expansion of the new Community loan instrument and there was acceptance of the need to widen the criteria in relation to it in order to include infrastructure. I drew particular attention to the need for a reduction in the matching finance from national exchequers to attract such loans.</P>
    <P>On the Regional Fund, I indicated our acceptance of the proposal that the quota section should be concentrated in the areas of greatest need of the less-prosperous member states but that we would have grave reservations on the effect on the Community's Regional Policy if any member state were completely excluded from benefiting from it.  I urged that the question of the size and application of the non-quota section of the fund should be left over for consideration in the context of the forthcoming review of the fund.  In any case, I indicated that the resources of this section should give preference to the less-prosperous member states particularly if it were decided to increase the relative size of this section of the fund.</P>
    <P>Finally, I added that in a situation where disparities in economic performance between the regions of the Community are growing, the Community should lay particular emphasis on the need to take full account of the regional aspects in the development and implementation of Community policies and on the need for co-ordination of all policies towards this end.</P>
    <P>On the Social Fund, I indicated our view that the areas of greatest need as currently designated should continue to have first priority in the allocation of the fund's resources.  On the subjects of innovation, research and development, I emphasised the need to improve technological training and facilities which are <Col N="906" /> essential to effective Community policies in these areas.</P>
    <P>In relation to chapter 3, dealing with budgetary questions, we found it impossible to reach agreement, particularly in relation to the period and the principles of budgetary rebates in favour of the United Kingdom and limitation of budgetary contributions in the case of the German Federal Republic.</P>
    <P>In view of the difficulties on the CAP and the budget, the broad area of agreement which we reached on chapter 1 is, as I have said, provisional, for we had agreed at the start of our discussions that any agreement on any one chapter would depend upon agreement on the other two chapters.  Although we did reach a considerable measure of understanding after many hours discussions, areas of disagreement remained centred on the following four issues: &mdash; milk problem; guidelines on agricultural expenditure; Mediterranean agriculture and the budget problem.</P>
    <P>We finally agreed that Foreign Ministers should meet informally, if possible, before Christmas, but if not, in January, to deal with these outstanding issues and to make recommendations to the heads of government, which it was hoped might be able to be approved without a further meeting.  If a political solution is found, the Council of Ministers would then adopt the necessary formal decisions. Attendance at this special informal meeting will be restricted to Foreign Ministers plus two others.</P>
    <P>The Council endorsed the conclusions of Vice-President Ortoli on the basis of a Commission report on the economic and social situation, save with one or two modifications, namely, the need to cut production and distribution costs, especially unit labour costs, and a need for special attention to be given to youth unemployment and the provision of more training for school leavers.  During these discussions I pointed to the desirability of some easement of the restrictive stance in economic policy at present followed by some member states whose financial and economic situation is less constrained and to the importance of Community solidarity <Col N="907" /> in assisting member states in their unemployment strategies.</P>
    <P>For this purpose I urged the fuller, more concentrated and more flexible use of the Community's means of action. What I had in mind here was the fact that certain member states, such as Ireland, who have the most severe unemployment problems are, by and large, those with the most limited financial resources to resolve them.  I therefore argued the case not only for an increase in but also for modification of certain operating rules of the Community's financial instruments so as to broaden their scope of operation and facilitate governments in using these instruments.</P>
    <P>The level of international interest rates is clearly a critical factor for the Community's future prospects and I agreed with the Commission that the Community should commit itself to seeking organised monetary co-operation with its main partners and in this context suggested that member states might organise themselves more effectively and unitedly through the Community institutions.</P>
    <P>The European Monetary System has been a helpful force towards stability since it came into operation.  As the system is approaching its third anniversary I felt it essential that some further progress should be made in developing it.  I, therefore, expressed our interest in discussing the matter in more depth at our next meeting, where the Commission will present a review of the system and an outline of its future prospects.  I added that I felt we all looked forward to the time when the UK may be able to join the system.</P>
    <P>Although the Council confined itself to a procedural decision on the recent German-Italian proposals on European union and did not discuss the substance of the proposals, it accepted the point, which we had emphasised, that stronger economic integration should proceed hand-in-hand with political development. The Foreign Minister were asked to examine and clarify the German-Italian proposals and to report back to a future meeting of the European Council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> The Council confirmed its political commitment to Community enlargement and emphasised the Community's determination to bring the accession negotiations with Portugal and Spain to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>As is usual, the European Council also considered international political developments. Chancellor Schmidt of the Federal Republic of Germany gave the Heads of State and of Governments an account of his important meeting last week in Bonn with Soviet President Brezhnev.  The Council emphasised the political significance of this meeting at a critical time in East-West relations and welcomed the presentation by Chancellor Schmidt on détente, co-operation and disarmament.  Progress towards major arms control and disarmament will depend in large part on the climate in which the current arms limitation talks are conducted.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will join with me in recognising that over the years Chancellor Schmidt has made a major personal contribution towards securing a favourable climate for serious negotiaions between East and West.  That contribution was obviously reflected most recently both by President Reagan's speech on 18 November and by President Brezhnev's statements in Bonn last week. The Chancellor's key role in promoting dialogue between the super-powers will be a continuing one in the months ahead and is widely appreciated on all sides.  I fully share his view on the importance of dialogue and communication between East and West and on the urgent need for a result from the current disarmament negotiations that will lead to greater security for all parts of Europe through mutual reductions in nuclear and conventional forces.</P>
    <P>The Council also considered the present state of negotiations at the CSCE follow-up meeting in Madrid.  The Council emphasised its desire for a substantive and balanced result by the end of the year, including agreement on a precise mandate so that a Conference on Disarmament in Europe can negotiate stronger confidence-building measures in the whole of Europe.  It is our hope that <Col N="909" /> other participants will show the same positive spirit and seriousness in search of an agreement.</P>
    <P>The Council took note of Poland's continuing need for assistance including debt rescheduling and provision of new credits, in support of the efforts of the Polish people to promote recovery of their national economy.  The Community reaffirmed its willingness to help, within the means available, in co-operation with other countries.</P>
    <P>The Council noted that the continuing Soviet intervention in Afghanistan was immensely damaging to international trust and confidence and pointed to its proposals of 30 June last as a reasonable and practical approach towards a solution.</P>
    <P>The Council did not reach many concrete conclusions.  This was due, in part, to the difficulty and technical detail of the subjects under discussion, where there were vital national interests at stake.  Our discussions were very frank and open right through and this enabled all of us, I think, to obtain an understanding of the difficulties others face.  This progress should, I hope, enable the remaining differences to be more easily settled.  What is essential in the whole process &mdash; apart from the details of any policy &mdash; is that the Community should retain its solidarity and its capacity to grow and develop. That objective must take precedence over individual policies, whatever their importance.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I would like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the efficiency with which the arrangements for the Council were made and to the hospitality and chairmanship of the lady who was our host.  The depth of understanding which was reached about our various positions and the situation of the Community is due in no small amount to the exceptional patience and capability she showed in presiding over our meeting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The full extent of the failure of the European Council meeting in London on which the Taoiseach has just reported can be gauged from the fact that for the first time no agreed statement <Col N="910" /> on conclusions was issued on the central issues discussed.</P>
      <P>Let me make it clear that I do not propose to try to attach blame for the failure of this European Council meeting on the Taoiseach, though as the relevant Dáil Debates will show he would certainly have sought to do so were our positions reversed.  At the same time I cannot share his complacency about the outcome of the meeting or regard it as an achievement that at least bad decisions were avoided.</P>
      <P>It appears that the Council's discussions were allowed to be dominated entirely by the budgetary problems and by the attack on the common agricultural policy to the virtual exclusion of other vital issues and in particular the crisis level of unemployment throughout the Community.  The unhealthy obsession with limited aspects of the Community's affairs over the last three years is worrying and a major cause of disillusionment with the EEC in the member countries.</P>
      <P>The effect of this preoccupied bickering over what are relatively minor matters having regard to the size of the Community's total GDP is damaging, and is nothing to be complacent about.  It is salutary to recall that had the founding partners of the Community approached their task with the same limited outlook there would never have been a Community.</P>
      <P>I would like, first, to turn to matters that ought to have been discussed in depth at this European Council meeting. I see it as totally unreal that any European Council meeting at this time should have failed to devote at least a substantial amount of its time to the discussion of the unemployment crisis in the Community where the number out of work is eight million and is still rising.  At every European Council I attended I sought to focus attention on this reality, but apparently this was not a major issue in London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw the Taoiseach's attention to the conclusions of the European Council at Maastricht in March 1981.  For the first time we succeeded in having it clearly acknowledged that unemployment was not just a matter which should be left to <Col N="911" /> individual national Governments to deal with in their own way, but that it was a Community problem and as such Community resources and institutions should be mobilised to tackle it.</P>
    <P>The following is the relevant quotation from the Maastricht Communiqué:</P>
    <P>The high and rising rate of unemployment especially among youth is a cause of deep concern to the European Council.  It was agreed that the fight against this evil should be conducted not only by the member states but also at the Community level.</P>
    <P>The Community can further contribute to economic recovery by fully utilising existing mechanisms for policy co-ordination and by ensuring that the existing funds and financing mechanisms contribute as much as possible to agreed social and economic objectives and the reduction of unemployment. Particular attention should be given in this context to the possibilities of providing advanced technological training and education for youth.</P>
    <P>That was the content of the Maastricht communiqué.  I would like to draw the attention of the House to the contrast between that statement of that Summit and the position which emerged from the recent Summit in London.</P>
    <P>The subjects which the Foreign Ministers have been asked to study and decide upon do not apparently include Community action to combat unemployment, despite the fact that the Commission in its report on the mandate produced a very useful paper on the subject which is relevant to our situation in Ireland.  Perhaps the reason for this is that the European Council have already agreed in principle on an anaemic and perfunctory formula, which simply involves a mixture of pious aspirations and the continuation of existing Community instruments, without including any real steps, qualitative or quantitative, which would do justice to the Commission's proposals.  We, of course, welcome the raising of the Ortoli Fund's borrowing capacity to 3 billion ECU's so as to increase the EIB's lending capacity, from <Col N="912" /> which we have profited, but this constitutes no more than a necessary extension to an existing Community loan instrument.</P>
    <P>The Commission in fact specifically proposed a strengthening of the Social Fund, &ldquo;so as to provide at all levels, in member states the financial resources necessary to support the job creation process&rdquo;.  They also recommend the development of &ldquo;a regional perspective in job creation policy, which takes account of the need to concentrate resources and initiatives in disadvantaged regions&rdquo;.  The Commission paper, which I have just quoted entitled &ldquo;Job Creation: Priorities for Action&rdquo; is a paper which is timely and constructive and which ought to have been made a major element in the Summit discussions.  There has been no indication from the Taoiseach that he sought to focus attention on this crucial issue.  Interestingly, among the Commission's recommendations to national governments were two which have been deliberately flouted by this Government. There is the recommendation &ldquo;to develop counter-inflationary measures in a manner most likely to favour economic recovery and employment growth&rdquo;, which is completely contrary to this Coalition Government's pro-inflationary fiscal strategy.  The other recommendation was to &ldquo;establish a social consensus and the full participation of all partners concerned, in particular through dialogue with the social partners&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Moving in exactly the opposite direction this Government, when they came into office, made it clear they did not hold with national understandings but put their faith instead in the ridiculous proposal of &ldquo;norms&rdquo; to be prepared by a committee of economists.  Thankfully, that proposal has been discarded, but as of now there is less social consensus than for a long time.  The trade unions fundamentally disagree with Government economic policy and farmers and teachers, to mention some of the more obvious areas of disillusionment, are equally hostile.</P>
    <P>The Commission paper concentrates on youth employment and the need to ensure that within five years those under <Col N="913" /> the age of 18 are guaranteed education, training or work experience, and over the age of 18 are assisted to enter into the labour market.  The Commission state that &ldquo;increasing the possibility of intervention and the creation of a wide range of jobs for the 19 to 25 age group must be given greater emphasis&rdquo;.  The paper from which I am quoting states:</P>
    <P>There is a wide range of measures available to the Commission to assist the entry into the working life of this age group.  The Commission would wish to consider <i>inter alia:</i> Selective recruitment subsidies; Forms of managing working hours; Training facilities leading to entrepreneurial activities; Assisting those schemes at present in operation in member states, whether public or private, designed to create employment.</P>
    <P>All these suggestions by the Commission are of immense relevance to Ireland, and I cannot understand why the Taoiseach, presiding over an unemployment rate of 130,000, which is likely to rise as a direct result of Government economic policies, did not insist that real action in this field should also be carried forward for decision by the Foreign Ministers.</P>
    <P>I turn now to a related subject, which was on the agenda of the European Council but which was also not adequately discussed, namely, the draft of the Fifth Medium-Term Economic Policy Programme.  The Taoiseach has used this document very selectively to seek to demonstrate that the Commission endorses Government economic policy, notably the passage on page 3 which speaks of the need to reduce public deficits, especially those substantially larger than the average in the Community.  This, of course, begs an important question: whether Government economic policy, despite its stated aims, is going to lead to any reduction in the current budget deficit. The tax package is likely, I understand, on the Government's own calculations to contribute to a current budget deficit of 9½ per cent of GNP next year, over 1½ per cent above this year's level, in the absence of severely deflationary measures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="914" /> In fact, if the Taoiseach were to study the Commission's document more closely, he would see that its criticisms of budget deficiting were particularly directed at Belgium and Italy, which have automatic wage indexation and a much more costly and elaborate social security system than we have.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach might profitably take to heart, and direct the attention of his Cabinet colleagues to, what was said in other parts of the Draft Economic Policy Programme. Paragraph 5.3.2. states unequivocally the following: &ldquo;Increases in indirect taxation directly feed the inflationary process&rdquo;.  If that sentence is taken in conjunction with remarks about the effects of inflation, &ldquo;that inflation has taken deep roots and is a threat to our prosperity&rdquo; and that &ldquo;improved price stability in all Member States, and particularly in those where inflation is above average, is an essential precondition for achieving other objectives&rdquo;, then it must be clear to the Taoiseach how utterly irresponsible Fine Gael's election promises were and how their implementation now would put our chances of returning to growth seriously at risk.</P>
    <P>It will be of interest to the House that the Draft Economic Policy Programme not merely endorses but preaches the high investment policies pursued by the Fianna Fáil Government both this year and last.  Last year Ireland alone was able to match Japan's share of investment in GNP amounting to 32 per cent, which the Commission declares as &ldquo;a significant illustration of the relative dynamism&rdquo; of the Japanese and EEC economies.  We put what were by our standards massive resources into energy investment so as to increase our energy independence.  I would mention the coal-fired power station at Moneypoint, the gas pipeline and peat development.  The Commission states that such investment must be given a particular priority.  We gave it such priority.</P>
    <P>The Commission also states that public investment in areas such as telecommunications and transport &ldquo;encourages structural change and leads or complements private investment, and that such spending must be favoured&rdquo;.  We did so, but <Col N="915" /> strong evidence is now emerging which would indicate that the telecommunications investment we initiated is now being cut back.  It appears that the Government and their monetarist economic advisers are poised to cut public investment, despite its spin-off effect of encouraging the private investment of which the Commission speaks.  The Government should take to heart the following piece of Commission advice: &ldquo;It is essential to be selective in exercising discipline, to avoid perverse effects that some spending cuts may make, such as, reductions in those investment programmes which contribute to improving economic structures and which provided jobs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Community makes a limited contribution to the development of infrastructure through the Regional Fund.  Last year we obtained £52 million from this source, about one-sixth of what we are spending this year on energy investment alone.  The Commission in its Report on the Mandate states unequivocally:</P>
    <P>The Commission believes that major changes should be made to enhance the effectiveness of its interventions and increase its impact.  There is a strong case for greater concentration of the fund's budgetary resources, which are likely to remain inadequate to cope with the development problems that will increasingly face the Community as it continues to enlarge. The section of the Regional Fund at present divided into national quotas, should be adjusted to focus even more on regions suffering severely from structural underdevelopment.</P>
    <P>The Commission is recommending a substantial expansion of the non quota section. What has happened to all this and what has the Government done to give vigorous support to the Commission's views on this subject?  It appears that the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs are happy to be fobbed off with ritual and meaningless verbal assurances about convergence, when in fact what is taking place is increasing divergence, as the recent NESC report clearly shows. Our income <i>per capita</i> has dropped from <Col N="916" /> about 65 per cent of the EEC average in 1973 to 61 per cent in 1981.</P>
    <P>It would appear from a report in the British newspaper, <i>The Guardian</i>, of 28 November that attempts to reform the regional fund have already been abandoned. I quote from that newspaper:</P>
    <P>The British Government conceded that regional spending in the future could be extended to the richer as well as the poorest EEC states and this cleared out of the way one of the problems in the section dealing with alternative EEC policies to agriculture.</P>
    <P>If that represents the outcome, then it is a particularly negative and detrimental one from our point of view.  Given the total inadequacy of the funding of the regional fund since its creation, it is outregeous that its funds should be allocated to rich and poor countries alike.  No worthwhile convergence or even compensation for the effects of free trade can be achieved in this way.  The discussions on the mandate offered a major opportunity to have this situation revised, and I am at a loss why the Taoiseach, who has always pleaded strongly for the regional fund, should have conceded our position, instead of insisting that it be carried forward for further examination by the Foreign Ministers.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of the budget which was placed at the centre of the European Council's deliberations.  It seems that all sense of proportion has been lost in these discussions.  An obsession with net exchequer flows has crowded out appreciation of the benefits of economic integration.  There is no doubt in my mind that the Community should have stuck to its position with regard to the British budgetary contribution reached in Dublin in December 1979.  The blocking tactics exercised thereafter and acceded to set a very unhealthy precedent.  The Taoiseach, by way of a petty comment recently, criticised me for agreeing to the solution of the British budgetary problems.  But as I explained at the time, it was hardly appropriate for a substantial beneficiary country like Ireland to object when richer countries decided to end the very real <Col N="917" /> and serious interruption of Community business then existing by agreeing to take on the burden.</P>
    <P>Britain as an industrialised country with a tiny agricultural sector entered the Community on the understanding that it would be a net contributor.  Its industry is in a position to benefit greatly from Community membership, and if it has failed to do so to the extent expected, that is not the fault of other member states.  The Community was and is based on a trade-off between free trade and the common agricultural policy and the rules should not be permanently altered to suit the purely budgetary demands of any state.  The Government must make it clear that a solution to the British problem, which consisted of repayments via abatements of this country's FEOGA receipts, would under no circumstances be acceptable to us.</P>
    <P>There appears to have been little discussion of the desirability of raising the 1 per cent VAT limit and it is another topic in which we have a deep interest, which has not been included in the discussion for the Foreign Ministers.  This limit, besides depressing agricultural incomes, makes it impossible for the Community to develop or to bring forward a more balanced range of Community policies.  The opposition of the larger member states, arising completely from self-interest, may lead to a situation where disillusionment with the Community becomes widespread.  If the Community has little to offer towards the solution of the major problems we all face, it will increasingly be regarded as peripheral and irrelevant.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the subject of the most vital interest to Ireland, the common agricultural policy.  Great play has been made by the Taoiseach of an entirely empty achievement with regard to the super-levy on milk.  This super-levy was a non-starter, and farmers will not be taken in by hailing the outcome as a victory when, in fact, there was no contest. To my mind, there is a negative and a positive battle to be fought in the EEC over agriculture.  The negative battle is to fight off potentially disastrous changes in the agricultural policy.  Now that the matter <Col N="918" /> is being turned over to the Foreign Ministers, with as few experts as possible, we shall be looking to our Foreign Minister to provide continued and resolute defence of our interests and of the basic principles of the common agricultural policy.  There is a great onus on his shoulders now, and he can be assured of whatever political backing he may need in this respect from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>The cost of the CAP, as a result of persistent and highly publicised British and German propaganda, has been exaggerated out of all proportion.  The truth is that it forms a large part of a minimal budget.  Community support for agriculture has declined to 0.4 per cent of its GDP.  I notice the Taoiseach uses 0.5 per cent but it does not matter.  A sizeable proportion of the agricultural budget is spent on food aid.  The surpluses have largely disappeared in the last couple of years.  We must oppose artificial production limits or the penalisation of production. Agricultural output, including milk output, has actually dropped in Ireland over the last two years and there is a good case for demanding the suspension of the co-responsibility levy altogether, at least until milk production in Ireland has been restored to the levels it reached two or three years ago.</P>
    <P>The Community should recognise that it is partly responsible for the crisis in agriculture not only in Ireland but in some other countries notably Denmark, by depressing farm incomes.  The Community must ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community and this is simply not compatible with reducing support prices towards world prices.</P>
    <P>An Irish Government has a positive as well as a negative battle to fight in Brussels. There needs to be greater appreciation of the role agriculture plays in the economy of the Community, particularly in providing down the line employment. It does not make sense in any part of the Community to drive people off the land at a time of high unemployment.  It must also be made clear that farmers are not prepared to go on producing food for the rest of the Community at prices that require that the farmers live at or below subsistence level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> I must remind the House and farmers that it was a Fianna Fáil Government that made a successful case in Brussels for special treatment for Irish farmers.  This Government's case for special treatment would be greatly assisted if they were not themselves greatly contributing to inflation through their shift to indirect taxation. However, given our fixed exchange rate in the EMS and the fact that a significant differential in rates of inflation will exist for some time to come, I believe we must press specifically for a study by the Commission of the particular problems for farm incomes arising from differential rates of inflation, so that appropriate action can be taken in time for next year's farm price fixing.</P>
    <P>There was also at this Summit, I believe, some discussion on the problems of enlargement and of the position of Greece.  To my mind, the Community has not handled the second enlargement situation well.  All member states are agreed on the political desirability of extending the Community, but there is a lack of generosity in the welcome being extended.  The whole future of the Community is clouded, unless the wealthier member states are prepared to show more flexibility.  I accept that it is not in Ireland's power greatly to influence the decisions on these matters.  But what influence we have we should use to urge recognition of the special claims of the poorer states of the Community.</P>
    <P>On the political front, there appears to have been very little time for discussion with the British Prime Minister on the situation in Northern Ireland.  This was a great pity, because we might have expected the Taoiseach to use the opportunity to impress on the British Prime Minister the dangers created by current developments which pose a new direct threat to peace and stability.  The overwhelming need at present is for impartial peace-keeping and the protection of the members of each section of the community from threats from whatever direction they may arise.  It is somewhat discouraging that in the present tense situation, time was not found for a meeting between <Col N="920" /> the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister.</P>
    <P>It is with a considerable sense of irony that I note that the Genscher-Colombo proposals for a European Act that would bring security and defence within the ambit of the Community were put on the agenda of the European Council.  The House will recall the hysterical outburst by the Taoiseach a few weeks ago, when to everyone's surprise, he attacked Deputy Brian Lenihan in a personalised and quite immoderate fashion on the basis that Deputy Lenihan had agreed to the discussion of options other than those proposed by Ireland.  This he claimed set Ireland &ldquo;on a slippery slope of a highly dangerous kind&rdquo;, putting us under &ldquo;immense pressure&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach's position on that occasion was absurd and illogical, as I am sure he now realises.</P>
    <P>The European Act contains proposals far more dangerous to Irish neutrality than anything contained in either of the options retained for consideration at Venlo, where Deputy Lenihan rejected the option that has now reappeared on the agenda of the European Council.  In view of this, the Taoiseach owes a public apology to Deputy Lenihan for the entirely unjustified aspersions he cast on him in this House on 21 October.</P>
    <P>Let me inform the House of some of the salient proposals in the proposed European Act.  The heads of Government are asked in the preamble to express their conviction &ldquo;that the security of Europe must also be guaranteed by joint action in the field of security policy which at the same time helps to maintain the common security of the partners in the Atlantic Alliance&rdquo;.  This phraseology makes it clear that security is being used simply as a euphemism for defence.  The member states are then asked to endorse as an aim &ldquo;the co-ordination of security policy and the adoption of common European positions in this sphere in order to safeguard European independence, protect its vital interests and strengthen its security&rdquo;.  The draft Act further states that for the purposes of co-ordination in matters of security, &ldquo;The Council may convene in a different composition if there is a need to deal with <Col N="921" /> matters of common interest in more detail&rdquo;.  That is of course another euphemism, this time for a Council of Defence Ministers.</P>
    <P>On this side of the House we have already expressed grave reservations about the decisions taken by the Foreign Ministers with the approval of the Irish Government in London in October, and the interpretations to which they have given rise.  The Sinai peace force has been widely represented as the EEC's first military decision, but the Greek Government seems to have been the only one to oppose this Sinai force.  It is significant to note that <i>Agence Europe</i>, the respected voice of Brussels opinion, on 2-3 November 1981, said that Mr. Papandreou's opposition could result and I quote &ldquo;in a blockage of political co-operation in several important areas, and that the day after decisions had been taken to strengthen mechanisms of this co-operation, including an investigation of the problems of defence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record of this House our objection to the way in which the development of the Community is becoming increasingly unbalanced in this way, contrary to our best interests.  Our Ministers and diplomats have no mandate to concede or abandon our neutrality, to which the vast majority of our population, and our young people particularly, are keenly attached.</P>
    <P>We were all clear at the time of entry that, in the event of full political, economic and monetary union being achieved, we would not stand in the way of such a union being completed by a defence element to protect what would then be a full community of interests. This stage has nowhere near been reached.  Commissioner O'Kennedy, in a speech two weeks ago in the European Parliament, referred to economic and monetary union as &ldquo;a dim and distant aim&rdquo;.  We are now witnessing increased security co-operation, while at the same time the CAP is being attacked at its foundations and there is an adamant refusal to consider an increase in the 1 per cent VAT ceiling, the only way whereby worth-while economic and social progress can be achieved.  What is being <Col N="922" /> sought is to reverse the entire timetable of European integration, to abandon the goal of full economic union, and to put political co-operation and defence in its place.  That is not the basis on which we entered the Community, and it represents a serious reversal of thinking and approach entirely detrimental to our interests.</P>
    <P>Both the Community and Ireland will be the losers, if the pace is forced in this manner.  The Community has nothing to gain by striving to become a military bloc or a superpower, as, I am informed, former Commissioner Professor Dahrendorf argued last week in London.  It already has considerable economic and political influence, much of which will be lost if it seeks to enter into power politics. Ireland's entry to the Community was of great significance, as it showed that a neutral country could be a member of the EEC.  Will this no longer be the case?</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that our standing in the world will be greatly changed if we are perceived to have become <i>de facto</i> members of the Atlantic Alliance and increasingly identified with NATO decisions, such as the Sinai force.  Our ability to contribute to the UN will be prejudiced thereby, as also will be our dealings with the Third World and with Arab, African and Latin-American countries.</P>
    <P>It is high time that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs came out and stated, clearly and publicly, what is afoot.  We want to know from them if they agree with us that we should not be committed to military entanglements by stealth and that we do not approve military decisions taken in the Community's name.  When full economic and monetary union has been achieved, and when Ireland's <i>per capita</i> income is at least 80 per cent of the Community average and rising, instead of 61 per cent as it is today, then the question, as far as we are concerned, may be reopened.  But this assumes steady progress to convergence which is conspicuously lacking today.  At that stage any agreement of the type proposed would of course have to be submitted for ratification to the Irish Parliament.</P>
    <P>Many of the ideas in the draft Act, <Col N="923" /> apart from these I have mentioned, are worth serious examination, though it must be doubted after last week's experience whether attaching additional responsibilities to the European Council would improve the speed and quality of the Community's decision-making.  We do not wish to enter into any military engagements so long as we are a divided country, as to do so could pose grave dangers to our internal stability.  Also, as I said in March, as recorded in the Official Report, Volume 327, column 1396:</P>
    <P>The security interests of other countries may be best served by membership of military alliances.  Ours at present are best served by a policy of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>Our political commitment is to Europe, but any military commitment by us can be only to the United Nations for peacekeeping purposes.</P>
    <P>The vision we have of Europe is of a continent united is prosperity and peace, based on the recognition rather than the suppression of individual national identity and culture, with member states acting together for common purposes and subject to such bodies as they may choose freely to set up to arbitrate between them, in which due sensitivity will be shown to the vital interests and concerns of the smaller as well as the stronger nations.  We would wish the European entity to exercise a moral, political, economic and cultural influence on the world, helping to bridge conflict and misunderstanding and using its economic strength to ease the problems caused by poverty, hunger and injustice.  We seek a Europe dedicated to economic solidarity and equality between the member states and the regions, which will bring its full resources to bear on unemployment, and which will maintain the fabric of rural life by giving farmers adequate and fair incomes.</P>
    <P>The London Summit achieved nothing in this direction but instead devoted itself to bargaining and bookkeeping.  No one comes out of it with much credit.  We now need decisions which will reforge the European spirit as we have known it, <Col N="924" /> leading to genuine development and progress.  The failures and omissions of the London European Council must be repaired, and we hope the Taoiseach and the Irish Government are determined to play their full part in that process of repair.  If they are and refuse to have the Community entangled in military alignments and power blocks they can count on our support, but if they acquiesce either openly or in secret with what we see as a major subversion of the legitimate aims and purposes of the Community, they can expect our implacable opposition.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment at 1.30 p.m. I was speaking of the importance of education and I referred to people from industry, trade unions and education being cloistered together.  From that I come to the composition of the board as outlined by the Minister in his statement.  He stated that they will have two members from the ICTU, two members from the employers' organisations, two from the National Youth Council, one from the Department of Education, one from the Department of the Environment, and three nominees of the Minister, one of whom shall be the chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often we are all aware at meetings, wherever they may be, of the problem of money being spent on social welfare. We are aware that this amount of money has been increasing continually, particularly in the field of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  I suggest to the Minister that he may on Committee Stage if he so wishes increase the number of people on the board to 12 or 13 or he may appoint one of his nominees a person from the Department of Social Welfare.  I would like to see a person appointed who is closely associated with employment benefit and unemployment assistance because, with increases that have been given in social <Col N="925" /> welfare, there are people on social welfare benefits in receipt of moneys equivalent, in some cases, to what a young person would get in his first-time employment. Therefore, it would be advisable if we are going to have this agency, which is an umbrella organisation, to supervise the various schemes we have for youth employment, to have somebody from the Department of Social Welfare, particularly someone who has a knowledge of unemployment benefits and assistance, to see how money paid by taxpayers and PRSI contributors is being spent. Through some of these schemes we might be able to use young people who are on the unemployment register.  When I say young people I am referring to those under 35 years of age.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes from a constituency which is very like mine and I am sure he is aware of complaints with regard to money paid out in unemployment assistance and unemployment benefits. People feel it should be used to supplement some of the schemes which were put in operation by the Fianna Fáil Government and which are now being expanded by the present Government.  If the Minister cannot include one person from the Department of Social Welfare from the three nominees he is going to make, he should extend the board to 12 in order to get someone who has experience in that Department of this terrible problem of people who are on unemployment benefit but who are capable of working.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech that these measures were designed to ensure that no young person is left without some sort of work.  When we are speaking to young people we should not overplay our hand.  Young people today are far more mature than we were.  They are aware there is a recession and of the problems we face.  We cannot promise them all that we are going to get them jobs.  It is a credit to many young people, who have gone to third level education or to regional colleges and who find that there are no jobs for them, whatever their qualifications, that they have gone to work on the factory floors.  I admire them for that and I have the greatest respect for them <Col N="926" /> but I would not like them to think that when this Bill is passed the Youth Employment Agency is going to guarantee and will be designed to ensure that no young person is left without a job.  The last time we had a reduction in unemployment figures was in May of this year. there was a reduction of 2,500 but, in every month since that, there was an increase in unemployment figures.  Bearing in mind that so many people left school in June and July the largest number of people who registered for employment are young people.</P>
    <P>Anything that can be done to extend the various programmes which will give employment to young people is very welcome. In his speech the Minister also mentioned the forthcoming report of the OECD team led by Mrs. Shirley Williams which examined our youth employment problems and our existing schemes earlier this year.  At that time I was Minister for Labour and I was very pleased to meet Mrs. Williams who was the leader of the group.  Since then, as we know, she has become a member of the House of Commons and I presume she will resign her position on the team.  That will not stop the document being prepared and I look forward to seeing what the report is like.  I am satisfied that when that team came over here they were keenly interested and met all the people they could to find out the extent of the unemployment situation.  They were keenly interested in the problem because of our young population and the high percentage of youth unemployment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as an extension of all the schemes that we implemented when we were in Government.  The Minister did not mention any new schemes but even an extension of existing ones is very welcome.  I am concerned about financing it and taking £63 million by putting 1 per cent on PRSI contributions by every worker and salary earner.  He is also going to take 1 per cent which will represent about £7.5 million, from farmers and self-employed by an assessment on health charges.  If you are introducing a Bill of this nature, it should be financed by normal methods on budget day.  Many people do not realise that when the Minister <Col N="927" /> introduced this Bill, welcome as it is, there was a mini-budget included in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pleasure, as the youngest Member of this House, that the first opportunity I have to make a speech is on the Youth Employment Agency Bill, 1981, which is a special recognition of young people and the specific problems relating to them.  We must commend the Minister and the Government for the alacrity with which they met their commitments by bringing in this measure.  It would be usual to have Green Papers, White Papers and consultative documents which would stretch for over a year.  The Minister has a great enthusiasm for this area of his responsibility and this he has clearly shown by setting up a limited liability company so that it will be in operation in early 1982.</P>
      <P>Special mention must be made of the National Manpower Service and their consultative committee which reported in November 1980.  This was a very relevant document on youth employment.  A contribution from the National Youth Council of Ireland and EEC reports have also been very effective and worthwhile.</P>
      <P>Welcoming the setting up of the agency I particularly welcome their concept, their statutory base and their financial independence.  In welcoming this the Coalition are not saying it is a substitute for sound economic planning and policy and it will not, by itself solve the unemployment problem.  What it does is to clearly meet the specific needs and many and varied problems of the age group between 15 and 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First there is the transition from school to work that no other age group seeking jobs has; this is a position of weakness and inexperience.  In a time of recession we have redundancies.  It is common union practice that the last in is the first out and young people are particularly vulnerable in this area.  Because we have higher standards of education, our young people are more idealistic and have <Col N="928" /> higher expectations than their parents and those who have gone before them, and it is extra demoralising and disillusioning when they cannot get jobs.</P>
    <P>Over 40 per cent of our unemployed are in the age group of 15 to 24.  As the Minister said, since January 1980 the growth of this sector of the unemployed has been 80 per cent.  The age group 15 to 19 years have problems of lower productivity for the same wage, and there is very little incentive for employers to take them on.  We also have demographic considerations and problems which are particular to this country within an EEC context.  Between 1975 and 1995 our labour force will double.  This is verified by the fact that over 50 per cent of our population are under 25 and recent census figures show that with the increased birth rate this trend will continue.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons this agency is urgently needed.  There is an urgent need for long-term planning throughout this decade and beyond for proper youth employment policies.  In studying the role of the agency we must look at existing services.  We must look at all the structures provided under the Department of Labour and other Departments.  I believe all these services and agencies provide a disjointed, incomplete and insufficient answer to the problem of youth unemployment.</P>
    <P>I have always believed the National Manpower Service should have been a national manpower authority.  Because they get their finances from the Department of Labour Vote they are under-financed, under-staffed and totally ineffective in dealing with young people's problems.</P>
    <P>In my constituency I meet many people of my own age.  Some are graduates and others have diplomas from the RTC.  The first thing I ask is if they are registered with the National Manpower Service. Ninety per cent of them are but they still cannot find jobs.  The present agency are not providing the required service.  The best feature of the agency is the work experience courses, £20 per week being paid to employers who retain these workers. At present there are about 5,000 employed under this scheme.  As the <Col N="929" /> placement rate in retainable jobs is about 80 per cent, there is a great need for doubling this figure.</P>
    <P>AnCO have an industrial training role to play.  The apprenticeship and adult training courses are excellent.  I visited the regional centre in Waterford which provides the excellent skilled requirements needed for our new labour force. Like the National Manpower Service AnCO needs to be expanded.  I believe there are certain counties which have lost out and have a higher proportion of refusals for AnCO courses.</P>
    <P>I am very critical of the community training projects scheme.  In Enniscorthy there was a particular development &mdash; the Enniscorthy Boys' Club.  They have been waiting three years for their project to be completed.  Many of the lads come from Waterford and they work very few hours a day because of travelling.  There are not a sufficient number of overseers there.  This scheme needs to be looked at.  If money is scarce this scheme should not be given the priority it is getting at present.  This is borne out by the fact that many other local voluntary groups that have proposed developments are not availing of this service because they know of the red tape and delays involved.</P>
    <P>In this area of community projects works I welcome the new scheme of capital grants for recreational and sporting facilities announced by the Department of Education.  This is a very worthy exercise as will be borne out by the number of applications received before the closing date.  When we talk about young people we must also take into account their leisure time and ensure their time is taken up constructively.  My only fear is that as these projects are put for tender and approved and inspected in the normal way by the Department, there is no guarantee young people will be employed.  The contractor who has entered the lowest tender will get the job. There is no guarantee that young people will be employed.  Therefore I do not believe this is an answer to the problem of the young.</P>
    <P>Examining the overall agencies and bodies that operate in the area of youth employment we see that they are all <Col N="930" /> doing their best in their own areas, but there is no co-ordination.  Each scheme is under-financed and there is no overall or isolated evaluation of the scheme.  This is where the agency will have a role to play.</P>
    <P>We must examine the existing educational policy at second level.  The type of academic curriculum pursued at present is a direct aggravation to young school leavers trying to find jobs.  The kind of textbook education they get does not meet practical requirements.  Many people do the leaving certificate at 16 and 17 years of age and when they are ready to apply for jobs the first thing they face is a statement in advertisements to the effect that applicants must be 18 years or over.  That means that there is a 12 to 18 month gap before they can hope to get official employment, even with State bodies.  The problem of young people leaving school too early certainly needs to be examined.  The points system for the leaving certificate has no practical bearing or usefulness for when children finish school.  I would like to see subjects such as technical drawing, building construction and work study and practice included in the curriculum, so that students in fifth year who are choosing their subjects for the leaving certificate will have an incentive under the points system to take up those practical studies.  There is a need for technical and scientific education and there should be an incentive towards that in secondary schools. The RTCs are doing an excellent job in this regard but there is need for further liaison between the National Council for Educational Awards, who present diplomas and certificates through the RTC courses, and industry.  That should be done so that we can get in young people who are employable and have the skills needed.</P>
    <P>School leavers are ill-equipped to handle even such simple things as filling up application forms or sitting for interviews. Our schemes at present are scattered and as a result many young people must approach local representatives or the National Manpower Service in the hope of getting a job.  In many cases they <Col N="931" /> do not get any further than completing an application form because employers do not reply to them.  It is no wonder that they are becoming frustrated.  That is one of the reasons why I welcome the establishment of the agency.  Many young people look to this agency with new hope that it will meet their problems and the problems that will be faced by their younger brothers and sisters.  The Minister must establish the extent of the problem and prepare a plan to solve it. The first move the agency must make is to compile a register of those who are unemployed.  There is a view that the National Manpower Service should carry out that duty but I reject that because the National Manpower Service did not keep such a register in the last ten years.  I do not think they have the personnel, the finance or the structures to keep a proper register.  I am talking about a register of those who are unemployed between the ages of 15 and 25.  Areas experiencing problems in regard to unemployment could be identified and the agency could put more finance into them to create more jobs.  It is the intention that the agency will operate a guaranteed system of a job within 12 months of leaving school and the preparation of a register as I suggested would help in that regard. If the agency is to be as effective as we would all like to see it, it is essential that it controls registration.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see the agency setting up a research unit to monitor and evaluate the programmes and schemes that are in operation to help young people get employment.  We are producing people for jobs that are not available because of the excess in those areas.  At the same time there is a shortage of young people with skills.  There is a fundamental need for such a unit to look at the areas that have excesses in requirements and those that need to re-evaluate courses. When considering youth unemployment we must remember that this does not occur only in the lower paid area.  Proportionately there are as many unemployed graduates and they, and their parents, have put a lot of money into their education.  Such people are utterly frustrated <Col N="932" /> because they cannot get employment. The research unit I have suggested could look at such areas as agri-business, horticulture and so on to see if graduates can obtain employment in them.  It should not cater for manual workers only.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the IDA regional offices have projects to help young people or those anxious to set up an enterprise.  The IDA is available to grant-aid projects that will lead to a reduction in imports instead of such industries as printing, the bottling of soft drinks or meat processing where there is an excess already.  All available information should be given to the agency which would then be in a position to play an advisory role and that role would be monitored by the research unit.  I accept that there will be teething problems with the agency as occurs in all new bodies but a research unit must be established to examine and evaluate the overall success rate of each scheme.</P>
    <P>The agency should also play an educational role and have powers to investigate and recommend changes in our second level system.  The curriculum must be looked at but I would like to see the agencies appointing a career guidance adviser who would be responsible for career guidance counsellors attending at schools throughout the country.  There is also a need to make civics courses mandatory in secondary schools so that children are advised on the filling out of application forms and are made aware of social welfare entitlements, tax matters, trade union and work practices and so on.  There is a basic ignorance about such matters among young people and they have to approach public representatives. They should undergo a work preparation programme in their schools under the auspices of the new agency.  Schools should be visited twice yearly by representatives of the agency and the agency should also invite representatives of the employers so that they can have a complete awareness of all problems.  We could call this a count down to careers and it should only be available to young people to see that they are better prepared when leaving school.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> I am most concerned about the direct employment role of the agency.  Most expenditure should be on specific projects. In the area of agriculture we have the farm apprenticeship board and relief services operated by Macra na Feirme. This morning I attended a meeting between the IFA and Macra and I heard the head of the family farm section speak of the need to train the new generation of farmers' wives.  In many cases those people were teachers or nurses before marriage and did not have any direct experience of agriculture.  With greater mechanisation on farms there is also a greater role for the farm apprenticeship board to play.  The new agency should also assist in those areas.  Deputy Allen spoke about inner-city groups and I should like to add that there is a role for direct community involvement in urban renewal, or where there are specific projects that need to be undertaken &mdash; either in an urban or in a deprived rural area in respect of which the agency on the basis of their register have assessed the problem and concluded that no individual employer can solve that problem.  In such circumstances they could examine the possibility of setting up temporary projects.</P>
    <P>In towns there are many instances where both husband and wife are out at work or where there are elderly people living alone and who are not able to undertake essential services in the home such as sweeping a chimney, clearing blocked drains and so on.  There is a strong case for the agency to consider the setting up of local agencies, possibly through a network of local committees, whereby services would be co-ordinated and people with the type of problems I have mentioned could approach the agency and they, in turn, would hire young people to do the necessary work. We all experience difficulty in acquiring the services of a plumber of a carpenter. If the agency at local level were to become involved in such activity, they would be contributing directly to employment. When set up, the board should have no reservations in trying pilot schemes.  I would hope that they would be courageous in this respect and would <Col N="934" /> not adopt a penny-pinching approach. The only way in which to find out whether schemes might be successful is to try them and test them fully.</P>
    <P>In the area of tourism we had in Dublin recently, for instance, a young traveller hotel set up.  There is also the area of hostels in which people are required for such duties as caretaking, supervision, domestic work and so on.  These are specific employment roles that the agency might consider.  However, if there is any question of the board setting up regional type situations as happened in the case of the health boards or of the IDA, I would fear that we would be setting up another layer of bureaucracy.  If the agency is to be on those lines I would suggest setting up on a voluntary basis if possible a complete network of local committees who would report directly to the various public bodies and make recommendations in regard to their individual areas.</P>
    <P>In certain areas in which there are specific problems the agency would do well to play a direct capital investment role though within their budget it may not be possible to make the type of capital allocation that would be necessary but they could provide the incentives in areas in which neither the public nor private sectors can meet the requirements of young people.</P>
    <P>The concept of youth co-operatives is worthwhile and should be assisted and grant-aided directly.  As a matter of priority the agency should have the assistance of young entrepreneurs whose talents and time would be very beneficial.  Moneys spent in this way would be recouped by the Exchequer in due course.  The co-operatives would ensure the retention of young people in employment.</P>
    <P>It is very important also that the agency have a strong public relations unit and that they have a very high public profile. The Minister expressed particular personal concern that the agency would operate in deprived and disadvantaged areas so far as young people are concerned. According to the National Manpower Service many of those are not even registered.  Therefore, the agencies we have are not helping these young people. Employers in such areas should be notified <Col N="935" /> of the assistance and of the schemes being provided by the agency.</P>
    <P>I do not find any reference to the handicapped in the Articles of Association in this legislation.  Perhaps it was not found necessary to make specific reference to these people.  This Government are continuing the policy of the previous Government whereby a minimum of 3 per cent of all public sector employees are to be drawn from the ranks of the handicapped or of the semi-disabled.  I urge that in the projects undertaken by the agency this figure be at least 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is no reference in the legislation either to equality though I expect that it is assumed there will be equality.  I make this point because the AnCO courses have been beneficial particularly to young men.  Many of these courses such as bricklaying, welding, mechanical engineering and so on are applicable mainly to young men.  The agency must be aware of the needs of young girls in the employment area expecially since there are more young girls than young boys in the country. There must not be this stereo-typing attitude in which girls are trained only for secretarial or clerical work.  Other courses must be available to them also.</P>
    <P>I am considerably disappointed with the composition of the board in so far as the National Youth Council are concerned. I have been in touch with that body during the past couple of years and I am aware of their commitment in this area.  They were the ones who in 1978 first mooted the idea of an employment agency in specific terms.  They have furnished the Department with considerable memoranda on the subject and they have had consultations with the officials of the Department of Labour and of other relevant Departments as well as with the Minister directly.  In these circumstances I am very disappointed to note that only two of the 11 members are to be drawn from that council.  Unless the Minister appoints more young people to the agency specific problems will arise.  At a time of recession there are always sectional interests whether on the part of employers or of trade unions.  If the textile industry, for example, is experiencing <Col N="936" /> a rough time representations will be made to the ICTU and to the FUE to safeguard the interests of that industry. That is why I ask that young people be given greater representation on the new agency.  They will not have any sectional interests.  A one-third representation would be fair and reasonable for them.  It would be a recognition of the voluntary work they undertake and of the role they have to play in this agency.  In keeping with their commitment the Government are to set up a youth committee made up of members of the Dáil which will be the first of its kind in that not only will it comprise Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas but also members from bodies such as Macra and so on.  I would like the committee to have a very close relationship with the agency and be directly related to youth affairs and youth problems so that there would be a close liaison between the two and recommendations could go backwards and forwards providing the House with an opportunity to examine these recommendations objectively and constructively.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the financial structure, I welcome what the Minister has done. He has not acted in a bureaucratic way. He has used the procedures already there, the PRSI and the health contributions, as the method of collection.  This will be effective since collection will be immediate.  It will also have the advantage of not entailing the recruitment of more staff to collect the moneys required. I believe the budget of AnCO and the National Manpower Service will not be undermined in any way because the agency will have money.  I know the Minister has decided against setting up a youth employment fund and I would have no objection to this decision if I knew for certain that the budget under the Department of Labour to the National Manpower Service and AnCO will remain unaffected.  I accept his dilemma from the point of view of speed and urgency and later on, when the agency is established and the financial structures are there, I hope the Government will consider setting up a youth employment fund so that there will be a guarantee of a <Col N="937" /> specific 1 per cent to be spent in a specific way.</P>
    <P>There will be no widespread condemnation of this tax measure.  I certainly have not heard any criticisms of it in my constituency.  Taxpayers realise that it is their sons and daughters and brothers and sisters who will be the direct beneficiaries under this scheme.  With the consensus for wage restraint in order to maintain and increase employment it is imperative that we do this in this way to ensure that those already in employment will have jobs and those who have no jobs will ultimately get them.</P>
    <P>On the expenditure side I would like a set allowance.  Whether it is a training course in AnCO, a work experience course with the National Manpower Service, a job under a specific project laid down by the agency, I would like to see a fixed allowance under which those involved would get the same rate of benefit, not a meagre rate as is the case with certain benefits at the moment.  Young people with AnCO do not make PRSI contributions. They get no entitlement whatsoever. I would hope there would be some system of stamp contribution for every week they are with the agency.</P>
    <P>The real importance of this Bill and of the agency lies in its financial independence. A minimum of £63 million will be allocated.  This sum will be topped off by the EMS.  Here we are doing more than any other member state per thousand <i>capita</i> and that shows the Government's commitment and the kind of resources we are prepared to invest in solving this problem of youth unemployment.  I understand £10 million is to be allocated for 1982.  That will not be enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear that. The Bill accepts the importance of the first job.  That is of particular significance. I would like to see a broad, positive, courageous and clear approach and the money spent directly to aid the young <Col N="938" /> unemployed.  If the so-called guarantee system is achieved, that will be a major achievement indeed.  If a school leaver fails to find employment in a six-month or a 12-month period there should be four options open to that school leaver. There should be a minimum six months AnCO training course or a work experience course, namely, placement with employers.  There should be special projects set up with the servicing agencies in each community, be it farm apprenticeship or inner city development.  If all these fail there should be a consensus on some form of capital aid through which these young unemployed could be directly assisted.</P>
      <P>The most important point is that the policy of the board must be to define the difference between employment retention as a top priority and a purely training role.  If the agency is to have the impact we would like it to have, not only must it co-ordinate all the different schemes, evaluate and improve them, but it must also ensure that all those involved have a set target of 45 per cent each year on the registration system with the prospect of retainable employment for at least a year after that.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister on his speed in introducing the Bill and I wish the board every success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>While we all welcome any measure designed to deal with what must be regarded as a crisis situation in employment, I am sure the Minister will not think ill of me if I have some small reservations about some aspects of this Bill.  We are all agreed that unemployment is the single greatest problem we have.  If this proposed agency is to be just a continuation of what we have had over the past few years I do not see any great progress being made in solving the problem of youth unemployment.  One would be inclined to think from the attitude of the Government that Ireland's youth constitute something of an embarrassment because they have to do something to try to relieve the unemployment situation. We, on this side of the House, regard our youth as our greatest resource and we take pride in the fact that we have <Col N="939" /> such a strong, virile, well-educated youth.  It was always our intention to provide our youth with whatever was necessary to give them a worthwhile living and a stake in this country.</P>
      <P>The Government appear to be working on two fronts.  While the Minister for Labour may have the best of intentions in dealing with this matter, it appears his Cabinet colleagues, particularly the Minister for Finance, do not think in the same fashion.  I refer particularly to the recent examples from the Department of Finance of cutbacks in the public expenditure programme, cutbacks as far as the decentralisation programme is concerned, the recruitment to the public service and a range of other cutbacks.  It is now becoming obvious to health boards and local authorities that the Government are intent on cutting back in those areas.  The Government are saying there have to be severe cutbacks to accommodate pressures on the economic front and at the same time the Minister for Labour is talking about finding money from the new type of income tax to provide job opportunities.  The Government should get together and decide there will be a joint effort in dealing with all our problems.</P>
      <P>It will be a very small service if the Minister's speech is another plethora of pious hopes and would-be aspirations for the future of our youth.  That will be no more than a continuation of the lip service which has been given to youth.  It is a popular thing now to talk about youth and what has to be done for them, but very little has been done.  The young people are quite happy with the lip service if it is transferred into some kind of positive action.  This agency is no more than replacing the existing one which is already serving in this area.  It is quite obvious from the Minister's opening speech on this Bill that no positive information has been given to our youth in regard to what areas of activity the Minister will become engaged in to relieve their problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 25 November, as reported in volume 331, column 218 of the Official Report, he outlines from (a) to (i) the <Col N="940" /> suggestions he will be putting to this new agency.  This is just a nice collection of generalities and is the kind of fine, bureaucratic terminology one expects from Departments of State but, in effect, it does not mean anything and is only put there to confuse those who are not confused. It is asking too much of our youth to expect them to express confidence in that kind of agency.  I am afraid they will be sceptical of anything this agency might do on their behalf.  There is no statement anywhere of anything positive the agency hope to achieve.</P>
    <P>It is well known that paper never refuses the ink.  We certainly get a considerable amount of this in these generalities and bureaucratic statements.  I do not believe this problem warrants more of that type of treatment.  It has such serious consequences for the country that, if the Minister's statement had only been half as long and if he had isolated a few particular areas in which he wanted to see action, he would have got more kudos than he will from this speech.</P>
    <P>The sentiments expressed in the Minister's speech must be taken as somewhat at variance with the statements made by his Cabinet colleagues.  It is very difficult for the people to reconcile the two attitudes: cutbacks and non-recruitment in one area and then talk about collecting money from the last of the workers to provide jobs for the others.  It is about time the Cabinet did something positive in that regard rather than have the ultra-conservative Fine Gael in the Government carrying out their monetaristic policy of cutbacks and regression and the other side of the Cabinet, the pseudo socialists, doing their best to bring forward socialistic policies, and the nameless party in the Government, who have been going along with the greatest anti-socialist bout of legislation ever introduced in the Dáil.  Consequently, everybody is confused, especially our young people, who deserve more than that.  I am not saying this in any critical way of the Minister, because I am sure he would like to do what is best in dealing with this problem.  Perhaps the Minister would concentrate on his other Cabinet colleagues, particularly the Minister for <Col N="941" /> Finance, and ensure that he gets a freer hand in dealing across the board with all matters concerning unemployment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Government's attitude on decentralisation and contraction in recruitment to the public service, for a number of years there has been a concentration of opportunity in the east coast to the detriment of the people along the west coast.  While we do not expect to get any particular favours from the Minister or his colleagues in that regard because they have no electoral support down there, at the same time they will have to understand that a large proportion of the land of the country is west of the Shannon. Even though the west has not the largest population, it is well to bear in mind that it has a certain amount of political clout and is prepared to use it.  This might become very evident in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>We have had the movement of many of our young people from the west to the centres of population.  It was natural to expect this as all the job opportunities over the last few years have existed in the East.  There has been a haemorrhage of the best of our people.  It has denuded the west of its talents.  We feel aggrieved about that.  While there was some redress of that in the last few years under the previous Administration, this seems to have been reversed now because there appears to be a complete draw back from all development west of the Shannon. This does not seem to be in one or two isolated cases but in many areas of which everybody is aware.  It brings home to the young people that there is no future in the west for them.  Fianna Fáil had channelled some extra infrastructural development into the west over the last few years, but this has been taken back piece by piece and, if there is any truth in the rumours we hear, there will be further instances of that in the near future.  That is not the way to generate any kind of hope in the young people of the west in the new agency, which is now being put forward as the saviour of the situation</P>
    <P>Our young people in rural areas have been taking their opportunities where they can, in the cities.  This denies the rights of young people and creates a <Col N="942" /> social imbalance.  These matters are very often slid over because we are only dealing with a small section of the community, but social imbalance has very far-reaching effects on opportunities.  The result is that we now have a population imbalance, which must be redressed if we are to get an even development in the west.  When the Minister is giving detailed instructions to the agency he should ask them to remember that those areas in which there is a social and population imbalance deserve greater attention than seems to be forthcoming from the Minister's Department at the moment.</P>
    <P>A report from the NESC said that between 1961 and 1971 there was an increased concentration of white-collar jobs in the east coast.  In 1971 some 49 per cent of the white collar jobs in the country were located in the east as was 59 per cent of office employment.  That left very little by way of job opportunities that we would have liked to see in other parts of the country, particularly in the west.  There was one specific effort made to help in this area when Fianna Fáil were in government in the 1960's which was reaffirmed in 1972 and 1977 but which was killed in 1981.  That was the decentralisation programme.</P>
    <P>It is no use talking about economic yardsticks.  Other matters must be considered also.  The programme had a lot going for it and it is unfortunate that the Minister now finds himself unable to commit his Government to its continuation.  Not only did it improve the social imbalance and the population structure in the west but it also brought about the one point that was the kernel of Fianna Fáil thinking even in the late 1960s.  It was not so much a question of decentralisation of buildings as decentralisation of decision-making. That is what it was all about in the 1960s and what it is still about, to let decision-making filter through the tiers and strata of the various Departments to enable the ordinary citizens to identify with the Government Departments for which they are paying and from which they expect fair treatment.  That is being lost because of the return to centralised government to which the present administration <Col N="943" /> are committed.  What the Government are proposing is a retrograde step.  It is no use trotting out economics in support of the cutback so far as that programme is concerned.  That will not wash with the people in the rest of the country.  People in rural Ireland who want to identify with the Government Department with which they are dealing will not be able to do that if there is a continuation of the policy that was outlined recently by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of youth unemployment.  We are facing very serious economic and social challenges: that is the usual kind of statement one expects to hear in this House.  The era of rapid economic growth so far as the economy is concerned has ceased.  I hope it will return but we must recognise the present reality, namely, the cessation of economic growth in the OECD countries. When we consider what brought about this situation we will see we did not have that great input into it.  The 1973-74 oil crisis started us on a fierce merry-go-round that brought so much hardship to many countries, including Ireland.  There was a shift in the balance of the world powers and we suffered in the middle. There were high rates of inflation in the OECD countries and there were high external deficits.  Added to that there was the never-ending extension of the dole queues and, consequently, we have now reached a situation where growth has ceased in our economy, as it has in others.</P>
    <P>We must provide an effective response to unemployment and that must be made the key priority issue.  It must be the first economic aim of any Government.  That was clearly stated by Fianna Fáil and we were doing something about it.  It involved certain borrowing abroad but it was done to keep jobs in existence, to provide a proper balance in the development of the country and to provide a proper infrastructure so that we could maintain our place when the turn around came eventually.  All of that is being put at risk.  A new approach is being adopted now but the result is higher inflation, more unemployment and, the worst of all, a cutback in living standards.  There <Col N="944" /> is a no-hope atmosphere in the area the Minister would like to deal with by way of this agency, namely, youth unemployment.</P>
    <P>This economic crisis was further exacerbated by a rapid growth in our workforce. There are those who consider that a failure, but I regard it as our greatest resource and this will be proved to be the case in the years to come.  This growth in our population is a welcome departure from the situation that existed for many years, but while the population was growing our economy was contracting.  There was also a growing demand for paid employment among women.  This was a phenomenon to us in the past few years and it further aggravated the situation. We also had the coming on stream of micro-technology.  This changed industry and is continuing to change it at a faster rate than the workforce can adjust to that change.  It is putting enormous pressures on the workforce.  In the EEC in 1973 there were about three million people unemployed whereas in 1981 the figure is in excess of nine million.  This shows that we are not the only ones caught in this dilemma but we are the only people who have not taken a direct stand to do something about it.  I am not as convinced as others that this agency is the complete answer to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>The worst hit in the population and in the changing circumstances that exist on the population front and in the area of technology are people under 25 years.  In this country that group comprise the vast majority of the population.  Even though they are not working they are willing to work.  They have been educated and trained to work and in the long term they will be our greatest resource.  We must utilise every facility at our disposal to ensure that we do everything necessary to deal with this matter.  If this agency does that I shall be the first to congratulate the Minister.  However, there are shortcomings so far as the agency is concerned and I will deal with them now.</P>
    <P>Unemployment will not just go away. It is a battle on our hands and if we do not win that battle it will become a war. While I do not want to make prognostications about what might or might not <Col N="945" /> happen if we do not adopt a certain course, it is my view that we will have a battle on our hands so far as unemployment is concerned and it is up to the Minister, for whatever time he is in office, to do what he can.  I believe we must share the burdens of the economic crisis and those who are lucky enough to have secure employment must play their part.  We must have a better social welfare system for those people who cannot get suitable employment in the short term and that means making a much better effort so far as increases in social welfare are concerned.</P>
    <P>We could reorganise working times because it is my view that not enough has been done in this area.  Even though it is not always popular to say it, I put it to the Minister that perhaps the time has come for us to do something about limiting overtime and about flexible retirement. All of this has been said before but nothing positive has been done.  I would have congratulated the Minister if he had included such matters in his address, even though they may not be popular and even though he may have to fight some sectional interests in doing so.  It was not done.  Denmark brought in early retirement in 1979 and reduced unemployment by 30 per cent in that year.  About 75 per cent of the jobs created by that were taken up by young people.  There is a positive area that should be listed.  If it was found that it applied to our situation and achieved half that result, it would be worth considering as one of the terms of reference of the agency.</P>
    <P>There are areas of economic potential that could have been mentioned by the Minister.  Lip service has been paid to small industries and small firms.  As far as the USA is concerned, over the last ten years two-thirds of all jobs created were in the small industries sector.  If that is the situation in the most advanced technological State, I do not see why we cannot apply the lessons to our situation. Much has been spoken about giving this area special treatment but it is not enough to pay lip service to it.  Small industries are usually more labour-intensive and communication is always better between management and the workforce.  There <Col N="946" /> is less friction and less man-days are lost. The Minister should bring to the attention of the Taoiseach the fact that if there is one State car left, this side of the House would not think too dimly of him if he appointed a Minister of State responsible for small industries.  If that was done it would generate more activity in an area which has served other economies so well over the last ten years.</P>
    <P>Another area is education.  As far as that is concerned, we must match employment skills to new employment opportunities.  This has not been done by the Department of Education.  We must have worker mobility.  We do not think enough about this.  At present young people are the most mobile youth the world has ever seen.  They are willing to move around and we should utilise that and put it to good use as far as the location of workers and young people is concerned. To engage in worker mobility we must consider changing labour law and trade union practice.  Surely there is no better qualified person than &mdash; I shall not say pseudo-socialist &mdash; a Labour Minister for Labour in a Coalition to introduce measures here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Government lost all credibility, sad as I am to say so, when they spoke about 9 per cent.  The wise men were met on the way home and told by the Taoiseach to bring in 6½ per cent. It then had to develop to 12 per cent and I suppose the Government will settle for anything in the end.</P>

      <P>They have butchered the west and put the hand of death on it.  The clawback is on there because they have no electoral support in it.  There is no problem in killing us off down there but we will deal with that before too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Labour law and trade union practice will have to be altered and the Minister should study this area.  The Minister's speech is notable for one thing only and that is that it suggests nothing.  It is a nice Departmental bureaucratic statement which signifies nothing.  It refers in the mildest way to job creation and training. We have a situation where people on unemployment assistance have been asked to sell their dignity.  The youth are <Col N="948" /> not prepared to do this for a small handout from any Government.  They will look with scepticism at the input of this agency.  It is a revamping of three or four other agencies which did not have much success but which, if they had been given extra by way of further finance, might have delivered the goods.  The Government should not try to confuse people by giving fancy names to old dogs.</P>
    <P>New methods are needed to deal with unemployment.  One of the areas which the Minister did not refer to and to which he should pay more attention is apprenticeships. Training, apprenticeships and giving special allowances to apprentices and employers would generate new job outlets.  If people were trained it would not matter if they had to leave the country, because their training would take them anywhere in the world.  Why has he not mentioned this tax rebate to firms providing that training?  There was no talk at all about incentives.  There was a load of talk about a new agency and who is going to be on it and what they will have to do.  They will be diametrically opposed to the other agencies who will be fighting to hold their place in the queue, but in the end, of course, the intention is that they will be swallowed up.  This agency is nothing but an umbrella under which all the other agencies will be taken and eventually phased out.</P>
    <P>I put a suggestion to the Minister &mdash; I do not know if it is new &mdash; it could have been referred to by him as a means of dealing with a certain section of the unemployment queue &mdash; that a national public works scheme be implemented. This would be of enormous benefit in the big conurbations, the urban areas and rural Ireland.  I suggest also training courses which would deal with the whole spectrum of apprenticeships and with an enormous range of jobs that are obviously so necessary to everybody and which run from the industrial side to the environmental side, the tourist side and so on.  We could give job opportunities particularly to unskilled people and thus, for half the money that this agency are going to collect by way of levy, eliminate all the unskilled people from the live <Col N="949" /> register.  We had national public works schemes a long time ago, during the famine, for instance, and some of them turned out to be very useful subsequently. Why would we not undertake such schemes now?  For instance, consider the great volume of renovation which could be carried out on existing council houses.  This could be undertaken if first the proper people were trained to direct and supervise.  We could undertake a cleaning-up operation.  We have public decor, public buildings.  Also we might channel a lot of this work into building up the infrastructure in certain parts of the country which have been denied the proper finance over a lifetime.  Perhaps £1 million spent on local improvement schemes would produce a great deal of good and I guarantee that it would be welcomed with open arms by everybody. People would not mind paying a levy if they were to see that money channelled into taking people off the dole queues. Traditionally small farmers used to get a month or two months' work of this kind in a year and this was a great support to their farming.</P>
    <P>I suggest that a national public works scheme could be undertaken in co-operation with local authorities and health boards and it would bring an enormous advantage.  It would kill at least 25 per cent of the live register.  With the addition of the flexi-retirement scheme which I mentioned, which has been successful in other European countries, we could eliminate virtually half the live register for half the money the Minister is talking about collecting for setting up a new bureaucratic system.  A fresh administration is going to act as an adviser to all the other organisations which have been dealing with this matter without much success because of lack of Government interest over the years.</P>
    <P>I refer to the possibility of the Taoiseach giving out his last State car.  I am not going to denigrate the Taoiseach for his attitude in this matter despite the fact that when the State cars were given out a few years ago when the 15 Ministers of State were created, we had to listen to the ballyragging and ballyhoo from the Opposition at that time.  They said then <Col N="950" /> that there was no need for them.  The need has been found now in order to accommodate the people who had to be bought off on the Government side.  One last car is left and perhaps the Taoiseach should create a Minister of State for small industry.  There is a grave need for such a post which would pay for itself because this phenonemon of small industries has paid off well in all the other developed economies in the western world.  We should apply the principle vigorously here, much more vigorously than the county development teams who have been strangling themselves struggling against insurmountable odds.  Also it would give a new fillip to the IDA who then would have a certain area of operation with a certain man responsible for the development of that resource.</P>
    <P>Small industries are labour-intensive and we should tell the banks that they should be more ready to lend risk capital to them.  The banking organisations have been reluctant to deal with the small, isolated person.  He does not seem to have the Government's support.  The county development secretaries have supported him as did the county councils, and the IDA set up a new structure a few years ago in support of him.  His biggest difficulty was in attracting foreign investment in the big operators and the multinationals. The banks should be requested perhaps no more than that &mdash; to look more favourably on lending that risk capital to these small operators.  It could even be State guaranteed.  Why not?  We guarantee many other things, and if that guarantee was given the banks might further relax their purse strings.  Why would we not create more favourable interest rates on this capital available to the small man? That would be a positive step in attracting the new entrepreneurs about whom we are talking so glibly every day while we do nothing further about it.</P>
    <P>Why would we not have an easier taxation system for small industries in general? Why not set up an agency under that Minister of State when appointed to give the kind of advice that is needed by the small operator who has the skill &mdash; for that is all he has?  He has the technological skill, <Col N="951" /> he has the skill in his hands, but he has no skill as far as accountancy is concerned and his operation would not warrant recruiting an accountant.  He has no skill regarding tax or in marketing, but he can produce in co-operation with his brothers and perhaps two or three operators.  Why do we not have a decent way of advising such people?  It will be said to me now that such advice is there.  The kind of advice available is a sheaf of documentation in typical bureaucratic terminology that would frighten off even some of the managing directors from the larger companies. We should not try to frighten off those small operators who, if they got the right kind of tax advice and incentive, would gladly set up in operation.  Let us not cloud the issue by making it more difficult for them to market the product of their operation and to deal with the taxmen.  The small industrialist is not interested in spending two days with his accountant and another two days chewing the rag with the local tax inspector. He is interested in being on the shop floor.  The job losses in the larger industries are much greater than in the small industries.  Small industries are much better able to weather the economic storms and recessions and are much less dependent on the fuel situation and energy resources than are the larger concerns, and consequently they can survive.  We have been giving them too much lip service.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister not say that in support of youth employment he would ask the Minister for Industry and Energy to set up a special operation with a new, fresh Minister of State heading it to deal with some small firms and small industries? Why would we not help co-operative marketing amongst small businesses? Nothing was ever attempted on that.  We have co-operatives in other areas.  Small business could pool their resources and talents and in conjunction with one another they could buy computers, technology and expert advice and divide the expenses over a large number of operators.</P>
    <P>With a view to improving the job situation for young people, the Government <Col N="952" /> could encourage the semi-State bodies and organisations, financial, economic and industrial, under State control to buy in from a host of small sub-contractors, instead of retaining the present situation where the big boys operate with each other.  Many downstream one- and two-man operations could be encouraged if the semi-State organisations got instructions from the relevant Department of State that this was expected of them. There are job opportunities going abegging but there is no concrete suggestion in the Minister's speech as to how this could be done except that he was going to ask them to review the whole situation of agencies already operating.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about education, school leavers and aids for job creation.  Many of the suggestions were worthwhile as far as employment programmes are concerned.  The training in our educational institutions is a fundamental and vital area of the whole question of youth employment.  We will have to have more practical courses.  We have been preaching about this over a long period, but the Department of Education have not yet got the message, and there is no suggestion in the agency formula that they are going to get any fresh ideas about what is necessary to educate our youth to take their place in the new technological era.  Youth unemployment is going to remain at unacceptably high levels for the foreseeable future.  It should not be thought from the deliberations here that this new agency is going to remove youth unemployment.  It would be misleading and mischievous to suggest that we had a panacea for all our ills.  We will have to stop unemployment rising any further and, hopefully, retain it at its existing level and then try to reduce it.</P>
    <P>What about matching up the types of jobs offered to young people today?  A contrast has arisen between the development of our educational system and the higher levels of education and the stagnation in respect of working conditions and responsibilities.  That means we must re-establish the type of growth that is more favourable to employing young people.  We have never seriously attempted to do that.  We have to adapt <Col N="953" /> our education and training to the needs of modern society.  We have only paid lip service to that as far as education is concerned. We must also improve working conditions and increase motivation in the work place.  No effort has been made by the Government to do that.  In fact, one would think they were hell bent on creating division and frustration in the work place.  What positive steps have been taken by the Department of Education to develop a proper career guidance service? None.  There are people appointed, drawing salaries, who have instructions in this regard in many educational institutions. But in rural areas there is no integrated programme of career guidance suitably adapted to our situation.  The Minister must recognise that.</P>
    <P>Until such time as young people are motivated in the right direction and given good advice early on from qualified personnel, fully acquainted with job opportunities, and the requirements of this technological era, until such time as we have the backup of an educational system geared to technological training, the Minister's agency is wasting its time.  It will be the square peg in the round hole for a few months and nothing at the end of it.  If you provide a job at a certain cost for a young person for a few months and suddenly tell him it is to be discontinued, you are doing a disservice to him, to the country and causing further frustration.</P>
    <P>The question of youth employment must be seen as a cycle.  There is not enough guidance for this technological age in which education has been changing over the past couple of years.  I am not denigrating the people who are working in this area.  Obviously, they are operating under severe constraints, but it is an area that needs looking at.  We also need training for young people so that they will get satisfaction from the job opportunities provided, not just any old job for a few short months to provide pocket money in the hope that something better will turn up later on.  Young people are asking us not to sell them short.</P>
    <P>They want to be provided with worth-while training and opportunities so that they are equipped for good jobs.  The first thing a 1981 employer asks a prospective <Col N="954" /> job seeker is about his training and experience.  The answer in the vast majority of the output from our academically geared institutions is &ldquo;None, sir&rdquo;. There is money going abegging in the European Social Fund.  I hope the Minister will tap that source and add it on to some of the money he is going to squeeze out of the hard-pressed taxpayer by way of this levy to make available essential training.  If the training went on for two years and it cost £200 million or £500 million it would be an investment for the future and it could have been done without the agency.  The framework was already there, but the initiative was not taken.  I hope the change of name will provide a change of heart and result in our doing something about it.  We have guidance training and a placement service doing its best with limited resources. They have plenty of people to place and nowhere to put them.  If all your attention, effort, money and resources are directed in one area without considering others in the cycle, then you are defeating the cause and you will only have a temporary improvement that will fall back when the money plug is pulled out.</P>
    <P>Premiums to encourage managers to increase their staff have not been referred to in the Minister's speech.  It costs money but it encourages and provides incentives to management to increase their staffs. They are quite prepared to do this if they can see a long term result.  It is regrettable that the public service sector has been cut back.  It throws the whole question of employment out of balance and suggests to the educational institutions to shift the emphasis from one area of activity to the other.  There is a stop-go situation as far as the public sector is concerned, and public sector employment has a bigger bearing on the socially and economically deprived areas than perhaps is readily seen in the city.  We must remember that. We do not want this agency to be seen as completely city-orientated.  The major outlet for the educational institutions in the west, which are academically geared, has been in the public sector programme and the Minister is now taking it away. The people are angry about this.  There is no use saying that when things improve <Col N="955" /> he will allow the stop gap to be removed and let employment flow freely.  That is not good enough.  There should be a nice, even flow into the public programme. The public sector programme, properly utilised, can generate other jobs downstream in the public sector.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this.</P>
    <P>Some action must be taken to make the best possible use of the EEC Social Fund as an extension of our financial assistance in this area.  A tentative figure, about £40 million, might be available from this source.  There is a great deal of goodwill in EEC countries towards providing extra financial assistance for job creation for young people.  All the other countries have experienced the same difficulties in youth unemployment situations and are conscious of the need to make further moneys available in this area.  Enormous strides in dealing with youth unemployment have been made in Belgium and Germany.  In Germany this was done by the use of better apprenticeship schemes.  We should be learning from the systems that worked in EEC countries.  I see nothing wrong with sending our specialists to study the methods that have been adopted and used to great effect by other countries.  Until we get closer to considering out future educational system on lines similar to the German apprenticeship system, where apprenticeship is welcomed and its proper status respected, we will not be going in the right direction.  The Minister should apply himself to that area.</P>
    <P>Every country should be in a position to offer one or two things to every young person: either the possibility of working or an opportunity to undertake training. We are not doing that, and that is the kernel of the problem.  If we cannot offer our youth work, we have to give them the opportunity to do a training course with something positive at the end &mdash; not just a job for the sake of a job to keep them off the streets for six months.  We need more than that.  I would be happier to see people with the proper educational background getting the opportunity to train for a much longer period so that by the time the training course was over <Col N="956" /> some of our technologically advanced industries would give them employment. This recession is not going to last forever and we are not making any great strides to benefit from the turn around when it comes.</P>
    <P>I said the national public works programme would reduce the numbers on the live register by at least 25 per cent.  If you were to utilise some of the money you are going to get&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should convey to the powers that be that the national works programme has many advantages: it reduces the number of the unemployed on the live register by 25 per cent and provides us with the means of carrying out a range of activities on the environmental, tourist and educational fronts. That programme could gladly be undertaken by local authorities in conjunction with the Department of Labour.  It is ridiculous to suggest that nothing can be done, as was suggested by the Minister's leader.  It was not helpful when he announced that the recession would be a continuing phenomenon and that nothing could be done.  If there is a will, there is a way.  I believe the young people have the will, and that they will put their backs to the wheel if they are given some kind of leadership.  However, they are not getting it.  Hopefully, this agency will provide the means by which a new direction will be given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like to throw cold water on any effort undertaken to reduce our youth unemployment crisis, because any such effort is worthy of the greatest assistance, but I am concerned that there might be some duplication as between the new agency and existing agencies.  The Minister should be prepared to state categorically <Col N="957" /> that it is not intended in the immediate future, or in the medium future, to nullify the operations of agencies operating at present, because that could cause a considerable amount of confusion in those agencies which have been doing great work in the area of employment over the last few years.</P>
    <P>There is not much point saying that these directions will be given to the agency.  I do not care whom the Minister appoints to the agency so long as the job is done.  He should pick the best he can, but there is a glaring omission here which the Minister can rectify by way of his own nominees.  I do not wish to keep harping on this, but it is obvious that people have forgotten the west.  The Minister should have a prominent person from the west nominated to that agency so that he can bring to their attention the plight of the people in the west.  Since agriculture plays a dominant role in this country, there is need for an input from somebody well-versed in agricultural matters.</P>
    <P>In the small farming area the meaning of the reference to accepted farmers is not readily understood.  I presume the Minister had something specific in mind and it would be appreciated if he would give a categoric assurance that those under a valuation of £40 will not be expected to pay this levy because they are not normally in the tax bracket and the vast majority of them are in receipt of unemployment assistance.  I take it that those in receipt of unemployment assistance or holders of medical cards will not have to pay this levy.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not make it explicit in his Second Stage speech what he meant by accepted farmers paying this levy.  He should remove the confusion that exists. I hope that the points raised by this side of the House have impressed the Minister. The Minister's Second Stage speech did not specify anything and offered only the hope that the agency would do a good job in creating new initiatives.  It would have been a lot more helpful if the Minister had specified details of the scheme. I hope the Minister will deal with the suggestion of a national public works scheme which is long overdue.  He is getting a glorious opportunity to introduce <Col N="958" /> such a scheme now because he has the money and the freedom to do it.  It would give a great fillip to the west and do a lot of good throughout the country.  I welcome the Bill.  I do not believe any Bill was ever introduced here that could deliver 100 per cent on what it proposed but this legislation is a step in the right direction.  I hope it will be followed up by real action.  If it is we will be happy that we went along with its provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. Ahern Mr. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The length of the debate on this Bill is an indication of the extent of the problem of unemployment among our young people.  The debate has covered all aspects relating to youth unemployment and I welcome that.  I will not attack the Bill but make what I consider to be constructive points which have been made by organisations I have been associated with over the years.  A youth employment agency was mooted three or four years ago by a number of groups.  It was pursued with the last Government and was picked up by all political parties in the last election campaign.  I should like to put on record the main points that were debated at that time in the various youth forums and at meetings that took place prior to the election.  Fine Gael stated that they would establish a youth employment agency to integrate youth employment schemes.  That party also said that they would prepare a register of the unemployed for information on job prospects.  The Labour Party had a lot of details worked out about this problem and undertook to provide a range of continuing education facilities to help young people enrich their educational experience.  The party also stated that there was a need for youth facilities, especially in the cultural, recreational, sporting and self-development areas and promised to introduce a national programme. They also stated that they were concerned to guarantee young workers uniform and appropriate conditions at work with proper conditions for all apprenticeships, block and day release facilities, standard work conditions and full integration into the work force in relation to representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill goes along that line and it <Col N="959" /> would be unfair to be critical of it.  It is welcome in the overall sense because it does something constructive about a problem that was with the last Government, is with this Government and, probably, will be with the next.  It would be unwise to be destructive about the Bill and I only wish to comment on the details of it.  The Minister has not said anything about the objectives of the agency, its working methods or its relationship to existing institutions such as Manpower, AnCO or the other agencies or schemes that are in operation.  There is data available about this.  When I worked with the National Youth Council that data was available in the Department and I hope it will be reviewed in connection with the establishment of this agency.</P>
    <P>There is an absolute need that the agency have power.  One of our main problems at present is that there is a lack of co-ordination between the various bodies and that has tended to undermine a successful attack on youth unemployment. All the bodies concerned with youth unemployment are powerful in their own right with their own strong views and management and their own institutions which they are anxious to protect.  It is hard to find any common ground between them.  They all seem to give different sets of statistics.  That is one of the great arguments for the establishment of one powerful agency.  I presume those other bodies will not operate any more and that the Minister will ensure that there will be effective co-ordination between the schools, the agencies, placement services and Government Departments. I hope the existing institutions are broken up so as to ensure that there is just one body.  That has always been my view.  The most recent report on the problem was carried out by the Manpower Consultative Committee about two years ago.  That committee investigated youth unemployment and the difficulties encountered by young people.  At that time I was involved in youth organisations and I can recall that the committee met fairly frequently over a period of six months but took a long time to issue their report.  They took the internationally <Col N="960" /> accepted youth ages of 15 to 24 but could not come up with any statistics.  Some believe that there are between 40,000 and 50,000 people in that age group unemployed but I do not believe anybody has the true figure.  I presume one of the first jobs of the agency will be to examine the data sources on youth unemployment and investigate the extent of unemployment in the various age groups so that they can identify the problems they will have to face.  The position at the moment is that despite there being a number of State agencies none of them have anything like what are considered to be the correct statistics.  Some time ago the manpower consultative body reached the conclusion that the sources of the statistics are insufficient in terms of coverage and frequency and that the service should be improved.  That seems a rather odd statement from a body who sat for a long time before producing a long report.  On another occasion they said that the unemployment level so far as young people were concerned was unacceptably high. Is it not surprising that a major group would have only a statement in such general terms to make, a statement that would not be of much use to the Minister or to anybody else who had to deal with the problem?  The first task of this agency should be to help as much as possible the various people and bodies dealing with this problem of employment for young people.  Something should be done, too, in the area of the inter-departmental group on unemployment statistics.  The committee to which I have referred concluded also that information on first-time jobs or on first-time registrations with the Manpower Service should be improved since information in this area is not readily available.  The group go on to say that the absence of such information can only prevent accurate estimates being made of the level of youth unemployment.  This is a point that the new agency must bear in mind but when we reach the Committee Stage of the Bill all these various details can be teased out.</P>
    <P>I have had many meetings at which the question of youth employment was discussed. This is an area that always leads to heated discussion but we must bear in <Col N="961" /> mind that this question is not a separate element.  It is caused by the lack of job opportunities.  There are now about 30,000 people each year entering the labour force from the various levels of education.  We must concentrate on improving career guidance facilities in order to help these young people. Regardless of what anyone may say, this problem of unemployment will be with us for a long time.  The number of people coming into the labour force is about twice the number who leave it by way of natural wastage &mdash; deaths and retirements. We can only conclude, therefore, that the employment situation will become much worse.  It is estimated that by 1995 our labour force will have doubled the 1975 level.  Such increase is not being experienced anywhere else in Europe.  This leaves us with a special problem and presents great difficulty for young people leaving education.  However, our job here is to do everything possible to improve the position.  If we cannot eliminate the problem we must make every effort to reduce it.  The points put forward by organisations such as the National Youth Council and the various other youth groups in the past years in relation to this type of agency should be noted carefully.</P>
    <P>There is a need for us to move away from the type of curriculum that we have been following at second level education. We must concentrate on a proper mix of the academic and the practical so that on leaving school young people will be in a better position to find employment.  It does not make sense to urge somebody to study Latin or French if he happens to be very good with his hands.  Perhaps the Minister would use his influence with the Minister for Education in an effort to change what has always tended to be a bureaucratic Department &mdash; the Department of Education.  If a student takes academic subjects in the leaving certificate he is more or less confined to jobs in the clerical field, whereas if there was a mix of the academic and the practical his chances of finding employment would be enhanced especially during a period of recession.</P>
    <P>Any programme embarked on by this <Col N="962" /> new agency must be geared towards long-term employment and not involved in simply putting people through a six-month course and then trying to pick up the pieces.  There must be a follow through into the various levels of the agency.  We have heard that the first step will be for the agency to establish themselves on a reliable day-to-day basis and to gather all the information that is available from schools, colleges and other agencies.  The next step will be to try to establish a good working relationship with the various schools.  Perhaps that is something that is being tackled now by the career guidance teachers.  The agency may have to become involved in pre-employment courses, in the preparation of courses and careers and in giving advice to the career guidance teachers. As I have said, there is a need, too, to consider the whole question of the curricula. The emphasis must be on providing courses that will best help people to obtain employment but first the agency must determine the skills that are needed most.  That should not prove too difficult.</P>
    <P>Industry is crying out in certain areas for qualified people.  Many of the career guidance courses I have attended were done by people willing to give their spare time to advising school leavers on what is needed in industry.  It is of paramount importance that courses should be designed to meet the needs of industry, but many of the courses run by AnCO and those under the aegis of the work experience schemes have really no relevance. However, the exercise has been useful in that if one does not try something one can never be properly informed.</P>
    <P>At the moment interviews can be very short and very snappy.  Only the other night I spoke to a chap who went for interview on an electronics course.  He struck me as a bright youth.  He was given a few sums to do and he was asked to write something to test his aptitude.  He had some experience of electricity and knew something about wiring.  After 40 minutes' wait those for interview were told that was it.  There was no talk about aptitude and no talk as to what this chap might do in some academic field.  That <Col N="963" /> was a course in an AnCO training centre. People in these organisations should appreciate that they are dealing with fellow human beings and not just numbers. They have an obligation to young people. They should help them along.  They should have an understanding of their problems.  The important thing is the link between the agency and the schools on one side and industry on the other.  If this structure is not properly worked out, the agency, like so many other State organisations, will turn out to be a misnomer.</P>
    <P>Local employment committees can be very important.  They should be constituted of representatives from Manpower, AnCO, the local authorities, the schools, the trade unions and youth organisations. They are the people who could examine the particular problems of the area and ensure employment prospects.  I represent the inner city area.  It has its own peculiar problems.  In the last few years Manpower, AnCO and the IDA have tried very hard to help the inner city area, but the projects have not worked too well.  Possibly the school leavers in the area are not geared to these projects.  In the next few days the Minister will be opening yet another centre in the inner city.  I hope he will devote himself to some of the problems that exist.  There is not much point in establishing some project without screening.  If screening is not done the whole scheme will collapse. Trouble-makers will jeopardise the project and that is why I say those employed must be closely screened.</P>
    <P>In Our Lady of Lourdes Parish there is a population of 7,000.  Of that 7,000 only 72 are employed.  That gives an indication of the severity of the problem. The statistic is almost unbelievable.  A town outside Dublin with a similar population would have at least 3,000 or 2,500 employed.  That shows the difficulties that exist in the inner city area.  These problems must be dealt with and they must be dealt with on a separate basis.  I look forward to hearing the Minister tell us about these special structures.  The local representative is naturally much better informed about the problems that exist.  The AnCO and Manpower <Col N="964" /> schemes do very little while they cost a great deal of money.</P>
    <P>The agency should have constructive preparation programmes with courses in schools aimed at developing work skills and improving vocational preparation. That could be of great benefit.  These courses could be availed of by pupils who have left school but have not found employment.  The course could be an intensive one in co-operation with local agencies, AnCO, Manpower, industry, the trade unions and so on.  They could be work experience programmes or projects based on community service.  The last Government instituted a number of these.  Unfortunately they have now almost disappeared.  The available work has diminished.  They were good schemes.  They provided employment for a limited number in areas where those employed saw the benefit of their work. These schemes worked very well even in areas where vandalism was rife.  Not only did they provide jobs but they improved the overall position from the point of view of reducing vandalism.  Vandalism was minimal.  There was one project &mdash; I mentioned it earlier &mdash; in Seán McDermott Street.  There was a youth employment scheme in regard to the local park. The landscaping was done by the youth and the amount of destruction subsequently was minimal.  These schemes helped to reduce the unemployment figures. I would urge the Minister to continue them.  They have a dual purpose in that they give people an interest in their own local area and at the same time some work experience.</P>
    <P>Not enough information is made available to young people on the various occupations there are and the locations where employment opportunities are likely to arise.  That is something that could be done very easily.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to recap on some of the points made by the Minister for Finance, who put up a very poor case.  There was nothing of substance in what he had to say in regard to why this programme should not be proceeded with. He mentioned the election and said it was important to take into account that there had been an election between the time the decisions were made and the scheme was set up by the previous Government, and consequently that imposed some kind of obligation on him and on the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware that at any time in any of the places where the new centres of employment were to be developed the <Col N="966" /> Fine Gael or Labour candidates in the general election said they would not go ahead with these schemes.  I know that the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry in my constituency did not at any time tell the people it would be part of the Government's policy to delay this scheme if Fine Gael were elected to Government. I am sure I can rely on the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry in Government to oppose what the Minister for Finance is doing in the long-fingering or scrapping of this scheme.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate what I said last night, that a great deal of detailed work had been done by Deputy Fitzgerald, then Minister, and Deputy Calleary, then Minister of State, and that the unions were informed of the Government's intentions.  We were quite satisfied that any teething troubles there might be, could be overcome, as they were in the case of the decentralisation of part of the Department of Education to Athlone and part of the Department of Lands to Castlebar.  The Minister for Finance was very harassed in his approach to the funding. I will not go into any detail.  My colleague, Deputy Barrett, will deal in more depth with the funding of our proposed scheme.  It was not envisaged that we would be borrowing abroad for this development.</P>
    <P>I reject vehemently the implication in what the Minister for Finance said, that somehow or other, if the services were located outside Dublin, those services would be inferior to the services provided in Dublin.  I do not think there is any substance whatsoever in this.  The Minister was very cautious about the infrastructural services necessary for setting up of the offices in the various centres.  I can tell the House that the areas mentioned for decentralisation are crying out for development.  If the scheme is proceeded with, the injection of real life and vigour into those areas will benefit the country as a whole.  It is in those areas we would be concentrating our development and not be afraid to say: &ldquo;If we give services there we cannot give them some place else&rdquo;.  That kind of specious pleading does not cut any ice in the House or in the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="967" /> The Minister for Finance mentioned the OPW and the supervisory role of that office.  Of course the OPW have a role in stating what the Government Departments to be decentralised would need. Surely the Minister for Finance was not saying that the private interests who were going to develop those centres would somehow or other squander their own resources.  There was a lack of logic in what the Minister for Finance said in this regard yesterday.  He promised a decision. It was very difficult to know what his intention would be.  He promised a decision very soon.  Now is the time for the Minister for Finance or for the Minister of State in his Department to announce positively that the well-thought out, well-structured scheme, to which a great deal of study and discussion had been devoted, will go ahead.  In essence, the Government are long-fingering if not scrapping the whole idea.  I indicated that all the homework had been thoroughly done by Deputy Fitzgerald, Deputy Calleary and by the outgoing Government.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation is regional development. The whole philosophy of decentralisation has been elaborated over the years.  I want to mention, in passing, the NESC Report No. 28, Service Type Employment and Regional Development, NESC Report No. 10, Comments on Report of Committee on Development Centres and Industrial Estates and Regional Studies in Ireland.  It is interesting for the House to note that the Buchanan Report mentioned Dundalk, Sligo, Athlone, Tralee, Letterkenny, Castlebar and it mentioned Cavan as a centre of development for the counties Cavan, Longford and Monaghan.  I am saying this to indicate that there has been plenty of discussion.  Now is the time for action.  It was precisely action that the Fianna Fáil Government were concentrating on because the time for talking had ended.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from <i>Administration,</i> volume 24, page 356, where Mr. Barrington stated:</P>
    <P>If ever a policy of decentralising jobs was to make any sense, it should be <Col N="968" /> related to office jobs.  The government itself as a major employer is a main sinner here.  The Irish system of government is extraordinarily centralised and concentrated in the capital city. We think of French government as being highly centralised; but only just over a quarter of French civil service jobs are in Paris itself.  In Dublin we have almost two-thirds.  Comparisons with other countries are likewise unfavourable.  One of the biggest things government could do for regional development is to have a real policy for decentralising office jobs &mdash; especially public service ones.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I have not time to elaborate. The discussion has gone on, the debate has gone on, the studies have gone on and we now want action.  We have had the briathar, briathar, briathar.  We want the beart, the beart, the beart.</P>

      <P>No decision on this issue of decentralisation, so called, has, as yet, been taken by the Government.  As my colleague, the Minister for Finance, indicated last night, the so-called programme is under review. Any responsible Government coming into office should give it a full review.  For example, the most striking thing I found in my examination of the file was the extraordinary coincidence whereby each area selected for decentralisation coincided with the fact that there was a Minister in each of the particular centres. That was quite extraordinary.</P>

      <P>One might ask why not Wexford for a decentralised area?  It happens that by an extraordinary coincidence of all the available towns, if one excludes the Dublin members of the Cabinet, excludes Deputy Power who is in the eastern region and excludes Deputy Fitzgerald who is in Cork, and one presumably does not decentralise from Dublin to Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would be grateful if I were allowed to make my contribution without interruption.  It was sensible of the Government to review this analytical <Col N="970" /> decentralisation programme of the previous Government.  Much has been made of the argument that there would be no net cost to the Exchequer.  I took a note of what Deputy O'Malley said last evening. He said &ldquo;buildings would have to be built anyway&rdquo; and he went on to say that the net cost to the Exchequer would be nil and that, in fact, the Exchequer would save £5 million, £10 million or £15 million.  He added that the provision of offices in the provinces would substitute for offices in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House this was not the intention of the previous Government. The press release on the decentralisation proposals on 22 October 1980 makes it plain that one of the consequences of the programme would be &ldquo;a significant contribution to the creation of jobs in the construction industry and in ancillary industries&rdquo;.   Fianna Fáil cannot have it both ways.  If Deputy O'Malley was correct yesterday evening that substitution rather than the construction of additional buildings was planned, then the press release issued on 22 October 1980 was misleading.</P>
      <P>The concept of a decentralisation programme should be put in a broad context. The 1981 population census gives a figure of 1,002,000 people in the greater Dublin area.  The previous Government announced they were introducing a programme of massive decentralisation, that they would send 3,100 civil servants out of Dublin.  Presumably 400 or 500 would be married and the rest would be single but the total dispersal to the whole of Ireland out of the Dublin population would not be more than 4,500 people. The net effect of moving 4,500 people out of a population of 1,002,000 would be .45 per cent.  The former Government called that a decentralisation programme but it was no more than a transfer system for a few Government Departments.  It was not a decentralisation programme by any stretch of the English language.  It was a blatant election gimmick by Fianna Fáil before the last general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems confronting the Government on inheriting the proposed decentralisation programme was the matter of finding finance in addition to the <Col N="971" /> normal programme needs of the Office of Public Works.  If private finances were available it would ease the problem but, as the Minister for Finance has said, the terms offered by private property developers were far from acceptable.  This is all on the files in the various Departments. Contrary to what Deputy O'Malley said, the offers by private developers per square footage of office space were precisely the same rates as applied in Dublin.  I see the former Minister shaking his head, It is said that a great deal of work was done in this area but I do not know where it was done. There is little evidence of it on file. Admittedly work was done in respect of sites, but as far as tenders from private developers and actual construction work are concerned there is scant evidence that much was done.  It has been suggested there are many philanthropic office developers in the provinces willing to charge construction and rental charges at a much lower rate than applies in Dublin. I would love to meet some of these people.  There is nothing in the files of the Department of Finance to bear out what Deputy O'Malley suggested.  Therefore, let us put all that nonsense out of our heads in considering the proposals here.</P>
    <P>We must remember that much accommodation is needed in the Dublin area, irrespective of whether we go ahead with the programme.  There is a substantial programme needed for existing staffs in the greater Dublin area.  The more money that is diverted into the building or the renting of new office blocks in provincial towns the less will be available for absolutely essential construction and for the removal of bad office accommodation in existing offices.</P>
    <P>I must confess I was somewhat taken aback yesterday evening by the virulence of Deputy O'Malley's remarks and by the anti-Dublin tone he adopted.  I could see a worried frown on the brow of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, when he was speaking.  Dáil Deputies are responsible for the entire country, not just for Dublin, Limerick or any other part.  It is important to remember that <Col N="972" /> slightly more than one-third of the registered unemployed are in the eastern region.  This region, for the most part Dublin, accounts for a higher proportion of people under the age of 25 on the live register.  In other words, the incidence of youth unemployment in the eastern region, including Deputy Haughey's constituency, is marginally higher than for the rest of the country.  These facts are readily available to Deputies.  In the building and construction sector 70 per cent of those who are insured and registered are unemployed in the Dublin area. Dublin has 29 per cent of the total population.</P>
    <P>The great denunciation of Dublin by Deputy O'Malley last night was highly selective and damaging.  I am not trying to say that Dublin is necessarily worse off than the rest of the country but it has similar problems to the rest of the country. Arising from the proportion of the population living in this area, the scale of the problems in terms of numbers is daunting.  I so not want to enter into polemical arguments with the Deputy about the virtues of living in Dublin or living in Limerick.  I could be very scathing about some of the temping prospects I would hold out in that regard.  I shall refrain from that kind of provincialism. As one who came to live in Dublin 24 years ago I have found employment and living here as good as and in some respects better than living in other areas. I do not wish to get into that kind of non-productive argument which would not help anyone in objectively assessing this programme.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned that there would be a loss of jobs if the programme was not proceeded with.  We have taken no decision not to proceed with the programme. It is under review and we hope to have a decision at Government level in the new year.  It is not true to say that the towns nominated for decentralisation will lose jobs.  The local benefits from decentralisation would arise from the spin-off effects of the extra local spending represented by the salaries of those transferred to the various towns.  No new jobs as such would be created.  The nonsense about a loss of 1,000 jobs is misleading.  Civil <Col N="973" /> servants will be transferred on a voluntary basis and I am sure there will be sufficient volunteers to go to these centres in the event of the Government deciding to go ahead with the programme. I do not want to jump the gun on negotiations with the public service staff or their representatives.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Malley and Wilson inferred that everything was signed, sealed and delivered.  That is not so.  Consultations with the staff in each Department will be essential.  There have only been three meetings with staff representatives to inform them of the proposals and keep them up to date on developments. Is that conclusive negotiation with the trade unions concerned?  Much remains to be discussed.  This aspect of staff transfer will be one aspect of the review we have at present.  We must ensure, if the decision is to go ahead, that the staff to be transferred are of a particular rank and have particular expertise. I am sure there is no need for me to say that to Deputy Barrett.  One does not transfer a Government Department from Dublin to a provincial centre and simply send all staff at clerical assistant level. One must send staff of all grades with expertise and experience.  That takes time.  There will be no compulsory transfers.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the sites which were available.  Some State-owned sites are involved and these are at Athlone, Galway and Nenagh.  These are valuable. I do not understand the jig of a reel on the part of Deputy O'Malley because he knows that Limerick was stopped at sketch plan stage pending the outcome of an archaeological excavation on the site there.  There is a great to-do about the Government's decision to stop the programme. Deputy Wilson maintained 15 minutes ago that everything had gone through and all the work was done.  Take Ennis and Dundalk.  No planning has commenced in those two centres.  The position with regard to the sites there had not been sufficiently clarified.  Deputy Barrett should consult with his colleagues in relation to this matter and see what they were up to when they went out of office.  We pointed out that the cost <Col N="974" /> involved of sending 3,100 civil servants from various Departments to centres in the country has been estimated by the Department to be £50 million to £51 million. That money will be all taxpayers' money.  Deputy Bruton said the cost in terms of allowances payable to staff for transferring could be up to £5 million or £6 million.  This money has to be borrowed and the question must be asked whether the yield is commensurate with the outlay.  That is important.</P>
    <P>An impression has wrongly been created that Dublin is a steaming civil service office-block with all the civil servants and those engaged in administration running madly around the centre of Dublin in and out of offices.  That is not true.  Much play was made of the fact that only 40 per cent, about 23,000 out of 60,000 civil servants are located outside of Dublin.  It will come as a surprise to many to know that there are 23,000 civil servants actually working outside of Dublin. There are 60,000 in all.  Four out of every ten civil servants in the civil service proper work outside Dublin and, that represents only part of the story.  Take the industrial employees, the craftsmen and the general workers employed by the OPW and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  There are about 5,500 such workers in the country and of those general employees in the OPW and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry no less than eight out of every ten are based and work outside of Dublin.</P>

      <P>Decentralisation has to be taken in context.  Taking the health agency staffs and leaving out the Eastern Health Board, which comprises the counties of Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow, 62 per cent of all health board staffs in the country are located outside Dublin. Therefore, we have to think of the staffs in that context.  While 60 per cent of the civil service is located in Dublin, it would be quite wrong to imply that 60 per cent of public sector employment is located in Dublin also.  That is not so.  The vast bulk of public sector employment is located outside Dublin.  Of course, as Deputy Barrett rightly said, they are located broadly in proportion to the overall population distribution.  In other words, while Dublin serves as an essential central base for many basic services because they cannot be located anywhere other than generally in the Dublin area, one cannot decentralise to the extent of destroying those services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to consider decentralisation under three criteria.  If the decentralisation will yield benefits commensurate to some reasonable degree with the total cost involved, then generally I would favour decentralisation. If decentralisation brings services closer to the people whom they are designed to serve and if that proved to be a reasonable proposition in relation to particular Government Departments, then I would favour aspects of decentralisation. If it can be proved that the spin-off <Col N="976" /> for regional development is of such magnitude that, despite the cost involved, it would be worth while, I would favour decentralisation.  But one has to be careful of the benefits to be anticipated.  If the benefits to be anticipated from expenditure on decentralisation are as great as those to be expected from any alternative investment opportunity available to us, then I favour decentralisation.  Finally, we have to take into account in relation to the so-called programme of the last Government &mdash; which is not a decentralisation programme at all, it is just a transfer of about half a dozen Departments to certain towns depending on where Ministers came from &mdash; if the overall state of the nation's finances is such as to allow all that, then I would support it.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party have a concept of decentralisation whereby every town in Ireland will have an Army barracks, a health board headquarters, a regional hospital, a psychiatric hospital, an airport, an international sports complex, a huge AnCO training centre, half a dozen civil service Departments working all in that town of 5,000 or 10,000 people.  They envisage manpower offices, employment offices and tax offices all transferred into the centre with ACOT offices and so on, a drugs squad, social welfare offices, telecommunications centres and so on.  If what Fianna Fáil are trying to cod the people about took place, it would be the greatest natural increase in population those towns have had in all their history. That is not decentralisation.  It is political nonsense.  It is promising people benefits which we all know cannot be delivered. To suggest that the proposal of the Fianna Fáil Cabinet of October 1980 represented a policy of decentralisation is to cod the people.  It is irrelevant in terms of population shift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, while the Government are examining the current proposals very carefully, we have not decided to defer the programme.  We have not decided to abandon any part of the programme.  We are looking at all of the options open to the Government at this stage and all of the representations which are being made, and all of the files are open for <Col N="977" /> analysis.  We are not going to do what Fianna Fáil were proposing to do, to run away like mad and, because eight or nine rural Ministers lived in particular towns, spend £51 million of taxpayers' money just like that and another £7 million or £8 million on staff transfers.  We will do what is to be done responsibly and objectively for the benefit of all the people.  I have no doubt that when the final decision is made the people will respect it, and reject the nonsense that we found on this issue when we took up office &mdash; a short-term general election gimmick with the former Taoiseach parading around the country into every town telling the people that we were all going to be decentralised, all the civil service jobs were coming down from Dublin, and that kind of nonsense.  It has to stop and I think we have brought an end to it on this occasion.</P>

        <i>(Clare):</i> I found some parts of the contribution of the Minister of State rather amusing, particularly his drawing of an analogy between the civil service and the fact that the Army are dispersed throughout the country as are the Garda and the local authorities. Surely he is not serious when he makes such comparisons.  Units of the Army have to be stationed at the most strategic parts of the country in order to fulfil the purpose for which they are there.  Likewise gardaí have to be dispersed.  Above all, I do not know how you can visualise the staffs of local authorities and health boards living in and around Dublin.  He tells us that they are not, they are all down the country.  Where else should they be but in their own areas?  Should Clare County Council staff be in Dublin?</P>

        <i>(Clare):</i> Now we are informed that this decision to decentralise published on 22 October 1980 is being reviewed.  Everything that had been there <Col N="978" /> and had been reviewed and examined fully when this Government took over is being reviewed again.  Such an amount of reviewing is going on that they do not know where the staff are to be found to review all these projects that have to be reviewed.  One thing is certain so far as this decentralisation programme is concerned. Even if this Government decide to let it go ahead, all they are doing at present with this review is delaying the whole programme.  We all know that delay in construction of buildings means greater costs.  If the review is only a postponement, it will cost the taxpayer more money because of increasing costs.  Now that it is being reviewed there are factors which were considered by the Fianna Fáil Government and the committee which was set up by them to examine the whole question of decentralisation.  That committee represented a number of Departments, the Department of Fianance the Board of Works, the Department of the Environment, the Department of Education, the Department of the Public Service and the Department of Social Welfare.  It was broadly representative of the Departments which were earmarked for decentralisation later.  We are having a review of something that was fully examined over a period by the previous Government and by the committee which I have just mentioned.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> There are factors in this review which should be seriously considered.  If the civil service is decentralised, surely it will mean a major source of employment immediately in the construction industry in the building of offices which will be necessary for this programme?  The construction industry badly needs a transfusion at present, as the Minister of State should know.  The total number involved, 3,210, is of no mean significance, not only because of the numbers involved but because they will be permanently in the areas to which they are being allocated.  Surely this will revitalise the areas to which they are moving.  All these people will need <Col N="979" /> houses which, in turn, will have to be designed and constructed.  This will be carried out by the local labour force. When the houses are constructed they will need furnishings which will be purchased locally.  The Minister of State said there will be no spin-off as a result of decentralisation.  I disagree with him.  It must lead to further employment in these areas.</P>
      <P>The most important factor is the transfusion of spending power which will go into all these areas.  We estimate, at present rates of pay, that the amount involved in this spending power will be £30 million. This is a sizeable sum to be injected into these towns in the designated areas.  All these people will have to purchase food and clothing.  They will also need entertainment and transport.  Supplying all these needs will provide more employment. All the facts I have mentioned were regarded as pertinent to the principle of decentralisation under the last Government.  The estimated cost, which is slightly in excess of £50 million, has been mentioned here.  My colleague, Deputy O'Malley, went into some detail yesterday evening and he rightly maintained that there would not be a saving of £50 million because, if decentralisation does not take place, offices will still have to be provided in Dublin.  Already there is a big demand for office accommodation in Dublin and it is running in the region of about £8 per square foot in the central areas.  If the Government do not build offices they will be obliged to rent them. Apart from decentralisation, there is such overcrowding in some Departments at present that office space still has to be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a proposal to build more offices in the grounds of the Department of Defence but nothing has been done yet.  The proposal has been with the Board of Works for some time.  There is serious overcrowding in that Department. There is also overcrowding in the Department of the Environment which, contrary to what some people believe, is not all housed in the Custom House.  It is in six different sections throughout the city.  There was such serious accommodation <Col N="980" /> problems in that Department, especially in O'Connell Bridge House, that strike action was threatened.  Some relief was afforded when the Board of Works rented some offices on the north side of the city but, as far as I know, there is still overcrowding there.</P>
    <P>The same probably applies to a number of other Departments in Dublin, so accommodation will have to be found in cases of overcrowding apart from decentralisation. The civil service is growing so rapidly that new accommodation will always be needed.  Therefore, it is wrong to say that this will mean a saving of £50 million.  The Fianna Fáil Party proposed involving the private sector in this programme and I know that during the term of office of Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, he took a personal interest in this programme and these proposals.  He was chairman of the committee and, when he was unavailable, his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, chaired it in his place.

        <i>(Clare):</i> In order to involve the private sector, discussions took place with a number of interested developers.  There was interest in this type of development.  It has been stated by the Minister and his Minister of State that private developers in rural areas wanted to charge the same rent for office accommofation as is charged in Dublin. I maintain they did not want the same level; they wanted the rents related to <Col N="981" /> Dublin office rates.  That is a reasonable request.  They did not want the rents to be on a par with those charged for office accommodation in St. Stephen's Green. As we do not have accommodation in other parts of the country on the same scale as in Dublin, these people should be entitled to relate charges for office accommodation to those charged in this city.  Rents charged in the centre of Dublin reach £8 per square foot.  I wanted to clarify that point.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works claim they have the right to provide office accommodation for any State Department.  I was personally involved in decentralisation, although that was not the first attempt at decentralisation.  In August 1977 I went before the Government and recommended that part of the Department of the Environment should be decentralised, and the Government agreed.  Then the location was decided. We chose Shannon new town, which was still under construction.  I maintain that that decentralisation would give an identity to that new town.  Such an identity is very important to a new community. Shannon Free Airport Development Company being on the spot, I decided they would carry out this decentralisation and I informed the Department's officials that that was how we would tackle it, but the Office of the Public Works claimed their right.</P>
      <P>As I said, that decision to decentralise was made in August 1977.  Tenders were sought in June 1980; the contractor was appointed shortly after September, and work started in May 1981, fortunately before the change of Government.  That took four years and the Office of Public Works were the main agents.  This should not have taken such a long time because the delay added enormously to the costs of the office block.  Last year there was a 22 per cent increase in labour costs for the building industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Foreign borrowing seems to be a bogey of this Government.  They put their hands in the air when anyone mentions it.  If the private sector were involved, there would be no need for the State to borrow abroad.  The private sector would get their money at the cheapest rate.  What <Col N="982" /> does it matter if the borrowing is from Dame Street, Paris or Frankfurt so long as it is at the cheapest rate?</P>
    <P>In Dublin it is estimated that 20 per cent of the total cost of an office block is set off against the cost of a site.  There is no way a site in the country could cost anything like 20 per cent of the total cost. In my own town I know a sizeable site &mdash; I forget the exact number of acres &mdash; which has been purchased and the contract signed, for £178,000.  There are other matters which make it more expensive to build office accommodation in Dublin than in the country.  As a condition in the planning permission, Dublin Corporation insist that part of an office block development must also be residential. As far as I know the residential part of these developments is done at cost because there is very little revenue from the residential side.  It is all charged to the letting of the office areas.  These reasons make rural Ireland more attractive for office building.</P>
    <P>Last evening the Minister said the Office of Public Works would not have a real involvement or have a real say in the design and/or supervision of these office blocks if the private sector were involved. I estimate that 75 per cent of State office accommodation in this city was not designed or supervised by the Office of Public Works, and there is no doubt that the rented office accommodation in Dublin is first class.  One of my colleagues has his office in Setanta House and he tells me there is no comparison between his office and mine.  I have not heard any criticism of any office block rented by any State Department in this city.  All I heard is praise.  Accommodation in a central part of the city, at St. Stephen's Green, is now realising about £8 per square foot but the Department of Finance already has office accommodation in Sarsfield House in Limerick.  Two tax inspectors are based there with their staff and as far as I am aware the cost of that accommodation is £4 per quare foot.  That is an important consideration if the Minister is starting to worry about tax payers and the cost of accommodation to them.  The Minister mentioned the need to save money, but in fact he is not saving any.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> It should be remembered that there will be rent escalation clauses in pre-letting agreements involving the private sector.  At every review those letting the accommodation will be entitled to a percentage increase on the existing rent, but those percentages could be related to the secondary office blocks located in what are described as secondary areas, away from places such as St. Stephen's Green. I am referring to places like Blackrock. The Minister also mentioned the question of accessibility for the public and how they would find transport to places like Ennis, Killarney, Athlone and other centres.  There has never been any difficulty about finding transport to such centres.  There may be some difficulty getting from Limerick to Ballina because the last Coalition Government did away with the railway service to Claremorris. A section of the Department of Agriculture is based in Castlebar and the farming community must travel there frequently because the headage grant and beef subsidy schemes are administered from that centre.  Those schemes involve personal contact by the farming community with the officials, but I have not heard farmers say it is any more difficult for them to travel from, for instance, Clare to Castlebar than it is for them to go to Dublin. Accessibility is not a problem in spite of what the Minister has said.  Has the Minister ever heard of any difficulties in the south of England due to the fact that the entire Department of Social Welfare is located in Newcastle-upon-Tyne?</P>
    <P>The Minister also drew attention to the fact that decentralisation would involve new sewerage and water schemes costing a lot of money.  I have some knowledge of the areas where water and sewerage schemes are required, having served in the Department of the Environment, and I can tell the House that a number of the areas mentioned are adequately serviced. A new scheme has been completed in my town and there is a new one under construction in Ballina.  I have not heard of any difficulty in Killarney other than that there was a need for a treatment works, but that got under way during my term <Col N="984" /> of office.  I cannot recall hearing that Galway has a problem.  In my opinion there would not be any great initial cost in supplying the services required for decentralisation. We are all aware that the greatest demand for such services exists in Dublin.  Dublin could spend the entire allocation for water, sewerage and housing if it was made available because the demand is so great and decentralisation would surely ease that problem.</P>
    <P>The site for the Ennis offices was purchased at a cost of £178,000 and the contact has been signed, but there it rests. There is no problem about water and sewerage in that town.  The proposal in relation to that town is being deferred pending a review.  That is one of many schemes being reviewed.  The Government are also reviewing two schemes which were approved by the last Government, the Ballyforan turf burning generating station and the Arigna generating station.  The Minister for Finance told us last night that there was a huge gap between our capacity to generate electricity here and what we use.  He said that of the 100 per cent capacity we only utilise 60 per cent.  That may be true but the Minister should remember that Deputy O'Malley was talking about using our native resources.  It is the policy of the EEC that we should get away from our dependence on oil and that is why the last Government proposed doing by establishing a turf burning station in Ballyforan and a second coal-burning station in Arigna.  Those projects have been hit on the head; but of course we should not forget that they are located in the West of Ireland, which is no-man's-land as far as the Government are concerned.  Many of the suggested locations for decentralisation are in the west but, of course, the west has only one Minister, the Minister for the Gaeltacht and we do have a Minister of State in north Kerry.  It is easy to understand why decentralisation has been knocked and why Ballyforan and Arigna have been knocked.  They have been knocked because of their location, an area that is of no interest to the Government.</P>

      <P>I have listened <Col N="985" /> with some interest to the contribution of the last speaker and learned a good deal. In particular, my political geography has been extended because I was unaware of the fact that the constituencies of Sligo-Leitrim and Donegal had some how or other moved to the east coast or that, alternatively, the Ministers of State who represent those constituencies had forfeited their citizenship of Connacht and Ulster.  I will not be deflected into an examination at this stage of the political geography that has been raised by the last speaker.  However, his ending was interesting because it seemed to me that that focused attention on what was the real motivation behind tabling the motion.  Of course it is appropriate that Dáil Éireann should examine the fundamentals of our economic policies and it is appropriate that we should examine our attitude to decentralisation, why we want to decentralise, to where and at what speed but I suggest that that was not the motivation that led to the tabling of this motion.  I suggest the motion was tabled for one reason only, to be mischievious and political and to seek to embarrass the Government.</P>

      <P>The history of this so-called decentralisation project and commitment of the Fianna Fáil Party was outlined last night by Deputy O'Malley in introducing the debate. Deputy O'Malley has maintained a discreet silence on debates on the Government's economic policies in the last few months but now he found it possible to drape himself in the Limerick colours to move the motion.  Perhaps the history of the project is covered by his first sentence which was to the effect that on 16 February 1980 the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, in his presidential address to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis announced that the Government would give effect to their decision to implement what was described as a comprehensive policy on decentralisation.</P>
      <P>That was hardly the forum for the introduction of a serious and planned commitment to decentralisation.  Rather it was an announcement to bring the warriors of destiny to their feet at the Ard-Fheis. If one looks a little further at the details of the project, in so far as they are available to us, one cannot help but notice the number of marginal constituencies or at least ones that were perceived to be marginal, that were to benefit. I am sure that even Deputy Barrett's political geography will accord with mine on this point.  Let us take, for instance, Limerick which was a marginal five-seater but which as a result of the activities of Deputies O'Donnell and Noonan is no longer marginal.  Again, there is the town of Ennis where Fianna Fáil defended successfully to the end their three out of four seats.</P>

      <P>A commitment to decentralise is fine so long as we are clear about what the motivation for such commitment is.  If the objective is to bring the point of decision-making closer to people and to increase their access to the point of Government that is fine, but if what is put before us is a badly thought out decision to announce a Government policy in the run-up to a general election in the belief that one party may gain from the announcement, is it not right and proper that a new Government should examine the consequences of that announcement?</P>
      <P>Of course there is a need to decentralise. We know very well that part of Dublin city is top heavy with office blocks.  Anybody going into the Dublin 4 or 6 districts cannot be in any doubt about that but we must have decentralisation only on the basis that it provides a better service for people, allows them to conduct their business more expeditiously, and ensures that their problems are attended to in greater detail.  It is for that reason that this Government are committed to decentralisation but if that objective is to be fulfilled it is essential that the commitment to decentralisation must be a considered one and that the locations to which offices are to be transferred be examined in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all this talk of decentralisation little reference has been made to the situation in this city in which there is an abundance of office space in the fashionable Dublin 4 and 6 districts while across the Liffey in the Nos. 3 and 5 districts office blocks are a rarity.  The reality is that if what is intended is that the Dáil should consider where it stands in relation to this question of decentralisation, that the Dáil should express its approval of decentralisation and that this House should say to the <Col N="988" /> Government this is what we want to see happen and, accordingly, you must move in that direction, it should have no hesitation in accepting the amendment moved by the Minister for Finance.  That amendment reads:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;accept the necessity in the context of the present difficult economic situation to review expenditure programmes including the decentralisation programme to ensure the best possible return for public investment; and also accepts that the review of the decentralisation programme should take into consideration in addition both the need for balanced regional development and the improvement of services to the public.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is not without interest that Deputy O'Malley at the beginning of his speech promised to parse and analyse that amendment but that he has not done so. I suggest the reason for that is that if one were to examine the amendment one would find in it a clear and unequivocal commitment to decentralisation, a commitment that this Government will follow through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil did not intend to be in any way provocative in putting down this motion and neither was their declared commitment to decentralisation intended to be in any way an election gimmick.  However, I was not surprised at the attitude taken by the Government in relation to this issue. When question in this regard were put to the Minister he took them together and answered in such a way as to indicate that this was another part of a programme that had been initiated but which, too, was to be shelved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the last speaker that I come from a constituency which is being affected by the halt in the decentralisation of Government Departments.  I am sure that when the idea was first mooted, all Deputies here but particularly those from the western seaboard constituencies welcomed it and saw in the concept someseate <Col N="989" /> thing that would be of benefit to local communities.  No doubt representations were made from all sides of the House in respect of the various areas.  I expect that many of the Government Deputies are as disappointed as we are because of the halt in the programme.  At the time the programme was announced I was a member of the National Development Organisation and we pushed for a location in Donegal.  We sought the support of the various agencies in the constituency, including the private sector.  Having regard to the guidelines concerning the selection of the various areas we realised that the only location in our county which would have any chance of being chosen was Letterkenny.</P>
    <P>The move towards decentralisation was a move in the direction of regional development but to hear speakers on the other side talk of the implications of decentralisation makes little sense.  We should bear in mind that if regional development is to mean anything it should be tackled vigorously and implemented.  In this city dwell 30 per cent of the entire population.  I do not think there is any other capital city in the world which accommodates such a high proportion of its entire population.  In regard to office employment, only 1.5 per cent of the entire employment in my county was of that nature according to the 1966 census but I am sure that the figure is even less now.  In the eastern region 59 per cent of the workforce are in office employment. There are many people employed in the public sector in Dublin, especially people from my constituency, who wish to get back to their own regions.  Their financial resources are strained living and working in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Regional development will bring closer to the people facilities to help them to carry on their daily work.  When we see a project, which was initiated and £2 million spent on it by the previous Government &mdash; £1.6 million on design and architectural work and £1.5 million on sites &mdash; now being sent for review, this clearly spells out for me that the Government feel the civil service is the area they must put pressure on and they must curb everything in the civil service.  The civil service <Col N="990" /> has grown over the years and needs to grow more because we are involved in many ways through Government regulations and procedures and also through our EEC membership.  It is important to bring the civil service closer to the people.</P>
    <P>The Public Service Advisory Council in report No. 7 for the year ended 31 October 1980, in pages 10 and 11 said:</P>
    <P>The Council has noted with special interest the references to decentralisation in the report of the Department of the Public Service and the opportunity was availed of to discuss this question in the course of the interviews which we had with heads of Departments and with staff unions.  An important advantage of the decentralisation already accomplished and at present in prospect is, of course, the contribution which can be made to regional development by the dispersal of service-type employment.  However, decentralisation also provides an opportunity for many civil servants to work in or near their own home towns.  We understand that there are long lists of applicants for the limited number of vacancies which arise in provincial centres at present and the Council would hope that working in close proximity to home would have favourable effects on morale (and consequently efficiency) in clerical grades particularly.  The sections in Government Departments selected for decentralisation are, it is understood, largely self-contained so that, given adequate communications, there should be minimal disruption once the transfers have actually taken place.</P>
    <P>However, it is evident to us from our discussions with heads of Departments that the smooth achievements of the transfers will be a sizeable and complex task, posing a considerable challenge for management in the Departments affected.  Adequate communications, especially telephone and (if they arise) computer linkages, will be crucial to the success of the programme.  However, in view of the recent and prospective achievements in the extension <Col N="991" /> and improvement of the national communications network, the Council would expect that no undue difficulties should arise on this score.</P>
    <P>There was a very favourable response for the many people who would be involved in moving to the various centres.  The old argument has always been that the facilities were not in the rural areas to accommodate any State Departments.  The constituency I represent for many years suffered those drawbacks but during the four years of the previous Government a major breakthrough took place in County Donegal.  Telecommunications there will be fully automated within the next few years.  Fianna Fáil initiated an extensive breakthrough on the industrial front.  We had the extension to our general hospital, we had the AnCO centre for Letterkenny mooted and we had the decentralisation of offices for the Department of Social Welfare.  Unfortunately, when there was a change of Government and I sought to pursue the matters mentioned, I found that no progress apparently will be made.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Government that for many years the emphasis has been for development in the eastern part of the country.  Unfortunately the same pattern prevailed in the Six Counties, where no development west of the Bann was allowed to take place.  Fianna Fáil believed that that attitude should change and set out on a course whereby regional development would take place in a meaningful way.  It is unfortunate, when that commitment was given and the work was in train by the previous Government, that we have now to have another review. There are many things the country needs but I do not think it needs reviews on any of the matters the Government are seeking reviews on.  It has been well argued in the House in relation to this project <Col N="992" /> that the reasons for a continuation of this programme are to be found in the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to forget about a review, because that is only a ploy to shelve this programme.  Progress will be impeded and many areas where the centres were to be set up will be deprived of them.  It will mean that many of the public sector employees working in Dublin who were waiting for the day when they could move back to their own areas will now have to wait for another five or six years before that happens.  The attitude of this Government seems to be to revert back to the policy of developing the east coast, crowding out Dublin, forgetting about the west and the north, letting them sit out on a limb.  I do not think the people of the west or the people of the constituency I represent will give any credit to the Government for their actions, which make it necessary to bring this motion before the House to highlight the contempt the Government have for the development of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I represent one of the most rural constituencies in the country and we are now denied the right to have what has been given to us by the previous Government. The people in that constituency will not forget that when they get the opportunity. I wish to put on the record my thanks to the previous Taoiseach, who enthusiastically pursued regional development, and to Deputy O'Malley who was Minister for Industry and Commerce and his vigorous efforts to start industrial development in that region.  I wish to thank also the then Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, who gave the necessary sanction for that region in Donegal.  A site is now available and the contract documents are ready for signature if the Minister will allow the work to be done.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach gave a solemn promise to the people of Bantry and welched on that promise.  Today we had welching on another promise, but we will deal with that next week.  In continuation of this crusade I want the Minister for Labour to send his officials and experts into West Cork to identify the needs of the people there especially the younger people, to see what kind of training they need and what skills they have because I know that while the Coalition are in Government a training centre will not be erected in Bantry.</P>

      <P>Of course I would like him to reply, but I am talking about investment.  A certain amount of investment is involved in erecting an AnCO centre but investment today means jobs tomorrow.  We are asking the Minister and the Government to invest, not very heavily, in a remote area which deserves special treatment from the Government. I hope that as a result of raising this on the Adjournment and the consequent exposure of this very important question, <Col N="998" /> the Minister will relent and change and, despite the pressures and constraints that may be put on him by the Minister for Finance, he will be man enough to fight and say that West Cork deserves special treatment and that we will erect an AnCO centre in Bantry and provide proper training and facilities for the people of West Cork.

      <P>The location of training centres is in the first place, a matter for the council of AnCO.  The council is representative in the main of employer and trade union bodies and may be expected to reflect the needs of both worker and industry.</P>
      <P>AnCO are financed through my Department's Vote and I have the task of convincing the Government and the Minister for Finance that they must provide adequately for AnCO's training activities including capital requirements. I must also satisfy them that AnCO moneys are spent to the best advantage.</P>
      <P>AnCO have drawn up a capital development programme which, when completed in 1985, will have resulted in permanent centres being spread strategically throughout the country.  The criteria for the establishing of a training centre are total population in each electoral area, population density around potential location and minimum size for the economic operation of a training centre.</P>
      <P>AnCO are convinced that the training centre should have at least 200 places to enable it to provide a wide range of courses, allowing that each of those places would accommodate at least two trainees during any twelve-month period. Deputies will get some appreciation of the numbers needed to keep a centre operating to its maximum capacity.</P>

      <P>A mix of courses must be provided, otherwise the local labour market would soon have surpluses in a limited number of skills with little prospect of local employment.  The aspirations of job seekers are provided for also in this way by giving them a reasonable range of courses from which to choose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>AnCO feel that the training needs of West Cork can best be met through the Cork City centres, through external training courses and the use of mobile training units.  A mobile unit was located in Bantry for a period last year during which three courses were run.  AnCO experienced some difficulty in recruiting sufficient numbers of adult trainees for these courses and in addition the placement rate was disappointing.  On the other hand, the mobile unit which operated in Clonakilty up to very recently experienced more encouraging results. For the future AnCO propose to offer a wider choice of courses through their mobile centres and this may be more suited to Bantry needs.  In addition to the mobile units AnCO are always ready to <Col N="1000" /> respond to the needs of local industry, both established and new, with special locally based courses.  Such courses have been found to be very successful elsewhere. Unfortunately, AnCO have not received any requests for them in the Bantry areas so far.</P>
    <P>AnCO's external training division ran a job seeking skills programme in Bantry in July last and this has been followed up by AnCO's Director of External Training meeting with the West Cork county development team on 24 November last when it was agreed to investigate what the external training division can do in the West Cork area generally.  There are 19 people from West Cork in permanent AnCO training centres at present and an additional 20 are in training on community youth training projects in the following areas: Aughadown, Churchcross, Skibbereen, children's playground; Skibbereen, flatlets for the aged and community centre.  Other projects completed in community youth training projects are: Sherkin Island, renovation of bird observatory; Ballymakeera, amenities complex; Sherkin Island Summer Camp; Bantry Blues GAA community centre and dressing room; Caheragh Community Hall and repairs to Skibbereen CYMS Hall.  A new project, which will provide a workshop for the Bantry Mentally Handicapped Association, has not yet been started.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan pointed out that the Cork city centre did not appear to be facilitating young applicants from west Cork.  I checked this matter with AnCO and I was assured that all applications for non-apprentice training are subject to the same selection criteria, that is, suitability for courses on offer or sought.  However, as applicants are called in chronological order, some have to wait for a considerable time for training, especially for courses such as heavy goods vehicle driving or welding, which are in high demand. Travelling and accommodation allowances are payable to trainees who have to attend training away from home.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in respect of non-established civil servants appointed in my Department since 30 June 1981, as at 15 October, other than those: (a) appointed as a result of competitions conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners; (b) arising in the normal course of promotion, and (c) appointed to posts listed as scheduled occupations in the first schedule to the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, is as follows &mdash; Five appointments have <Col N="866" /> been made on terms that the appointments are to terminate not later than the date on which the Government cease to hold office.</P>
      <P>Three appointees, Ms. Miriam Ivory, Ms. Emily Mitchell and Ms. Teresa Kelly, are acting as personal assistants in general office duties in the office of the Minister and the office of the Minister of State at a remuneration of £141.88 per week.</P>
      <P>Two appointees, Mr. Jeremiah Cronin and Dr. John W. Harris, are acting as my special advisers and were respectively Education Officer with the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee and Principal of Newpark Comprehensive School.  These appointees have been seconded to their present positions and continue to receive their salaries from their former employers, subject to recoupment arrangements.</P>
      <P>These salaries are as follows: Mr. Cronin &mdash; £15,540 per annum; Dr. Harris &mdash; £16,288 per annum (including allowances).</P>
      <P>The Deputy may, perhaps, have been prompted to table the question because of recent newspaper publicity concerning the appointments of Mr. Cronin and Dr. Harris and also publicity regarding two other individuals and, in particular, a front page lead story in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 3 September 1981 headed `Sack Fianna Fáil Men Say Unions'.</P>
      <P>This article relates to the status of the Deputy Secretary of the Department and also of the Information Officer.  While it is true to say that neither of these officers entered the civil service through the normal channels, their position is now that of established civil servants.</P>
      <P>The Deputy Secretary first served as a non-established officer as Private Secretary to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government during the period 23 June 1951 to 22 February 1953 and as Administration Officer in the Government Information Bureau from 22 March 1957 to 9 September 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government of the day decided, on 10 September 1957, that he should be absorbed into the civil service.  He served as an officer of the Department of Education from 15 March 1973 until 31 <Col N="867" /> January 1980.  He had been elevated to the position of Deputy Secretary on 18 December 1979 and he was formally seconded, as from 1 February 1980, to the Department of the Taoiseach, where he served until 30 June 1981.  At that stage he reverted to his position of Deputy Secretary in the establishment of my Department.</P>
    <P>The information officer was absorbed into the civil service by the Government of the day on 6 July 1977 and given the rank of Assistant Secretary.  He served in such grade in that Department from that date until 13 August 1981 when, at my request, he was seconded from the Department of the Taoiseach to act as information officer, holding the same grade, in my Department.</P>
    <P>The advisers and the officers mentioned are all, in my opinion, carrying out their duties admirably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that appeals to An Bord Pleanála should be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.  I have so advised the board and have asked that procedures be reviewed to that end.</P>
      <P>The most recent analysis suggests that there is some reduction in the time taken to deal with appeals so far in the current year as compared with 1980.</P>
      <P>The board have pointed out that the time taken in dealing with appeals can be affected in a major way by procedures, and by factors outside their control, such as delays in submitting grounds of appeal, requests that appeals be held in abeyance, awaiting documents from local authorities, circulation of documents, new issues arising and, in some cases, inadequate plans submitted with original planning applications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">

      <P>The report of the Manpower Consultative Committee's sub-committee on youth employment was published in November 1980.  The sub-committee's terms of reference were to examine the extent of the present and future youth employment situation, the difficulties encountered by young people in obtaining employment and to suggest ways of overcoming these difficulties.</P>
      <P>The main recommendation contained in the report was that young people who remain unemployed for a period to be specified after leaving school should be regarded as priority clients for the allocation of places on training courses, work experience programmes and youth employment schemes.  The Youth Employment Agency, which will have the task of arranging that up to 20,000 young people who are without employment for up to six months will qualify for participation on one of the existing or projected youth employment or training schemes, will discharge this recommendation. This figure of 20,000 will be in addition to the 20,000 young people who will participate in such schemes in 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report made a number of other recommendations on how to deal with the youth employment problem.  Many of the recommendations related to the lack of adequate statistics, information and research, on youth employment and unemployment.  Recent measures, such as the introduction of an annual sample survey of school leavers which gives a broad indication of the pattern of employment among young people upon leaving the educational system, will assist in the preparation of data and other information on employment among young people.  Furthermore, since the beginning of 1981 the National Manpower Service have introduced a new information system on job-seekers registered with it and school leavers looking for their first job and registered with the NMS are separately identified.  Details of <Col N="891" /> the numbers involved are published quarterly in the <i>Manpower Information Quarterly.</i> In addition, the activities of the Youth Employment Agency will improve our information on the youth labour market.</P>
    <P>The report stated that, while a reduction in the level of youth unemployment would be achieved mainly through economic growth and the consequent increase in overall labour demand, certain groups of young people could, however, have specific employment problems. The primary objective of a number of Government programmes is the protection and creation of jobs and this will, of course, assist young people.  I might mention here the National Development Corporation.  The Youth Employment Agency will provide for increased penetration for disadvantaged youth to the various training and work experience schemes.</P>
    <P>The report also referred to the need for research into the problems of the disadvantaged and I anticipate that the agency will be looking into this whole area.</P>
    <P>The report referred to the lack of sufficient information available to young people on the occupations and geographical locations where employment opportunities are likely to be best.  The occupational shortages sub-committee of the Manpower Consultative Committee have considered this recommendation and have highlighted the occupations in short supply and the areas of likely employment opportunities.  The main agent for the dissemination of this information is the National Manpower Service, which has offices throughout the country and the service has been and will continue to be active in this field.  The sub-committee have also endeavoured to reach graduates through the careers and appointments services of the universities and by developing special postgraduate courses in areas of particular shortages.</P>
    <P>The report also recommended that a comprehensive examination of the educational system regarding its relevance to modern employment of a technical nature should be carried out.  The Manpower <Col N="892" /> Consultative Committee, and other interested bodies, are continuing to examine the needs of the labour market and the response from the educational system to these needs, in consultation with the Department of Education and other bodies.  In addition, the sub-committee on attitudes to industrial employment will shortly make final recommendations. Earlier recommendations of the sub-committee &mdash; for example, those relating to the establishment of school/industry links schemes &mdash; have already been implemented.</P>
    <P>As regards the general question of vocational preparation and training, this matter will be taken up by the Youth Employment Agency under a number of their terms of reference, including that relating to the submission of views on educational policy and its effectiveness in preparing young people for working life.</P>
    <P>The report stated that the employment incentive scheme and other such schemes may make a contribution to overcoming any resistance on the part of firms to employing young people and that they should be continued.  The EIS has operated in 1981 and discussions are underway regarding its continuance in 1982. The Youth Employment Agency will expand substantially other schemes operated for the benefit of young people.</P>
    <P>The report highlights in a number of its conclusions and recommendations the problems of disadvantaged young people.  This will be an area where the Youth Employment Agency will concentrate their efforts.</P>

      <P>The National Manpower Service of my Department is the designated national authority for overseeing and assisting in the implementation of the Second EEC Programme for the Exchange of Young Workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NMS has sought to foster interest <Col N="893" /> in this programme by publicising information leaflets for young workers and for employers who might be interested in participating.  These leaflets are available at all offices of the National Manpower Service.  In addition NMS placement staff are available to discuss the details of the programme with interested young people or others.</P>
    <P>A number of meetings have been arranged by the NMS with representatives of interested organisations(a) including employer, trade union, professional, youth and other interests as well as with the competent exchange promoting bodies. These meetings have enabled useful discussion and initial consultation with employer organisations to advocate participation by their members in hosting or releasing employees for exchange programmes. Arising out of these meetings CERT recently sent two groups of trainees on successful exchange to Brittany, French.</P>
    <P>At the initiative of my Department the EEC Commission in February of this year appointed AnCO as a recognised European body with authority to intitate and implement young worker exchanges. In view of the vocational orientation of the programme and AnCO's close liaison with Irish employers in the manufacturing sector as well as their long experience in working with and for young people, a greater number of young Irish persons can be expected to benefit in future.</P>

      <P>In the Joint Study on Economic Co-operation published on 11 November 1981 officials considered the subject of industrial development both bilateral and in the context of the two countries' common membership of the European Community. It was agreed by both the British and Irish sides that, to the extent that industrial development is dependent on the attraction of overseas investment, the scope for co-operation between Ireland and Northern Ireland is limited since it has to be recognised that both areas are in fact competitors in the search for and <Col N="901" /> the attraction of internationally mobile industrial investment.</P>
      <P>The joint study, however, noted that there is scope for co-operation in the encouragement of small industries and craft industries in Border areas and to this end informal discussions have taken place and are continuing between the Industrial Development Authority and the Northern Ireland Department of Commerce.</P>
      <P>Provision is also made in the non-quota section of the European Regional Development Fund for grants and marketing aid for craft industries in the Border counties.</P>
