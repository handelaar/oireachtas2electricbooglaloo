      <P>Apart from our general protest about the manner in which very important legislation is being railroaded through the House this week, I want to express particular objection to the taking of the Insurance Bill today.  I want to point out to the Taoiseach that at no stage in the discussions between the Whips was the Insurance Bill mentioned: it made its first appearance in the list of business to be taken when the guillotine motion was put down.</P>
      <P>Apart from any of the other legislation being rushed through the House in a casual and haphazard manner, it is deplorable that the Insurance Bill should be dealt with in this manner.  It is a very important, complex and tricky piece of legislation with considerable implications for the insurance and financial worlds. We want to register the strongest possible protest about it being brought forward at the very last minute.  I want to say that in respect of any flaws and errors that may subsequently emerge and any detrimental effects the Bill will subsequently have, we have no responsibility for them because of the manner in which it is being put through the House.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about an Adjournment debate.  I am asking the Taoiseach if we can discuss the settlement that has been reached, which I welcome, I might add.  It would not have been obtained but for the efforts of Deputy Kavanagh within the Coalition Cabinet.  I welcome that, but I want to know if we can discuss it in detail, particularly in view of the fact that we had a wage negotiation breakdown almost three weeks ago.  I believe that the settlement achieved now would also have obtained in a national wage agreement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Is é is cuspóir don Bhille seo trí leasú éagsúla a dhéanamh ar reachtaíocht dlí árachais &mdash; leasuithe a bhaineann le Cuideachta Árachais Saoil na h-Éireann Teoranta, le ráthaíochtaí onnmhairithe <Col N="2050" /> agus le ráthaíochtaí i ndáil le hiasachtaí ón mBanc Eorpach Infheistíochta.</P>
    <P>This short Bill contains three separate amendments of insurance law.  The first relates to Irish Life Assurance Company and the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938, under which the company was set up.  The purpose of the amendment is, primarily, to allow Irish Life to enter the non-life insurance market in Ireland through a subsidiary company.  The second amendment refers to section 2 of the Insurance Act, 1953, which covers export credit insurance.  It is proposed to increase the aggregate of the Minister's liability under export credit insurance policies from £100 million to £300 million. The final amendment affects the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1978, which was introduced to allow banks to do certain types of guarantee business, and is by way of confirmation that banks licensed in the State can guarantee loans issued by institutions such as the European Investment Bank for industrial development projects in this country.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies will be familiar with the history of Irish Life, but it is worthwhile recounting that the company was brought into being by the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938, to take over the business of several existing insurance companies which had run into financial difficulties.  The 1938 Act enabled the Minister for Finance to contribute the very large sum in those days of £1 million towards meeting the deficiencies in the funds of the insolvent companies in question. The 1938 Act provided that the business of these companies would be transferred to a special company referred to in the Act as the terminating company, which would, in time, transfer the business to a company known as the Permanent Company.  The transfer to the Permanent Company was effected in 1947 and this Permanent Company is now known as Irish Life Assurance Company Limited.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone can doubt that the measures taken by the Government in this case have resulted in one of the major successes in public enterprise.  Irish Life is now our largest insurance company with assets in 1980 of over £700 <Col N="2051" /> million.  These assets, which represent the savings of individual policy holders, have provided valuable investment funds for the economy as a whole.  The performance of the company's investments has ensured a continued and sustained growth in premiums to the company.  The success of Irish Life's investment policy is a tribute to its business acumen and to the freedom of action and flexibility allowed to the company in such matters. This is essential in the area of life assurance where the company is competing with many other insurers who enjoy this freedom.  Thus while the Minister for Finance controls the shares of the company, Irish Life is in practice run on a strictly commercial and independent basis.</P>
    <P>Within the past few years there have been important changes in insurance in this country mainly stemming from moves to open up the Irish market as a result of EEC Directives.  Already we have seen the implementation of the EEC Non-Life Directive in 1976 which provided easier access to our non-life market for EEC insurers.  A similar effect on the life assurance market will emerge when the EEC Life Directive is brought into force shortly.  Of course, liberalisation in the EEC works both ways.  We gain access to other EEC markets and I would certainly like to see Irish insurers take more positive steps to expand into these markets.</P>
    <P>Irish Life itself has sought to diversify and extend its activities, for example, into overseas markets.  The company has recognised the desirability both for its own investment portfolio and from the point of view of extending the range of insurance services to its clients, of being able to engage in the non-life insurance market.  Being able to compete in both markets will strengthen the company's domestic base.  Under Irish insurance law, and indeed in an EEC context under the First EEC Life Assurance Directive, it is not possible for a company which is authorised, for example, to transact life insurance, to engage in non-life insurance, and <i>vice-versa</i>, except through a subsidiary company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2052" /> There are several examples of such subsidiary companies already in the Irish market.  However, the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938, places an even greater restriction on Irish Life by providing that it can only carry on life assurance business and it cannot, therefore even by way of subsidiary company, engage in non-life insurance.  The basic purpose of the first section of the Bill is therefore to remove this restriction and allow Irish Life to establish or acquire such a non-life subsidiary.  This does no more than place the company on the same footing under insurance law as any other life insurance company.</P>
    <P>Deputies will know that Irish Life has made a successful offer for a majority holding in the share capital of Church and General Insurance Company Ltd., which has been in business since the early 1900s.  This offer was conditional on the enactment of legislation enabling Irish Life to make the necessary changes in its memorandum and was also subject to a decision by me not to make an order under section 9 of the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.  As I mentioned in the Seanad, I have decided not to make such an order and I am allowing the take-over to proceed.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this new partnership between Irish Life and Church and General will redound to the benefit of the policy holders of both companies. Church and General in the recent past have expanded their business considerably, underwriting risks other than those related solely to Church interests.  There is every reason to believe that the take-over by Irish Life and the strengthening of Church and General's base, which this will provide, will enable this expansion in business to be maintained and will help to increase the share of the insurance market underwritten by native Irish offices.  For Irish Life the acquisition of Church and General involves a closer relationship with a continental insurance company which has a substantial equity holding in Church and General.  This connection with a leading continental insurer should benefit Irish Life in any plans to extend operations in that market.  I am <Col N="2053" /> hopeful that Deputies will agree that this take-over is indeed a welcome move, involving an important strengthening of the native Irish interest in insurance, and the prospect of involvement in the European insurance field.</P>
    <P>Finally, still on the subject of Irish Life, the Bill also provides in section 1 for two further slight amendments to the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938.  The first will enable certain purely technical changes to be made in the memorandum of association of Irish Life, to bring the description of life assurance contained therein into line with the EEC Life Assurance Directive.  The second will allow Irish Life to delete certain spent provisions from their memorandum. These latter amendments which arise out of the particular wording of the 1938 Act are basically of a technical nature and do not make any real change in the company's position.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Insurance Act, 1953 enables the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, to give guarantees with respect to the insurance of risks in connection with exports.  Under the Act, the aggregate amount of the liability at any time for principal moneys in respect of export guarantees was set at £2 million. With the sharp growth in our exports since then, this figure has been successively amended, reaching the present limit of £100 million in the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1978.  Already, however, this latest limit is in danger of being breached.  At the end of 1980 the actual aggregate of liability stood at £68.1 million. the opportunity is being taken in this Bill therefore, to amend the relevant Insurance Act and increase the present limit to £300 million.  I know that the size of this increase is large, but it has been set at this level so as to keep pace with the expanding value of our exports and to remove the need for further upward adjustment of the limit for several years.</P>
    <P>The availability of export credit insurance is an important asset to our exporters enabling them to minimise the effects of a wide range of commercial and political risks involved in exporting.  The presence of an export credit insurance policy is also of considerable value as security <Col N="2054" /> with banks when the exporter wishes to raise working capital.  The recently introduced export credit finance scheme for goods sold on short term credit bears testimony to this.  The scheme is proving to be very attractive to exporters and in itself will encourage greater use of export credit insurance.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree that against this background the increase now proposed in the State's liability is a price worth paying to maintain this important export support.</P>
    <P>The final provision in this Bill confirms that licensed banks in this country can guarantee loans made by institutions such as the European Investment Bank to industrial development projects in this country.  The Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1978, allows licensed banks to undertake certain types of guarantee and suretyship business specified in the Act, which were previously regarded as insurance business.  Unfortunately certain doubts have arisen as to whether, within the exact and very specific terminology used in the 1978 Act, licensed banks are allowed to guarantee loans from the EIB. The EIB requires guarantees for its loans and it was the intention in 1978 to allow such loans, amongst others, to be covered by bank guarantee.  In order to put this matter beyond any doubt it has been decided to amend the 1978 Act in the manner set our in section 3 of the Bill. The provision of EIB loans is important for this country given our development needs and I feel that Deputies will be willing to agree the small amendment provided for in section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, before commending this Bill to the House, I may say that it has been the intention for some time to undertake a complete overhaul of Irish insurance legislation in general.  This exercise is complex but is well advanced and I hope to introduce the necessary amending legislation fairly soon.  For this reason, the present measure has been limited to the few specific items for which there is an immediate need and which could not await the finalisation of the major Bill now being processed.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House and I am hopeful that Deputies will be <Col N="2055" /> agreeable to enabling the Bill to be passed speedily.  Molaim an Bille seo don Teach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the principle of this Bill.  However, I did make some points in relation to it yesterday in the discussion on the guillotine motion, in so far as it was allowed, to which I had hoped the Minister might advert today, particularly in the light of the extremely short time we have to deal with this Bill, now 35 minutes only. Unhappily he saw fit not to and in fact gave this House an almost exact regurgitation of the speech he made in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that it happens, particularly in present circumstances because it is an insult to the House. We are able to read the Seanad debates if we have any interest in them.  In view of the fact that there have been fairly serious developments in this Bill since the Seanad debate &mdash; and I am sure the Minister knows what I am talking about &mdash; and in view of the fact that the company have expressed some concern about some aspects of the Bill to which I adverted yesterday, I would have hoped that they might have been dealt with by the Minister rather than the rather flippant way in which he just read out his Seanad speech with some minor amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of this Bill has not been dealt with very satisfactorily by the Minister. It has quite a history &mdash; I do not know that it is necessary to go into it all &mdash; at least some of which might be mentioned. Early this year the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited had come to a provisional arrangement with the shareholders of the Church and General Insurance Company whereby a certain type of transaction would be carried out between them.  When the Government's consent was sought to this I advised the Government against it on the grounds that it was diluting the State's interest in the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited and the Government agreed and did <Col N="2056" /> not accept the proposal put up.  I then advised the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited that we had no objection in principle to the Church and General being taken over but that they should do it by way of ordinary acquisition for cash rather than giving away their shares and diluting the interest of the Minister for Finance below 75 per cent, which would have been the effect of the original proposal. The Irish Life Assurance Company Limited then went ahead with the takeover of the Church and General Insurance Company, not quite on the lines I had envisaged because they are not purchasing the entire share capital, they are in fact purchasing 60 per cent of it, and the existing shareholders retain, <i>pro rata</i>, the 40 per cent.  I suppose there are some advantages in doing it that way. Perhaps there may be some advantages, particularly as it is a small company, to take it over completely.  However, that is not a point about which I would make any great issue.</P>
    <P>Where the issue does arise is on the rather confusing wording of section 1 (2) of this Bill as drafted.  It allows the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited to make certain changes in their Memorandum of Association.  Clearly there would not be any objection to the changes that are necessary to implement this transaction which has been agreed with the Church and General and which is to the benefit of both the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited and Church and General. But what concerns me, and I think concerns the House, is that the method by which this subsection is drafted makes no reference to the single transaction with the Church and General but gives a general power to the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited to form any subsidiary they wish in life or in general insurance, or to take over any company they wish in life or in general insurance either here or abroad.  I have no concern about what the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited do abroad &mdash; the more they can do abroad the better.  For several years I encouraged Irish insurance companies to increase their business and I am very glad to see the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited doing that.  Therefore I shall <Col N="2057" /> make no further reference to their ability to operate abroad, to acquire companies abroad or to form subsidiaries.  Likewise, since they are the major life insurers in this country I have no great objection to their forming other life subsidiaries, if they have to do so, for example for unit-linked purposes or whatever.  That is of no great concern to the House &mdash; if they feel it necessary to form other life companies &mdash; because no doubt the other life companies will be run as the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited are, will be profitable and will put nobody at risk.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we narrow it down to one category, that is the unfettered ability of the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited to acquire or to form a subsidiary to carry on in Ireland non-life business.  I have no objection to the proposal in so far as it extends to the Church and General Insurance Company, but my feeling is that section 1(2) should confine the power to the specific case of the acquisition of 60 per cent of Church and General because if the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited are to engage in other general insurance business here that is something that should be brought back to the House.  In the Seanad, although the debate was short, quite a proportion of it was devoted to the whole vexed question of motor insurance in this country.</P>
    <P>Unhappily the Minister did not make any reference at all to that in his statement today.  This is a great pity because motor insurance is really the kernel of this particular crux.  There has been constant pressure from certain people both inside and outside the House, for many years to have the State take over motor insurance.  It is regarded as unsatisfactory; it is costly and it is not available to some people who are adjudged to be particularly high risks.  Successive Governments have resisted that move.  I know I did on several occasions and I heard the present Minister do so on at least one occasion since he assumed office and do so with some vehemence.  However, we cannot speak for future Governments, particularly if the legislative power is given to enable the State to become <Col N="2058" /> involved.  Up to now one of the excuses a Minister had was that the State had no power to do this.  If this subsection is passed in this form the State will have power.  It is a matter that should get considerable consideration, not the kind of consideration that is available between now and 11.30 this morning.</P>
    <P>This is not a Bill I want to make any fuss about but it is a Bill that is of considerable importance to the financial affairs of one of the largest and most successful State enterprises in the country.  It is putting the financial strength of that enterprise in some jeopardy by putting them in a situation in which they may well be forced by public pressure on some future Government to cave in and to take on the bulk of motor insurance in this country or perhaps all of it.  One does not have to be an expert on insurance to realise the situation in which the policy holders of the Irish Life Company would be placed if their policies had to carry that burden.</P>
    <P>This principle of this point was recognised by Senator Whitaker in the Seanad. He talked about the traditional division here between life and non-life companies and said that the first Bill he had ever dealt with, as a young civil servant in the Department of Finance, in 1938, was the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938, which we are amending here and for that reason he had a good recollection of it. The reason why that Act and the earlier Act of 1936 and subsequent Acts in this country and in the EEC have always sought to separate life companies from non-life companies is that there has always been a fear that if they carried on the same business the non-life side, which is traditionally not very profitable and often loss-making, as is the case in the Irish motor insurance industry would pull down the life side of the business and would either bankrupt it or would render the outturn of the life policies of policy holders less profitable for them than would have been the case if the life business had been operated on its own.  That law was not enacted in 1936 and constantly re-enacted without good reason. There was good reason for it and when the EEC make amendments in it, as they <Col N="2059" /> are now proposing to do, they do so with great caution and on the basis that separate funds should be maintained for life and non-life business and so on.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are being asked to accept a situation in which something that is notoriously unprofitable, the Irish motor insurance business, potentially can be taken over by Irish Life.  Irish Life do not want that and it would certainly do their business no good to be in that position. For that reason section 1 (2) of this Bill should be amended to ensure that unfettered power is not given to the company to carry on non-life business in Ireland other than this acquisition of the Church and General.  I am suggesting that not because I want to limit the company's powers but because I want to preserve the company from being put into the position of having what would be in insurance terms, a horrific amount of unwanted business imposed on them at some future time.  It is a very valid point to make and I have reason to know that the Irish Life Assurance Company themselves take that point and certainly do not want to be put in the position of being potential takers-over of some company that might fail in the future.</P>
    <P>One has to bear in mind that motor insurance has not been popular with insurers generally, with one exception. We have the unfortunate, unbalanced situation here that between 50 and 60 per cent of the motor insurance risk is carried by one company.  If the Irish Life Assurance Company found themselves in the position in a couple of years that they were under public pressure and perhaps Government pressure to assume a large part, of perhaps all, of the motor insurance risk here then inevitably the company as a whole would find their interests prejudiced and their policy holders, who had taken out policies in good faith on the basis that it was a life company only, or on the basis that it was a life company that was taking a majority interest in a prudently run and well run and profitable general company like the Church and General, would have every reason to feel aggrieved at the change in the company situation, a change which they could not <Col N="2060" /> have foreseen when they took out their policies.  Therefore, paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of section 1 should be amended.  It is not easy to amend it as it stands.  It should be reworded to allow the takeover on the basis that we have discussed the Church and General, to allow the company to promote subsidiaries or to acquire subsidiaries abroad in an unlimited way and to allow them to promote subsidiaries on the life side in Ireland in an unlimited way but to confine their non-life activities in Ireland to things that were authorised by legislation or, if the Minister wished, by ministerial order.  Preferably it would be by legislation. I have tried to draft an amendment to the section as it stands and some of the paragraphs in subsection (2) would have to be removed and redrafted.  I understood that this exercise was being carried out and I do not know whether the Minister intends to put down an amendment. I can only presume that he does not; otherwise he would have mentioned it already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will skip the other matters to which I want to refer but I wish to raise the matter of motor insurance which is central to this Bill, as was <Col N="2061" /> mentioned in the Seanad.  I have many times made certain suggestions in regard to the high cost of motor insurance but my suggestions were not fully listened to, although to some extent they were.  The high cost of claims results in very high premiums.  The cost of claims is due to a number of things, one being the legal system and the extraordinary equanimity with which insurance companies who finance most of the actions in the High Court allow this system to continue, although they must know that it is financially crazy.  The great majority of cases are not settled until they literally reach the doorstep of the court.  Once they have their briefs in their hands they will talk settlement in the round hall of the Four Courts.</P>
      <P>Dozens of routine motor accident cases are dealt with every day.  There is no law involved and it is usually just a question of assessing damages.  It is the kind of work which in 95 per cent of cases could be carried out by a clerk of reasonable experience and moderate competence, as would be the case in any other country. Instead of that, no less than eight lawyers have to be engaged, two senior counsel, one junior counsel and one solicitor on each side to settle the case in the round hall of the Four Courts a few minutes before the case is due to be heard.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder that we find such difficulties in the area of motor insurance today in the face of that kind of situation. I thought that we might be able to deal with that situation by legislation but apparently it is very difficult to do so. The insurance companies who pay these heavy costs could put a stop to it but they seem to have had it impressed upon them that this system is in some way sacrosanct and that they cannot intervene in it.  If cases were settled at an early stage and if this unnecessary panoply of lawyers were done away with there would undoubtedly be a substantial saving in the expenses incurred by motor insurers which in the last resort are carried by drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were several other aspects with which I wanted to deal but in view of the statement by the Minister that he wishes to reply and that we will have a Committee <Col N="2062" /> Stage I will be glad to give way to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I completely accept the points made by the Deputy in regard to the unattractive nature of motor insurance and completely share his point of view, which I have often expressed myself, in regard to the State having its arm twisted by political or public pressure into taking over something which is bound to cause it heavy loss.</P>
      <P>I see the force of what the Deputy was saying regarding the form of subsection (2) of section 1 but I think he was a little graceless to fault me for the shape of the speech with which I introduced Second Stage.  I thought it only right to let him make his case, even though I had an inkling what that case was.  I did not hear his speech here yesterday but I inquired whether he had adverted to the Insurance Bill and on learning that he did so I at once got a copy of his speech.  Although by that time it was after office hours, I had the officials advising me contacted at their homes and I met them very early this morning in order to consider and make sure I had not misunderstood the substance of his point, which he did not outline yesterday in the same detail as today.  I have a suggestion in the form of an amendment which I will circulate now, if the House will permit, and which should cover the point the Deputy raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Deputy O'Malley's last point, I do not think the insurance companies are fully in control of the legal costs situation.  I can see the reason for his indignation about the scene in the round hall of the Four Courts but a very experienced barrister friend told me recently that his experience with certain very big companies was that they would not take their own counsel's advice to settle proffered at an early stage in the case before anyone put on a wig and gown, and that they pig-headedly go ahead and fight and end up being decreed for a sum substantially larger than that for which they might have settled originally, as well as incurring the legal costs to which the Deputy referred.  Apart <Col N="2063" /> from that side, I do not think legal costs are completely within their control because as long as the plaintiff can retain his panoply &mdash; if he is successful his costs will be assessed on the basis that he was entitled to them &mdash; the insurance companies must match that kind of team.</P>
    <P>There are other things which could be done about motor insurance and I hope the committee which is now sitting will produce some useful suggestions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The danger the Deputy adverted to is very remote.  As far as I can see there is unanimity on both sides of this House that this loss-making operation should not be taken on by the State and I cannot see any Government giving in to it.  Nonetheless, in view of the short time we have, I thought I would try to meet the Deputy's point by amending paragraph (b) of section 1 (2) by taking out most of the second line so that the paragraph would read as follows:</P>
      <P>The promotion or acquisition by the permanent company of a company formed and registered in the State, or a company or companies formed and registered outside the State;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems to accommodate the points <Col N="2064" /> on which there is no issue between us because it will permit the company to form or hire subsidiaries abroad but will confine it within the State to the actual single acquisition which is now taking place.  If the Deputy can suggest an improvement to that on his feet, I will try to meet him; but it seems that that formulation would effectively deal with the points he raised.  No change is necessary in paragraphs (a) or (c) because they do not bear on that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point the Minister is trying to make, but the draft is not one of the most elegant I have seen. The draughtsman is trying to distinguish between the Church and General and other activities by simply putting the reference to a company in the State as &ldquo;a company&rdquo; and to those outside the State as &ldquo;companies&rdquo;. In other words. the phrase &ldquo;a company formed and registered in the State&rdquo; should be construed as referring only to the Church and General. I do not think a court would interpret it that way.  If that meaning is sought to be put on it the words &ldquo;one company&rdquo; should be used rather than &ldquo;a company&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the two parts of my suggested interpolation are distinguished by the fact that in the first part it simply refers to a company in the singular but in the second part it goes out of its way to give the singular form and, alternatively, the plural form, that makes it absolutely clear that a single company and only a single company is in comtemplation in the first part of the phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about this legislation; but if one read in an Act the following phrase &ldquo;Fóir Teoranta shall be entitled to take over a company.&rdquo; one would construe that as meaning that Fóir Teoranta shall be entitled to take over whatever company or companies they see fit.  If one were trying to make that provision it would not be drafted as follows: &ldquo;Fóir Teoranta shall be entitled to take over companies in the State.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Deputy's point, but what I am trying to say is that <Col N="2065" /> since the companies outside the State are expressed in the singular and plural and since the element inside the State is expressed in the singular only, there is not any room for misunderstanding.  I am told that is the specific view also of the draughtsman.</P>

      <P>If it is, I am prepared to accept it.  My difficulty is that when the High Court or Supreme Court come to construe this they are not supposed to take these debates into account.  They will have to interpret the legislation as it is in the statute.  The Minister and I are <i>ad idem.</i> He recognised what I said and tried to meet it in the public interest.  It is not very elegantly drafted.  One has to twist it somewhat to get the meaning intended out of it.  One possible variant on it which would make the matter clear would be to remove the words &ldquo;a company formed and registerd in the State&rdquo; out of the substituted words and put in &ldquo;the Church and General Insurance Company Limited or a company or companies formed and registered outside the State&rdquo;.</P>

Is the liability regarded as cumulative?  It must be, because it could not increase at that rate so rapidly in three years if it is not.

      <P>It rises and falls like a balance. It is like a tide coming in gradually. The £68.1 million refers to the level of the Minister's exposure at the end of 1980, but by 30 June 1981 the figure was already £58 million.  That is not cumulative because according as debts are paid the risk correspondingly falls.

      <P>It does not specifically say the EIB but that is what is primarily contemplated.  The reason is that doubts arose as to whether the specific terminology in the 1978 Act would allow licensed banks to guarantee loans from the European Investment Bank.  The formulation in 1978 referred to the sole obligation of the person under the contract whereas in the case of EIB loans the person borrowing the money is not only required to repay the loan but also may be subject to further conditions such as completing the project on time.  That will still be the primary obligation, but it is not necessarily the sole obligation in terms of the EIB system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The objectives of this Bill represent a radical change in housing policy.  Under the Bill, I intend to introduce a pilot scheme which will provide an option to purchase to many people who simply cannot obtain adquate mortgages at present.</P>
      <P>The Bill will provide the statutory framework under which a company, to be known as the Housing Finance Agency, will operate.  The company will be established soon after the Bill becomes law.  I would welcome the support of Deputies on all sides of the House for this Bill.  I think that it is imperative that the Bill should be enacted in the current session.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the agency is to raise additional finance for housing mortgages on a self-financing basis.  In its first year of operation, it is intended that the agency will raise some £25 million to £50 million for these mortgages.  This money will be obtained mainly by selling State-guaranteed bonds, linked to the rate of inflation and having a small real rate of return, to the operators of pension funds and life offices.  A first-time purchaser of a new or an existing house, with an annual gross income of up to £9,000 in the previous tax year may obtain an ordinary loan of up to £22,500 and up to £27,000 in special cases.  The amount of the loan in any case may not exceed three times the borrower's annual gross income in the previous tax year and 90 per cent of the net value of the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The borrower will be charged an index-linked mortgage rate, taking into account the real rate of return to the bondholder and administrative costs.  To ensure that a borrower will not be required to make excessive repayments in any year, actual loan repayments under the new scheme may be made on a pay-related basis.  Where a person borrows three times his gross income in the previous tax year, he may repay the loan over a period of about 25 years on the basis of 18 per cent of the gross income <Col N="2069" /> in the previous tax year, which would be equivalent to about 15 per cent to 16 per cent of current earnings, based on recent experience.  Where a person borrows less than three times his income, the proportion of pay taken in repayments may be less.  It is intended that individual loan applications will be processed by local authorities who have successfully operated the traditional house purchase loan scheme for more than 80 years.</P>
    <P>A scheme providing for tapping institutional funds in order to give loan assistance to first-time purchasers was first mooted in a policy document published by Fine Gael in October 1980.  An outline of the proposals was also contained in the party's policy document of last May and in the Programme for Government 1981-1986, announced on 28 June 1981. The proposals in these policy documents were based on the premise that there is a need to provide a new source of finance. I am satisfied that the existing sources of mortgage finance are not able to cope with the extra demand for loans.  Furthermore, if a person with an annual income of £9,000 borrows £22,500 over the typical 20-year period from a building society in respect of the purchase of an existing house, his gross repayments in the first year, at current interest rates, would amount to £3,846, representing 43 per cent of his income.  This is patently unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>As regards raising money for the new scheme, the Government have decided to adopt a radical approach by providing in the Bill that the new agency may issue index-linked bonds having a real rate of return of such amount as may be approved by the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  Initially, it is intended to issue the bonds to pension funds and life offices only.  The issue will be on an auction or tender basis as regards the amount of the real rate of return.  The manner of repayment of both principal and interest will be decided by the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  It is proposed to make provision for a market in the bonds, but for the time being, this will be limited to the pension funds and life offices.  It is entirely appropriate that the agency should be funded mainly by these <Col N="2070" /> sources; the terms of the bond issue will safeguard the investments made, mainly by small savers, in these institutions.</P>
    <P>Under section 5 of the Bill, the agency will be empowered to make loans to individual borrowers.  It is proposed, however, that within the foreseeable future, local authorities may operate the loan scheme either on the same broad basis as they obtain money from the Local Loans Fund or alternatively, they may act as agents.  There would be no point in arranging for the agency to set up a local branch network when 41 local authorities already efficiently administer house purchase loan schemes throughout the country.  In general, the new scheme is aimed at helping mainly the marginal house purchasers, or in other words, first-time purchasers earning up to £9,000.  This new limit relates to the gross income of the borrower, excluding the spouse's income, in the tax year preceding the date of application.  Many of these people find it difficult to obtain loans from other lending agencies.  Persons qualifying under the existing local authority loan scheme will be allowed the option of repaying their loans in accordance with the proposed terms.  It is envisaged that, at full operation, this new scheme will replace the local authority loan scheme.  Under the new scheme, the maximum loans available from public funds will be increased very substantially. In ordinary cases, the agency scheme will enable loans of up to £22,500 to be made, compared with £14,000 under the existing scheme.  Special categories of borrowers, such as a tenant of a local authority house surrendering the tenancy of his house and buying a private house, may now qualify for a loan of up to £27,000, compared with £18,000 under the existing SDA scheme.  In the case of houses on certain islands off the west coast, the maximum loan is also being increased to £27,000.  In the case of a loan for the acquisition of a house, the new limits will apply where the contract is not made before today.  In the case of a loan for the construction of a house, the new limits will apply where the foundations were not completed before today.  The new limits will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2071" /> I think that the development of housing co-operatives should also be assisted. In an effort to promote activity by these voluntary bodies, the Government have decided that, where a bona fide housing co-operative builds houses on sites provided either by housing authorities or by the co-operatives directly, members of the co-operative who have annual incomes of up to £9,000 or are local authority tenants can qualify for loans of up to £27,000 under the new scheme, provided that at least 80 per cent of the new householders are otherwise eligible for house purchase loans under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Loans under the scheme will not distinguish between new and existing houses. Furthermore, loans will not be confined to married persons and persons about to marry.  One other important development is that a loan applicant will not, as in the case of SDA loans, be required to prove that he cannot obtain a house purchase loan from commercial agencies. While the loan will normally be restricted to first-time purchasers, loans will also be available where a home-owner wishes to buy a bigger house because his existing house is unfit or overcrowded.  Loans will be made where a home-owner is obliged to obtain alternative employment in another area and wishes to buy a house there.  In particular, a key industrial worker moving into an area will be facilitated.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, actual loan repayments under the new scheme may be made on a pay-related basis.  Where a person borrows three times his gross income in the previous tax year, he may repay the loan over a period of about 25 years on the basis of 18 per cent of the gross income of the principal earner in the previous year.  This proportion may be reduced to 16 per cent, 14 per cent and 12 per cent where the amount borrowed represents 2½, 2 and 1½ times, respectively, of the borrower's gross income in the tax year prior to his application. The pay-related approach to loan repayments will usually result in the amount of the principal outstanding increasing in nominal terms in the early <Col N="2072" /> years but in case there may be any misunderstanding, it must be emphasised that the amount of the principal outstanding under the proposed system normally declines in real terms when inflation is taken into account.</P>
    <P>The essential feature of the new scheme is the way in which the real burden of loan repayments will be spread evenly over the duration of the loan.  This feature will give access to home ownership to many for whom the extremely high repayments burden in the first few years of a conventional annuity mortgage is an effective deterrent.</P>
    <P>In addition, the scheme will protect the borrower against the short-term effects of a loss of income due, for example, to sickness or unemployment, in that repayments required in any particular year may be restricted to the proportions of income to which I have referred, with the shortfall being made good in later years by the lengthening of the repayment period, if necessary.</P>
    <P>The total repayments will be calculated to ensure that the agency are self-financing, taking one year with another.  Thus, they will be based on the agency's total costs, including the cost of servicing the index-linked debt.  It is not possible to say for certain whether borrowing will in the long run prove to have been more or less expensive than borrowing on a conventional annuity mortgage.  That will depend on the evolution of inflation and mortgage interest rates in the decades to come.  In Ireland, mortgage rates exceeded inflation rates for part of the sixties, while the reverse situation has obtained for most of the seventies.  The upward trend in interest rates in the last year or so has resulted in the mortgage rate exceeding the inflation rate in many countries.  In Ireland, while inflation rates generally are relatively high at present and may remain so for another year or two, the Government are determined to curb inflation rates in the next few years.</P>
    <P>During the period 1973 to 1980, increases in average annual industrial earnings exceeded the rates of inflation by 3 per cent.  While increases in earnings are likely to be less than the inflation rate during the next year or so, earnings are <Col N="2073" /> likely to grow in real terms in the long run.</P>
    <P>In any event, of course, repayments will cease when the total amount required to cover the agency's costs have been repaid, even if this is long before the originally envisaged maturity date. Where a person qualifies for the mortgage subsidy of £3,000, it is intended that the borrower will transfer the subsidy payments to the lender, thereby reducing the amount of the loan outstanding and shortening the repayment period.</P>
    <P>In order to cut red tape, this scheme generally disregards the income of a spouse.  Borrowers will be free to make repayments over and above the specified proportions of income at any time if they so desire.  This will reduce the capital debt outstanding at that time and shorten the repayment period.</P>
    <P>Under section 6 of the Bill, the Minister will be empowered to issue formal general policy directives to the agency, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The agency will, of course, be primarily responsible for formulating policies, but it may be necessary for the Minister from time to time to issue directives which relate to social and economic aspects of the agency's work.  Under section 14 of the Bill, the agency will be required to meet their costs from their operations, taking one year with another.</P>
    <P>As regards the detailed provisions of the Bill, I should like to refer Deputies to the Explanatory Memorandum which I have circulated and add a few brief comments at this stage.</P>
    <P>A substantial part of the Bill relates to technical provisions which apply to most State-sponsored companies.  Section 2 provides for the formation and registration of the company.  Under section 3, the share capital will be £100 and this capital cannot be increased or reduced without the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Section 4 refers to the memorandum and articles of association and sets out key objectives of the company.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to section 5 in some detail.  Subsections (3) to (8) are very technical and are based on the corresponding provisions of section 39 of the <Col N="2074" /> Housing Act, 1966 relating to the existing local authority loans scheme.</P>
    <P>I have already referred also to section 6.  Sections 7 to 9 are fairly standard provisions relating to the taking up of shares by the Minister for Finance, his rights as a shareholder and the disposal of any dividend and so on arising from such shares.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance occupies a central role relating to the capital and shares of the company.  I have in mind that the board of directors would be drawn from persons with relevant experience in the commercial and public service.</P>
    <P>Section 10 enables the agency to borrow money up to a limit of £200 million; in the first year, borrowing may be of the order of £25 million to £50 million.  In particular, the agency may issue bonds. Section 11, which is a standard provision, empowers the Minister for Finance to guarantee borrowings; this would enable the agency to issue State-guaranteed bonds.  By virtue of section 10, guarantees will also be limited to £200 million.</P>
    <P>Sections 12, 13, 15, 17 and 18 are standard provisions.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to section 14 which requires the agency to be self-financing. Under section 16, any transfers of bonds, debentures and other securities issued by the agency will be exempt from stamp duty in the same way as transfers of certain loan stocks.  Before I conclude, I should say that I expect that applications for loans under the new scheme will be accepted within about six weeks.  The first bond issue will be made within about three months.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now had the benefit of the Minister's speech outlining what the Government have in mind for this agency.  The Bill as presented to the House yesterday was described as a skeleton Bill and did not in any way clarify how the Government envisaged the agency operating.  In his speech the Minister said that the essential feature of the scheme is the way in which the real burden of loan repayments will be spread evenly for the duration of the loan and <Col N="2075" /> that this feature would give access to home ownership to many for whom the extremely high repayments burden in the first few years of a conventional annuity mortgage is an effective deterrent.</P>
      <P>I question the approach of the Government to the matter of alleviating the burden of repayments in the first few years. We considered that the way to tackle that basic problem was to introduce a mortgage subsidy scheme and we did that in April of last year.  That is a far more effective and efficient way of tackling this essential feature of the problem of home ownership.  I fear that this agency represents no more than the setting up of one more semi-State structure for which there is no need.  What the Minister has said today confirmed this view.  The agency, if I understand the Minister correctly, are to be used as the vehicle for the raising of funds but the operational work is to be done by the existing SDA loans staffs in the offices of the 41 local authorities throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the purpose of the agency if their function is merely to raise money from the private sector while continuing to use the existing structure to administer the loans?  Surely the type of loan the Minister is talking of could be decided on by way of regulations from the Minister. It is not necessary for the purpose of raising funds by way of bonds to set up this new agency.  Already there is in the Office of Public Works legislation providing for the State to raise money in the manner envisaged in this Bill.  What the construction industry require at this time is not a new agency but finance.  We were told yesterday by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach that the agency is required urgently to meet a desperate social need and that this measure will enable the Government to establish an agency who will ultimately channel private funds into housing.  We were told that there is a serious shortage of funds for housing and that this measure is designed to provide the necessary injection of resources to alleviate the problem.  This morning we hear from the Minister that in the first year borrowing will be of the order of from £25 million <Col N="2076" /> to £50 million.  This would provide funds for about 2,500 loans.  There is a far more fundamental funding required, not only of the order of £25 million which is envisaged by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The money that is necessary to solve the problems of the construction industry can be got without the necessity of setting up an expensive housing finance agency. Great play has been made by the Minister of the percentage of income to be repaid and he makes a virtue of this repayment over the lifetime of the loan.  I should like to quote from an article of 27 September in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> which looked at this agency in the light of announcements which had been made by the then Minister of State at the Department of the Environment.  It nails the lie with regard to the virtues that the Minister purports to see in the agency&mdash;</P>
    <P>It is a great wonder that Margaret Thatcher did not come up with the idea of a housing finance agency on the lines now being proposed by the Government. But perhaps it is even too right-wing conservative and anti-welfare state even for her.  The proposed scheme clearly aims at shifting the burden of housing the less-well-off away from the State and onto the shoulders of the less-well-off themselves.  And it does so in a slick way which gives an initial impression that the scheme is devised for the benefit of the poor.  It isn't and could not possibly claim to be.</P>
    <P>It will impose on them far more onerous terms for borrowing money than are available to the better off neighbours.  It will saddle them with a mounting debt which will eat up at least 17½ per cent of their gross incomes for 25 years to come.  Even in year 25, they will be paying 17½ per cent of their incomes.  Those lucky enough to get building society finance, on the other hand, will find their repayments taking a progressively smaller portion of their income.  Even assuming a 10 per cent rate of inflation, and say a 12 per cent rate of pay increase, the impact of building society repayments rapidly diminishes with the years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2077" /> The carrot in the new scheme is that people, who could not afford the high repayments in the initial years of a building society mortgage, will be lent money under the proposed scheme. The repayments will be pegged at between 17½ and 20 per cent of income &mdash; so they will be relatively low at first, so low, in fact, that they will not be enough to meet the interest charges on the borrowed money and the amount outstanding on the loan wil be steadily increasing.  In the example alongside it will continue to increase for no less than 17 years.</P>
    <P>The figures are staggering &mdash; not only because of the light they throw on the actual implications of the proposed scheme but also as an indication of where inflation is leading.</P>
    <P>For instance, the man who borrowed £20,000 under the scheme now would pay back no less than £140,000 over the 25 years.  In year 24 his repayments would be a massive £14,479 &mdash; or £278 a week.  And that would be 17½ per cent of his weekly income.</P>
    <P>The following example assumes that a man borrows £20,000 under the proposed scheme.  At the start he has an income of £5,700 a year and that income goes up slightly faster than inflation &mdash; 2 per cent a year faster.  It is further assumed that inflation continues at 20 per cent a year for the next two years and then settles down to 10 per cent a year.  The interest rate on the loan is assumed to be 2 per cent above the rate of inflation.  Repayments are fixed at 17½ per cent of the borrower's income.  These last two figures are in line with the Fine Gael policy document of a year ago.</P>

    <P>So, calculating on fairly conservative figures, assuming an interest rate of only 10 per cent after the first two years, on a £20,000 loan under the scheme suggested by the Government, with minor alterations in the Minister's speech today, the borrower will be repaying about £140,000.  That is not a saving to the construction industry or the type of scheme that will attract support from potential home purchasers.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael policy document suggested that a capital requirement of between £160 million and £200 million would be required to finance 8,000 mortgages a year.  If we are talking about that type of money we are talking about making substantial inroads into the funds of building societies and other agencies, particularly when one considers that the total amount raised this year on mortgages was £300 million.  That will show the dramatic effect this housing agency <Col N="2079" /> will have on the overall fixed pool of savings.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that this scheme has not been well thought out in regard to its effect on the construction industry, on existing mortgage finance available in the market place, on the building society movement in general, on the pool of savings and in regard to the Bill's destabilising effect on the whole housing market.</P>
    <P>Of course I welcome additional funds for the construction industry but I question whether this is the way to go about it.  I wonder if the Minister has thought about the full implications of what he is proposing, not so much in regard to the nature of the new agency but in regard to the total effect of the Bill which the article described as being too right-wing even for Margaret Thatcher.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the Bill I should stress that it is an important initiative in providing additional funds in the housing area.  For many years there has been a need to provide funds for young people and others who have been seeking to own their own houses but who have found themselves falling between two stools, those with incomes which would enable them to qualify to purchase from local authorities and those with incomes which would enable them to obtain loans of sufficient amounts from building societies In so far as the establishment of this agency will make available funds for people who want to own their homes it is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>During a debate on a Bill like this one should look at the many problems that exist now in the area of house acquisition. I have no doubt that this Bill, though it will make a substantial contribution in the housing area, may leave the need for the House in the not too distant future to look at areas concerned in housing and to ensure that in the long-term a fully co-ordinated approach will be made to housing finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years the building societies have made a very important contribution to Irish society.  However, with the growth of building societies and of the <Col N="2080" /> finances available to them, these societies effectively have enjoyed a monoply position. The manner in which the building societies are operated today gives cause for some concern, and something should be done in this area to look into some of the existing practices in the operations of building societies.</P>
    <P>If we can do this at a later stage we may ease the burden that many young couples, particularly, have when they seek to purchase accommodation.  Many of those who come within the ambit of qualifying for loans and mortgages from building societies find they have difficulties with these societies.  It may not be intended that the proposed housing agency should perform this function, but I should like to see a greater degree of competition built up with the building societies than exists at the moment.  The building societies compete for funds by way of deposits and effectively, in theory at least, they compete to provide loans for the general public.  We all know that the problem is that there are not sufficient funds in the building societies to enable them to meet all loan applications. We have had the position during the years that the amount that an applicant kept on deposit with a building society prior to being regarded eligible for a loan has been gradually increased.  It has gone up in some societies from £500 to as much as £3,000, though there was a time many years ago when it was not necessary to have funds on deposit for any length of time to qualify for a loan.  Although in theory the societies are competing for customers, in practice the same interest rates are payable to depositors as by those obtaining loans and the lack of competition between the societies has resulted in the services they offer to the public not being as efficient as they should be or could be.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the element of competition being introduced in the future.  There are one or two examples which illustrate the steps the societies could take to provide a more efficient service and in so doing enable young couples facing the difficulties and the financial traumas we are all facing at this <Col N="2081" /> time to have real savings when purchasing houses.</P>
    <P>I want to illustrate one or two areas in this respect.  If a building society is to grant a loan for the purchase of a house they will always, as they must do, ensure that the house for which the loan is intended is structurally sound and will provide the society with the degree of security necessary.  As a result, the societies, prior to granting loans, will arrange for their own architect or surveyor to go out to examine the house, report back on it and advise the society whether the house will provide proper security.</P>
    <P>At present any sensible house buyer, prior to purchasing a house, will have the house surveyed by a surveyor or architect and get a report back to confirm that the house is sound.  We have here a duplication in that none of the societies will make the surveyor's or architects's report on a house available to the applicant for a loan.  Yet all the societies require applicants for such loans to pay the fees the societies must pay to the architect for making the report for their own purposes. In other words, the applicant for the loan pays the fee of an architect or surveyor to check the house concerned, without having any right to obtain a copy of the report given to the society.</P>
    <P>If the applicant is sensible, he or she has to duplicate that expense because the applicants will want to ensure that the house on which they will commit themselves to pay a mortgage for 15 or 20 years is sound.  The usual period is 20 years.  I see absolutely no reason why there should be this financial duplication. I do not understand why applicants who pay fees to have a house surveyed should not also be entitled to obtain the report on that house.  If they had that entitlement the initial expenses incurred when a house is being purchased, not just in the area of the actual price of the house, could be reduced by something between £70 and £100, which is a substantial sum.</P>
    <P>It is even more ironic that the building societies do not make these reports available in the light of a recent court case in England in which it was held that, if a report came back suggesting that a house was structurally unsound but nevertheless <Col N="2082" /> it could still provide sufficient security for the society and subsequently a real problem arose with the house, the borrowers could hold the society responsible for not advising them of the difficulties.</P>
    <P>Building societies in Ireland have not yet come to terms with that problem.  If there was a real level of competition between the societies, they would quite happily make these reports available to their applicants for loans, who are, effectively, their customers.  That is a problem at the moment.  People applying for loans feel dependent on the goodwill of the building societies, rather than the building societies feeling they have to compete for business and customers and that they have to provide an efficient service.</P>
    <P>Another area in which there is duplication which adds to the cost of the purchase of a house is the area of legal fees. If a loan or a mortgage is being obtained, the purchaser will not only have to pay the fees of his own solicitor, but also normally the legal fees of the building society for the preparation of the mortgage. There is a need to have another look at this.  There is a need to examine seriously whether there should be a duplication of work in these areas.</P>
    <P>When applications for loans are being processed there is a different legal interest between the society and the applicant and it is necessary for both sides to ensure that their legal rights are protected.  Much of the legal work done on these applications is duplicated and, as a consequence, the people who are suffering are those seeking to obtain loans from societies. This is another area which should be looked at to see if some method could be introduced to reduce the cost of the duplication involved.</P>
    <P>A third area which would not be a problem if there were a real level of competition between building societies is the area of delays in processing loan applications and making loan cheques available. A substantial number of applicants for loans to building societies find that they have to close the sale of a house, complete the purchase, and go on bridging finance.  Delays of one, two or three months may occur before the building <Col N="2083" /> society loan cheque is made available to them.</P>
    <P>This has a number of consequences. The first is that the people buying the houses, who at this stage will have been approved for a loan, will find that the cheque is not made available to them and, for a period of time, they have to pay interest at a higher level to the banks, who have given them bridging finance. The interest payments incurred normally will be substantially greater than the payments which would have been made if the loan cheque had come through quicker.  There is a failure on the part of the building societies, and to some extent it is fair to say on the part of lawyers processing mortgages for building societies, to understand the true effects and the difficulties involved for young people when delays occur in the provision of the loan cheques.</P>
    <P>It does not require legislation to change that.  It requires a change of attitude on the part of those processing these loan applications.  If we had a degree of competition in this area, it would be dealt with quickly and come to terms with quickly.  Where we have what is effectively a monopoly situation in which the customers are dependent on the societies rather than the other way around, there is no incentive for the building societies to deal with these matters more quickly.</P>
    <P>I want to make a plea in this House to the societies to do what they can to speed up the process between the time when a loan is formally approved and the time when the loan cheque is made available. I wonder whether the societies could not play a role in the provision of bridging finance if it is still necessary.  In reality, if the societies came to terms with the problem of making the loan cheques available, we could cut out the necessity for bridging finance in the vast majority of house purchases.  In so doing, effectively we would be realising moneys the banks are using in this area for use in other areas.  This is relevant not merely in the area of house purchase, because it would have implications for our economy.  As yet it has not been tackled seriously or <Col N="2084" /> pursued by the building societies.  I hope they will look at it seriously.</P>
    <P>At present, as we all know, there is a major housing problem.  It is clearly illustrated in Dublin by the number of applicants for houses both on the Dublin Corporation list and the Dublin County Council housing list.  At present Dublin Corporation have approximately 7,000 applicants on their housing list who have been approved as housing applicants. Dublin County Council have approximately 1,800 applicants approved.  On average in recent years Dublin Corporation built 1,500 houses per year and Dublin County Council built approximately 600 houses per year.  On the rate of building it is clear that, unless there is a dramatic change in our circumstances, the number of houses being built will be much less than the number of applicants in need of housing.</P>
    <P>This problem is not merely concerned with making finance available.  It also has to do with the whole policy in the area of housing.  We need to look at this in a comprehensive fashion and see how the different finances available and the existing legislation are interacting.  I have no doubt that many of the applicants on the Dublin Corporation list and on the Dublin County Council list &mdash; as a member of Dublin County Council I deal continuously with people on the council housing list &mdash; under the terms of the legislation to be enacted to provide the Housing Finance Agency, will find themselves in a situation, when the agency becomes operative, where they will be able to raise funds to enable them to purchase accommodation.</P>
    <P>I believe we will discover that when this agency is fully operative it will result in a reduction in the housing lists applications as they obtain.  I have no doubt that the provision of funds by this agency will alleviate some of the difficulties encountered in these areas.  But we must look at the problem in a comprehensive way.  There are problems being encountered with the existing local authority loans scheme which could arise, not in the context of the Housing Finance Agency but in the way in which it intertwines with other schemes.  These problems <Col N="2085" /> should be looked at but cannot be dealt with in the context of this Bill. There are anomalies warranting serious examination, which have built up because our housing policy over the years has developed on a piecemeal basis.  For example, as matters stand at present, a housing applicant to a local authority will be awarded points which will qualify that applicant for allocation of a house on a variety of grounds.  One matter not looked at in the context of determining whether an applicant qualifies for tenancy of a local authority house &mdash; as opposed to qualifying for a loan to purchase a house &mdash; is the applicant's income; there is no income limit.  If somebody is living in unsuitable housing accommodation, in overcrowded conditions, they may have sufficient points to be allocated a local authority house regardless of their income.</P>
    <P>Under the present local authority housing scheme, if somebody has an income in excess of £7,000 such person will not qualify for a local authority loan. Under the Housing Finance Agency the income limit will be increased to £9,000. However, at present there is this anomaly that if somebody applies, say, to Dublin County Council for a loan for the purchase of a house, if they have an income of, say, £7,500, they will be turned down because their income is £500 in excess of the present limit.  A similar situation could arise under the new Bill, in that somebody could apply for a loan with an income of £9,500 instead of £9,000.  What can such an applicant then do?  If such an applicant is in Dublin County Council offices he or she can go out of one office in which they made their application for a loan and go into the office next door and apply for tenancy of a Dublin County Council house.  If they can show that their conditions are such as to warrant their being allocated a house, when an allocations meeting of the council occurs, they may very well have sufficient points to warrant their being given a house by way of tenancy, despite the fact that their income was such that they could not obtain a loan from the council to purchase a house themselves.</P>
    <P>The situation becomes even more <Col N="2086" /> ludicrous if one examines what would happen to the person who has been refused a council loan but who finds he has been allocated tenancy of a house. When that person moves into a local authority house he may then, under the purchase scheme for local authority tenants, find that he can get a loan to purchase the House in respect of which he was originally allocated tenancy, despite the fact that that applicant originally could not get a loan to purchase a house &mdash; that was not a local authority house &mdash; from the council.  The effect of this is that in some instances local authority houses are being taken up whereas if loans were available, possibly applicants would not have needed to go into local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The other problem is the provision of a more equitable, sensible and co-ordinated system to deal with this problem. If we are to have an equitable housing policy, if there are financial limits laid down determining the circumstances in which somebody may be granted either a local authority loan or a loan through the Housing Finance Agency, surely there should also be income limits on the granting of local authority housing by way of tenancy.  That is something that should be seriously examined.  It must be done on the clear understanding and in full consciousness of the necessity to plan the approach and ensure that nothing is done or measures taken to deprive people genuinely in need of housing.  But there is no logic in having financial limits for determining whether one qualifies for a local authority loan for the purchase of a house or whether one qualifies for a loan through the Housing Finance Agency &mdash; which initially will come through the local authorities &mdash; without having such limits on applicants for tenancies of local authority housing.</P>
    <P>I have not gone into the details of the Bill.  That would be more appropriate at a later stage.  I have no doubt that its implementation will be much welcomed by many young people who find themselves at present in a limbo situation unable to obtain a local authority loan but who are not in such financial circumstances as would enable them to obtain <Col N="2087" /> a building society loan.  I believe that the implementation of the provisions of this Bill will act as a stimulus to the building industry and as a catalyst for the building of more houses so badly needed.</P>
    <P>I must say something about the criticism voiced by Deputy Raphael Burke. Indeed it is a general point which is relevant to this Bill also, that throughout this Dáil session there has been criticism levied at legislation placed before the House.  It is the function of an Opposition to criticise legislation, to seek to improve it, if it can be improved.  But I would submit that it is the function of a credible Opposition, if they do not agree with measures before the House but agree that a problem exists &mdash; and I think all Members of the House would agree, no matter what their political persuasion, that there is a problem in the area of the provision of houses for our young people &mdash; to provide credible alternatives to deal with that problem if they feel the legislation before the House is not tackling it properly. Like so much which has been said about other Bills in other areas it is very easy to knock theoretical holes in legislation, easy to undertake an academic exercise and transpose it into appearing to be a valid criticism of a measure introduced. What is of more relevance is to produce the policies with which to deal with the realities of young people's problems at present.  I have not yet heard a Member opposite do that in the context of this Bill or any other.  I would draw the attention of the House to a speech by a Member opposite last week made in the context of the Rent Restrictions Bill.  On that occasion Deputy Séamus Brennan &mdash; and I think I would be correct in paraphrasing him in this way &mdash; maintained that all parties in this House over the years had not truly come to terms with the housing problem.  He recognised the existence of a major problem.  I would put it to Members opposite &mdash; as I have done on other legislation &mdash; produce the policies.  If you contend this is not the correct way in which to deal with it, then say how we are to deal with it, or are we simply to say: we wash our hands of the problem, we will not look at it and will <Col N="2088" /> not do anything about it; we will keep things running as they were before?  If their criticism is to be given any degree of credibility I would submit that they must and should produce alternative policies to this House.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Housing Finance Agency will make a major contribution to solving what is a major problem.  I believe there are other steps that should be taken to deal with the problem of housing.  I believe also that if this House fails to come to terms with this problem the young people of Ireland will lose whatever faith they retain in politicians in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Having got that lecture from the previous speaker I want to assure him that, on this side of the House, we are examining this Bill to see what it can do for the future in respect of those who may require mortgages for the provision of houses for themselves.  We are examining the Bill also in order to see what its provisions can do for the building construction industry.</P>
      <P>I cannot see what this piece of legislation will do to alleviate the problems in this area.  There is the problem of giving the construction industry the impetus it needs in order to provide employment and to take itself out of the difficult situation in which it is at present.  Above all, we must examine this legislation from the point of view of what it will do for people who require mortgages in order to provide themselves with homes.  It has always been our policy to help people to have a home of their own, to take pride in their home, to look after the maintenance of it and not to be dependent on the local authority to do this for them.  Of course, there will always be many people who will, of necessity, have to be rehoused by local authorities but as far as possible we should give every assistance to those people who require a home and are in a position to provide it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been mentioned that at present there is no income limit to qualify for a housing authority list.  I would never say that income should be the sole criterion to qualify a person for rehousing.  There are other considerations to be taken into <Col N="2089" /> account, such as their present accommodation. There are also other problems and difficulties people may have which would put them in a position of not being able to provide a house of their own, even with the assistance available.  I do not believe that being over a certain income level should debar people from being on a housing authority list.  This would be bad policy and would create tremendous hardship.  At present the managers of local authorities take the income of a person into consideration. For example, if there is somebody on a much lower income and perhaps living in similar unsuitable conditions, they would decide that the person on the higher income would be in a better position to provide themselves with a home.  However, there should not be an income limit to qualify to go on a housing list.</P>
    <P>I cannot see what this Bill will do for people who require a house of their own. I can see that this agency, when set up, will be in a position to provide extra financial aid.  That seems to be the purpose of it.  However, we must remember that it will be going into competition with other people in that field who require money from the financial institutions and that the money available for investment is limited.  Money raised by this finance agency will make money scarce for other activities.  The building societies have been doing a good job down through the years.  I realise that there are many people who find it difficult to qualify for a loan at present.  I note that the local authorities will be the people to continue to operate this scheme and I agree that they have been doing a good job.  I believe they could continue to meet the present need provided the finance was made available to them.  Finance is the difficulty.  I cannot see that in the first year of operation a sum of £25 million, or even a sum of £50 million, will do anything to relieve the situation in which we find ourselves.  I had hoped that the Bill would give the necessary stimulus to the construction industry and that it would do far more for young people who want to provide themselves with a home.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the easing of the repayments will be in the early years.  This is <Col N="2090" /> very welcome and will encourage people to borrow, but as the years go on the repayments will increase.  This is where I would take issue with this Bill.  People will be encouraged to borrow money because of the easing of the repayments in the early years.  Later they may have a family, which makes their financial situation less favourable.  The house too will begin to deteriorate and the cost of upkeep will increase.  Therefore, they are facing an increase in the cost of living, the cost of having a family and the cost of repairs to the house.</P>
    <P>This Bill runs counter to the policy of all the lending institutions in this market at present.  Up to now repayments have decreased as time has gone on.  Under this Bill repayments are increasing and increasing at a time when the borrower has extra commitments to meet.  I believe there will be difficulties and problems for the borrower.  When they examine this Bill they will find that there is nothing in it for them over and above what is provided by the lending agencies at present. Under the existing system it is only necessary to make sufficient funds available and to increase qualifying income in accordance with inflation.</P>
    <P>The new scheme provides a means of raising money but it will be very expensive for the borrower and may lead him into great trouble.  Financial institutions will not make money available without a worthwhile return and this return will have to come from the borrower because the agency will be self-financing.  The scheme may prove to be a millstone around the necks of borrowers because their commitments will increase as time goes on.  In the early years of marriage when a couple have children costs increase enormously but later they will have to pay education and other costs and at that time their repayments under this new scheme will also increase.  Under the present system repayments diminish as a proportion of income as the years pass and this is an inducement to people to borrow, but this new scheme will make it more difficult for them in later years.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that this Bill would provide some assistance for the construction industry and for those who want to own <Col N="2091" /> their own homes, but unfortunately it will not do these things.  The Bill is a disappointment to those who had hoped that their lot would be improved by it.  We may find that there will be no demand for this new scheme, as in the case of the £9.60 for housewives.  This would be disastrous because we all realise that there is a need to give some assistance to the construction industry.  Because of our growing population, the increasing standard of living, the necessity to take people off local housing lists and the desire of people to have a home of their own, we had hoped that something definite would be done.  Unfortunately this Bill will not bring relief to people who really need it and it is a great disappointment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on a very imaginative and non-legalistic approach to the Housing Finance Agency.  It is clear that he has gone out of his way to make the scheme as available as possible to a very wide number of people and there is a marked absence of narrowness in the interpretation of eligibility.  This is probably one of the most imaginative measures I have seen during my time as a public representative at local and national level.</P>
      <P>The single biggest problem with which we have to deal at our weekly advice clinics is not, as is often thought, social welfare but housing.  An enormous number of people come to us thinking that somehow we can wave a magic wand and take them out of a desperate situation in which they are forced to live with parents or parents-in-law or have to leave a flat because they have had a child.  Given the rate of growth of our population, this problem will become even graver in the future.  This Bill proposes to make more money available for housing and to enable repayments to be made on a pay-related basis.  It is something which has been needed for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Shatter, referred to housing projects in the Dublin city area.  Dublin Corporation are building between 1,500 and 1,600 houses per year, but there are about 6,000 applicants on the housing list.  I accept that some of <Col N="2092" /> those on the list should not be there but people will apply under a scheme when there is no income restriction, even though they do not need local authority housing.  Apart from those people, there is a sizeable number on the list who genuinely need houses and will not be reached.  These people are in the category covered by this Bill and will benefit greatly from it.  The new scheme will result in people coming off the local authority housing lists thereby enabling local authorities to house more worthy cases and reduce the waiting list.  Those objectives are approached very imaginatively and very courageously in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The reason there are so many people on the housing lists or seeking to borrow at a rate they can repay is that through the years there has not been a real effort to tackle the problem of housing on a realistic basis.  If the steps the Minister is taking now had been taken by the last administration, or by the previous Coalition, we might not have the present situation. Urgent steps should be taken to remedy the situation because there has not been a concerted effort to deal with the problem in a realistic way over the last decade.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the pay-related element and the sections of this Bill dealing with repayments being spread evenly over a longer period.  A Deputy mentioned yesterday that a person could be repaying £140,000 over a long period for a house, and if one looks at any mortgage repayments one will find that over a 25-year period the repayments are very substantial.  If one was to discount the repayments to be made under this scheme by the rate of inflation over a 25-year period, there would be very little difference between the mortgage figure and the repayment figure mentioned here.  I do not believe the difference would be significant and it certainly would not be as big as the Opposition allege.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that the housing agency will raise the funds required under this Bill and that local authorities will carry out the scheme.  This is a very good move because the local authorities have people who are experienced in administering <Col N="2093" /> such a scheme.  This will also enable public representatives at local level to monitor and comment on the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am very critical of the rigid approach taken by local authorities in cases where young people are buying local authority houses.  Sometimes the authority insist that minor repairs, such as gate pillars or gates, be repaired before the local authority loan is granted.  Very often this means the couple may have to stay on bridging finance for two or three months until these repairs are carried out.  These people should be allowed move into their houses and have these repairs done as they go along.  Sometimes they might even be able to carry them out themselves. The procedure being followed by the local authorities is unnecessary, does not help to reduce the numbers on our housing lists and to get as many people as possible into decent housing.  If the local authorities carry out this scheme, I hope they will not be narrow in their approach.  They should encourage people to move into their houses and then carry out the minor repairs needed.</P>
    <P>Somebody borrowing under this scheme could find that their repayment rates could be as low as 12 per cent, or as high as 17 per cent, depending on the number of times their income they are borrowing.  At present building societies are insisting that people must pay somewhere in the region of 45 per cent of their incomes.  This is totally unacceptable. This is happening in the early years when people are experiencing great difficulties. It can be argued that in later years, when there are children, families are under great financial pressure but I am talking about the initial problems of getting a place to live.  The building societies are not helping couples to get over this difficult period.  They should spread the repayments over a longer period because this would have a very beneficial effect.</P>
    <P>We have a housing crisis in Dublin which has been caused partly by people living in local authority houses who should not be.  I said this last week elsewhere and I want to put it on the record of this House.  In many cases local authority houses are made available to people who are genuinely in need, but in some <Col N="2094" /> cases they are not in need.  It must be remembered that income is not taken into consideration.  Presumably, these people have been housed because they needed it, but in a few years time a man might get promotion and his income could be much higher.  Because of the rent restriction, a person earning £20,000 a year could be living in a local authority house and his rent would be very small, possibly in single figures.  That is an absurd situation, especially when one considers the present housing crisis in Dublin.</P>
    <P>People who can afford it should be encouraged to buy their own houses and this Bill will do that.  The people most in need of houses should be allocated local authority houses.  There has been a great deal of talk about money going down the drain.  There are many couples paying £30 a week for one room.  Many people come to me looking for flats and they are prepared to pay up to £30 a week, and many of these people have very small incomes.  That is money they will never recover but under this scheme that money could easily provide these people with houses.  The houses would appreciate; they would belong to the couples and they would be spacious, not one-roomed hovels.</P>
    <P>This Bill aims to increase the total amount of funds available for housing. The biggest builder of local authority houses is Dublin Corporation.  Are we getting value for money?  If we were to take into consideration the site cost, development costs, building costs and overheads, we would find local authorities are paying more for local authority houses than the people in the private sector.  This is a crazy situation and a terrible waste of public funds.  I do not believe officials of local authorities would accept that statement but if an independent examination was carried out of this area it would be found that finance is wasted.  Local authorities in any event do not build the houses but engage companies through tender to build for them.  If they were to purchase houses already built by private builders an enormous saving could be made.  To put it another way, for the same amount of money spent <Col N="2095" /> on house building they could probably get a greater number of houses made available to them.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to pass this Bill before Christmas.  I do not like the idea of Bills being rushed through this House but when there is a breakdown in communication or a clash, such things can occur.  Nevertheless, the legislation is urgently needed.  I welcome the fact that it will be passed before Christmas although I regret that it must be passed in this manner.  If we are to delay any longer it will take about six months to implement the Bill and that will mean that fewer people will be housed.  In the area of housing finance the performance of the banks has probably been the least helpful and most selfish.  Banks who are making substantial profits have not sought to do anything to ease the problem, a problem they have contributed to in some way by bringing many people from outside regions to Dublin to work in the banks, thereby taking up private accommodation.  The banks have not in any way made a realistic contribution by way of funds to deal with this problem and the paltry sum available was as a result of pressure from the Government.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the banks in the area of bridging finance is also regrettable. Their responsibility in this regard must be seriously brought home to them.  I hope that next year the Government will be able to persuade them that it is necessary for them to take their responsibility more seriously and not always be grabbing for profits.</P>
    <P>It is proposed under the Bill to raise between £25 million and £50 million for mortgage finance.  That will be an extra amount of money for houses.  If the banks, insurance companies and building societies make the maximum amount of funds at their disposal available together with this effort by the Government a real inroad can be made on the housing crisis in Dublin city.  The exorbitant short-term rates being charged for bridging finance should be examined as a matter of urgency and I hope the Minister when he meets the banks, as he does from time to <Col N="2096" /> time, will take this matter up with them. He should ask the banks to adopt a more serious community-orientated approach to the problem of housing.</P>
    <P>For the first time ever institutional funds not otherwise available will be tapped for housing.  That is a welcome innovation which should have widespread implications for the future funding of similar projects.  The alternative to creating more funds for housing and as a result more housing, is costly.  We know from our work as public representatives the amount of overcrowding that exists in many houses.  We are aware of the problems that have been created by vandalism because some parents are not able to cope, with the result that children get out of parental control.  We are aware of the problem of marital breakdowns which is enormous in the city and is probably unprecedented in any previous decade. We are aware of the damage to health that overcrowding causes with people taking valium like smarties.  It is a common thing to be told by people on the housing list that they are taking valium daily.  That is one of the costs we must bear for not providing proper housing accommodation and it will continue unless the right approach is adopted.  The provisions of the Bill represent such a move.  I welcome the fact that finance will be made available to single people whether they are about to get married or not.  There are many settled people anxious to buy their own homes and that good aim should be recognised.  It is expected that in this area there will be sufficient funds available to encourage those people to participate in the scheme. The Minister, in the course of his speech, said that persons qualifying under existing local authority schemes will be given the option of repaying their loans in accordance with the proposed terms of the new scheme.  That is another of the innovations which the Minister has written into the Bill.  He has approached this matter from a very wide angle.  I welcome the fact that limitations have been kept to a minimum and that people in existing local authority schemes will be able to avail of the new scheme if they wish.</P>
    <P>Under the new scheme the maximum <Col N="2097" /> amount available is being increased from £14,000 to £22,500 and for those in the special category from £18,000 to £27,000. That is a realistic move.  The old figures were not realistic or sufficient to enable a person to purchase a house anywhere. The new figures will give people a real opportunity to purchase their own homes.  I welcome the fact that the scheme is available to co-operatives. Again, that is indicative of how determined the Government are to make the terms of the scheme widely available. The fact that the new scheme disregards the income of the spouse is also welcome particularly in view of the fact that most of the people in the category we are speaking of probably have two incomes up to the date of marriage, but, thereafter, would have only one income. Working on the basis of one year in arrears that could have an effect on the amount of funds to be made available.</P>
    <P>Another important development in the scheme is that a loan applicant, as in the case of SDA loans, will not be required to prove that he cannot obtain a house purchase loan elsewhere.  That is another indication of the unusually wide approach being taken by the Minister. Previous contributors to this debate have not mentioned the fact that the scheme will protect the borrower against the short-term effects of loss of income due, for example, to sickness.  Somebody has put a lot of thought into the provisions of the Bill because many of the innovations were never thought of before.  They are now being brought forward together but can be reviewed as we go along.</P>
    <P>The innovations are very welcome and in this particular case very thoughtful.  I hope that the scheme will be operative within six months.  I understand the Minister's intention is that the agency would commence raising funds within three months and that first applications could be taken within six months.  The earlier the agency get under way the better.  In common with other semi-State bodies, they should be subject to the usual examination by the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies so as to ensure that the funds involved are reaching the <Col N="2098" /> people the Government intend them to reach.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fahey referred to the problem of couples later on in married life having greater commitments than is the case in the early years.  The problem is, though, that couples need help to provide a house in the first place and that is why we must help them at that stage.  The objection to their contribution being by way of a portion of income is unrealistic.  The reverse is the case.  Deputy Fahey has referred to a millstone being put around the necks of young couples by way of this means of repayment.  That is not true.  What we are doing is providing a cure for the ills which a young couple face in trying to set up home.  We were told that this approach would not be possible having regard to the various restrictions that apply but we have been able to go ahead with the legislation.  Deputy Fahey expressed disappointment with what we are doing.  If I were in Fianna Fáil I, too, would be disappointed because that party did not have either the courage or the foresight to introduce a similar Bill a short while ago while in office.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil remind me somewhat of the late Admiral Doenitz who in the closing days of the German regime assumed Government and proceeded to govern an area of about the size of Bray, appointing various Ministers, including a minister of religion.  In their latter days in office Fianna Fáil behaved in a similar fashion. They had lost all sense of reality and should have been able to take their defeat with some semblance of integrity.  They have persisted in being obstructive and in failing to put forward any reasonable argument against any of the legislation that we have brought before the House. Privately some members of that Party have admitted that this Bill is very good.</P>
    <P>We hear concern being expressed here from time to time about the building industry.  Surely this is not to be taken as serious concern when at the same time these people say that a Bill to make available between £25 million and £30 million of additional funds will curtail activity in this sector.  This legislation will provide a lift for the building industry and will help that industry not only to tackle the <Col N="2099" /> problem of housing but also to provide more employment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope that within a short time it will bear fruit in terms of the moneys that will be available to those many people who are in need of housing finance.</P>

      <P>I can assure both Deputies Mitchell and Shatter that regardless of whether people say in private that this Bill is good, I consider the idea behind it to be good.  However, there are certain aspects of it that I will have difficulty in accepting.  Consequently, if we are allowed to table amendments to it we shall do so.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter does not believe that during his time in the House we have done anything constructive.  I can assure him that we asked for this Bill to be held over in order to give us time to table amendments to some of the more serious aspects of it.  It was on those grounds that we opposed the rushing through not only of this Bill but of other pieces of legislation before the House this week.  As an Opposition we have not only a right but a duty to table amendments when we consider them to be necessary.  It is our duty to be constructive and helpful in our opposition and to endeavour to improve the various pieces of legislation coming before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing problem is serious throughout the country but particularly so in our cities.  This problem is the cause of many people, women in particular, having to seek psychiatric treatment.  It contributes also to a large extent to the breakdown of marriages.  Local authority housing is not available to many young couples who find it impossible to provide homes for themselves.  In so far as this Bill will ease the burden for those young people it is welcome and one that a realistic politician would not oppose in those terms.  The problem of marital breakdown has serious implications for all of us.  It is the biggest social problem that we as politicians must face.  We can deal with it to some extent by providing homes for people because if people have proper living accommodation they have the basis <Col N="2100" /> of a good marriage and of proper family life.</P>
    <P>In the context of providing finance for housing we must have regard to the fact that in the last number of years house prices have increased enormously.  This has put the cost of a house well beyond the means of a person on an average salary.  An ordinary semi-detached house anywhere around this city is costing up to £30,000.  Neither married couples nor single people can afford the repayments that the raising of such money would involve. That is why we must look realistically at the provision of necessary legislation which will control the cost of housing to some extent.  A major input in this regard is the high cost of building land particularly around our cities.  As a member of a local authority I have been involved for some months past in rezoning land plans around the city so as to provide additional land both for industry and for housing. That is part of my function as a member of a local authority but it is my duty also as a legislator to try to ensure that those who reap large profits are taxed fairly and that they make their contribution to maintaining and ensuring that the high cost of houses is not solely the burden of the people who have to buy them.  We must bring in necessary legislation to ensure that we control the very high cost of building land which adds to the cost of houses and provide additional finance to ease the burden on people buying their own homes.  If that legislation involves constitutional change in the form of implementing the Kenny Report, that might be a more worthwhile crusade than those we have been having for the past while.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred to the number of people on the local authority housing list in Dublin.  There are 7,000 applications on the Dublin Corporation housing list and there are 1,800 applications on the Dublin County Council housing list. Last year Dublin Corporation built 1,500 houses and Dublin County Council built 600 houses.  Roughly less than one-third of the people who are currently on the local authority housing lists were able to be facilitated in the past year.  If these numbers continue to grow it will be <Col N="2101" /> beyond the reach of all of us to find a solution.  I believe many of these people could provide homes for themselves if they were encouraged to do so.  It is not just a matter of providing finance, it is also a question of providing them with the necessary incentives.  There are many people who do not believe it is their duty to provide homes for themselves.  They believe this onus should fall on the State and, irrespective of their income, they would never dream of getting the money together to provide themselves with a home.  Many of the people who come to Dublin County Council looking for houses could well afford to provide houses for themselves.  They are earning salaries far in excess of the higher salary requirement for an SDA loan at present and in excess of the £9,000 which is the maximum amount which someone can earn in order to qualify for a loan from the Housing Finance Agency.  We will have to look realistically at our whole letting scheme to ensure that those who can afford to pay for their own houses should have to buy them.  We cannot afford to subsidise people who are earning up to £20,000 per annum.  They are preventing people who earn very low incomes and the unemployed from getting local authority housing.  I support the idea put forward by Deputy Shatter and Deputy Mitchell that the matter of a means test for some local authority housing should be investigated.</P>
    <P>Some of the items in the Housing Finance Bill must be questioned.  Deputy Shatter criticised us for opposing some of the measures in the Bill.  We are not alone in criticising some of the measures.  In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 27 September Colm Rapple, in a very extensive article on the proposed Housing Finance Agency, outlined his criticism of the measures.  He particularly criticised the fact that a £20,000 mortgage over 25 years would cost the borrower something like £140,000.  Is that a realistic proposition for any Government to expect us to accept willingly?</P>
    <P>I see the need for a Housing Finance Agency and for going beyond all reasonable limits to provide housing, especially for our young people, but I cannot accept <Col N="2102" /> that the lender's money will be inflation-linked and that they will also have an increase in the real interest rate. We will fuel the rate of inflation and the borrowers, who are getting mortgages from the housing agency, will be heavily subsidising the big finance houses.  That is a disgrace.  At present it does not happen with building societies and it should not happen in this case either.  It is wrong that people trying to repay mortgages should be financing the lending institutions and big finance houses.  I hope that the money which these finance houses will provide for this housing agency will not be diverting money from other very important sectors of the economy.  I could not support the idea that the person with a mortgage should be subsidising the finance institutions, who should be helping to ease the burden on mortgage holders.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred quite extensively to the fact that many mortgage holders, whose loans are approved by building societies, have to wait for a long time before they get their cheque.  This entails having to enter into agreements with banks and other institutions to get bridging loans which can be very costly. I do not see why the building societies cannot sort out all the legal problems before the cheque is sent out.  When the loan is approved the money should be sent to the applicant immediately.  I should like the Minister and the Government to investigate the possibility of the building societies speeding up the process between approving the loan and the granting of the cheque.  I hope the Housing Finance Agency, when they are approving loans, will not have long delays between the approval notice and the person getting the money.  This is a very heavy burden, as it is very difficult for young couples to get bridging loans, especially as many of them do not have bank accounts, having invested their money in building societies.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest scandals at present is the amount of money which solicitors are making in conveyancing fees.  In many cases they run into hundreds of pounds.  You can have a solicitor doing the work for one house, the next hundred <Col N="2103" /> houses in the estate are exactly the same and yet he charges the same amount, when all that is involved is duplication of the work he has originally done.  We should investigate the possibility of cutting down costs here because these legal costs can run into sums of up to £1,000 between paying the building societies and other costs to the Housing Finance Agency, paying their own solicitor and possibly for a report by an engineer or architect.  These hidden costs are placing a severe burden on many people and solicitors' fees are disgracefully high.</P>
    <P>We should also be considering the type of houses we build.  We have the highest home ownership in Western Europe but everyone should not have to buy a three or four bedroomed semi-detached house with a front and back garden because many people cannot really afford to do this.  There should be smaller house units, especially for single people and for young married couples in the initial stages of their marriage.  These units would be cheaper to provide and would be sufficient for a young couple in the early years of marriage.  As their needs and their money increase they could move on to a bigger house.  There are apartments in Dublin but these are beyond the reach of people on normal incomes.  I do not want another Ballymun, but I think these low density, not high rise, smaller units could be provided in many housing estates. They would provide much needed housing for single people, elderly people and widows or for couples who have not families in the first years of their marriage.  It would ease the burden and provide badly needed cheaper and more convenient accommodation.</P>
    <P>Finance cannot be provided without first investigating the high cost and the type of housing units, but in overall housing policy I hope that the Government will look into the question of stamp duty on secondhand houses for first buyers. This duty places an extremely high burden on many first-time house buyers. It means that many young couples who might prefer to live closer to the city centre in Dublin, because of the convenience from the point of view of work and <Col N="2104" /> for other reasons, are put off because of the very high stamp duty on secondhand houses.  There might be a legal problem about reviewing it, but it is worth investigating.</P>
    <P>The idea of the agency is a good one. I would never criticise proposals by any Government to provide housing finance for people trying to buy homes for themselves, but I honestly do not see any great difference in the proposed scheme from the present one operated by the local authorities.  There is a difference in income requirements.  It goes from £7,000 to £9,000.  The amount of money provided goes from £14,000 to £20,000 and for the second category in the housing list the amount will go from £18,000 to £27,000.</P>
    <P>Over and above that I do not see any great novel idea in it, such as Deputy Mitchell spoke about.  It is not the great imaginative thing I thought it would be. It does not look at new methods of financing house purchase.  It is similar to the scheme in operation, the one big difference being that the scheme will be financed by private investment and not to any great extent by the Government. In these circumstances will the Government try to get off the hook in a few years' time by getting private investors to plough their money in and get paid interest? I wonder will the State contribution be increased in real terms?  Will there be an increase in the amount of money at the moment invested by local authorities?</P>
    <P>The existing local authority scheme, although restricted, is a good one.  In that respect I should like to take up Deputy Shatter on his criticism of the Fianna Fáil Government in regard to their housing policy.  We came a long way.  We increased substantially the SDA loans, we increased the income limits from £5,000 to £7,000, we increased the amount of finance available, we provided the £3,000 mortgage subsidy for first-time house buyers and the £1,000 new house grants.  They were new and imaginative schemes.  They may not have been sufficient but they went a long way to ease the burden of providing people with their <Col N="2105" /> own houses.  The mortgage subsidy scheme was worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the idea about having the mortgages related to income streams of the applicants.  That is a good thing because it is terrible to think that in the first few years of marriage couples have to try to provide houses, furnish them, try to run cars and engage in all the other expensive enterprises involved in getting homes together.  Some such couples at the moment are paying up to £400 a month in repayments.  Perhaps after 15 years, as their incomes increase, they could afford to move to much bigger houses; but in the early years of marriage it is important that these burdens should be eased.  It is important for people not only to have houses of their own but to be able to furnish them and at the same time live at a proper standard.  For instance, in many cases today some couples have to sacrifice the quality of their food: many of them eat cheap processed foods because they cannot afford proper food or clothing while they are repaying high mortgage rates.  Therefore, the idea of linking mortgage repayment with income streams is a good one.</P>
    <P>However, I am upset to think that mortgage repayments will not be linked with income streams alone but only as a percentage.  In other words, in the early years of the life of the mortgage, if the mortgage is, say, for £20,000, there is not a decided set figure of repayment.  It is a fluctuating rate of interest, changing from time to time as inflation changes, and it will be difficult for a couple to predict the kind of payments they will have to make from year to year.  It will worry people who would like to plan in advance.  For instance, if people have children they would like to provide for their education when they are 16 or 17 years of age. However, this type of mortgage repayment will inhibit them.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are not opposed to the setting up of the housing agency.  As a party throughout the years we have tried to do everything possible to ease the burden on young couples trying to buy houses.  I am particularly pleased that the Bill does not propose to discriminate against single people.  It was a disgrace <Col N="2106" /> that the £3,000 mortgage subsidy was removed from single people.  As a single person, I have to say that single people require housing.  Many of them live with elderly relatives and some of them have gone past the stage of getting married, even if they wanted to.  Suddenly they find themselves wanting to buy houses, but that is not easy on one income.  House prices these days are geared to two-income families.  Therefore we should have tried to ease the burden on second category single people.  Widows and others have been shamefully discriminated against by the Government in regard to mortgage subsidies.  I spoke of secondhand houses earlier and I should like to see the Government extending to them the mortgage subsidy and the £1,000 house grant.  We want to have a living inner city in Dublin and the extension of these schemes to secondhand houses would help to achieve that.  We must make it possible for younger people, in particular, to live in our inner cities.  The mortgage subsidy should be on the house and not on the mortgage itself.  That subsidy was a good idea but it is time to extend it to people buying secondhand houses.</P>
    <P>There will be many other matters we will be taking up on Committee Stage. We are particularly worried about the part of the Bill which provides that the mortgage holder will be financing and subsidising the lenders, particularly the big finance houses.  That position does not exist <i>vis-à-vis</i> the building societies. Many people will resent having to pay mortgage rates in excess of the inflation rate in order to make money for big finance agencies.  Banks, insurance companies and the big finance houses could be playing a far greater role in the provision of money towards housing.  The banks, particularly, are making substantial profits and we should examine the possibility of forcing them to invest substantial amounts in this housing agency or other worthwhile State investments.  I do not see anything that could be more worthwhile than providing housing for our people.  Such institutions first of all should be providing houses for their employees.  Generally, private enterprise <Col N="2107" /> could play a greater role in our housing development.</P>
    <P>By and large the idea is a good one.  It has the general support of all sides of this House.  We would not want in any way to prevent this Government or any other Government from getting on with the job of providing housing and housing finance for so many people who are on the local authority housing list and who are living in very bad circumstances.  This leads to severe psychiatric illness and a high rate of marital breakdowns particularly among young people.  This is particularly true of people on local authority housing lists who are living with in-laws and other members of their families.</P>
    <P>In many cases the husbands and wives are separated.  This places a very grave burden on them and puts great stress on their marriage.  From that point of view it is important to do everything possible to provide our young people, and people generally, with the necessary finance for housing and the incentives and education to encourage them to own their own homes and to take a pride in owning their own homes.  If others can afford to pay for their own homes they should make an input, and they should not expect the State to hand them out a house literally for nothing, as happens in many cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this very socially important Bill.  I have a particular interest in it because I was involved in it as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment when I met representatives of the association dealing with pension funds and the association dealing with life offices with a view to getting a commitment from them to finance this agency.  I was very happy with the response I got.  I am hopeful that this agency will be a big success.  It must be a big success because of the need which exists for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition felt they were not getting enough time to discuss this Bill.  As a Whip I felt we could not leave this Bill over until next year because of its importance and because of the great social need for housing.  There was no element of <Col N="2108" /> trying to push the Bill through for any reason other than to make funds available. The Opposition are aware that finance for housing, as for most other things, is a scarce commodity.  Housing is a priority for couples about to start married life.  We could let nothing prevent us from getting this Bill on the Statute Book to get this agency started immediately and get our index-linked bonds on the market and take up a source of income which heretofore was not tapped.</P>
    <P>This is a third arm of housing financing. We have the building societies who have been doing an important and first-class job.  They may have their critics, but I am not a critic of the building societies.  We also have the SDA scheme, which is limited in its operation.  There was a need to cater for the income limit between £7,000 and £9,000.  Quite a number of people were finding it hard to get building society loans and, where they could get them, the cost of financing them was beyond their means.  This agency is one of our reforming policies.  This was uppermost in our minds because we must remember that, if we are providing houses for people, they must be able to afford them.</P>
    <P>Up to now many people had to take on second jobs.  Wives had to go out to work and leave young children to help meet their repayments.  This will remove that type of pressure.  There will not be this terrible pressure of the mortgage repayments coming in on a monthly basis and, in some cases, almost outstripping the earning power of the principal earner.  If people borrow three times the amount of their income they will pay 18 per cent only, which is very reasonable.  It is generally acknowledged that 20 per cent to 25 per cent is what we should be paying. We are bringing in this scheme to ensure that it will not cost more than that.  If people borrow two-and-a-half their income the rate will be down to 16 per cent.</P>
    <P>People can base their mortgage repayments on their incomes.  This is a real contribution to family life.  Pressures on marriages because of high repayments are often the cause of running the marriage onto the rocks.  By and large, financial difficulties cause serious problems. <Col N="2109" /> As well as making money available for housing, this Bill has a great social content built into it.  It will remove the terrible pressures and strains on people. Therefore this Bill has a lot to commend it.</P>
    <P>In the first year we will be making an injection of between £25 million and £50 million.  This is a new source of revenue for the house construction and building programme.  I am glad to see that the CIF have made it a top priority that this Bill should be passed.  They see the merit in it.  I do not know whether I am telling tales out of school, but they were the first to indicate that they want to invest in it. They want to put their money where their mouth is.  To me that is a sure sign of the industry's confidence in this Government's Bill.  It will provide employment. It will develop the housing industry to a far greater extent.  It will bring it within the scope of many more people.</P>
    <P>There are people on local authority housing lists who, although they want to buy a home of their own, because repayments are too high, are debarred from so doing and instead must line up in the housing queues of local authorities whilst living in substandard accommodation or with in-laws, which places tremendous stress and strain on marriages.  This Bill opens up for such people the hope of acquiring a home of their own more quickly.  There are no restrictions, no barriers once their income is under the limit of £9,000.  That is the type of person who more and more is going on to the local authority lists.  People who genuinely want to own a home of their own will now be given that opportunity.  Judging by the number of inquiries I have been receiving from constituents the response to this Bill has been very encouraging. That was the reason I was anxious that this Bill be passed quickly, for no other reason but to make it more possible for people to acquire a home of their own as quickly as possible and give the building industry a stimulus also.</P>
    <P>I was therefore at a loss to discover the opposition there was to taking this Bill. Eventually we were forced to do something, which, as I indicated yesterday, I had not wanted to do, that was to impose <Col N="2110" /> an allocation of time motion.  We were forced to do so when we saw there was more than a reluctance to the taking of this Bill.  I could not under any circumstances see why when I had agreed that even were it not taken this week we would resume two days earlier than the agreed resumption.  I made the proposal that we resume on 20 or 21 January to take this Bill to which the response was no, a negative response.  When one makes every effort to facilitate the Opposition then, if one does not receive the minimum of co-operation, as we did not, one course only remains open.  One cannot contend that this Bill is being rushed through the House.  There are ten hours being devoted today to a Second Stage debate.  I think the Opposition will be hard put to maintain speakers for the day.</P>

      <P>The interesting thing is that we will raise substantial sums of money which, in my view, can influence a whole new area of housing finance &mdash; tapping this type of institution.  If in the future we set up some sort of national trust fund, that could be used.  There is a whole area of finance which heretofore was not used or tapped which can be injected into this industry.  It must be remembered that the construction industry is a very important one to the country as a whole.  Most of its products are manufactured here and it has a high labour content.  For that reason alone it is important that we tap and bring in all the finance we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stonewalling by the Opposition amazes me because they have always told us how concerned they were for people in need of homes and housing.  It must be said that, while they pay lip service to people's needs, when they left office the whole of the housing area, particularly the public sector, was in a shambles, totally under-financed, indeed so bad that the industry in many local authority areas was on the verge of closing down, there being no money available.  One of the first tasks we undertook in our first weeks in Government was to inject £30 million into the housing construction <Col N="2112" /> area.  Even that injection was insufficient, which will give the House an indication of just how badly the previous Government had performed in the housing area. Certainly they put housing packages together, parcelled them beautifully but forgot to finance them.  Rather they presented this beautiful package in April, saying that they would do this, that and the other, without there being any money available.  Therefore, it amazes me when I hear people talk about discrimination against single people.  What is discrimination? For example, as family living in a tenement room, because of under-financing can be condemned to those conditions for longer periods than they should. Therefore, if one takes finance from one area and puts it into the area of greatest need, surely that would be regarded as the function of any Government?  When we found ourselves with no money we had to make hard decisions.  It is not easy to make the decision of taking money from one area to give to another but we were not afraid to take such decisions. While these may have been unpopular decisions in many areas they are ones over which I can stand at all times.  In times of less financial stringency, of course, we would not cut back on A or B.  But when there is a certain sum available and one sees the great need there is within the local authority housing area &mdash; with people living literally in hovels awaiting alternative housing &mdash; then I believe, as a Government, we are charged with the responsibility of doing something about that.  In so doing it is my view that we have alleviated a great deal of the hardship which existed.</P>
    <P>We are aware of our obligations to society.  In this Bill there are no constraints being placed on single people from applying for housing finance through this agency.  The opportunity will will be available to them.  That is a clear indication that we know there is a need but where there is a greater need we had to take the action we did take.  That is something we will continue to do despite opposition.  This legislation will be seen, in the fullness of time, as being very important legislation in the housing area, <Col N="2113" /> opening up a whole new avenue of finance.  In the Bill we talk in terms of £200 million that will be provided over the years ahead.  That will make a real contribution to our housing and to society and help to meet the aspirations and ambitions of our young people.  One of the great advantages we have is that we have a young and vibrant population.  We must provide them with education, job opportunity and housing.  This Bill will give us the impetus to develop the housing area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke said this could be handled by the existing agencies.  It could not, because basically the Government fund local authorities and the building societies are an independent group.  This tapping of the institutions is something new.  We believe it was necessary to set up an agency and give it statutory authority, an agency that will have the backing and the guarantee of the Government when they are raising finance.  That is so important.  People have said that the institutions will be getting the going rate. We are in an economic world and we must face economic reality.  If we want to attract funds we must make our index-linked bonds attractive.  The insurance companies have an obligation to their investors.  If we offer index-linked bonds which do not bear comparison the companies just will not invest.  It would be meaningless to set up an agency knowing from the first day that it is not competitive, that it will not attract money.  The prime function of this agency is to attract funds from the institutions I have mentioned. I believe it will be successful in doing so.  I do not agree that it could have been done by the existing agencies.</P>
    <P>We are not setting up a whole new empire of bureaucracy.  It will be a simple company overseeing and policy making in the area of housing finance.  The actual mechanics of it will be handled by the local authorities.  It is important that local authorities are used.  I am a great believer in local authorities.  I think they are the best bastion of democracy.  The more responsibility we can give them, the better. They do a magnificent job.  We are giving them an opportunity to continue giving the kind of public service they have <Col N="2114" /> given this country for so long.  They will operate this in the humane way they have always operated things.  They have the expertise in dealing with the lending of money because they do the SDA loans. They have the staff for inspection and they have the staff for administration. Something that has bedevilled this country is the fact that if we want to start something we seem to have to start with committees upon committees spreading tentacles throughout the land.  I am delighted that this is not happening in this case.  We are not setting up a bureaucracy.  We have workmanlike, highly expertise management boards defining policy, encouraging investment in the agency so that it can lend funds to the local authorities for them to administer. It is a very simple method when one considers the great expense incurred by building societies with their shops throughout Ireland competing against each other.  The cost of organising and developing their funding is high.  This will not be expensive.</P>
    <P>An important point is that we will not be in competition for building society funds.  The building societies have played a magnificent role and it would be a useless exercise if the agency were to tap the resources already supplying the industry. That will not happen.  This Bill represents a new concept in relation to housing.  For years we were talking about mortgages and how to relate repayments to ability to pay.  That has been a topic for the past 15 years and especially during the past five or six years and all sorts of plans were put forward but Governments have not had the will to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue praised our policy and said that Fianna Fáil had been examining the matter but they did not go any further because it was a new concept and they were afraid that it might not work because of pitfalls.  We saw the merit in this idea and the legislation is before us today in order to fulfil our commitment.  While I was Minister of State at the Department of the Environment I was very proud to be associated with this scheme.  Fianna Fáil huff and puff and take one step forward and one step backward.  Deputy Reynolds said he <Col N="2115" /> still does not know what is happening but he will get all the answers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that there are no pitfalls whatever.  The agency will borrow and lend to the local authorities and people will be able to borrow three times their income up to £22,500 &mdash; and there will be higher income levels for other special cases &mdash; at 18 per cent of their income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that Deputy Reynolds sees much merit in this Bill and he fears its success in financing the expansion of the building industry.  Is that what Fianna Fáil fear?  I have spoken to them about it and all they will say is that it seems to be a good idea.  They were afraid to let the Bill into the House and I was then convinced more than ever that this legislation must be even better than I had thought because they were so strenuous in their objections.  They never gave a good reason for their objections but said they wanted more time.  We have given them time and I hope they will use it well.  We want to ensure that the Bill is debated and we will be more than amenable to any amendments which may be tabled by the Opposition.  There is no question of closed minds on this legislation. If they put down a number of amendments I will be convinced that the Opposition are taking the Bill seriously and that they want it to work.  If they do not do so it will strengthen my view that they are afraid of it.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately I had to bring in a motion on the allocation of time.  In the fullness of time we will see that this is the correct thing to do because we indicated earlier in the year that the legislation would be passed by Christmas.  I hope the agency will be set up and people will be availing of funds in the shortest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the inquiries I received regarding <Col N="2116" /> this legislation were from people on the local authority housing list who knew they had not much chance of housing for a considerable time and who saw this measure as an opportunity of getting the necessary finance at the kind of terms that would not impose great pressures on them.  That is what makes this such very important legislation.  I would ask the Opposition to examine it fully and I would welcome any amendments they might wish to table.  I look forward to hearing their views on Committee Stage on various aspects of the Bill and we will then see how interested they are in this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney welcomed the Bill but had certain reservations.  I must compliment her on her worthwhile contribution concerning the housing question.  As we debate the Bill the Opposition will see its merits.  As public representatives we are all especially concerned about housing. A great number of the problems of public representatives relate to housing and providing accommodation.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Opposition will support this Bill.  If they see any problems or if they do not understand this Bill, they should let us know and we will explain it fully.  Like any legislation we want to ensure that this Bill is clearly understood and that the reasons behind it are valid and solid.  If the Opposition contemplate putting down amendments the earlier we have them the more research we can do on them.  We want the Opposition to contribute to this Bill on Committee Stage when we will examine each section.  If we feel there is a need for an amendment we will put it down but at the moment we do not see the need.  As the debate continues if we get suggestions from the Opposition to improve this Bill, we will be only too happy to accept them.</P>
    <P>This is an excellent Bill which will have great social consequences for people in need of housing, people who want to buy their own homes and have a stake in society.  In my view this legislation will help these people.  That is why I am asking that this Bill be passed, that the agency be set up and, in the fullness of <Col N="2117" /> time, this will be seen as one of the best Bills to be passed by this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because we are serious about this Bill that we said it should not be guillotined.  Housing is an instrument of social policy and a Bill dealing with it should not be rushed through this House.  Why is this Bill being pushed through?  Is it because it was part of the Fine Gael election programme?  Is it because a commitment was given that it would be put through before Christmas? If so, that is a very poor reason for rushing it through this House.  Nobody in this House is against anything which would help lift the building and construction industry off the floor and which would try to meet the expanding needs of our young population who are trying to reach their first objective in life, that is, providing themselves with houses.  Everybody knows a house is a man's castle and it <Col N="2119" /> should be the aim of every Government to help him reach that objective.</P>
      <P>I cannot see the reason for rushing this Bill through the House.  Is it being guillotined because the Coalition have failed to deliver on so many of their election promises which were sold to the electorate earlier this year?  Despite what the Minister of State tried to convey to this House, this is a fundamental change in housing finance so far as the State is concerned.  Let there be no doubt about that.  To say that this Bill is merely setting up an agency to borrow money to help people build houses is an over-simplistic approach, the same type of marketing strategy that was invoked by this Government when they tried to sell many of their other election promises.  We all know how the public were fooled, how the stay-at-home housewives were fooled, by this expert marketing strategy.  Today they know the real score but they did not last June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same policy is being tried here today&mdash;the simple side is being sold. The Government are not pointing out the full financial implications as far as a young married couple who want to buy a house under the scheme are concerned.  That responsibility rests primarily on the Minister and on the Opposition.  We will endeavour throughout the debate to give the reasons why we were reluctant to permit this legislation to be guillotined through the House and there are good and valid reasons why.  It is our duty to <Col N="2120" /> be vigilant and constructive in Opposition. We must ensure that the public is fully aware of what is involved.  We should not have a simplistic approach of forming a company to borrow money and then give out mortgages.  We must investigate it fully and see how such a proposal affects the situation in relation to housing finance so far as the Government are concerned and what the end effect will be on the borrower.  We must be able to spell out clearly to the borrower whether he or she will be better or worse off. There is a fundamental switching in policy in this regard and I will go into it in more detail after Question Time.  That switch relates to housing and Government finance and how the borrower will fare out at the end of the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that on seeking information from his Department in September I was informed that the Minister had issued instructions to the effect that Deputies could not receive information from his Department unless they referred to the Minister's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware that Deputy Brady had specifically been given that information but that would be normal information.  I imagine when whoever it was the Deputy was speaking to referred to &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; he was referring to a previous Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reassure the Minister that I made deeper inquiries and was informed that this Minister had given those instructions.  That type of instruction shows utter contempt for Members of this House and should not be tolerated.  I hope the Minister will withdraw that instruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make it clear, as I said in my reply, that neither the Minister of State nor I issued any such instructions. However, as a practice of long standing the normal procedure is that letters or representations in any form from Deputies in their capacity as such in general are replied to from the office of the Minister of State or from the office of the Minister for Education.  That practice continued over the period in office of several previous Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>No Deputy has had such experience or difficulty since 1977 and I should like to ask the Minister if he is aware that a similar instruction was given in 1974 by the Minister at that time?  That was a matter that led to a debate here.  It is regrettable that the Minister should seek to repeat that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would find it difficult to accept the first part of the Deputy's contention because from 1977 on four different Deputies tabled Parliamentary Questions <Col N="2127" /> to the previous Minister in this regard.  The reply given by my predecessor was that the practice had obtained since before the date on which he had assumed office but that he was satisfied that it was the most appropriate practice to adopt in all the circumstances.  While the practice is being continued for the time being I am examining the situation in order to ascertain whether it is in the best interest of all concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>

Has that practice been continued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the practice was one that was followed by my predecessor and by his predecessors.  I am not sure as to how far back it goes but I am examining the whole situation now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of a final supplementary, would the Minister give an assurance that the instruction given will be withdrawn in the interest of Deputies seeking information on behalf of their constituents, a role for which we were elected solely?  It is disgraceful that a Deputy should not be permitted to obtain information in the interest of his constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained already that it is not a question of my withdrawing any instruction.  I did not give any such instruction but I am examining a practice of long standing whereby all queries or <Col N="2128" /> representations are answered from the office either of the Minister or of the Minister of State.  Regarding the question posed by Deputy Wilson, on 28 May 1980 in answer to Dáil questions, he said that the normal procedure is that letters or representations in any form from Dáil Deputies are in general replied to either by the office of the Minister or the office of the Minister of State irrespective of whether the queries were addressed to the Department or to the Minister.  In November 1980 the Deputy gave the same reply except to add that he was satisfied that the practice was the most satisfactory to adopt in all the circumstances, and he went on to say that he did not consider the rights of Deputies to be infringed by the procedure and that, therefore, he did not propose to change it.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that whereas in the past when school managers had difficulty in filling vacancies and had to visit colleges of education to ask students to accept positions when they had graduated, managers now have 60 applications for each vacancy that arises?  In the circumstances, will the Minister state what steps he is taking to provide work for unemployed graduates?</P>

      <P>We had extreme difficulty in formulating an adequate reply to the Deputy's question because he will appreciate that many people who are qualified teachers may not be teaching at present. Consequently, it is virtually impossible to assess the number of trained teachers who are not working.  From that point of view, I found it very difficult to give any quantifiable figure to the Deputy.  In any year, there is a varying number of people who have not taught for some time and who then decide to re-enter teaching.  It is very hard to establish how large that pool is and to state with any accuracy the number of qualified people who have not secured permanent employment.  There <Col N="2132" /> may very well be many people who have qualifications but who are not endeavouring to secure permanent employment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that in July the Government decided to sanction and provide funding for the employment of 300 additional national school teachers to provide additional employment opportunities for some of the graduates leaving the colleges of education and also to reduce further the pupil-teacher ratio.  People who have taken up those appointments are now working in schools.  In the period to the end of September over 100 qualified people who had not previously been teaching decided to re-enter teaching and who took up appointments in schools.  Because it is impossible to assess how large that group is, it is very difficult to put an exact figure on the number of qualified people.  In relation to graduates this year, the Government decided to employ 300 additional national school teachers to provide additional employment opportunities in relation to those graduates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the reason for the difference in the value of University grants being paid to students from Naas, County Kildare, who attend different colleges in the Dublin-Kildare area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant extract from <Col N="2135" /> the clause dealing with the value of grants in the County Kildare Higher Education Grants Scheme for 1981 reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The annual value of a full grant under this scheme shall be lecture fee, not exceeding £592, plus £400 in respect of maintenance and other expenses in the case of a candidate (i) whose normal family residence is in or adjacent to a university town, or (ii) whose course is provided in an educational institution adjacent to his normal family residence.  In other cases, the annual value of a full grant shall be lecture fee, not exceeding £592, plus £1,000 in respect of maintenance and other expenses.  In the case of the lecture fee the upper limit of £592 may be exceeded to the extent necessary to cover the total lecture fees payable in certain years of the degree courses in the medical, veterinary and dental faculties in the colleges of the National University of Ireland and in Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Kildare County Council shall decide (i) whether a candidate's normal family residence is in or adjacent to a university town, or (ii) whether the candidate's course is provided in an educational institution adjacent to his/her normal family residence, in the light of distance and local public transport services.  The lower rate of grant shall be applied in the case of every candidate who could reasonably be expected to travel daily between his home and college and in the case of every candidate whose home is within 15 miles of the college or other educational institution at which he/she is pursuing his/her course of study.</P>
      <P>It is the responsibility of the county council to determine the value of the grant in each case in accordance with the terms of the published scheme.  I have no reason to consider that the grants being awarded to individual students are not being determined by Kildare County Council with due regard to all the relevant circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputy feels that any individual case is not receiving sympathetic treatment <Col N="2136" /> perhaps he would care to take the issue up with County Kildare County Council.  Alternatively, if he furnishes me with details privately I will look into the matter on his behalf.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it extraordinary that a student from Kildare attending Belfield gets £600 more than a student attending Trinity College and that a pupil who is even nearer to Maynooth University and who finds it difficult to commute would also qualify for the higher grant?  does he not think this is open to odious comparisons?  Can he assure me that if it is interpreted by Kildare County Council, as they were quite prepared to interpret it but feared the wrath of the Department, that all students attending a Dublin university should be classified in the same bracket and get the higher rate of grant, his Department will agree with that interpretation? Does he not feel this decision can be classified as very discriminatory? Viewed by the eyes of a knight involved in the crusades, does he not think this is a crusade at which he could tilt his lance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I quoted from the Higher Education Grants Scheme adopted by the county council.  It is made clear that the county council shall decide that if the candidate's normal family residence is in or adjacent to a university town in the light of distance, because of public transport, the candidate would not qualify for the higher rate of grant.  Presumably, the local authority, in making a decision of this nature, would take into account whether a student might have to stay away from home in digs or lodgings, whereas a student attending some other institution, because of the availability of public transport, might be able to attend the institution more easily and return home each evening.  I emphasise that it is a matter for the local authority to <Col N="2137" /> make a decision.  I accept the basis of the Deputy's contention that often it can be very puzzling how a decision is taken in relation to one student as against another whether the higher or lower rate should apply.  If any Deputy has a case or cases in mind which they would like me to look into, I would be only too pleased to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>I have no information in relation to which teachers who were engaged as examiners at the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations in 1981 are members of the Tipperary Branch of the Association of Secondary Teachers.  All examiners were paid by 9 December 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that these teachers who became examiners were unfairly treated in quite an unprecedented fashion?  They were kept waiting for almost four months for payment for the duties they carried out so carefully and so diligently.  Would he not agree that this habit has not been confined to South Tipperary, or Tipperary in general, and that it is a national disease which has affected teachers all over the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it was most unfortunate that there should have been such a delay in the payment of the examiners this year.  I would hardly go so far as to describe it as a national disease.  It is fair to point out that the delay was an inevitable consequence of the industrial dispute which occurred earlier in the summer involving some clerical officers and staff officers attached to the examination branch in Athlone.  That dispute lasted for five weeks and, as a result, the entire procedure of the marking of the examination papers was delayed very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department and I were most anxious that the normal length of time should be given for the marking of the papers so that there could not in any way be any reflection on the standard of marking for the public examinations this year.  As a result of that delay, which in the case of the intermediate certificate spilled over <Col N="2143" /> into the commencement of the academic year, the payment of the examiners was delayed to a considerable extent.  I regret that very much, but I am afraid it was due to circumstances caused by the industrial dispute during the summer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree it is unfair that the teachers should be penalised for the sins of others who were on strike?  Would he give an assurance that this will never happen again?  I have no doubt that he will not get any examiners from the teaching profession next year unless such a guarantee is given.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was decided that the staff should first deal with the claims from <Col N="2145" /> superintendents of examinations because that work had been done in June.  Those payments were issued on 9 October last. It was not possible to put a greater team on payments because the Department had to concentrate on getting scripts out to examiners after the strike had ended and then afterwards on the processing of the results of the intermediate, leaving and day vocational group certificate examinations.  When those results were issued extra staff were transferred on to the matter of processing the payments for the examiners.  A certain number of staff also had to be assigned to deal with appeal applications in relation to results of the leaving certificate, so that those appeals could be processed and the results of the re-checks issued in that case without any undue delay.  Because of time scales the question of making advance preparations for next year's examinations also arose.</P>
      <P>I want to give the House an assurance that every effort was made to see that the payments were issued at the earliest possible opportunity.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to express my regret at the fact that these payments to examiners, not salary payments &mdash; it would be wrong to describe them as such &mdash; payments to examiners for work they had undertaken&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The only information I have in that regard is that in early 1980 the Galway RTC raised the question of an extension to their canteen and informed my Department that they were preparing detailed proposals of the additional accommodation which would be required over the next five years.  Since then the Department have not received these proposals from the RTC.  I have had representations made to me, both directly by the students' union and by a public representative on their behalf, as a result of which I am looking into the matter.  But no firm proposals have come from either the RTC or the VEC there in relation to the improvement of the canteen facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education when he proposes to give the Dublin Institute of Technology an expanded role in education and parity of esteem with the National Institute of Higher Education, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology are institutions conducted by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee to supply continuation and technical education in accordance with the Vocational Education Acts.</P>
      <P>The colleges have been designated under the National Council for Education Awards Act, 1979, for purposes of the grant of awards by that council and the range of courses in the colleges is fully comprehensive, embracing degree, diploma and certificate courses.  I am satisfied that the colleges have, and are generally regarded as having, a standard of attainment and excellence in their areas of speciality fully comparable with any other third level educational institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question refers to the Dublin Institute of Technology having parity of esteem with the National Institute of <Col N="2148" /> Higher Education, Dublin.  The difference is not so much a matter of status as of function.  The National Institute of Higher Education exists principally to provide for graduate and non-graduate education in technology.  The Colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology provide for a range of requirements for industry and commerce from apprenticeship, through technician training, to professional qualifications.  I would esteem both equally but regard their functions as not being identical.</P>
    <P>On several occasions, when visiting the Colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology, I have stressed my interest in and support for the development of these colleges. The proof of this support can be seen in the fact that I have approved the purchase of additional site area for the college in Bolton Street and have also recently authorised the appointment of consultants for the extension to that college and also for an extension to the college in Kevin Street.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not say who did that one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the appointment of consultants for the extension of the college in Kevin Street, I gave approval for that.  That was in relation to a site which had been purchased by my predecessor.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I have also announced that, if specific proposals are received from Dublin City Vocational Education Committee for extra student places at Rathmines College of Commerce, the College of Marketing and Design and the Dublin College of Catering, such proposals will receive due consideration.</P>
      <P>In view of these commitments, I do not believe that there can be any doubt about the high esteem in which I hold the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are frightful accommodation problems facing the Dublin Institute of Technology, that while they may be equally esteemed, they are far from being equally <Col N="2149" /> paid, that these anomalies have existed for some time and that there is no economic structure in the Dublin Institute of Technology which allows proper development or promotional opportunities? Would the Minister agree that it is because of all of these things that the Dublin Institute of Technology felt they were not being properly recognised and were heartened by the Fianna Fáil promise, before the election, that the Dublin Institute of Technology would be given a greatly expanded role in higher education and parity of esteem with the National Institute for Higher Education in Dublin?  Will the Minister now set about honouring that promise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already expressed in the course of my reply my high esteem for the DIT and the fact that I hold both the DIT and the NIHE equal but would regard their functions as not being identical. I also referred to the high esteem in which I personally hold the DIT, which indeed was accepted by the Deputy in the course of his supplementary question.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of salary levels, the Deputy will be aware that there has been a group meeting with regard to amendments to circular 14 of 1979 which has caused an amount of dissatisfaction in relation both to salary and provisions on the part of the staff.  I am hopeful that, following the very genuine contribution made by all sides in relation to this matter in the recent past, it will be possible to bring about a resolution in the relatively near future.  It might be interesting to compare, however, some of the salary scales.  The scale for a lecturer II in DIT rises to a maximum of £15,318, which is the equivalent of the maximum for a lecture in NIHE, although the NIHE lecturer starts at £10,974 as compared to lecturer II in the DIT who commences at £11,065.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept entirely, and I referred to it in my reply, that there is difficulty in relation to accommodation problems in some of the colleges.  This was why I sanctioned at the cost of several million pounds the purchase of the site in Bolton Street for expansion of the facilities there and also sanctioned commencement of building of <Col N="2150" /> the extension to Kevin Street which my predecessor had initiated.  I would be very anxious to receive from Dublin Vocational Education Committee proposals in regard to improvements in the other colleges, specifically in relation to extra places for Rathmines, the College of Marketing and Design and the College of Catering.  I assure the House that if I receive such proposals I will lose no time in having them processed and giving them every possible favourable consideration. There is certainly need for improvement in the accommodation in those colleges, especially in view of the very great work they have done over the years.</P>

I asked permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment last week and it was in order but did not reach the top of the queue.  Obviously the same position exists today and tomorrow and at the time of the discussion of the Cavan-Monaghan by-election writ we were promised by the Taoiseach that we would have the Finance (No. 3) Bill before the House for discussion prior to the Christmas recess.  Obviously that will not happen and I ask the guidance of the Chair as to how the subject matter of Question No. 629 could be raised other than on the Adjournment.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Deputy's question has given me the opportunity to express my exhortation to all road users to exercise every care and consideration during the holiday period and in particular to advert to the danger of mixing drinking and driving.  I intend to develop this message in appeals on radio and television. In addition, the National Road Safety Association have organised a winter campaign which will extend over Christmas and the New Year, the principal features of which highlighted pedestrian and cyclist safety and the menace of drinking and driving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I last asked this question a number of weeks ago there have been quite a number of road traffic deaths and injuries.  Can the Minister assure the House that there will be something other than exhortation to bring people to their senses in relation to their obligations to one another, not just during the Christmas and New Year period but generally?  Would the Minister agree that people simply are not listening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy is incorrent in saying that people are not listening. Exhortation is one of the most powerful weapons we have.  I would like to ask every Member of this House, particularly over the next weekend when we will be speaking to our parties and issuing scripts, to make the point of bringing home to people the dangers of drinking and driving at the same time, particularly over the holiday period.  That would be a very positive contribution which we could make.</P>
      <P>I intend going on radio and television next week to make the same appeal.  I have been very graciously invited to speak on the Mike Murphy Show one day next week to make the same appeal, but one voice is not enough.  It needs the voice of every concerned person continuously making the same appeal and I hope I will have the co-operation of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's attitude to this very serious question but nobody seems to be listening to us or to the agencies invloved in road safety.  The Minister might have seen a recent RTE programme, &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo;, which set out the continuing horror story on our roads.  Is there any possibility of approaching RTE with a view to making this video tape available to organisations and individuals who might want to see it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not see the programme but I will certainly do as the Deputy suggests.  I will ask RTE to make this tape available to senior classes in <Col N="2155" /> schools because that would be a very useful move.  I should also have said that part of the campaign will be to have stickers on buses and I must thank CIE for making the space available free of charge for the next month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not competent to give the reason, but the fund of goodwill obviously does not extend to everybody or we would not have these accidents. People who are concerned about the carnage on our roads should extend this goodwill to everybody.  That will eliminate road accidents completely.  I am not saying &ldquo;as far as possible&rdquo; because that is not good enough.  As long as one person is injured or killed on our roads I am not satisfied with the campaign.  We must eliminate completely death and injury on our roads.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he was considering setting up a traffic corps. What has he done in this area?  Will there be a sufficient number of gardaí to enforce the traffic laws over the Christmas period?  Is the Minister satisfied there are enough taxies available between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. to provide transport for those who might like to leave their cars at home?  I am not satisfied there is sufficient public transport between these hours and transport of some kind should be available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not want to do anything that is purely cosmetic; whatever is done must be effective.  I am having the question of a traffic corps examined but I must admit the people I have spoken to are not very enthusiastic about it.  They feel the message should be passed to each individual road-user, whether he be a pedestrian, a motorist, motor cyclist or pedal cyclist.  Whether there will be a sufficient number of gardaí <Col N="2156" /> on duty over the Christmas is a matter for the Minister for Justice, But I am sure he is as concerned about this matter as I am.</P>
      <P>The Taxi Owners Association would hold &mdash; and this is something I would want more notice of before I could answer it adequately &mdash; that the number of taxies in Dublin per head of population exceeds that of many cities of a similar size in other parts of the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody residing in this city recognises that there is a grave shortage of taxies at specific times &mdash; lunchtime, teatime and between 11 p.m. and between 2 a.m. or 3 a.m.  Special provision should be made to allow extra taxies to operate between those hours.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay a tribute to RTE and NRSA for their co-operation in providing information on road safety.  RTE provided the time free and the NRSA, with a very limited budget, have done a superb job.</P>

      <P>It goes without saying that I support the sentiments expressed by the Minister that an all-party approach to make people realise the seriousness of this problem would be very desirable.  In view of the unanimity on this issue would he consider suggesting to the organisers of the Mike Murphy programme that Deputy D. Andrews should join him on that programme? That would be a unique situation where two people from opposite political parties would be on one view in getting this very important message across to all drivers at Christmas-time.  Would the Minister make that suggestion to the organisers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have no objection.

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that many of the accidents in the Dublin area are caused because of frustration experienced by drivers who have the onerous task of driving through the city at peak hours?  Today there seems to be a build up of traffic all the time.  Much of this build up is caused by irresponsible and illegal parking.  Are there any steps the Minister can take to ensure that this illegal parking is reduced over the Christmas and New Year period?  A great deal of this traffic build up is caused by the ripping up of streets, some of which might not be necessary at this time of the year. I could mention three places I passed today where new digging is taking place. Would the Minister use his influence with Dublin Corporation to reduce illegal parking and postpone the filling in of these holes for the next two or three weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that frustration because of the delays in traffic is a contributory factor but, again, like Deputy David Andrews' question about <Col N="2158" /> the psychology of the driver who brings about accidents, I am not competent to judge that.  However, I will bring Deputy McMahon's remarks to the attention of Dublin Corporation.  Double parking is illegal, it is breaking the law and it is the duty of the Garda to see to it that those who do that are brought to court.  But in the end; no matter who double parks or what streets are dug up, the final responsibility rests with the individual.  Individuals are the cause of accidents whether they are pedestrians, pedal cyclists, motor cyclists or drivers of mechanically propelled vehicles.  It is only by those four groups exercising continuous care that accidents will be avoided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not come here, nor did Fianna Fáil, to bash the Bill for the sake of bashing it.  We are anxious to get, as is our duty as an Opposition, answers to question in relation to the Bill.  Those answers are not available in the information that has been presented to the House so far.  We welcome certain aspects of the Bill.  We welcome any action taken to uplift the building and construction industry which is such an essential part of our economy.  Indeed, it has often been used as a barometer of the success or otherwise of our economy.  It <Col N="2229" /> makes a great contribution to employment and, by and large, uses native raw material.  We are aware that the industry is on the floor at present for reasons I will deal with later.  It has been said that the Bill will help people buy their own homes and that is why we feel justified in asking many questions in relation to this legislation. Listening to aspects of Government policy one must bear in mind the importance of looking behind the scene and trying to discover the things the Government should have said.</P>
      <P>The Bill represents a fundamental change in housing finance policy.  For the first time it will transfer responsibility for inflation-linked bonds which will be distributed away from the financial institutions and on to the borrower.  That has never happened in relation to the financing of housing or any other aspect of Government financing up to now.  It is a fundamental change in that respect.  It is clear to me, and it should have been clear to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, who made a case for a bit of a social policy, that when one transfers responsibility for linking and indexing of inflation away from the financial institutions, the experts in the financial field, to a national housing agency who then pass it onto the borrowers &mdash; the agency will be self-financing and will not receive any subsidies or help from the Government &mdash; it is anti-social.  It will also put those who borrow from the agency at a disadvantage compared to those who borrow from building societies, insurance companies or are beneficiaries of SDA loans. Traditionally such people borrowed at a rate that has been under the inflation rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been pointed out that the inflation rate plus a real rate on top of it will be the new rate for the borrower under the scheme.  What is happening is that a golden egg is being handed to the financial institutions because, for the first time ever, they will be fire-proofed against inflation.  They do not have to worry about it.  They will be <Col N="2230" /> putting their money into State guaranteed bonds that will carry, on top of the existing inflation rate, a real rate of interest. Will it be 1 per cent or 3 per cent?  I have heard various figures tossed about but whatever it is it is gilt-edged and it puts a golden egg into the hands of financial institutions.  The responsibility for repaying that inflation rate interest rate, plus the real rate, is on the borrower.  We should tell the people what they will be paying if they get a loan under this scheme.  This has never been done before.  The small amount of money that is talked about initially will not upset the general finance situation in the country but the Minister has clearly established that eventually the agency will replace the SDA loan scheme.  The Minister confirmed that when he said it is envisaged that at full operation the new scheme will replace the local authority loan scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are we witnessing?  Are we witnessing the phasing out of and the getting rid of for all time local authority financing for housing known to us as the SDA loan scheme?  If that is what the Government are doing they should spell it out clearly so that our people are not under any illusions.  I heard it stated that this represents additional funds to the housing industry.  If that was the case we would all nod approval to the legislation but if the eventual aim is not to put more money in but to transfer the burden of housing the less well-off sections of society from the State, from the Exchequer, and on to the shoulders of the less well-off sections of our society then we are entitled to take note.  That is what appears to be the eventual aim of the agency.  Many thousands of people will want to know more about the scheme. Public representatives will also want to know what is to happen to the SDA loan scheme.  Will it be replaced by a scheme which is based on repayments of the rate of inflation plus a real rate of return?  We should look at the great attraction this will represent for the financial institutions who are responsible to their shareholders or policy holders to get a rate and provide pension at the end of the day.  This is the best and easiest way out for such institutions. It is a gilt-edged situation linked to <Col N="2231" /> inflation and carries a State guarantee. Those institutions will have their foot in the door and as the scheme unfolds in years to come pressure will build up from the same financial institutions on the State to carry the full can of inflation in relation to their borrowings.  That is a serious step forward in that direction and we should be clear about where it is leading us.  If I am wrong the Minister should tell me when replying.</P>
    <P>How any Member can say that this is social legislation when he considers the points I have made is beyond me.  Under the scheme borrowers will be put at a disadvantage to those who borrowed through local authorities, insurance companies or building societies.  Where is the social justice in relation to that aspect?  I recognise that since we joined the EMS there is a need for the creation of new investments for funds but when one takes a step in that direction and establishes a gilt-edged situation that will be inflation-linked and carry a real return on interest, then everybody will try to get into that area, and why not.  The banks will try, as will the insurance companies. I have no doubt that the Minister recognises that fact because he has told us that the first issue will have to be auctioned. Of course they will have to be auctioned because there will be many people knocking at the door.  That is the greatest investment that can be got.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister will get all the money he wants in relation to his £25 million to £50 million. However, I think he should come clean and let us know whether eventually the old SDA loan is to be changed, whether the whole financing of local authority housing is to be changed.  If that is the case, he should say it openly and honestly.  When I look at the Government across the water and compare them with this Government, I find that in many ways similar policies are being pursued.  However, the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, and her Government, who are hell-bent on balancing the books at all costs and have little regard for people, did not go along this road.  This is totally against the <Col N="2232" /> interests of the less well-off of our society. Mrs. Thatcher must have felt that she would not get away with it.  If this is the first step along that road, the House should be fully aware of it.  Our responsibility is to point it out to the public.  If that is the road we are travelling let everybody be fully aware of it and not find out later.  In the last three or four months people have found that many of the schemes they thought were of benefit to them were not, in fact, beneficial at the end of the day.  If this is another sleight-of-hand operation the Government should be honest and tell us.</P>
    <P>I believe the National Housing Agency scheme will involve wholesale discrimination against the poorer sections of the community.  Those who borrow from the NHA will be liable for higher interest rates than the better off members of our society.  We have always heard the claim made that the better off can borrow at less money.  This scheme is institutionalising that situation.  I know there are categories of people who look forward to this scheme because of its initial attraction. They are either not qualified to get an SDA loan or they are outside the building society area.  We should certainly have a scheme to cater for them but they should be fully aware of the financial responsibilities they are taking on.  It is attractive to a couple in the initial years of their marriage, but as their children grow up and their educational requirements increase the burden increases.  They should be told what the situation will be later on.  It is understandable that a young couple getting married will grab at any money available in order to get a house.  To provide it is a worthy objective, but we must not walk them blindly into something.  We must tell them in advance what the score is.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the housing situation there are many areas that could be improved.  The Government did away with the mortgage subsidy.  They then excluded the single person from eligibility for the housing subsidy.  This was a retrograde step.  In my part of the country it has always been the practice that when a young fellow was thinking of getting married he got his site and tried to make <Col N="2233" /> arrangements to build his house.  The statistics show that 24 or 25 per cent of applicants for loans and grants were single people.  This was a good way to have young people thinking.  No longer can such people make a start and built their houses in time to get married.  In my part of the country they say that there was a time when you got the cage first and then went to look for the bird but that now it appears one must get the bird first.  This will have a detrimental effect on the building industry.  I am not playing politics. I am stating what I believe to be a fact.</P>
    <P>The Minister may claim that this new provision will make the burden of people lighter in the early years, but it is interesting to note that the spouse's income is excluded whereas it is included in the case of the SDA loan.  What is the reason for that?  Is it as I believe, a sleight-of-hand way of forcing people by stealth out of the SDA loan category and moving the burden of housing the less well off away from the Government and back on to the people's own shoulders?  When one looks at the combination of events that is the picture that emerges.  If I am wrong I will be delighted to hear it from the Minister because I do not think that is the way the Irish people want this country to be governed.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects to this which I am delighted to note.  I am glad to see the area of co-operative housing getting further recognition and help.  It is a very worthwhile development in our society. It helps to provide houses at realistic prices.  Of course, the supply and demand situation determines the price of houses. When we are fundamentally changing the whole approach we must surely assess what the repercussions of that will be.</P>
    <P>Under this scheme the £3,000 mortgage subsidy will be given back to the lender to reduce the amount of the loan. Builders, as we know, will watch that development and, as they have always, will try to increase the price of houses to grab any money lying around.  When the borrowing capacity of a borrower is increased from £2,000 to £2,500 to £3,000 to £3,500 it is worth asking experts in that area whether that too will contribute to <Col N="2234" /> an increase in house prices.  I say this because traditionally builders have had regard to the market in deciding what to charge for houses.  They take into account the amount of money that a house purchaser can borrow in terms of his gross income and on that basis decide on the price of the product.  In other words, the builder tailors his operations to suit the market.</P>
    <P>These are the repercussions of which we must be very careful in terms of any change in policy.  Has any assessment been made of the effect of this legislation on house-building costs?  Such assessment is possible on the basis of experience gained down through the years in the housing market, a market that has always been determined by the supply and demand concept.  There is a social responsibility on the Government of the day to cater for the needs of the less well off, but I hope that this legislation is not what one might think it to be from reading between the lines, that is, a withdrawal by the State from that social responsibility and, by stealth, to push the less well off into a situation in which initially they think they are doing all right but in which eventually they will realise that the burden involved is much greater than was envisaged at first.  We have seen this happen in relation to people borrowing from the building societies where they undertook commitments early on in life which later proved a great burden.</P>
    <P>It is nice economic theory to tell potential house purchasers that what they are involving themselves in is the payment of 18 per cent of their incomes.  It would be fine in theory if each week people worked on that basis while making the same sort of calculation in respect of their various other commitments.  But what is to happen to somebody who loses his job?  Are we still talking about 18 per cent of social welfare payments?  That is another question that needs to be clarified.</P>
    <P>What we are certain of is that there will be no help from the Exchequer, since this agency will be self-financing and as such must recoup from the borrower the inflation rate of the day plus the real rate of return, plus the cost of running the national housing agency.  We have considered <Col N="2235" /> various ways and means of tackling the nub of the problem and of bringing about improvements in the house building area.  I hope the Minister is not jumping too fast in this instance.  I do not see any reason for rushing through the legislation.  The building industry is generally quiet in the month of January.  We had sought to have the measure discussed at length.  However, what we cannot agree to is the inflation link for the financial institutions in respect of housing bonds.  There is a social responsibility on financial institutions to put a certain amount of their profits into housing.  To some extent the banks and the insurance companies have been doing that, but they could be encouraged to do more.  What I fear in relation to this scheme is that from the small pool going from these resources to the housing industry there would be a diversion into bonds, with the institutions saying that is their contribution. That is a likely development which would mean that all we were doing was giving them a gilt-edged, State-financed, index-linked, inflation-proof real rate of return on these diverted funds.  That would be undersirable and I know it is something with which the Minister would not agree.</P>
    <P>The question is how to guard against that happening.  We can talk of the auctioning out of the bonds, and in that regard we can be sure that there will be plenty of financial people at the auction. If they see an opportunity of making money they are not too concerned about who pays the bill at the end of the day, and we all know that the unfortunate borrower will be the one to pay the bill. There is a distinct possibility of the abolition of SDA loans, but I hope this will not come about.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach talk about this Bill in terms of its being social legislation.  I would refer him to the Minister's statement in which he said that it is not possible to say for certain whether borrowings in the long run will prove to be more or less expensive than borrowing on a conventional annuity mortgage.  If at this point in time the</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2236" /> Minister cannot say that the action being taken will not be of any more benefit to the people who will be borrowing, what is the point in labelling the Bill as a piece of social legislation?</P>
    <P>It is clear from the examples I have attempted to give that housing will be more expensive and that the housing agency interest rates will always be significantly higher than those of the building societies.  One of the results of this situation will be that those people who find it impossible to obtain loans from the building societies or from insurance companies will have to borrow from the agency and that they will be liable for the penal rate over and above the inflation rate of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is the question, too, of the cost of the administration of this scheme.  Has anybody costed it or decided who will administer it?  Obviously, it will have to be self-financing.  When we talk about adjustment being an annual event in respect of every borrower we are talking about a very big operation in terms of administration.  The assessment will be based on the income tax returns for the previous April.  I do not agree with the flippant approach of which I heard mention today.  Will the cost of the scheme be any less than the cost that is involved so far as the experts in that field are concerned at the moment?  I think the scheme will prove to be an administrative nightmare especially having regard to the opposition of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to part of the proposals for taxation reform, proposals which may or may not be implemented.  We are talking here about the same type of administration. If the Government are serious about their embargo on public service recruitment, is the scheme to be administered within the existing framework of the Department of the Environment?  These are questions on which we should have answers, especially since the cost at the end of the day will be borne by the borrower.</P>
    <P>When the scheme has been in operation for a while the harsh realities of it will become apparant not only to all of us here but to the people generally.  It is our duty to say now what we think will <Col N="2237" /> be the effects of the scheme.  In principle we are not against any move that might help people to acquire houses or that might help the construction industry.  It is in its present state because of decisions which were taken by the Government. We know that the demand was increasing earlier this year when Fianna Fáil made an announcement in relation to the mortgage subsidy interest.  As soon as the mortgage subsidy was taken away demand was dampened down immediately and people who had been looking at houses backed off straight away.</P>
    <P>It is also wrong to discriminate against single people who do not now qualify for interest subsidy on mortgages.  A single man cannot get approval now from a bank for a bridging loan.  He has to be married before a bank will grant this. These are the real causes of the slowing down in the building industry.  A reversal of some of the decisions made already would give an instant impetus to the building and construction industry, which is such a vital part of our economy, which gives employment and which, by and large, uses Irish materials.</P>
    <P>Initially a certain amount of money will come in.  I believe there will be a queue at the Department of the Environment, the agency or whoever is going to run it. In this connection, we would like an answer to that question: who is going to run it?  Will it be a mixture of commercial concerns and the public service?  We have not been told so far.  It is up to the Opposition to ask the questions and I have done so.  I would have liked to have heard Deputy Kemmy or Deputy Browne speak on the social aspects of this legislation. I do not see them, although I have stated what the anti-social aspects are. There is a category of people who need this scheme but it is not an answer to all the problems of the housing industry.  I fear it is unloading the burden of the State onto people who are not able to provide for themselves.  This is a retrograde step.  I want to ask a fundamental, basic question: is this transferring the responsibility for inflation away from the financial institutions and proofing them against whatever happens?  Is that not totally against everything done up to <Col N="2238" /> now?  I do not like cosmetic exercises.  I like something presented openly and honestly.  I hope to get honest answers to the questions I have put in relation to the inflation-linking of this money and an admission that the people who borrow are going to be at a disadvantage compared to the people borrowing under existing schemes.  Are SDA loans to be abolished?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> I have not made up my mind about what Deputy Reynolds was talking about.  On one hand he seems to be in favour of something and on the other he appears to be against it.  I welcome this Bill.  I know that change brings fear but one must be prepared to accept the challenge of change.  This is a breath of fresh air into the funding of housing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds said there would be a queue by financial institutions and the difficulty this will cause for borrowers.  I understand from reading the Bill that it will be index-linked to the rate of inflation. I am assuming that inflation is going to drop, in turn repayments will also drop&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i>&mdash;&mdash;and also that the money which is coming into the fund will be from pension funds and life assurance offices.  We have heard on various occasions about the need to provide better pensions.  If pension funds can be invested in something like this there will be a fair return for investors.  We are losing sight of the fact that this is a genuine effort to provide funds for people to buy their own homes.  We have heard about SDA loans and various other schemes and that there will be no help from the Exchequer.  There is no mention in the Bill that grants will be abolished. Surely that is assistance from the Exchequer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Reynolds knows, the SDA loan has a fixed rate of interest.  Does he think it justifiable that someone who has an SDA loan of £4,000 should expect the State to subsidise that loan after 20 years? <Col N="2239" /> I do not think that is fair when there are queues of people in various parts of the country trying to get loans to buy a house for the first time.  We must be realistic and accept the fact that if we are going to give people assistance there will be some initial flaws in the scheme.  The Minister said he is being very careful about who will get the loans and the amounts which will be authorised.  That is the right thing to do &mdash; we all have to creep before we can walk.  I am surprised at the Opposition party having fears about giving money to people to buy their own homes, that we might be putting more money into the pockets of financial institutions and that this could damage the building industry.  Any money given towards housing will help the building industry, which is so important.</P>
    <P>We were asked if insurance companies would stop giving loans and if there would be unfair competition.  I am in that business and I can tell Deputy Reynolds that insurance companies will give you loans at fixed rates of interest at present. You will get a loan at perhaps 18 per cent fixed over 25 years.  If the interest rates drop after some years you still pay 18 per cent, so what is the difference?  Here is an opportunity for somebody to take on a contract knowing at the outset, contrary to what Deputy Reynolds thinks, what his or her liabilities are going to be.  I am sure that when Deputy Reynolds hears the Minister's reply all his fears will disappear and I have no doubt he will welcome the Bill as wholeheartedly as I do.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Haughey yesterday when he spoke about local authority houses and SDA loans. He said the only thing wrong is that local authorities are starved of finance.  I am glad to hear the ex-Taoiseach admit that his Government starved the local authorities of finance for housing, because I agree with him.  That is evident from the fact that when this Government took office a Supplementary Estimate for £30 million had to be introduced to pay for the existing contracts the previous Government had entered into.  I do not think the arguments put forward by Deputy Haughey yesterday hold much water.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2240" /> It is time people realised that out there in the big bad world young people are becoming very annoyed and upset because of the fact that they cannot get homes.  It is time we as politicians recognised this.  When we do something that will help these people we should not put up arguments against it for the sake of doing so.  This is a genuine effort by the Government to encourage people to buy their own homes, to get off the local authority waiting lists and to be taken out of hovels into which they are forced in order to get a local authority house.</P>
    <P>I spoke in this House before about this aspect of Irish life, which I deplore and which has crept into our society, particularly in the Dublin area.  Any effort which will encourage people at an early stage to save a deposit knowing that there is an agency behind them which will give them a reasonable amount of money to buy their homes should be encouraged. I came up through the local authority structure and I saw many families destroyed by bad housing.  There was no one there to help those couples at an early age.</P>
    <P>In Dublin at present if you want to get a local authority house you must have at least one child and you must be living in grossly over-crowded conditions.  In effect that means one room.  If we build a society which forces our young couples to live in one room at a very delicate state of their marriage, we will get one of two things.  We will get very united couples, or very many split homes.  The pressures facing these people day in and day out in bad housing conditions with their children in bad health are enormous.  I am against saying they must take their chances on the local authority housing list.  That is not what we want in Irish life in the future.  It is a worthwhile exercise to encourage people at an early stage to save money to buy their own homes.  Any effort to assist them must be welcomed by all politicians irrespective of party.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It shows imagination. It recognises that it is necessary to help people to buy their own homes. Under this Bill they can borrow up to two-and-a-half or three times their salary and make repayments at a rate of aproximately <Col N="2241" /> 15 per cent of their income.  This is a very positive type of approach.  At present if somebody on an income of £9,000 borrows two-and-a-half times his income, in the first year of repayment he pays back 43 per cent of his gross income. That is wrong.  That is where the problem lies.  That is why this Bill should be welcomed by everyone.  It is giving people an opportunity to get a realistic sum of money which will help them to get off the ground at an early stage and into proper housing.  I fail to see how anybody could have any doubts about this.  I thought all parties would praise the Minister for introducing a Bill showing such vision as this Bill does.</P>
    <P>Anything which takes people off the local authority housing list is to be welcomed. We will always have people within our society who will need local authority housing.  I cannot see how this Bill will interfere in any way with the State's commitment to provide housing for those who genuinely cannot afford it. This agency will give a realistic loan to those who need a little help.</P>
    <P>There is no point in talking about SDA loans if the limits set are so low, or go out of date so quickly, that they are of benefit to nobody.  There is no point in giving people in Dublin a loan of £14,000 if their income is under £7,000 and the purchase price of the house is £26,000. That is asking somebody with an income of under £7,000 to save £12,000.  That is totally unrealistic.  It is out of the question. The SDA loan is utterly irrelevant to the vast majority of people.  Whether we like it or not, one-third of the population live within the greater Dublin area. Therefore, effectively one-third of the population are cut off from getting a loan through the SDA system.  It is easy to see that the SDA system does not apply in Dublin and that is the area I know best.</P>
    <P>I saw an example the other day.  You can borrow £18,000 through the SDA system provided you have been a year on the housing list, have one child and live in grossly over-crowed conditions. There is no income limit.  If people living in a rented two-bedroom cottage are told they have to get out of it &mdash; and this is the case I am quoting at the moment; this <Col N="2242" /> couple have to get out next January &mdash; if they apply for the £18,000 loan, they do not live in grossly over-crowded conditions and they will not get the loan.  What is the alternative?  They can get a £14,000 SDA loan provided their income is under £7,000.  This is totally irrelevant in my book.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to get on and do what we should be doing, that is, to make a genuine attempt to give money to people who need it and to give them a realistic amount which will enable them to buy a home, instead of going through the charade of saying we have an SDA loan scheme which does not apply to the vast majority of people who look for these loans.  This does nothing to help the building industry or to help anybody to get a home.</P>
    <P>This Bill approaches the problem from the right direction.  It tells people they can borrow up to two-and-a-half times or three times their income and make repayments over a given period of time at a percentage of their income.  It is unrealistic to expect people to pay 43 per cent of their gross income in the initial year. Those people are now finding their way onto the local authority housing list and ultimately the State has to provide a house and fund 100 per cent of the construction of that house.</P>
    <P>The fears expressed by Deputy Reynolds are unfounded.  I would have thought he would have come in here to support the Bill.  It is very important to support the building industry which gives a vast amount of employment.  It has been a part of Irish life and it has provided an excellent service for those anxious to set up homes.</P>
    <P>There has been a change of attitude in so far as we realise there is a need to look at the funding of mortgages and in regard to the type of houses we are building. The standard estate in Dublin and elsewhere nowadays is made up of three-bedroom semi-detached houses and we are asking newly-weds to buy these houses, whether they want them or not.  I would appeal to the agency when they begin operations to ensure that funds will be made available to purchasers of one-bedroom and two-bedroom houses.  In the <Col N="2243" /> early stage of home building people should not be required to take on three-bedroom houses.  That is not to say that they should not be enabled to do so if they wish, but we should ensure that funds will be available to assist large groups of people, particularly because the agency will cater for single people.  A single person may borrow from the agency and that single person may only need a single-bedroom house.  From the point of view of both the building agencies and the new housing agency it is desirable that we would get down to providing one-bedroom and two-bedroom dwellings in our cities.</P>
    <P>In the initial stages of the agency's development there will be an income limit of £9,000.  I can understand fully that that should be so because I do not think there is much point in a State agency being set up that would be seen to challenge existing agencies such as the building societies.  If the building societies are catering generally for people in the £11,000 to £12,000 a year salaries bracket I do not see any benefit in this agency being seen to be in competition with building societies at that level.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to achieve assistance for people who have not got loans from building societies.  I therefore appeal to the Opposition to appreciate that we are talking about a serious problem and that it is essential we get it right.  Our housing policy will determine the type of society Ireland will have in the future and if we allow the present situation to continue we will build a society none of us will be proud of.  Weaknesses in the legislation may be picked out in the future through aspects of the agency's operations, but the principle behind the legislation must be welcomed and a lot of good can be achieved if the Opposition recognise that and give the agency proposal their full support.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds expressed concern about the administration of the loans schemes.  If he had read the Minister's speech carefully he would have learned that they will be administered by the local authorities throughout the country.  It would be useless to establish another <Col N="2244" /> group of offices throughout Ireland to do what the local authorities are geared to do.  I am sure the local authorities will be pleased to administer these new loans.  I think it is a very good idea that the Minister and the agency should decide to use the local authorities to deal with applications at local level.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Reynolds mention the co-ops.  I was relieved to read that particular attention is being given to them.  I have seen them work with a great measure of success in Dublin. One thing they can do is to give houses to the people.  It is a big challenge for people on their own to enter into a commitment of that size but when you have a group of people coming together in a co-op things are made easier because the group can negotiate and engage contractors, and they can be financed by the new agencies, which will be of great assistance to the co-op movement.</P>
    <P>Another aspect to which sufficient attention has not been given in the past is the help the agency will lend to people to purchase existing houses.  I have found it difficult to accept that many people would be concerned exclusively with new houses, because I know that many people in Dublin would be glad to purchase existing two-bedroom or one-bedroom houses.  Such houses are in very short supply, possibly because it was hard to get finance for that sort of house.  It is good to realise that the Minister means to assist people to purchase such houses.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is good to see flexibility, and I welcome the fact that single people will be able to borrow from the agency because we should encourage people to buy houses in advance of marriage. That will be to everybody's advantage ultimately.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds asked what will happen if a mortgagee gets sick.  The Minister's speech makes it clear that there will be a very sensible approach to this.  If somebody gets sick special arrangements will be made to extend the term of the loan, and repayments can be suspended for a short time until they overcome sickness or get employment if they are unemployed. Recently I read an article by the St. Vincent de Paul Society about the <Col N="2245" /> new poor in Ireland, the people in the middle income group who have found themselves unemployed and have found heavy mortgages around their necks.</P>
    <P>This is a worthwhile aspect of the operations of the proposed agency in so far as it recognises that if somebody becomes ill or is unemployed some assistance will be given them, with more flexibility being allowed in the way they can make repayments or indeed extend the term of their loan.  This is particularly to be welcomed in view of the recent comments of the President of the Saint Vincent de Paul Society which spelled out the massive amount of money they have had to give to people who, through illness or unemployment, were unable to meet their repayments.</P>
    <P>When the agency is established I would recommend that its operations be reviewed from time to time.  I am thinking particularly of circumstances in which if somebody can obtain a loan from another lending agency but cannot raise a sufficient deposit, the agency could be asked to help out.  The whole purpose behind this Housing Finance Agency is to help people get off the ground at an early stage.  I would hope it would be possible &mdash; and I have no reason to believe otherwise &mdash; that once established the agency could see its way to help people raise a deposit through an additional loan or perhaps second mortgage.  I have no doubt but that this agency will be a great help to all citizens.</P>
    <P>Another matter causing grave concern in Ireland today is that there are a number of old people, particularly those on fixed incomes or pensions, who find themselves living in rather large, three, four or five-bedroomed houses whose upkeep they cannot afford.  They find it very difficult to maintain such a property to a good standard.  They genuinely cannot afford the house in which they are living.  The sooner people in that position here &mdash; as has happened in other European countries &mdash; can be allowed sell their homes and with the money they receive subsidise their already fixed income, the better.  I have in mind here such persons selling their home, remaining in that home for the rest of their <Col N="2246" /> lifetime, the proceeds being used at the time of receipt to supplement the fixed income or pension, at the same time guaranteeing proper accommodation in the environment to which they have been used.  When the time comes that such a person dies that property should then revert to the agency.  Perhaps the Minister could consider this aspect in the future.</P>
    <P>As somebody who has been involved in this business for a number of years through insurance loans, I have been approached by people on numerous occasions, people living in three, four or five-bedroomed houses whose upkeep they cannot afford.  Yet they have nowhere to go, they do not want to leave, they would be anxious to mortgage their house and remain there for the rest of their lifetime.  This would constitute a worthwhile advancement on our thinking in regard to old people.  I could not for the life of me see why it could not be arranged.  There will always be capital appreciation in housing.  If an agency such as this could foresee their way to assisting those people to get a loan, with the guarantee that they could remain on in that property for the rest of their lives, the property then reverting to the agency, that is something that would be welcomed by everybody.</P>
    <P>I welcome this new thinking in terms of financial assistance towards housing, particularly for young people starting off. I welcome the fact that the Opposition also will afford this agency a chance to get off the ground, giving them every encouragement because ultimately the country at large will benefit.</P>

      <P>The Bill before us has wide-ranging implications.  We on this side of the House would have liked more time to debate it in greater detail.  However, we shall debate issues as they arise. Any Bill designed to help the housing construction industry and those in need of housing will be welcomed by us.  However, I want to put on record that we have not been given a sufficient time in which to deal with this Bill.  We would like to have gone into it in greater detail.</P>

    <P>When I was in the Department there <Col N="2247" /> was then a White Paper on Housing being drawn up which would give us an indication of the number of houses needed in the next five years.  I would like to know from the Minister if and when that paper will be issued.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that. Naturally I was anxious to know the position in regard to it.</P>
      <P>I would like now to deal with planning applications in regard to housing.  It has come to my notice that planning authorities in some cases have been holding up housing proposals for very inadequate reasons.  In some cases throughout the country it has happened that &mdash; within two days of the expiry of the planning regulation in regard to the two months' period &mdash; the planning authority sent an applicant a registered letter seeking some further information or documentation. That is not fair and should not be tolerated. I have no doubt that the Minister would not be a party to any such practice but I would draw his attention to the fact that it does happen.  That practice holds up an applicant for perhaps another two months causing him a lot of hardship in addition.  If, say, such an applicant is getting married it complicates the situation further and imposes extra costs that should not be incurred.  The planning departments of local authorities, especially in regard to housing, should know exactly what is required when a planning application for a house reaches them.  If an applicant does not submit all of the required documentation then an officer in that local authority should be in a position to write almost immediately saying: We need an extra house plan, a site map or a specification.  But it is most unfair to any applicant to send a registered letter two days before expiry of the planning regulation saying that perhaps their site map is incorrect, that they had not submitted sufficient documentation, or whatever.  That is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal now with the legal fees involved in housing which are very costly. <Col N="2248" /> Here a problem may arise in regard to title.  I do not wish to go into the legal aspect in great detail, but in regard to the conveyance of title, this should be examined to ascertain if there is any way &mdash; and I stress any way &mdash; in which it could be processed more quickly or transference of a plot of land effected.  Here I would like to warn applicants intending to build houses that they should not get involved in land in respect of which the title is bad or doubtful.  They should ensure that the owner of the land is the registered owner and has title.  I have known of persons who bought a plot of land or entered into a contract in respect of that plot of land and who to their grief perhaps discovered that it took a couple of years to sort out the question of title.</P>
    <P>There can be a long delay when land is being transferred from one person to another and I believe conveyancing must be looked at.  The person building the house may have to get bridging finance until the title is made good and that can take months.  The local authority or any other financial institution will not grant any money until the title documents are in order.  I would like to see something done about this.  I know it is a rather complex matter but I would hope that some way could be found to get around this problem.  Bridging finance costs the borrower a lot of money.</P>
    <P>In regard to the type of houses that should be erected I do not think that a one or two-bedroomed house should be the standard laid down.  That might be all right at the time of purchase but when a family comes along what use is a one or two-bedroomed house?  The person then has to make additional accommodation available.  Where is he to get the necessary finance to build on additional rooms?  Our local authorities are building very good houses at present.  I would also like to place on record that the National Building Agency are erecting very good houses.  The standard of work is excellent and I want to congratulate them on it.  It is a matter for a local authority to decide on the type of housing that should be erected in any area.  In many areas they may be called upon to <Col N="2249" /> build a four-bedroomed house.  I am glad to say that the National Building Agency who do the work for a number of local authorities have been building such houses and I want to compliment them.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask whether as a result of this Bill there will be any more finance available for housing.  We are now asking insurance companies to put money into this agency and we are going to pay them very attractive rates.  Are they going to redirect their finances into this agency and will that mean that finance will not be available for other essential items?  I have some reservations about this.  I want to know if there is to be more finance available.  What I see happening, and I foresaw it when the Bill was first mooted, is that the SDA loan is about to go.  My views on that are borne out by the Minister's statement.  People who are in a favourable position to borrow will be able to do so at a more attractive rate from other loan institutions.</P>
    <P>I would like to know who is going to define the income every year.  Will it be the Revenue Commissioners or the company with which one is employed?  If it is the Revenue Commissioners, they have recently told the Government that they are not prepared to work another scheme.  There is a fundamental point as to who is going to give the income of the applicant every year.  Whoever is responsible, extra administrative costs will be incurred.  According to the terms of the Bill the cost must be paid out of the revenue of the agency and I have no doubt that the borrower will have to carry this burden.</P>
    <P>Regarding the bonding which will be offered to institutions at an auction &mdash; I do not like using the word &ldquo;auction&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Auction down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be auction up. When they realise that investment in the agency will be gilt-edged and that there will be a higher return than they would receive elsewhere, it will become a very attractive proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know whether new offices are to be acquired for this agency and whether extra personnel will be <Col N="2250" /> recruited.  I would also ask how many directors there will be.  The Minister when replying might give this information. If office accommodation is to be built or purchased or leased this will mean a whole new organisation.</P>
    <P>When I was in the Department of the Environment I investigated the possibilities of raising revenue but I found that new ventures would have to be financed by taking revenue from other areas where it was needed.  That is why I did not go ahead with an agency like this or some other form of organisation.  We decided earlier this year to increase the rate of housing loans and income limits and the mortgage scheme would give great assistance to purchasers during the first three years.</P>
    <P>We have been accused of not making the necessary money available for these schemes.  We would have made the money available but we could not know before these schemes were introduced how much extra money would be needed because it would depend on demand. During my years in this House there has always been a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of the Environment, formerly the Department of Local Government. It is not right that Government spokesmen, especially Ministers, should say that we did not make the necessary money available.  How did it come about that this government were able to make additional appointments costing over £0.5 million, as well as other appointments about which we learned today?</P>
    <P>In view of this Bill, builders will have to consider the best type of house to erect in order to get a return on their money. This may cause a steep rise in house prices and some may say that the CRV system will prevent that.  I hope it will but I have some reservations in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is stated that the agency will have to carry all the costs.  We do not yet know what these costs will be but in view of the fact that SDA loans are being wiped out, it seems that the burden will fall on the borrower.  Some time ago a reputable financial correspondent stated in an article that a loan of £20,000 over a 25-year period would cost as much as £140,000 in repayments.  That figure has not been <Col N="2251" /> contradicted.  The Minister stated in his opening remarks that it is not possible to say for certain whether borrowing will in the long run prove to have been more or less expensive than borrowing on a conventional annuity mortgage.  This is a grey area where the borrower can be called on to pay back a very substantial amount on his loan.  The position should be explained to the borrower because some people have the idea that when this legislation becomes law there will be no problems and repayments will be very low, but as the years pass and the family grows up there may be a heavy demand for a college education and the borrower will then begin to feel the burden.</P>
    <P>As I said, we are moving from one type of financing to another but the question must be asked: are we going to provide extra money for housing under this Bill? In my opinion, this is simply a transfer of resources.  It is the duty of a government to make available the necessary finance for housing and other relevant matters. This is very important.  As I read the situation, the borrower will pay for the running of the agency, the administrative costs and so on.  I would like to know if we are going to have a new organisation with possibly new offices.  Will these offices be in different parts of the country or will there be a central office?  If there is a central office only, probably the directors will operate from those offices with the people who will administer the agency.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill we are doing away with SDA loans.  How will this affect the SDA loans for house repairs, such as extensions? Will the agency take over that role?  Will they give grants to provide additional accommodation, such as extra bedrooms?  If that service is excluded, I would have grave reservations about this legislation and this area should be looked at again.  People should be able to apply for a loan if they are living in over-crowded conditions and need money to carry out much needed repairs, extensions and so on.</P>
    <P>We welcome any Bill that will improve the housing situation.  There has been talk about issuing bonds to financial institutions, <Col N="2252" /> but how will this be done?  With the gilt-edged security being offered by the State I have no doubt there will be a flood of applications from financial institutions. The Minister used the word &ldquo;auction&rdquo;.  What will the situation be in this respect?  When the Government try to acquire money from these financial institutions I am sure a number of them will be looking to invest.  Will this have an adverse effect on the funding of other very essential items?  Will it bring about a change of emphasis in the funding of the gilt market?  This is a very interesting situation.</P>
    <P>It is patently clear that repayments to the new agency will be pay-related.  This opens a new area which could possibly result in borrowers repaying extraordinary sums.  Here it is important to quote from the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>It is not possible to say for certain whether borrowing will in the long run prove to have been more or less expensive than borrowing on a conventional mortgage.</P>
    <P>In my opinion those in a well-off or favourable position to borrow from other lending institutions will get more favourable rates than those in the lower income group.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of haste by the Government to push through this Bill.  I want to assure the Minister that we would not hold up any legislation that was for the good and the benefit of the people. What we wanted to do was examine the legislation in detail with a view to proposing amendments that might improve it.  This is the proper procedure as was illustrated in respect of the Fire Services Act in respect of which there was a very good debate during a period of a couple of weeks.  Many valid arguments were put forward during that debate and the Minister saw fit to go a long way to meeting us in respect of our suggestions.  Unfortunately, there is no such opportunity in regard to the Bill before us, a Bill which represents a change of emphasis, a whole reorganisation of the local authority system. As the Minister has told us, the SDA loans are about to be abolished.  We had hoped to be able to raise a number <Col N="2253" /> of matters concerning the operation of this new legislation and in relation to many other relevant matters concerning it but we are not being given that opportunity.</P>
    <P>There are some very good points in the Bill but there are some aspects of it on which there should be more debate in order that we might determine what exactly is involved.  What is before us represents a new form of financing, financing by way of funds other than those used now.  I do not see this change leading to any extra capital being made available for housing because the borrower will have to pay the top rate.  In addition there is the cost of administering this scheme.  There are many questions that need to be answered.  For instance, who is to make the returns yearly in respect of income?  Will they be made by the employer or will the responsibility fall on the Revenue Commissioners in terms of the end of year returns?  In any event there will be a very much increased work load involved.</P>
    <P>In regard to housing generally, I am very much an advocate of rural development in this sense.  In many parts of the country there has been crowding into towns from rural areas.  In my county it used to be said that when a girl married, her mother would say, &ldquo;Take your caravan and head for the biggest town possible. That is the only hope you have because if you remain in a rural area the engineers will not wish to know of any problems you may have&rdquo;.  When I was in the Department I used preach to country managers about the desirability of building up the villages, because in that way we maintain schools, shops and, of course, people, in the rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree very much with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Another effect of this crowding into towns is the strain imposed on the various services.  For instance, the extra demand for water, especially with the extension of the boundaries to about three miles, is very great and that is why people in the towns often complain of an <Col N="2254" /> inadequate water supply, particularly at weekends.</P>
      <P>County councillors must accept a certain amount of the blame for this situation. They have not been vocal enough in endeavouring to bring about a spread of housing.  Perhaps I was guilty, too, in that respect in my earlier days as a local representative though on every occasion possible I raised this subject.  There are many people who do not wish to go to the major urban areas.  They would prefer to remain in the villages if they could get housing there.  I am always very pleased when I hear of a local authority buying land for housing in a rural area, whether by compulsory purchase order or otherwise.  There have been many instances in which there has been an outcry about a school closing after the pupil numbers had dropped to the extent that it was no longer viable to maintain a school.  We were collectively at fault in that regard in failing to bring about the spread of housing that was necessary.  I am glad that the Minister agrees with my sentiments on this matter.  So far as county managers or engineers are concerned all I can say is that where there is a will there is a way and that they should do everything possible to maintain rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>Another point I wish to make concerns compulsory purchase orders.  This is a difficult area in which various legalities are involved but it should be possible to speed up the process.  In recent times I am glad to find that there has been some speeding up but more is needed.</P>
      <P>So far as I know the average time from the date of which a notice is lodged in the papers to the date of the final declaration is about nine months though it may be a year or longer.  We would be doing a good day's work if the process could be speeded up.  In some instances landowners set out to make situations awkward for local authorities.  These landowners engage in delaying tactics.  They may plough the land and say that it is more valuable than ever.  I have no sympathy for such people.  There are some landowners who would not part with even a tiny portion of holdings of hundreds of acres.  I have no time for them, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2255" /> Another difficulty in this area relates to accommodation that is rented.  That creates a number of problems also and will create problems in the future.  It is a complex matter and something which we have not examined in detail.  When we left office we had built an all-time record of almost 28,000 new houses.</P>
    <P>We were accused of not having made sufficient money available for housing.  In the four years in which we were in office, we raised the income limits and the amounts on four occasions.  When the Coalition Government were in office they did not raise the limits at all.  When they left office the limit was still £2,350&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before we left office we made the necessary money available as we did every year.  Last year we built 28,000 new houses, which was a record. We cleaned up the mess which the Minister's party left.  We brought in an incentive in April, which was welcomed by the <Col N="2256" /> building industry.  The SDA loans at present are gone because the Government have brought in regulations to that effect.</P>
      <P>We will be taking Committee Stage of this Bill tomorrow and we shall try to get as much information as possible as to what the implications are.  There is a change of emphasis in the financial arrangements: the Government are transferring money from one area to another but it is the borrower who will have to pay and guarantee, with the backing of the Government, the financial institutions which are getting gilt-edge protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has just heard a certain amount of cross-talk as to what limits were imposed by various Governments on the SDA loans scheme. Having been a member of a local authority for some years, like other Deputies I have always felt that the limits, both as to the amount of loan available and the income limits that were imposed, were always inadequate, irrespective of which Government were in power.  We, as members of local authorities, always had people coming to us during the terms of both Governments complaining about the inadequacy of the limits and we were well satisfied that they were inadequate to meet urgent housing needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as this Housing Agency Bill and the concept that is proposed here are concerned, I have very grave genuine fears and worries about the concept of what is involved.  I will be looking to the Minister to alleviate, if he can, many of the real fears I have as to how it is going to operate in practice and what it will mean in reality.  The Minister referred to the fact that a 20-year typical loan from a building society, where the gross repayments in the first year would amount to £3,846, represented 43 per cent of his income.  It must be pointed out that the repayments to a building society are compounded of both a principal and interest. I am sure the figure of 43 per cent is correct.  How will the situation be under the proposed new scheme where the repayments are to be index-lined?  I would like to have this clarified.  I am not an accountant but it would be reasonable <Col N="2257" /> to anticipate that, during the forthcoming year and perhaps for the next few years, the rate of interest which would have to be paid by any person who is unfortunate enough to borrow on this index-linked basis, would be 20 per cent.  I do not think that is unreasonable because of the way interest rates are going at the moment and the indications of the way things will be.  The yield on Government stocks is running at around 18½ per cent plus.  Here one must add administration and financing costs of the agency which will have to be built into the cost to be charged to mortgagees.</P>
    <P>Therefore it would not be unreasonable to assume that the opening interest rate would be 20 per cent.  If a person borrows the maximum loan of £22,500 at 20 per cent, the interest alone that he would have to pay would be £4,500 annually, which is not 43 per cent of his income but 50 per cent.  And that is only the interest, what about capital repayment? At least when a person is paying 43 per cent to the building societies he is getting his capital repayments down a bit but here &mdash; I may be wrong and if so I hope the Minister will correct me &mdash; the interest element alone will be at least 50 per cent of his income.</P>
    <P>Reading the Minister's speech I understand him to have said that of course the person need not meet all that, that he can lengthen the period and carry forward the burden towards the end.  I wonder how that aspect of it will work.  It could be carried on forever throughout his lifetime. If the person is unable to meet his interest payments, to say nothing of capital repayments, his capital repayments would go forward into year two and would be substantially higher.  This will be on an ever-growing basis.</P>
    <P>A young couple taking on a new house for the first time will be faced with a 20-year mortgage period.  Looking forward, 20 years seems like a very long time, but at least there is an end to it, but I fear that under this scheme we are not talking about a 20-year period but forever, a lifetime.  It seems to me there is a real risk here that people will be taking on mortgages and the likelihood of which is that they will never get rid of them in <Col N="2258" /> their entire lifetimes, that the period of capital and accumulated interest will mount up, get bigger, and that not even the ravages of inflation, savage as they are, will be able to meet that situation.</P>
    <P>To index-link the rates of repayment on a mortgage would be a very serious step that would require very great care and consideration and I do not see how it can be contemplated unless we reach the point when pay and wages also will be index-linked to enable parity to be achieved.  As we know, wages and salaries are not index linked.  Therefore the tide is running against the mortgage holder all the time.  Index-linking is irrepressible, it carries on year after year. Can it be that all the mortgagee has to do, <i>ad infinitum,</i> is to pay 16 per cent or 18 per cent of his earnings?  How can that be, as a long-term proposal?</P>
    <P>The Bill requires the agency to make ends meet but there will be no source of funds to the agency other than what they will borrow on bonds, and taking one year with another the agency will have to make ends meet.  Therefore, there must be some limitation on the push forward period envisaged in the Minister's speech but not in the Bill.  As each quarter or half-year period comes the agency will have to find the money to meet the interest and to repay the capital as and when it falls due for repayment.  Their source of income will be the repayments they will receive from mortgage holders, and if payments are deferred year after year &mdash; it seems to me to be highly likely that that will happen &mdash; the agency will find great difficulty in meeting interest payments.</P>
    <P>The whole concept of what is involved here worried me.  It is throwing into the ravages of the open market place the person who is trying to buy a house at the lower end of the market, the person who needs subsidy and protection, and I do not think the essential supply and demand that would be necessary even to consider a free market force would apply here.  Therefore, there is an obligation on the State to provide protection and subsidy to the people at the lower end of the scale, but what we appear to be doing here is the reverse.  The reality will be <Col N="2259" /> that people at the upper end of the scale will have a better deal because they will be in a position to obtain their loans from building societies whose interest rate at present is 16 per cent, whereas those at the lower end will be faced with 20 per cent, maybe a bit more or less.  That seems to me to be an entirely incorrect concept.</P>
    <P>Here is the play of the unfortunate development that has taken place in politics, which proposes that there can be a no-cost benefit scheme.  This has been a fault of Fianna Fail and of us on this side.  There cannot be a no-cost scheme because all schemes that are intended to be applied for the benefit of the people have a cost, and that cost has to be met.</P>
    <P>I will say this for the Bill: it is innocuous. The worrying part about it is the speech that introduced it.  It seems to me that many of the matters in the speech might more appropriately have been in the Bill because when the Bill has been passed it is the law and none of the matters in the Minister's speech will be the law.  If one goes to court it is the Act which will be the guiding force.  When I first read the Bill I thought it was intended to operate it on a different basis. It had not occurred to me that it would mean the scrapping entirely of the local authority loans scheme.  That would be a tragic development.  As the Minister indicated in his speech, that scheme has been very well administered by very dedicated people in the local authorities for upwards of 80 years.  They did a magnificent job.  The limitations of that scheme were not local authority limitations.  They were imposed upon them by successive central Governments from both sides of this House.  Those limitations caused its shortcomings in so far as it had shortcomings.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the direction of this concept, of this new agency, would have been a topping-up provision, as it were, to provide for small but very necessary second mortgages for those people who, with the benefit of such a second mortgage, could have availed of the existing local authority loan schemes, suitably <Col N="2260" /> adjusted.  They need topping up.  The capital and the income need topping up. If provision were made for second mortgages of perhaps £2,000 or £3,000, or a suitable cover amount of that nature, it would make all the difference in the world and would bring into the capability of buying a house at reasonable rates very many thousands of people who have not got that facility at present.</P>
    <P>I was heartened when I saw a specific reference in one of the sections of the Bill &mdash; we can look at it on Committee Stage tomorrow &mdash; to the question of second mortgages.  I do not see any reference in the Minister's speech to how that would operate.  Would the Minister consider preserving the local authority loan scheme providing as it does for loans at some kind of reasonable interest rates, even in these difficult times, which would enable people to get their houses, coupled with the top-up of a second mortgage?</P>
    <P>I would not have minded if the small second mortgage element, £3,000 or something of that nature, had to be raised even at a higher interest rate through an agency such as this, if that would have made the difference.  One would have wished to have it at a lower interest rate for those people but, at least, it would have been confined to the top-up element and not to the bulk of the purchase money, the £22,000 or thereabouts which would be typical.</P>
    <P>The scheme has to be self-financing.  I find that a very worrying factor in the inflationary times in which we are living. Reading through the Minister's speech and doing my own rough calculations, I find it very difficult to see how it will be self-financing without having a cut-off point where at some stage the agency will say to an unfortunate house owner who has a thick rope around his neck of a mortgage getting bigger by the year as each year rolls on: &ldquo;We have carried you for a year, or two or three years.  Now we have to meet the repayments on our bonds.  We have no choice but to call in your mortgage and insist that at least you will meet the interest payments and make a contribution towards paying off the capital.&rdquo; At that stage the amount he will <Col N="2261" /> owe will be vastly in excess of the amount he borrowed originally if he has availed of the opportunity of deferral referred to in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>The key question in this whole matter of house buying relates to the cost of the house itself, because that relates to the amount of the mortgage which will be required.  In this connection I am disappointed that steps have not yet been initiated to implement the Kenny Report to control the price of building land.  That would be a very vital and key factor if introduced and implemented.  It would bring down the price of new houses in particular by reducing the price of building land.  I find it indefensible that, over the years, successive Governments have failed to bring in that provision.  It is part of the joint programme and I should like to see it introduced as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>To sum up my position, I have a very real and genuine fear on this matter.  I fear for the abandonment of the SDA loans scheme and its replacement in its entirety by a mortgage scheme which will have inordinately higher cost and interest repayments.  I fear for the people who will be compelled to go into the market to buy a house and find themselves with no choice or no alternative but to avail of the scheme at highly exorbitant rates of interest, the future course of which they will know nothing.  There will be very major guesswork here.  A person may take up a mortgage at 18 per cent today. He will have no way of knowing what will happen.  The following year it may be 20 per cent or 25 per cent.  The escalation of interest rates and inflation indicates that the trend is still upwards.  I know the Minister has indicated that it is the Government's hope and expectation to reduce that rate in the years ahead.  I sincerely hope they will be successful.</P>
    <P>We have to remember we are carrying a very heavy burden of foreign debt incurred for the most part during the tenure of the previous Fianna Fáil Government, who borrowed that money irresponsibly for non-productive purposes. That burden is there and that debt is there.  It will be extremely difficult to bring down the rate of inflation.  I wish <Col N="2262" /> the Government and the Minister great luck in doing so.  We have to accept the very real risk that it may not be possible to do that, that inflation may creep upwards, and that people who avail of this scheme may find themselves and their families in a very deep and difficult situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. While the Bill is of an enabling nature and is, therefore, somewhat vague, it raises a number of very large and important issues about the whole question of financing housing.  It is important to try to clarify some of these points.  We have just heard Deputy Taylor enumerate some of the reasonable questions which arise on any inspection of the material available to us so far.</P>
      <P>Apart from those general points which would occur to any reasonably concerned reader, in my own case I gather that I was cited as a co-respondent of some sort yesterday by the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  I was given as claiming some sort of paternity for the offspring we have before us today.  I should like to clarify as carefully as I can the sort of ideas and proposals which I put forward in the past, ideas, which at a later stage when we were in Government, were developed into proposals which were looked at not only within the now defunct Department of Economic Planning and Development but also within the Department of the Environment. I would have assumed that before any proposals came before this House from that Department, they would have dealt fully with the various issues raised in the earlier proposals in which I had some involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to set the record straight.  There are really two sides of the question to be looked at in turn.  One is the position of borrowers, people who want to buy their own homes and who find it difficult to do so with the existing financial arrangements.  The second set of questions that arises are those on the lending side.  If we are going to make available some form of inflation-proofed paper for pension funds or for <Col N="2263" /> life assurance companies we must look at the way in which that is done to ensure that it is consistent with the overall management of financial markets and with the overall handling of the Government's finances, that it does not adversely affect the way in which the Government deal with their other borrowing needs.</P>
    <P>I want to take each of those in turn. First of all, then, there is the position of borrowers, people who want to buy their own homes and find it difficult to do so. We are all conscious of the way in which that difficulty is magnified during a period of high inflation.  We know that in effect what has been happening is that home ownership is becoming like a very exclusive club, where the initial subscription one has to pay in order to join has gone up very rapidly year by year.  That initial subscription is the size of the deposit people have to pay in order to secure a house.  The actual mortgage repayments in a period of high inflation take up a very large and growing fraction of people's incomes in the early years.  The figure quoted in the Minister's opening remarks was one of as much as 43 per cent of a person's income going on mortgage repayments in the first year.  Once one has got into the club, once one has managed to pay one's deposit and managed to meet one's mortgage repayments in the first years, then, with inflation, the real burden of those repayments falls very rapidly.  After all, if one looks at the situation of someone who, say, bought their house 25 years ago &mdash; the sort of house which is typical of the numbers mentioned in the Bill &mdash; back around the 1960 mark that house could have been bought for approximately £2,000 and the mortgage repayments would have been of the order of £10 a month.  It was a fairly heavy burden at that time on people buying their own homes but those repayments now constitute less than 1 per cent, on average, of people's incomes in those cases.  Therefore the conventional mortgage as we know it, in a period of high inflation, works against people getting started but becomes progressively easier as the years go by.</P>
    <P>It was the recognition of that problem <Col N="2264" /> that caused me and a number of my colleagues to investigate ways of getting around that difficulty.  Hence the suggestion of an inflation-linked mortgage, the idea being that a person would borrow their sum of money &mdash; let us say, £20,000 &mdash; and, instead of having to pay the high mortgage rate of 16 per cent, 18 per cent or whatever, would pay a very small interest rate.  Here I have to say, with respect, that I am not sure Deputy Mervyn Taylor was right in his reference to the Government's proposals &mdash; and this is one of the things I want to tease out &mdash; whether or not, with the Government's proposals, one would find borrowers having to pay very high interest rates in the earlier years.  I can see why he may have been confused.  I want to make it quite clear that any inflation-linked scheme I would support would have to be one that avoided that difficulty.  Therefore, let me try to say what I would envisage happening.</P>
    <P>The borrowers would borrow their £20,000 on which they would pay a very small, real interest rate &mdash; let us say 2 per cent.  Obviously they would have to make some capital repayment each year, as is the case with every other mortgage &mdash; let us say 3 per cent.  Therefore one could envisage a total repayment of interest and capital of approximately 5 per cent each year.  Hence, on a £20,000 mortgage the repayment in the first year would be, say, £1,000.  That repayment would increase each year in line with inflation so that, if inflation is 10 per cent a year, on average those repayments would go up from £1,000 in the first year to £1,100 in the second, to £1,210 in the third, and so on.  In that way one is giving the person taking up the mortgage a chance of spreading their repayments in a way that fits in better with what is happening to their pay packet.  Naturally, we would assume that on average, people's incomes would rise each year also in line with inflation.  After all &mdash; going back to my earlier example of the £2,000 house of 20 years ago, probably costing approximately £40,000 today &mdash; the reason people can pay £40,000 today is in part because their incomes have also risen twenty-fold in the meantime.</P>
    <P>For that reason an inflation-linked <Col N="2265" /> mortgage of the type I have just described &mdash; namely, one which has very low cash payments in the first years of the mortgage &mdash; would make it more manageable in cash terms for prospective house buyers. Also it would mean that over the lifetime of the mortgage the mortgagee would find himself or herself paying out sums of money which, while they would increase each year, would reduce in real terms.  After all with a 10 per cent inflation rate they would certainly be paying, as against £1,000 in the first year, £7,000 or £8,000 by the time they got to the twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth year of the mortgage.  Of course the actual cash sum they pay would grow very large but so too would their income.  Therefore, as a proportion of their income no greater burden would be involved.</P>
    <P>That is the first point to make clear.  I have to say it was not made clear in the Minister's opening remarks when he said:</P>
    <P>The borrower will be charged an index-linked mortgage rate...</P>
    <P>It is not quite clear what is meant by an index-linked mortgage rate.  In fairness to Members of the House it would have been much more helpful had the Minister attempted to spell out the actual financial implications of mortgages as they would operate under the scheme.  I can see why Deputy Mervyn Taylor, and indeed Members on all sides of the House, could feel that the proposal before us today would actually worsen the situation in the early years for mortgage holders rather than make it easier for them by reducing the size of the cash payment in the earlier years of their mortgage.</P>
    <P>That is the basic point I should like to establish &mdash; that the sort of proposals which I first put forward publicly in newspaper articles in 1975 envisaged a very low cash payment in earlier years, rising with the rate of inflation, so that the real interest payment made to the lending agency insulated or maintained the value of the initial sum loaned.  That is the first essential point to be clarified.  It is important for me to do so because the initial proposals emanating from the Fine Gael <Col N="2266" /> side &mdash; and I say Fine Gael as distinct from Labour because, as I recall, they were referred to in Fine Gael'a election literature &mdash; spoke about setting up this housing agency with some form of inflation-linked mortgage.  However, they spoke about the repayments being geared to the income of the borrower and not being linked to what was happening to inflation.  I notice that there has been a very subtle shifting of ground between the first statement of Fine Gael proposals, the repetition and enlargement of those proposals at election time last summer and what we have before us today. What we have before us today is a statement which reads:</P>
    <P>The borrower will be charged an index-linked mortgage rate...</P>
    <P>Further down in the Minister's remarks he said:</P>
    <P>...actual loan repayments under the new scheme may be made on a pay-related basis.</P>
    <P>I would certainly like to know, before this Bill passes into law, whether we are seeing another retreat from some of the high-blown and half-baked schemes that have been gushing out of the Fine Gael Party will over the last year or so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Call it what you wish but I think it is important for the Members of this House to be quite clear that your original scheme is definitely one which I would never support. If you are now shifting your ground and coming over towards a proposal which I would support I would be happy to know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for reasons such as this that Members on this side of the House did not wish to see a hasty discussion on this Bill and a rushing through of legislation which has important implications for the whole management of housing and for the various financial institutions.  I would like to have as much clarification as possible before we rush through with a guillotine <Col N="2267" /> vote on this legislation by tomorrow night.</P>
    <P>If I may take it then that pay-related repayments are no longer an essential feature of the scheme and, therefore, can be assigned to the limbo of irrelevancy and if we are talking about a genuine index-linked scheme, I would also like to have it made clear that we are talking about an index-linked scheme of the type which I have described, namely one which charges a low rate of interest in the initial year and which then increases the annual repayment in line with the rate of inflation so that the actual cash payments by a person taking up such a mortgage are very much smaller in earlier years than with existing loan schemes and then rise over the years.  If we could have that aspect of it clarified then there are attractions in a scheme of that nature.  It would then make it possible for many people, who at the moment find home ownership something which is just beyond their reach, to buy their own homes.  We all know of cases of young couples who are trying to scrape together the money to get the initial deposit or, in some instances, where they achieve that goal they are deterred by the fact that they cannot make the repayments on the size of the loan needed for the house which they have in mind.</P>
    <P>If we can bring down those initial early year costs of home ownership that will be a very worthwhile step.  It has always been the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party to encourage home ownership to the maximum extent and if we can devise satisfactory arrangements which enable more people to secure their own homes I imagine that most Members of this House will regard that as a desirable step forward.  We are certainly not willing to give an immediate blessing or support to a scheme which, as earlier enunciated from the other benches, was of a quite different variety and one which would have operated very unfairly against lower income families.  It would have been unfair to ask low income families to commit themselves to paying a proportion of their income over time.  If they were to do that, what you are saying is that if they <Col N="2268" /> were ever to succeed in improving their real income, if they were to secure promotion in their job or if their real pay level rose through time, they would find themselves faced with, in effect, an additional income tax on their particular earnings. They would always be committed to paying 18 per cent or whatever of their income by way of repayment on their loan.  So, irony of ironies, the party that goes around talking about greater equality and helping the poor and all the rest of it would itself be initiating some form of house finance scheme which deliberately taxed lower income families at a higher rate than those who were better off in the sense of being able to afford the existing conventional mortgage.  I hope we will hear no more about pay-related mortgage repayments.</P>
    <P>I want to look now at the lending side of the operation, where they get this money, why it should be available, and whether it is a good thing to take it on. From my own discussions with people in various financial institutions I have no doubt that there would be relatively little difficulty in raising substantial sums of money by way of inflation-linked borrowing on the part of this agency, because pension funds, life assurance companies and so on all face a real difficulty in trying to place their money in some form of long-term investment which would keep its value over time.  I know there are many people who are concerned that this might be an undesirable development, who feel that if we do this we are protecting large powerful, rich, financial institutions against inflation, that we are taking the risk away from them and placing it on the shoulders of the people who are buying their own homes.  It is undoubtedly true that if the agency is to function as described and as it should function, that will be the case.  The risk of inflation has shifted from the lender to the borrower. I would say, provided you borrow your money from a specified institution, this is not a bad thing.  Who are the pension funds and who are the life assurance companies? The biggest life assurance company in this State is, in a sense, owned by the State anyway, so you are not giving the money to any capitalist.  Even in cases <Col N="2269" /> where you are dealing with privately owned insurance companies or pension funds, what happens to these moneys? What are they being used for?  Who do these institutions need to protect against inflation?  The answer is that they are trying to provide pensions for the people who pay the premimums to these companies. Who are those people?  The very same people, in most instances, who are trying to buy their own homes.  So it is taking it out of one pocket and putting it back into the other.</P>
    <P>It is very necessary to contemplate making available some form of inflation-proof investment for genuine pension funds and life assurance companies. At the moment there is a very real injustice.  The only people who can enjoy inflation-proof pensions are those in the public sector.  I am not opposed to public servants who have served the State loyally over the years being able to enjoy adequate provision for retirement, but I do think there is something wrong with a system which does not allow the same advantage to people in the private sector, many of whom work just as hard, many of whom are exposed indeed to much greater risk in their employment and in their income than those in the public sector.  It is unfortunate that with our present system none of those people can be given a guarantee of an inflation-linked pension.  The best they can hope for is a 5 per cent increase in the value of their pension each year because that is all existing revenue arrangements can permit. It is simply not possible for private financial institutions to guarantee protection against inflation.  I would have thought it was a good thing to make it possible for people in private sector employment to have open to them the possibility of an inflation-linked pension in the same way as people in the public sector.  A way of doing that is to allow approved pension funds to place the relevant amount of money in this Housing Finance Agency, to make their funds available for investment in this way. Although on paper this is transferring the inflation risk from the lender to the borrower it would fulfil a very desirable social function, provided it was done with <Col N="2270" /> the appropriate safeguards.  This is an important aspect which needs careful consideration to make sure that money is raised in a way which helps those who need this type of pension provision and is not diverted into less urgent or less deserving avenues.</P>
    <P>Another question which will be asked is whether this will upset the whole working of the financial market.  After all, some companies can place their funds in this agency and be guaranteed against inflation.  How will the Government be able to raise the rest of their borrowing by way of conventional gilt-edged securities paying a fixed rate of interest and therefore providing no hedge against inflation?  I recognise that this question exists and the answer has to be that if the agency draw only the limited amount of money which they need in any one year it should not have too unsettling an effect on the market because once the agency have got their £50 million or whatever sum is required that is the end of that bargain for that year.  In the case of difficulty in selling conventional gilts, there is no reason why there could not be some sort of pairing arrangement so that big institutions would get so much of the index-linked paper only if they also undertook to buy a certain amount of gilts.</P>
    <P>It would be fair to comment that the overall management of the financial market can be done adequately by the Central Bank and the other authorities making sure that the overall flows of credit are properly supervised and other forms of security, whether gilt-edged or short-term lending through Exchequer bills, will find their own price in the market as they do at present.  I would not feel that the impact on the financial markets would be necessarily harmful or undesirable in the long term, provided it is properly managed.  I would agree that if this new form of security were simply tossed in without any regard to its impact on other institutions and other types of financial lending, then it could have unnecessary unsettling effects.</P>
    <P>There is no need to have an elaborate agency with large numbers of staff. Essentially the agency is required to act <Col N="2271" /> as a middleman or channel for collecting funds and distributing them to the various existing mortgage agencies.  The reason for having an agency of some sort is to have an identifiable office or body to which financial institutions can refer when they want to place their funds.  If a pension fund or a life assurance company want to take up £10 million or £20 million of these inflation-linked securities, they know which office to contact.  A relatively small number of staff will be required and only £50 million per year is being sought. I suspect that could be arranged in a few conversations within the space of a day or two because these institutions do not want to deal in trivial amounts of money and are much more likely to want to place millions of pounds on some sort of regular basis.  They manage very large flows of funds.  The taking-up of the money from institutions does not require an elaborate staff.</P>
    <P>The reference in the Minister's speech to auctioning or offering by tender may not be the most appropriate method.  I would have some reservations on that score which I will not go into at this juncture because it is not the most appropriate place or time to do so.  I suggest that this aspect be examined before any final decision is taken.</P>
    <P>Once the agency have arranged their finance there is the question of distributing funds to people who want to borrow. I agree with the view expressed by the Minister that this should be done through existing bodies such as local authorities.  There is no reason for the agency to deal directly with any person who wants to buy a house.  It would be much more sensible for them to allocate appropriate sums to local authorities. There is no reason why funds of this nature should not be distributed by the agency to other institutions such as building societies, because in principle the agency are acting as a mechanism to facilitate house buyers who want to get a mortgage in this form.  One could envisage the agency allocating parcels of money to various private institutions such as building societies as well as official institutions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2272" /> The basic case for some form of inflation-linked mortgage is to get over the problem posed with existing mortgages of very high cash repayments in the early years and the inflation-linked mortgage does this by lowering initial repayments. I do not think we should go so far as to give 100 per cent of a mortgage in this form.  For convenience of administration one might envisage lending inflation-linked sums in various proportions. There might be several options open to the house buyer.  He might have half his mortgage inflation-linked and the other half in the conventional form and the proportions could be varied.  The amounts might be rounded to the nearest thousand to facilitate administrative work in calculating the changing repayments each year.  This would give the prospective buyer a package of finance and a combination of options involving some increase in his total repayments every year because of the growth in the inflation-linked part of his mortgage but the overall repayment not growing as fast as inflation as a whole and, hopefully, not growing as fast as his income.</P>
    <P>The final point that arises from that suggestion is: what happens in cases where the borrower is not able to meet the repayments, whether through losing his job, sickness and so on?  In my opinion the best way to try to cope with that problem is to build a small fraction of an insurance payment into the basic mortgage agreement, to have in effect a form of mortgage protection policy which caters to a reasonable limit for loss of earnings, whether it be for three months, six months or whatever.  I do not see how we could provide total cover because we do not attempt to provide total cover with existing mortgages.  While it would be nice to envisage attempting to do this, I do not think we can never arrive at a situation which will provide perfect security for every person.  The world is not like that.  We all have to live with various hazards and uncertainties.  All we can do is to attempt to put forward reasonable measures that can accommodate a large proportion of circumstances so that the majority of people would be adequately catered for by an inflationary mortgage <Col N="2273" /> scheme which had some form of mortgage protection policy and that would not be very expensive to provide.  This would cater for the majority of instances of loss of earning power, whether through sickness, unemployment or death.</P>
    <P>Those are the main points I wish to make.  At this stage we are only dealing with the general principle of the Bill, not the details.  I have attempted to make clear that we recognise there are difficulties in a period of high inflation for people attempting to buy their own homes, especially people who are on the margin of being able to afford to venture into house purchasing.  If we can devise new forms of financing arrangements which can overcome some of those difficulties and increase the degree of home ownership, that would be a desirable step forward and we should be willing to explore ways of doing that.</P>
    <P>However, while the intention may be good and the basic idea may be appropriate, we should not rush off with half-baked ill-conceived schemes.  For that reason we would like to see spelled out in greater detail the manner in which this agency would operate, the precise details of the way they would give mortgages and the terms on which those mortgages would be available.  It is very important to make clear what is meant by an index-linked mortgage rate.  I have given my views about what I imagine would happen, but it would be interesting to know if that view is shared by the Government. If we could have clarification of these matters and if we were given some idea how the agency would function and who would be responsible for their activities, we might be able to give a more considered verdict on the proposed housing agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the introduction of this agency at this time as very opportune because there is a need for innovation in the area of home financing.  Anybody who has been involved in local authorities knows the stop/go method that has prevailed in regard to the availability of finance for house borrowing. The establishment of this agency is particularly opportune in the light of the <Col N="2274" /> housing survey being carried out at present and in the light of the White Paper to be introduced in early 1982.  We know from experience what this survey is likely to find.  It will categorise the people in need of housing and itemise the number of houses built over the years.  Even with all those figures it will be difficult for the survey team to get to the root of this sad but truthful situation, namely, that finance has not been available on a continuing basis to help young people purchase their own houses.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately Government White Papers in the past decade have increasingly taken on a lack of credibility.  A Government White Paper succeeds a Green Paper which is the result of discussion and decision when setting out policy.  Unfortunately there seems to be a lack of political will to put into effect what can be put into print.  That is why I believe this agency will breathe new life into the area of home finance.</P>
      <P>In recent years money has been very badly needed to provide houses for young couples.  Money was needed to stop once and for all the haphazard method by which local authorities provide money.  I have heard only too frequently that couples who applied for loans were told after a very lengthy delay that their loans had been approved.  They had to wait another long time before the money was made available simply because the Government of the day could not provide the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now more than ever a new source of finance is needed and this agency will provide the basis for that.  The Minister set out some of the merits of loans under this new scheme, advantages which do not exist under the present SDA loans scheme.  The agency will not draw a distinction between new and existing houses.  Loans will not be confined to married persons or persons about to marry.  A person who applies for a loan will not be obliged to prove that he cannot obtain a house purchase loan from a commercial agency.  Loans will be available for a home owner who wishes to buy a bigger house because his existing house is unfit or overcrowded.  Loans will also be available where a home owner is <Col N="2275" /> obliged to obtain alternative employment in another area and wishes to buy a house there.  This applies particularly to key industrial workers.</P>
    <P>In none of these instances in the past few years have the necessary facilities been available, simply because the finance was not available.  With the establishment of this agency I see an opportunity for local authorities to fulfil their obligations by providing one of the basic needs of life, namely accommodation for young people at reasonable rates.</P>
    <P>The criticism of the Opposition ranged from being vague and a little mischievous to being very responsible &mdash; from wondering whether offices would be built around the country and who the directors would be, to a confidence that this agency may have a capacity for achieving even more than is set out in this Bill.  It is with this confident attitude that the Government brought in this Bill.  They seek to have that confidence translated into the only effective terms that mean anything to young people &mdash; to know that money is available for them for housing when the need arises.</P>
    <P>I accept the sincerity of the reservations expressed in regard to the Bill, especially the reservation concerning the abandoning of the SDA loans scheme.  If that scheme can be replaced with something better I will not shed any tears at its demise.  It has been a stop-go operation. It involved a policy of limitless cost, in that it did not matter what the cost was because the State would foot the bill.  A stop had to be put to that sort of mentality because the State cannot continue paying bills which increase year after year, especially when people begin to adopt the attitude that the State is there to pay those bills regardless of from which quarter they may come.</P>
    <P>I accept the genuineness of the concern expressed in relation to the imposition on borrowers at times of high interest rates but the answer to this lies in the reduction of inflation, a reduction that is reflected in the interest rates for borrowers.  Our policy is to reduce inflation and if we fail in that respect we will have failed in our <Col N="2276" /> policy.  It behoves all of us to strive to reduce inflation.</P>
    <P>Listening to some of the speakers on the other side I got the impression that behind all the questioning and the reservations lies a sort of inbuilt regret that they were not the authors of this scheme. The last speaker told us that as far back as 1975 or 1976 he mentioned a scheme on the lines of the one proposed.  We can all speculate on what might have been but we might ask ourselves what mileage Fianna Fáil would have got out of a policy like this in the election campaign having regard to their superior PR machinery. However, the Bill is the brainchild of Fine Gael.  It has evolved in the past two years and today is proposed as permanent legislation.</P>
    <P>There must be certain basic criteria in respect of any new legislation and, if this criteria can be met with confidence, even in advance of the establishment of the agency, the undertaking is well worth while.  The potential of the new agency may be far greater than any interpretation of the Bill would indicate.  The questions we might ask in respect of this agency are, first, whether it will provide more money for housing.  It is the sole purpose of the Bill to do that.  Secondly, we may ask whether it will be less costly for the State in their getting away once and for all from the no-limit attitude, from the attitude that the State will alway foot the bill.  If the new arrangement proves to be less costly to the State, it will be justified.  The third question is whether it is within the capacity of the borrower in the early years as well as in subsequent years to meet his repayments. If inflation is reduced, that will be the position.  There is the advantage of the borrower being in a position to meet his commitments in the early years in particular. The fourth question is whether the scheme will provide an increased number of houses.  For far too long we have had the situation of local authorities providing houses for those at the lower end of the scale; people in the middle-and upper-income brackets were in a position to meet their mortgage repayments on houses in the £35,000 to £40,000 bracket, while in between there was a mass of <Col N="2277" /> people who were not in a position to obtain the necessary finance either from local authorities, because of the limits, or from building societies because of inability to meet the repayments.  It is to fill that gap that the agency is being established. I am confident that the four aspects of the criteria will be met in full and that when the agency is in operation it will be very fruitful in terms of Irish society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ClementCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister on his presentation of it.  Indeed, I welcome any measure designed to ease the disastrous situation throughout the country but particularly in my own constituency in respect of housing.</P>
      <P>Of course, we must wait until the scheme has been in operation for some time to find out what the results of it will be.  We have not come here to oppose the measure but to investigate the various details of it as well as to question matters that we consider should have been included but which are omitted in the Minister speech.  The Bill is so important and far-reaching in its provisions that it is very unwise to rush it through the House and it was in that sense that we opposed it.  We had been hoping to be given time to debate it properly.</P>
      <P>People on both sides of the House have been questioning many of the items in the Bill.  There are many areas that are not clarified in the Minister's speech and I am at a loss to know why this is so.  As the last speaker has said, the scheme has been under consideration for more than two years.  I would associate myself, too, with the remarks of my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, who said that a scheme such as this has been under consideration within Fianna Fáil for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not sorry or ashamed to associate ourselves with any measure which would alleviate the worries and fears of many people who find themselves lacking a facility that is of paramount importance to anyone who gets married &mdash; to own their own home or at least to be living in a home which they could eventually own. <Col N="2278" /> I am sure it is the wish of everyone in the House to make a worth-while contribution and attempt to help those people who are less well off and not in a position to secure a loan or build their own house. This Bill seems to shift the responsibility onto the shoulders of the borrowers and put them at risk, whereas it offers a guaranteed investment to the financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The element of business speculation will be shifted from the financial institutions and laid, should anything go wrong, at the doorstep of the Exchequer.  It is obvious that there would be no difficulty in securing finances under the terms of reference here since it has a guarantee incorporated in the Bill.  Over the last number of months, and this can be established by consulting with the housing authorities in Donegal, many people who have even small loans from the local authority, either under the SDA loan or what was known as the low-rise mortgage loan, are finding themselves in difficulty. It is my duty to be very careful about seeing that this situation is not aggravated. Under the terms of reference of this Bill, the borrower will be more at risk than the lender.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives me an opportunity to highlight the depressed state of affairs in the constituency which I represent.  In 1980 a survey was carried out, in conjunction with An Foras Forbartha, and it was established that there are approximately 7,200 unfit and overcrowded houses in County Donegal.  It also established that there is a prospective need, over the next five years, for something in the region of 6,000 houses.  This leaves a total of approximately 13,000 houses to be provided in County Donegal over the next five years.  If we look at the pattern of construction of houses in the county to see if we are progressing or going back in Donegal, at present we have tenders on hand since early this year &mdash; and some since last year &mdash; for 184 SI cottages.  We have a further 82 houses ready to go to tender and approved applications this year to date for 1,000 houses.  Included in these figures are the small type structures referred to as demountable dwellings. On checking the figures, even in the <Col N="2279" /> provision of demountable dwellings, there is a very marked decrease this year. In 1978 we provided 28 demountable dwellings, in 1979 30 demountable dwellings, in 1980 23 demountable dwellings, and in 1981 only seven demountable dwellings.  This is a terrible reflection on the housing programme in County Donegal, regardless of what administration are in office, particularly in the Year of the Disabled.  Although many of these old people are not completely disabled, many have a degree of disability and it is disappointing to think that this was the contribution we made to those people who were possibly the least well off in the country and not in a position to do something for themselves.</P>
    <P>One may ask why there is such a demand for housing in County Donegal and what the population trend is since our last census.  In 1971 the population of County Donegal was 108,344.  In 1981 the population has increased to 124, 783, which represents an increase of 16,439 or approximately 14 per cent.  We are not in a position to meet the housing demands of the county.  Donegal County Council are at present endeavouring to deal with a total of 2,350 applications for housing. That is a staggering figure.  It represents all housing needs, SI and SF houses which were tendered for but not built, local authority houses and demountable dwellings. When our housing need reached such an alarming stage, we decided to meet officials from the Department and we presented a very well-documented and accurate case to the Minister &mdash; I do not have to recap on that case &mdash; and the only assurance we got was that Donegal would get its fair share next year.  I am wondering what our fair share is going to be because I have outlined the need that is there and the very slow, grinding-to-a-halt manner in which we are tackling the problem.</P>
    <P>In 1977 we built 225 houses, in 1978 200 houses, in 1979 266 houses, in 1980 162 houses and in 1981 177 houses.</P>

      <P>They are there to be questioned if necessary.  I did not misquote the figures.  We have schemes of houses in progress in Killea, Falcarragh, Convoy, Ballyshannon and Carndonagh. I am sure the Minister of State will verify that there were 97 applicants for 16 houses in Convoy and that 50 of those applicants live in grossly unfit and over-crowded conditions.  The terms of the Bill do not offer anything to the people of Donegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The people I am referring to are not in a position to apply for SDA loans.  If they were capable of meeting such repayments we would not have 2,000 applicants for houses to Donegal County Council.  The arrears chart of Donegal County Council is on the increase because many people are not able to meet the repayments on their loans even though they are small.  There is no relief in the Bill for such people. There is no ray of hope for them.  Those on the housing list of Donegal County Council are desperate.  Many of those who live in unfit and overcrowded conditions <Col N="2281" /> are unemployed and, consequently, cannot negotiate a loan.  I am sure the Minister of State has had representations about the scheme in Convoy because there were many disappointed people in that area.</P>
      <P>In Donegal we build approximately 1,100 houses annually, taking into consideration local authority and privately built houses.  In the next five years there will be a need for 14,000 houses in the county and one does not have to be very bright to realise that we will not meet that target.  In fact, we will not even hit the board.  I am not here to criticise the legislation but I am concerned that its provisions will not help the people of Donegal.  I should like to contradict what has been said on the Government side about loans and the number who have applied for loans in County Donegal.  In 1979, 377 house loans were approved, in 1980, 430 were approved while in 1981, 446 were sanctioned.  That is a long way away from the number of people in need of housing and it will not make any impression irrespective of the type of loan scheme that is introduced.  Donegal needs a sizeable injection of capital to build houses.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to judge whether the legislation will be successful, and the Minister admitted that in the course of his speech.  If we have to wait 25 years to find out if this new agency will work satisfactorily it is too long to wait.  There are many aspects of this rushed legislation that are difficult to understand and similar fears have been expressed by Government Members.  The main factor is that financial institutions are given a guarantee.  that is an indication that somebody must pay the piper and in this case it will be the borrower.  Bearing in mind that the legislation has been in the melting pot for more than two years it is surprising that it does not contain more original ideas.  Our concern is to look after those in need, not the financial institutions. We are concerned about those in need of housing who are not in a position to provide for themselves.  The legislation does not attempt to protect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only new and questionable element in the Bill is that if the scheme does <Col N="2282" /> not work it will be rescued by the Exchequer. That type of guarantee to investors is very attractive because there is no risk involved.  If this proves successful for the financial institutions it will open up the gates for similar schemes in many other areas.  It gives an unfair advantage to the housing agency <i>vis-à-vis</i> other existing lending institutions.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Government Deputies and was taken aback when Deputy Barrett said the provisions of the Bill were a breath of fresh air.  For the people in my constituency who are seeking loans there is no fresh air in it.  Our main concern now is where our people will go to find work when they become unemployed and unemployment figures are increasing month by month.  Not this year or last year have we found it increasingly difficult to draw industries into our county because of its isolation.</P>
    <P>It is with our young people in mind that I question the benefits to be enjoyed from the provisions of this Bill.  One has only to visit any town with a regional technical college, like Letterkenny or Carndonagh, to see the floods of thousands of young students coming out to ask where or how they will get jobs, where they will live.  In a few years those young people will not accept lip service from Governments when they make their demands.</P>
    <P>I question the supposed beneficial effects of this legislation.  There is the matter of staffing the scheme.  I sincerely compliment the local authority staffs who deal with loans and I am disappointed that instead of this Bill we are not making much more finance available to local authorities to continue their loan schemes.  In Donegal we have a small, efficient staff to deal with the entire county and delays only occur through documentation going to and coming from the Department of the Environment, such things as CRVs and certificates of exemption.  When a deputation met the Minister we asked him to try even a pilot area involving a few counties which are well served by staff, in an effort to remove the backlog, the red tape, the letter-writing to the Department.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any difficulties in the local <Col N="2283" /> authorities implementing this scheme.  I am sure Deputy Harte and other Deputies have experience of negotiating loan applications.  Two years ago it was necessary to have two sureties and they had to give their names and addresses and the names and addresses of their banks. Surely there is no necessity for such bureaucracy when the council have the title to houses worth £30,000 or £40,000; surely there is no need for sureties at all.</P>
    <P>Difficulties will arise in this scheme, possibly, in relation to self-employed people who have no involvement with accountants and who do not want to have anything to do with them.  We know the incomes fishermen have.  In the year when some boats caught 1,000 cran of mackerel each and it was sold for so much per box, it was said they must have made a packet.  People forget that in winter their boats are tied up for 14 or 15 weeks at a time.  How can you estimate the wages of such people?  The same applies to small farmers.  As far as I am aware full-time farmers will be exempt from many of the regulations that will apply under this scheme.  All these questions my constituents will be raising.  There will be, as there have been, questions in regard to the establishment of absolute title.  Many times I have raised the question of a person applying for a simple house loan.  He had to pay not only his own solicitor but the council's solicitor as well.  Surely there is room for improvement in that respect when people in my constituency are scraping for the money to build houses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett said this legislation would encourage people to own their houses.  I agree it will encourage the better-off type of applicants but it is no source of encouragement to people struggling on lower incomes.  If I were asked for a partial solution to the housing problem I would suggest immediately a genuine cash grant scheme.  In 1972 an applicant could avail of a higher rate of grant, £900.  In Donegal it was known as &ldquo;the farmers' grant&rdquo;.  The income limit was £1,500 and for the average type of small dwelling, three-bedroom house, the loan applicant could buy all the materials necessary <Col N="2284" /> for that £900.  That scheme was a great incentive to the self-employed, the fishermen and small farmers, to build their own houses.  They did so, and an enormous number of houses were built.</P>
    <P>Since 1972 under successive Governments we increased that grant by only £100.  In present day conditions if we were to offer the same incentive we would have to give a cash grant without strings of £5,000.  The £1,000 grant for new houses is on its way out.  Many of the people I represent would prefer the type of cash grant I have been talking about with which to buy the materials and build their own houses.  If we are to tackle the problem seriously we must increase the cash grant.  This would be particularly beneficial to a man who is farming or fishing and who has a certain amount of time to spare.  Many of these people will not undertake to build a house costing £12,000 or £14,000 if the only grant they will get is £1,000.  Since 1972 the only increase in that grant was £100.  I cannot express any great satisfaction with the increase granted by Fianna Fáil, but it is worth recalling that when Deputy Tully was Minister for Local Government he tried to abolish the grant completely.  He suggested that only those who qualified for a supplementary grant should get the Departmental grant of £300.  In the subsequent election he got an answer to his endeavours.</P>
    <P>The low-rise mortgage scheme was mentioned.  I was very disappointed that the Government saw fit recently to discontinue that scheme which helped the type of applicants I am speaking about. The applicant's interest and repayments were subsidised for the first ten years. The applicant, his wife and one child had to be living in unfit or overcrowded conditions for a year prior to the application. There is now a special category loan of £14,000.  Many people who would have qualified under the old scheme are frightened of the repayments on this special category loan.</P>
    <P>I said I did not see any great reason for rushing the Bill through the House this week.  It is a Santa Claus effort for the financial institutions.  Unlike the borrowers, the financial institutions have not got <Col N="2285" /> a hole in their socks.  My main criticism of this Bill is that there is a lack of guarantee for the borrowers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett referred to the statement made by Deputy Reynolds when he queried the administrative section of the Bill.  Deputy Reynolds was of the opinion, as I am, that the existing staffs of the local authorities will not be able to implement the scheme without supplementary staff.  That is reasonable because of the financial and other implications involved.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be of benefit to people in industrial areas, people who are sound financially.  There will be many applicants. I do not see any great attraction in the Bill for the people of my constituency. Will the counties which are classified as the poorer counties get a more sizeable capital allocation by virtue of the fact that there will be very few applicants? I saw a television programme recently dealing with Tory Island and the question of people from that island being housed in a scheme in Falcarragh.  The commentator referred to the mainland as the poorest part of the islands off Europe. This raises a serious question mark over the status of County Donegal and its problems in relation to housing.</P>
    <P>Over the past couple of years I have met a number of people who are in the poverty bracket.  When I first became a member of the county council, the usual problems I met with were concerned with housing grants, delays in house inspections, house improvement grants, water and sewerage grants, or the construction of minor roads.  Today an increasing number of people find difficulty in meeting their grocery bills.  A scheme such as this will do nothing for them.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear Deputy Taylor say he hoped a serious attempt would be made to protect borrowers.  This is our major concern on this side of the House. He also questioned the scrapping of the SDA scheme and the low-rise mortgage scheme.  Deputy O'Donoghue referred to a mixture of both.  The fine print of this Bill will be of interest when it is enacted but by then it will be too late for us to go back over it.</P>
    <P>I am also in agreement with Deputy Taylor about the implementation of the <Col N="2286" /> Kenny Report on the price of building land.  Wealthy people are coming into our county.  They can afford to buy a site for a summer home.  They offer £3,000 or £4,000 for a site and that puts up the value of local land.  Young people who have just got married and are looking for a site find that the price of land has been raised in a poor county like Donegal to the level where a site in the vicinity of Donegal town costs in the region of £8,000.  We have to put £30,000 on top of that to build a house.</P>
    <P>There was an interesting discussion on this Bill this evening, but people on the other side of the House showedso little knowledge about it that I begin to wonder whether it is not another one out of the bag of tricks of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, like the circular on the national school which is going through whether we like it or not, and whether some people on the other side of the House like it or not.</P>
    <P>The Minister's introductory speech made it absolutely clear that our reluctance to take this Bill before Christmas at such short notice was justified.  I say that mainly because of the lack of detail on a number of issues to which it will give rise. Apart from the issuing of bonds to financial institutions and so on and the guaranteed return it means that the risk of inflation will be transferred from the lending financial institution to the new agency and, almost certainly through the new agency, back to the borrower.  This will give rise to this type of system being used in other fields.</P>
    <P>A serious defect of the Bill is that there is no indication of how the agency will be managed.  If this Bill has been in preparation for over two years I should have imagined that by now that aspect would have been well and truly thought out and presented in conjunction with its introduction.</P>
    <P>There is an indecent haste on the part of the Government to rush this Bill through without any consideration being given to the many important issues this new agency and its methods of operation raise.  We in Fianna Fáil will not oppose the establishment of the actual structure because it is of such a general nature we <Col N="2287" /> shall probably be able to use it for some suitable purpose in the not too distant future.  Now that we have some idea of what the Government envisage, we intend considering in depth the many issues this new agency and its methods of operation raise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  This is my second occasion to speak in this House, the other having been on the Youth Employment Agency Bill.  Both of these Bills constitute concrete evidence of the Government's commitment and action in the area of young people, whether it be in regard to jobs or housing. The Opposition would be very quick to point out if we broke any promises in relation to any matter of policy.  Therefore we should be quick to point out on this side of the House when our promises are kept in full.  This agency was promised not only in our election programme but also in our programme for Government, 1981 to 1986.</P>
      <P>Nearly all of the Opposition speakers have commented that the passage of this Bill is too swift, that they have been given insufficient time to study it properly. There are two points I should like to make about that.  One is that, as a new Member, it strikes me that Members' contributions in some ways might be called ineffective in regard to their actual input in legislation and in relation to Government or Opposition amendments incorporated in such legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the concept enshrined in this Bill.  It would be very easy for the Minister and the Department to add another layer of bureaucracy to housing finance agencies, be they local authorities or building societies.  I would point out also that there has been no Green Paper or White Paper in this instance.  Instead we have got straight down to the measure to which we were committed.  As was pointed out by the Minister, the type of finance about which we are talking in the first year of this agency's operations &mdash; £25 million to £50 million &mdash; will constitute absolute evidence that this will not be in any way a cosmetic maneouvre but rather a real attempt to ensure that a <Col N="2288" /> certain category of people will be able to build or buy their own homes.</P>
    <P>When we speak of housing basically we are talking about one of the most fundamental things required of a Government or of a politician.  As the deputy leader of the Labour Party said some months ago: if politicians in Government can provide housing and jobs, the rest of the services is almost indulging in luxury.  The fact that £25 million to £50 million will be spent on building houses, on the blocks and mortar, means that there will be an immediate spin-off effect on jobs.</P>
    <P>I should like to outline the housing situation in my constituency in County Wexford and its dilemma at present. There are approximately 1,500 to 1,600 applicants for local authority housing, that is for vacancies in houses constructed by the local authority as well as isolated applications, to have houses constructed. Indeed, we inherited a particularly grave situation in the middle of this year.  I can think of three schemes in my electoral area in respect of which there was insufficient money in Wexford County Council for their completion, not to speak of any new starts for next year. Therefore I welcome an extra £500,000 being given to Wexford County Council and, as a result of a deputation, an additional £115,000 for this year's allocation. This will go some way to ensuring that houses started this year will be finished and that there will be some new starts for next year.</P>
    <P>In municipal areas such as Enniscorthy Urban Council, in respect of most houses allocated and advertised, there is a ratio of 6:1 &mdash; six unsuccessful applicants to every successful one.  I know this Bill does not relate to direct capital allocation for housing.  But, given the present situation in which there is only so much money to go round, if more money has to be injected into this area for those who cannot afford to build or buy their own homes, there is then less for loans to encourage people to build or buy their own homes.</P>
    <P>The situation obtains also that those in the middle income bracket who wish to build or buy their own homes have access to SDA loans.  In 1980, for example, <Col N="2289" /> there were £2.1 million spent in this area by Wexford County Council.  This year it appears that £2,500,000 will be spent. According to the officials there are approximately 350 applicants &mdash; in other words, approximately 350 families &mdash; of which 300 will be successful, all of whom would have incomes of under £7,000 per annum.  There is then the other category, those people whose incomes amount to £12,000 or £14,000 who can go into a local building society office and who, provided they meet all of their requirements, have some chance of building or buying their own homes on loans negotiated at commercial rates.  But in between, and this is the whole point of this Bill, there lies a category of people &mdash; for instance, somebody whose income amounts to only £8,000 per annum &mdash; who have no chance whatsoever of getting a local authority house or of obtaining an SDA loan.  The building societies would laugh at such people simply because they were not in a position to raise the necessary savings even to be considered for a loan.  That is the real immediate need for this Bill &mdash; to fill that gap.</P>
    <P>We must look at another aspect also. For example, when one provides loans one does so on a credit basis.  But whether such loans be given for housing, manufacturing industry or whatever, there is always an investment input.  There is a very effective investment and incentive feature in this Bill.  We must pose the question: who is investing money in housing at present?  The answer is: young couples who need to get a loan and who must effect savings initially.  But of the percentage of all people's savings we see far more being put into shares, into investments in other companies, into short-term speculative interests.  Approximately 18 months ago an inquiry was carried out in Britain as a result of which it was recommended that anybody with savings, with liquid assets, should invest them in building societies.  This has not been done.  Therefore this agency will afford people that opportunity, through index-linking, through definite return in real terms for their money.  Hence, we should now see much needed money and investment going into the housing field.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2290" /> I also welcome the independence of the agency.  Too many new bodies, or layers of bureaucracy set up by legislation passed through this House, are dependent on the budget and the economic constraints of the times.  I am glad to note that this agency will be independent and, if it is successful, that there will be no taxation requirement.  Here there is a double aspect in so far as, if it is costly on the Exchequer, it will have to be recouped in indirect taxation.  The other factor is that, if taxpayers' money were to go into it, it would be robbing Peter to pay Paul, simply because the middle income group, who would be paying the tax to keep this going, would be the people who would be benefiting from it, because this is basically for the low to middle income categories who would be availing of these loans.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the details of this Bill have not been gone into but one can clearly assess from the Minister's speech that the very clear intention is there that this would be available to the people and would be useful in real terms.  We see that it is available for single people, and this is to be welcomed.  We see that £9,000 per annum is the maximum figure but somebody could have a wife earning perhaps £6,000 a year.  In their case there would be a total income of £15,000 a year and because the spouse's income is disregarded it would be even more effective. The fact that 90 per cent of the total net amount of the purchase price of the house is to be given out is a clear indication of the usefulness of this.  I know in my own constituency that if many people want to buy a house through an auctioneer the first thing they have to do is to put down a deposit of 25 per cent, a quarter of the total amount.  Under this Bill 10 per cent is the amount that is needed.  It is not unfair to ask people to have this sort of money in savings.  Up to three times the gross income of the previous year is available, and with inflation every year that is over three times.  I know the SDA loan is only two-and-a-half times the income with the very rigid maximum of £7,000 and £14,000 available.</P>
    <P>The fact that local authorities will operate this, that people will not have to <Col N="2291" /> apply to Dublin to get it, shows that we are bringing it to the people and that we mean business.  In all these measures there is a clear indication that we want this to work, that we want people to apply and that it will be really effective.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of comment on both sides of the House in regard to the repayments.  There has been the question whether people will in fact be better off or whether, as some independent financial experts have said, they will be ripped off.  I would not accept that at all.  It is written into the Bill or the Minister's speech that it is basically on their ability to pay and it is done <i>pro rata.</i> The flexibility on the repayments as regards unemployment is very welcome.  That does not apply in the case of building societies, where, if someone loses his job or has a permanent injury he has no comeback whatever.  Also if a person were to win the sweep, he would have the opportunity of paying it all off.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, when the agency is set up, to ensure that the instrution goes out that there should not be a repetition of the difficulties being experienced with SDA loans, the difficulty of getting provisional approval, final approval, certification of title deeds, the sealing of the mortgage.  There should be a simplified procedure and all applications dealt with expeditiously.  People, especially when they go to auctions to buy a house, would like to know where they stand within a fortnight.  If this is to be effective it is most important that the processing system be very rapid.</P>
    <P>As regards repayments there are two guarantees written into it that are far more equitable than the SDA loans even where there are fixed interest rates.  I agree with the concept of repaying more when the money is devalued.  At 20 per cent inflation the pound is worth 20p less each year and the fact that they pay that extra 20p when they can afford to is fair. At present if somebody gets a loan and is unlucky enough not to get the mortgage subsidy, the real crux for them is getting over the first five years.  Then they come to the stage with inflation, with a 10 or 12 per cent increase in their wages every <Col N="2292" /> year, that they are paying back devalued money.  The concept of paying back more of the devalued money and in real terms paying back the same amount is far more equitable and reasonable for a young couple who might have young children when they start the loan and when they get half way through the 25 years the children would be grown up and their whole standard of living affected.</P>
    <P>I think we should also look at the overall housing policy.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that he is finalising the White Paper for next year.  The essential criterion is the housing stock of the country. We know that over 50 per cent of the population is under 25 and the housing stock must bear some relation to the population. In all 87 local authority areas there are many old council houses on hands.  The rent may be a fixed one of £2 or even less.  To repair windows and so on would cost £200.  If money is scarce I believe it is better to sell those houses off reasonably cheaply so that there will be some cash flow to build more houses. The needs of the people in the caravans, and in rented flats at atrocious rates, to get a roof over their heads is far greater than the needs of a tenant who has been there for 20 years.  Why should she or he not pay for their own repairs?  There must be a re-assessment there.  To get the housing stock up to any realistic level there must be private development.</P>
    <P>We must welcome the development of this agency because it is not involved in the public sector.  The houses that will be built will be built by private development, whether it is by groups or individuals. This is the only way we can approach the overall problem of the housing stock.  Other countries such as Canada, America and our EEC partners do not have our traditional attitude towards house ownership.  I would question whether any young people are economically wise to put a millstone around their necks to ensure that they own their own house.  In other countries it is not uncommon for people to lease a house or apartment for most of their lives.  Repayments on any type of loan have a crippling effect and can affect a couple's whole <Col N="2293" /> standard of living at a time when they may have young children.  The agency should examine this question with a view to changing attitudes in this area and encouraging developers to build houses for renting on a fair and equitable basis. There is an urgent need for the building of such houses yet we have this crazy system whereby people feel that they must own a house.  A change in that attitude would be a major step forward.</P>
    <P>It is accepted by all engineers and by Department officials that it is cost-effective for houses to be built in groups so that electrical and sanitary services can be provided on the one site rather than in isolated developments.  Co-operatives have a great role to play here and this should be encouraged by the agency.  In Enniscorthy there was a development of 12 houses and the urban council sold the sites.  It would have been ideal for development by a co-operative but they could not get a unified approach to raising the money.  The agency should examine the idea of registering all co-ops in order to encourage their development and make them really effective.  This would be a way of helping people to acquire their own homes.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister whether the £3,000 mortgage subsidy will apply to all loans serviced by the agency or will apply only to loans for new houses.  Will it apply at all?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <P>It is important that there should be close consultation and liaison between the agency and building societies. I would not like to see a situation where a State agency would be in direct competition with experienced professional groups in this area.  The new scheme is aimed at helping the marginal house purchaser earning up to £9,000 but that figure will obviously have to be raised as money devalues in order to cover the same income group.  When this figure comes up for review there should be close liaison between the building societies and the agency to ensure that there is no overlapping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2294" /> I welcome the Bill because it is equitable in providing for consistent repayments in real money terms.  It does not depend on the Department of the Environment or the generosity of the Cabinet at each budget but is independent in its statutory base and has the financial grip to raise the money.  It will fill the gap for those people who cannot get SDA loans or building society loans and also help to increase the housing stock.  I commend the Minister and wish the agency every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Like other Opposition speakers I regret very much that it has not been postponed until the next session to give the opportunity to the Government to study its very serious implications.  The Bill has not been well worked out and is premature, and the effort being made to push it through is grossly unfair.  As a result this will not be properly debated legislation.</P>
      <P>I read with great interest the speech by the Minister this morning.  As has already been said by another speaker, the courts will not have to comply with that statement but rather with the Bill itself.  The Minister merely outlined his personal views and when this agency is set up he will have very little direct personal involvement in their operations.  That is a major shift in policy by the Government because the Minister will not be answerable in this House at Question Time in relation to the agency.  I do not see any provision in the Bill that would allow a Deputy to put down a question on the agency's operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is transferring responsibility from the successful SDA loan system to a new agency and passing the buck.  Since he took office the SDA loan system has been dramatically watered down.  I believe the policy of the Government was to phase out completely the SDA loan system and many of the regulations and memoranda circulated to the local authorities have indicated this policy. I would refer to the debate last week during Private Members' Time regarding restrictions on SDA loans introduced by this Government.  These loans were <Col N="2295" /> restricted to married couples or those about to marry but the Minister has now lifted this ban.  When he took office in July he set about phasing out the SDA system and is now bringing forward this legislation to justify his actions.  The Minister has reversed many of the decisions taken since the Government assumed office in July.  Loans will not now be restricted to married couples but will also be available to single people.  I welcome the fact that there are no restriction, although I would prefer to see this extended to the SDA loan system also.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>That date has no relevance to the circular the Minister sent out restricting the loans to married couples. He removed the loans from single people and brought in new regulations referring to the procedure for obtaining a loan &mdash; the letters from the local authority, the parish priest and so on.  We discussed that last week in detail and I will not go into it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's policy since he took <Col N="2296" /> office has been to phase out SDA loans. He now proposes to bring in this new Housing Finance Agency to take responsibility for SDA loans.  In his speech he clearly stated it was envisaged that at full operation the new scheme would replace the local authority loans scheme.  That is the Minister's policy.  He is replacing a very effective system which has provided thousands of homes.  We increased the SDA loan to £14,000 and increased the income limit to £7,000, and we did not include the spouse's income.</P>
    <P>The Minister is handing over lock, stock and barrel full responsibility for housing to a private agency which will have no accountability to either House of the Oireachtas for their day-to-day running. I ask the Minister to reconsider the situation and to bring in an amendment to allow for this agency to be accountable to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are entitled to that and I am surprised any democratic Minister would hand over such a responsibility to a company which was set up under the Companies Act.</P>
    <P>I have found the SDA loans system to be very effective and it was operated very well by the local authorities, up to this year.  For the first time I noticed there has been a change of emphasis by the Government and this has affected the smooth operation of the SDA loans scheme.  It has made it extremely difficult for local authorities to decide who are eligible for loans.  This is due not to a restriction imposed by Deputy Burke when Minister for the Environment but to this Government's policy decision. Now we know why this decision was taken, why they have undermined the SDA loan system.  We now have a situation where the Government have introduced the Housing Finance Agency Bill, 1981.  This Bill is being rushed through this House and when the budget is introduced on 27 January the allocation for SDA loans will be reduced dramatically. That will mean the Government will have to raise less money for the Exchequer because responsibility for housing will be pushed over to the new housing agency which will raise money from lending agencies and pension funds.</P>
    <P>We will reach a stage where the Minister <Col N="2297" /> will have very little responsibility for housing if he hands over these responsibilities to a private company.  This is not a semi-State body: it is a company the Minister is setting up.  He will have no direct involvement in the day-to-day running of that agency and it will not be accountable to either House of the Oireachtas.  In the Bill it says that the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, can issue policy directives to the agency and copies of such directives must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and published in Iris Oifigiúil. That does not mean the agency will have accountability to this House.  When Deputies put down questions looking for information about this agency they will be ruled out of order because the Minister will have no direct responsibility for the agency.</P>
    <P>The Minister is proposing to phase out the £3,000 mortgage subsidy introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government last April.  This subsidy has been a major boom to the building industry, to young couples and to single people.  In his speech the Minister stated that the subsidy would be paid directly to the agency and not to the loan applicant.  That is another shift in Government policy. During the election campaign the Fine Gael Party in particular gave a clear commitment that they would enforce the £3,000 subsidy.  Does the Minister propose to phase out the £1,000 grant as well as the £3,000 subsidy?  I hope he answers that question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have preferred the Minister to increase the SDA loan to £15,000 or £16,000 and the income level to £8,000 or £9,000.  That would be a great help.  We increased these figures to a very realistic level before we left office. If we were in office now we would have <Col N="2298" /> to update those limits.  We would not have stopped single people obtaining loans.  They too are entitled to them.  The Minister is now suggesting that the agency ignore the income of the applicant's spouse.  At present the spouse's income is taken into account by the local authorities because of the Minister's circular. I ask him to reconsider that circular in the light of his speech made here today.</P>
      <P>Under this legislation the SDA loan system could have a very short life.  I believe the finance for this system will be reduced in the 1982 budget and I regret this very much.  The Minister should tell the House if he proposes to retain the SDA loan scheme which has been effective down the years.  We would have preferred a better opportunity to consider the contents of the Bill.  I understand that we will be submitting some amendments but we will not have an opportunity of going into the terms of the legislation in great detail.  In the interests of the State and the borrowers the Minister should have given the Opposition, and the public, a better opportunity of considering all the implications.  There are not adequate safeguards in the Bill and many complex questions remain to be answered.</P>
      <P>We are not against the concept of such an agency if it can be shown that it will help relieve the housing shortage but we are against phasing out the SDA loan scheme.  The new scheme will not be of great benefit to borrowers and people will see that when they study the inflation and pay related aspects of it.  They will find that it is not an attractive scheme when they have to borrow over a long period.  I accept that there are provisions to cater for those who become ill, but it must be remembered that in that event the period of the loan is extended with the result that many people will never own the house.  They will be in hock to the agency for life and will hand over the debt to their family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us that the new company will be established six or seven weeks after the Bill passes through both Houses and that loans will be available a short time after that.  He said that the agency will act through the 41 local <Col N="2299" /> authorities that are effectively administering the SDA loan scheme at present. It must be remembered that the officials involved will not be answerable to the Department but to the new agency.  The Bill does not propose to delegate authority or control to local authorities.  Decisions regarding loans will be made in Dublin.  Local housing officers should have a say in regard to the allocation of loans.  The Minister will not have direct responsibility for the day to day running of the agency while county councils will be operating the new scheme.  Who will be responsible for paying the staff involved?  In my view this amounts to another method of taking the local authority burden off the Department of the Environment and putting it on to the new agency.  That is a serious political decision which will have repercussions for the staff of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell us what the status of local authority staff responsible for housing will be when the agency is set up.  If the staff will be the responsibility of the agency they will be moved from State employment to employment by a private finance company.  Will those people have any say in that move?  The SDA loan scheme at a fixed interest rate of 12½ per cent is a very attractive proposition for borrowers and it is not surprising that there are many applications for the loan of £14,000.  I should like to know what the position will be in relation to the £4,000 reconstruction loan scheme operated by local authorities.  Will that scheme be transferred to the agency?  I do not see how the agency will be empowered to pay out a loan for reconstruction work.  The agency appears to be confined to new houses.  Such a defect will impede the operation of the agency.  Will it still be possible to obtain a loan for a house attached to a business premises as is provided under the SDA loan scheme?  At present the area of the house is dealt with under a separate folio and there is a separate charge by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Section 1 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;house&rdquo; includes any building or part of a building used or suitable for use as <Col N="2300" /> a dwelling and any outoffice, yard, garden or other land appurtenant thereto or usually enjoyed therewith;</P>
    <P>That could restrict loans and might mean that loans would be restricted to separate houses built on separate land but not attached to business premises.  Much discretion is being operated by the local authorities and I have found that they will provide a loan for a private house attached to a business premises but not when the business is operated in the house.  That is another matter which may not be covered in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Once the Bill is passed the Minister will have no direct responsibility for the agency.  He may issue requests to them but he will not be in a position to issue directives.  In other words, he will not be able to interfere in the running of the agency.  Under section 6, however, with the consent of the Minister for Finance he can issue policy directives to the agency, copies of which would have to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> The Bill is very restrictive in the sense that it makes no provision for the Minister to issue a directive in any particular case, whereas in the case of the SDA loans scheme any Member of the House could bring a case to the attention of the House or of the Minister, who ultimately is accountable for the operation of the scheme.  What we are doing here is voting ourselves out of business so far as housing is concerned, and that is very serious.  I appreciate the reservations being expressed in particular by Deputy Taylor about the implications of the Bill.  Indeed, I should not be surprised if the Minister had a revolt on his hands having regard to the concern that has been expressed by some of his colleagues on this issue.</P>

Obviously, there are serious reservations among Members of the Labour Party on the legislation.  Consequently, I hope they will have the good sense to vote with the Opposition.</P>
      <P>We would have no objection to the Minister re-introducing the Bill in the next Dáil session.  That would give us an opportunity of going into its provisions in detail and of putting forward amendments as we consider necessary.  I am confident that the Minister would accept many of those amendments.  Good legislation is needed in the whole housing area because of the implications of any such legislation for all young people who may need to borrow for housing in the years ahead.  The offer that will be made to the lending agencies as a result of this legislation is very attractive, especially in regard to pension funds, but let us consider the position of the people who will be borrowing the money.  The big institutions will be making money on the backs of the borrowers.  The Government are not making any input so far as subsidising loans is concerned.  I appeal to the Minister to take on himself the power to give to the agency the right to subsidise loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government withdrew the subsidy on loans from building societies.  That was a major blow to borrowers.  In this legislation the Government are to some extent projecting the image of doing something great, but I wonder how pleased those backbenchers who are applauding the Bill will be in about six months' time when the SDA scheme is withdrawn, when the £3,000 mortgage subsidy is withdrawn and when, perhaps, the £1,000 grant will be phased out.  The Minister has given an assurance that the latter grant will be continued and I hope <Col N="2302" /> he will keep his word on that.  Many people are relying totally on the £3,000 subsidy in order to be able to secure a house.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be man enough to request the Cabinet to postpone this Bill until he has had time to consider fully many of the points put forward.  If we were dealing only with Second Stage before the recess and taking the remaining Stages later, we would be doing a much better day's work.  We are as concerned as are the Government in providing finance for housing.  Therefore, we would not in any way attempt to impede the passage of good legislation in this area, but for very good reasons we are not satisfied with the details of this Bill. We have been attempting to highlight many of the problems that will arise in the future if the Bill goes through in its present form.  When we return to office, be that in 1982 or 1983&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we will retain the general concept of the agency but will bring forward amendments to tighten up the whole process.  The Minister is taking on himself a very serious decision in bringing forward legislation which in its operation is likely to be found ineffective. The situation will be very attractive to the people who are providing the finance for the agency in that the money will be guaranteed and inflation proofed.  One wonders why the ordinary members of the public will not be given the opportunity of providing finance for this agency since many people would be tempted to invest on such terms.  However, that would involve major competition for the building societies who would be likely to be out of business overnight.  There is no other loans system operating in this State, or so far as I know in any other State, which is inflation proofed and index-linked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the most attractive bonds ever offered in the State because young people will be paying for those loans in the long-term.  The agencies and the pension funds will finance this legislation but, <Col N="2303" /> in the event of finance being restricted in any way, the Minister can provide funds from the Exchequer.  However, it is possible when the Bill comes into operation that the Minister will not be in a position or will not be prepared to provide finance for this agency and the number of loans which will be provided over the years will be limited.  Irrespective of what the Minister may say, there must be a limit to the number of loans which will be provided under the Bill, but that is not outlined in the legislation before us.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the new agency should procure its funds by way of issuing bonds to financial institutions.  The important point about the bonds is that they will be inflation-proofed.  No other country has provided such an attractive offer.  Will the Minister be restricting the borrowing to this State or will he be seeking finance from overseas?  Financial institutions all around the world will be rushing into the State to provide funds for this agency if it is inflation-proofed. We have a strong economy and a stable political system.  The financing of this agency will have to be watched very carefully and I ask the Minister to state whether the financing will be limited to Irish institutions operating within the State or will this agency be allowed to provide funding on the open economies of the world?</P>
    <P>The Minister should lay down a policy decision in this regard because the agency will have far too many powers to decide where they will provide and obtain their financing.  The financial institutions apparently will be guaranteed a definite return of 2 per cent or 3 per cent over and above the rate of inflation.  This means, in effect, that the risk of inflation will be transferred from the lending financial institutions to the new agency and to the borrower.  This will be a major imposition on young people who have to work and provide the funds for the moguls of Switzerland or anywhere else who, unless there is a directive given by the Minister, will be providing much of the finance for this agency.</P>
    <P>This concept of enabling financial institutions to lend to a State agency on the <Col N="2304" /> basis of a guaranteed inflation-proof return is an innovation which must be looked at very carefully.  The Department of Finance should reconsider this. Was this a Cabinet decision?  If so, it must have been taken very lightly.  It is a strange innovation which is not available anywhere else in the world.  Can the Minister name any other country which provides such an attractive offer to people who are providing the finance?  The offer which the Minister is making may be a great boon to business moguls but it is no asset to the young people, who may be conned into believing they are getting a good deal.  However, when the details are spelled out, when the journalists and the in-depth magazines have an opportunity to study the implications of the Bill, there may be few offers from people to borrow money from this agency as soon as they realise what it will cost them in the long-term.</P>
    <P>Who will run this organisation?  That is something which will have to be decided by the Government and which will have very serious implications because they will be laying down the overall policy. The people who run the organisation will decide how it operates and who gets loans.  The Minister will have to define very clearly what power the board of this organisation will have and if the local authorities will have an input to this organisation.  Will the local authorities be represented and will they have a right to nominate members of this agency?  The Bill should state how people will be nominated. The local authorities will to a great extent be operating this legislation when it becomes law, but the 41 local authorities will have no power unless the Minister decides to give them a say in the operation of the company when it is set up.  At present every local authority have their own housing offices and they decide on loans subject to ministerial directives. Up to July they had discretion but it has been limited in the last few months.  The whole system operated very well.  There were no restrictions on loans to a single person, to a person who was about to be married or to married couples.  Up to quite recently when a person had repaid the first mortgage they gave a second <Col N="2305" /> mortgage to build or buy a new home. That restriction should be lifted in the present system.  But I note in this Bill that this restriction would not apply to an applicant seeking a second loan where the need arises.  I feel that should also apply to the SDA loan system.</P>
    <P>Governments have always resisted borrowing money on the basis that it should carry the inflation risk rather than the lending financial institutions.  This is a major shift of Government policy and I wonder if it has been gone into in great detail to decide on the implications for further borrowing from other companies and agencies in the State.  If this Bill comes into operation and if this offer is being made to the agencies, organisations and pension funds, will all the money be moved into this area and taken out of other areas of business activities in the State?</P>
    <P>When the ESB are floating a loan, will they also have to make a similar offer? This is something which will have serious repercussions and ramifications throughout the economy and should have been gone into in great detail.  We are deeply concerned about this because in the long-term it will be a very costly exercise.</P>
    <P>We are not opposing the setting up of the agency but we are concerned about the whole housing policy of the Government and about the proposed solutions in the Bill.  We are concerned about our inability to debate the Bill section by section, line by line, in Committee because it is being jackbooted through the Oireachtas.  It will not be as effective as it might have been if we had been given an opportunity to debate it fully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased at the opportunity to welcome this Bill which I regard as a product of new thinking which has not been evident in proposals of this kind for many years.  It is a break with tradition, an exciting development, because it seeks to tap resources previously untapped, for the benefit of people who are in dire need of funds to provide them with housing.  For these general reasons the idea in the Bill must be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker supported the principle <Col N="2306" /> of the Bill.  The &ldquo;new poor&rdquo; is a phrase that has become nearly a cliché. They are the people who cannot be accommodated in local authority houses and who cannot turn to the building societies because they cannot afford to face the high level of repayments in the early years of occupation.  They have been caught in a real trap and have become part of the new poor.  That is the section for whom the Minister proposes to do something and in this Bill he has introduced an ingenious way to do it because it will mean they will be able to repay.</P>
    <P>People who want to own their houses but who are just above the local authority limits can barely manage to repay the 40 per cent to 50 per cent of their incomes in the early years of mortgages.  They are being dumped on to local authority housing lists and this Bill seeks to remedy that.  Of course there are risks attached to this legislation, and of course we would all like to have more time to discuss it, but the idea is good and the approach of the Government in this Bill is justified.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment briefly on a few aspects of the Minister's statement. There is not anything magic about the scheme proposed in the Bill: people will not get anything for nothing, but instead of the high percentage of their incomes they would be paying at the beginning of their mortgages, diminishing to a small percentage at the end, this Bill evens out the percentage of income for the servicing of housing loans.  The figure is about 18 per cent, which is not excessive and is the kind of percentage prevalent all over Europe.  It allows people to get into the housing market who otherwise would not be able to do so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the simplicity of the Minister's approach because the Bill will help to remove red tape which means that applications will be speeded up.  The fact that single people as well as married people can apply to the agency will be welcomed by all, although we all must appreciate that married people with children deserve priority.  That is not discrimination. The fact that the Act will be operated through the local authority system <Col N="2307" /> rather than through a newly-created bureaucracy is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I was glad to note that within six weeks of the passage of the Bill the Minister will be able to receive first applications and that loans can be granted at the end of three months.  That is a noteworthy achievement at a time when such a service is required urgently.  The level of loans of up to £22,000, and in certain circumstances above that, is a recognition of the cost of new houses.  The fact that old houses are not excluded is important because in many of our cities there is a serious problem about urban renewal. Therefore, the exclusion of old houses would have been a mistake.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of a figure of £25 million to £50 million in the first year to provide for between 3,000 and 4,000 starts, with an assumption that 2,000 houses will be begun in the first year. That will be welcomed beyond measure because all of us realise that the housing situation is not what we would like it to be.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to flexibility in regard to repayments, that the Bill provides what amounts to a pay-related repayment scheme.  People who are sick or out of jobs will not be in the crippled position they would be if they were dealing with the building societies.  In that way the Minister has introduced the human touch to the matter of repayments. It would not be a tragedy if people were forced to stretch the period of their repayments provided they had the assurance that they could extend their repayments a little longer.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister is allowing for the needs of other than first-time home purchasers is a sign that the Minister has been listening to the problems of people and families who have been living in overcrowded conditions and that he is alive to the problems of mobility of labour, of people who need to move from one town to another but who are precluded from doing so because of the general housing shortage.</P>
    <P>I welcome very much the incentives provided for housing co-operatives.  This is only in its infancy in my area in Cork.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2308" /> There are some very heartening signs of advances in that area in the new development at Mahon on the outskirts of Cork city where recently a group of people completed a small co-operative housing project at figures which were substantially below the cost of the corporation's own houses, and also the houses were larger.  There is a great potential there.  The Minister has recognised it in granting special incentives by way of larger loans to housing co-operatives in certain situations.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment from the Opposition on the question of securing the position of pension funds.  References were made to moguls, and to Switzerland, and so on.  Clearly the Minister is talking about pension fund managers who are in the business of dealing with the small savings and pension contributions of hundreds of thousands of people.  There is nothing wrong in saying pension funds must be index-linked and must protect the investor or the pension holder against the ravages of inflation. That is the purpose of a pension.</P>
    <P>At the moment, pension fund managers have the option to invest in Government securities, or in blue chip properties, and things of that kind.  As a result, they are virtually inflation-proof.  If we are to attract that kind of money in substantial quantities into housing it is only sensible that we should recognise the fact that the pension fund managers have a duty and an obligation to protect the funds under their care, which are not the funds of mighty institutions, but the aggregate of many small pension contributions from many people.  Really that issue ought to be nailed.</P>
    <P>This proposal will help to stimulate the private housing sector and to stimulate it quickly, which it needs.  That will have benefits for employment, and it will have benefits for builders' providers and all the spin-offs associated with the building industry which is in a state of growth. That must be welcomed on all sides of the House because it is badly needed.</P>
    <P>There has been a fairly wide-ranging discussion on aspects of housing outside the absolute limits of this Bill.  I should <Col N="2309" /> like to comment on a few matters.  I hope the Minister, who is self-evidently committed to improving the lot of the house purchaser, will also look at the operations of the Land Registry and the whole area of transfers.  If ever a Government agency needed to be decentralised from the vista from which I look at it in Cork, it is the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other issues which are of concern.  One is the disgraceful performance or lack of performance by some builders in the finishing of estates.  I know it is not far from the Minister's mind, but I urge him to tackle that problem quickly.  It is a cancer in the housebuilding market.  It is bad for building. It is bad for builders.  Above all, it is bad for the people who pay good money for their houses to find years afterwards that the estates are still unfinished.  The local authorities are in disarray about whether they have an adequate bonding system.  By now we should know how to deal with that.  I appeal to the Minister to look at that matter as well in the context of the housing programme he is launching in the new year.</P>
    <P>The cost of housing is critical when one talks about any form of finance for housing. I am a little concerned about the operation of the building regulations, not because I am against them &mdash; nobody could be against them &mdash; but because there is a danger that housing will become too expensive.  There always will be and should be a tension between quality and price.  I hope that, in this commendable endeavour to increase the housing stock, we will be concerned about quantity as well as quality.  In Cork Corporation there is an outcry if anyone suggests we could have slightly less good houses, but more houses.  That is not a popular political stance to take.  The facts are that we need numbers of houses and we need them badly.  If a house costs £25,000 and we are trying to build a couple of hundred of them, we should look seriously at the idea of building extra houses for slightly less than that.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly this is a major new initiative which will provide an opportunity for a significant number of people who would not otherwise have the opportunity <Col N="2310" /> to acquire their own houses.  In that context I support and congratulate the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I look on this Bill as a major departure from the norm in the financing of houses.  I have no doubt the Bill will be attractive especially to the capitalists, if I may so term them, the tycoons and the moguls as Deputy Leyden called them.  They will have their bonds indexed against inflation, and who would not be in favour of that?  Deputy Leyden also asked a question which will have a fundamental influence on our financial structure in the future.  If the ESB want to raise a loan, will they have to offer equally attractive terms and, if they do not, will they get no money?</P>
      <P>The Government did not give sufficient thought to this Bill.  They are rushing it through when there is no need to do so.  We are keen to see the housing drive expedited to provide all the houses we need, but this is not the way to do it. I wonder how Members of the Labour Party will react to it because it is the most right-wing Bill I have seen for a long time.  Will some of the socialist Members of the House troop through the lobby in support of the Government on this issue? If they do they will be very right-wing socialists.</P>
      <P>Any Government have a major task in finding money for housing.  With our rising population the demand for more houses increases all the time.  It is a headache for any Government.  There is no short cut to solving the housing problem. Somebody once said that if someone invents instant housing we will be in trouble. Either the Government have panicked or they were advised by some foreign consultants when they decided to put this legislation through.  Either they panicked on this Bill or they do not understand it fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tonight Deputy Yates made a very good speech, but he went on to say that on the Continent very few couples buy houses.  This is what will happen here also because people will be unable to buy houses under this scheme.  A correspondent in one of our largest newspapers wrote an article some time ago in which <Col N="2311" /> he estimated that a person would pay something like £140,000 back for the loan he had obtained.  I do not know what that man's politics are; indeed he may have none.  I do not know whether or not those figures are true because I am no economist or financier.  But money will be made so terribly dear for housing, as Deputy Yates said, that many young couples will not buy their homes.  It is difficult enough under the generous SDA terms to buy a house but it will be rendered impossible under the provisions of this scheme.  The Government may say: that is all right, they can rent their houses.  But let us not forget that within our society there is the traditional longing to own a house or a piece of land; it is the Irish way of things. Under this new scheme that day will have ceased.  We will not see any couples of whatever age acquiring their own homes. One of the best cushions against inflation today is the ownership of a house because it constitutes a solid possession.  Inflation can affect one's position in many ways but one's own house constitutes some security.  In the case of SDA loans inflation actually helps because if an applicant obtains an SDA loan at a fixed figure &mdash; even though inflation may rise &mdash; his repayments would not be increased in real terms and after some time would be so small compared with new interest rates, that he would be comparatively well off.</P>
    <P>I think the Government realised that the housing drive was grinding to a halt. However, I hope they realise that in this city they will face a frightful social problem, as indeed they will in the other larger cities such as Cork, Galway or Limerick. This is borne out by the fact that under the present system they are unable to provide money even to local authorities for SDA loans at acceptable rates.  The Government could pull back even now. We asked for more time for consideration of this Bill but for some reason it is being rushed through with indecent haste.  I forecast that the Government will regret their haste in this matter.  I do not think they have given it sufficient thought.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt the Government's intention of providing more houses but I contend <Col N="2312" /> they are going about it the wrong way.  I fear that some members of the Labour Party, be they inside or outside this House, people who believe in some form of socialism, will not accept this. We on this side of the House believe in free enterprise, of course with controls. With all its faults I believe it to be the best system but it must be well controlled.</P>
    <P>Here people are being guaranteed that the bonds they purchase &mdash; mind you it will not be the man in the street who will buy them, rather it will be the big financiers and tycoons &mdash; will be insured against any inflation.  But who will insure them?  It will be the unfortunate couple buying a house or negotiating a loan, it is they who will pay these people.  Who else can pay them?  The Government cannot print money.  We will see the spectacle of young couples endeavouring to go along with this new-fangled idea in order to buy a dwelling for themselves. We do not want to be churlish about the Bill and oppose it for the sake of opposition. We do not propose to oppose the setting up of this agency.  But we insist that henceforth each measure must be examined to ensure that we are not laying on a bonanza with State funds for the monied people.</P>
    <P>This is a major departure from the traditional financing of housing or, for that matter, the financing of anything.  I pose the question to Fine Gael backbenchers: are they satisfied that this Bill has been examined by their financial advisers to ensure that it constitutes the best system in order to provide us with more houses?  Some time ago the Taoiseach embarked on a crusade.  No doubt he was inspired by very lofty motives.  I do not take those from him.  It is all right to talk about Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution but they do not affect the daily lives of our people.  Here is something that will affect their housing.  Somebody has worked out this scheme without too much thought.  Deputy Leyden referred to the moguls.  We used to talk about the gnomes of Zurich.  I can see that this new agency would be very attractive to many of these people on the continental money market.  Why should it not be?  I do not know of any other country <Col N="2313" /> that will guarantee against inflation with State funds.  The question must be posed: who will pay for it?  It will be unfortunate couples, whether they be young, middle-aged or old who will avail of finance from this agency.  Why could the Minister not have said: all right, we will endeavour to provide a more fluid and generous system of SDA loans?  Why can we not fund our local authorities and say to them: now get on with the job?</P>
    <P>It would have been much simpler to have done so but of course would not have been so attractive to the monied people.  We must remember that they do not feel charitable towards our housing needs.  Rather they will invest in this company for the reason that there are large profits to be made.  Very often we condemn the people who build office blocks for profit.  Let us face it, they build them for profit; they do not build them for the comfort of the people who will work in them.  In some cases office blocks are necessary and they yield a very good financial return.  In this city at present accommodation in an office block can be rented at £9 per square foot.  However, I can foresee that when this agency is established and their money is switched over it will attract money easily.  It would be the same thing if the Government or anybody else tomorrow offered to issue a loan at 20 per cent, 30 per cent or 40 per cent.  Of course people will invest but somebody must pay in the end.  Always it has been the story with Coalition Governments that housing is hammered by them.  Whether it be that they are unlucky at the time they come into power I do not know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If they followed Fianna Fáil they would not get into trouble but the fact that they do not is what has them in trouble.  The Minister has said that they always follow Fianna Fáil, that is understood &mdash; we are the leaders &mdash; but the point is that they are not following us on this occasion, they are following somebody else giving them very bad advice <Col N="2314" /> which will lead them into a lot of trouble. The Minister is a businessman and probably knows a lot more about finance than I.  I feel he is uneasy about this whole Bill, he must be.  Some Deputy asked this evening whether local authorities have any say in it.  Probably this agency will be very efficient in the sense that they will guarantee a good return to the people who invest money with them.  But will it be as good a proposition for the people who have no proper dwellings?  There is to be seen in this city at present the slow down in local authority housing.  We must not forget that housing in other places has occasioned great social upheaval.  I have witnessed social upheaval in this city before but that will be nothing to what will happen if people cannot afford loans. There will be there then the makings of social trouble and unrest, all because the Government decided they wanted this Bill put through in such a hurry.</P>
      <P>I do not know why they want to do so. I negotiated with the Government Whip &mdash; and I am not criticising him in any way whatsoever &mdash; he was doing his job just as I was.  I appealed that this matter should be put back for further consideration. That was a reasonable request.  We ask why the Second Stage must go through tonight and the remainder of the Bill tomorrow.  We could easily have left the Committee Stage until after Christmas. I am not talking about politics now but commonsense.  We have always been able to regulate the business of the House in a friendly manner and we have made great progress but in the case of this Bill, the grey eminence, whoever is behind it, decided it must go through and damn the consequences.  We have not yet been shown how the SDA structure will fit into it or even how the local loans will fit into it.  We are told this must go through and the jackboot is being used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some members of Fine Gael, especially those on local authorities, will agree with me that all is not well in the housing situation.  In the city of Dublin we have over 7,000 applications for housing. I am not including the County of Dublin.  The corporation at present have 1,400 dwellings under construction.  The corporation were told last week to go and <Col N="2315" /> borrow more money.  I hope they borrowed it quickly because they certainly will not get money when this comes into operation.  Would anybody lend money to Dublin Corporation at a reasonable rate when they can invest in these index-linked bonds and make a lot more money?  This will not affect the Government's policy on housing but it will certainly affect the local authorities, the ESB, Bord na Móna, the Sugar Company or Irish Shipping.  If any of these bodies try to raise money they must at least match what is being offered by this new housing agency.  It is proposed to raise £200 million.  How much of that will go towards indexing it against inflation? These people will have to be paid back. They are not philanthropists.  They are not providing money because we need to build houses.  They are doing it to make money out of it.  This is going to affect the person who is renting a dwelling from a local authority.  It is like throwing a stone into a pool.  When the Government throw this into the pool it will absorb most of the money which should be in circulation for general purposes.</P>
    <P>It was said at one time that Fine Gael were going left.  I do not think they are. The Labour Party are going very much to the right.  I do not know how they can say they are socialist if they vote for this most right wing proposal.  This would do very well in some of the wealthier states where there is little socialism or if there is a kind of state socialism with the State grabbing most of the money which would be there for industrial development or any kind of commercial development.  I would ask the Minister again to leave over the Committee Stage until we can all examine it in detail.  I know I will not influence the Minister in the least.  The Government will put the Bill through and then we will all go home for Christmas.  Perhaps the Government will feel they have done a good job.  I do not think they will have. I think they are creating a Frankenstein which they will not be able to control.</P>
    <P>All of us in public life have people coming to us every week looking for dwellings.  I do not think the new agency will ease the problems.  Deputy Yates, <Col N="2316" /> who made a very good speech earlier, mentioned that on the Continent people seldom buy their houses.  It is a different system.  We must solve our problems our own way.  Under this Bill it will be very difficult to own a house or a flat.  Life is fairly short and one would need to apply at about 20 and live to be 100 to pay for a house under this system.  The Labour Party said some years ago that the eighties would be socialist.  I think what they meant was that socialists would be 80 when they would have paid for their houses.  I hope the Labour Party will oppose this measure.</P>
    <P>How can we protect the couple buying a house from the high rate which this new agency must charge in order to finance the deal?  I am still wondering why the Government rushed it through and the Minister when replying might tell us the reason.  I am not a financier and I admit that the Minister knows far more about the subject.  However, I have been a public representative for many years and I know of the terrible shortage of proper housing in this city.  The area in which I live has become flatland and I see many young couples who have come from good homes in the provinces living in flats for which they are paying exorbitant rents. If their families knew of the conditions in which they are living it would cause them great worry.  It is heart-breaking to have to tell them that they do not qualify for local authority housing and the vast majority of them will not be able to afford to take advantage of this new scheme.</P>
    <P>I implore the Government to examine the financial structure of this measure because it will not help anyone to get a reasonably priced dwelling.  People who are looking for houses will not thank the Government for this effort.  Some unfortunate people live rough in the streets because our system is not helpful to proper living.  Many young couples with one or two children live with their parents in overcrowded flats and it is no wonder that there are so many marital breakdowns. It must be almost impossible to live in such conditions.</P>
    <P>The majority of people will make every possible effort to buy a house but under this new system more people will be <Col N="2317" /> deprived of that opportunity.  Our generation were more fortunate because SDA loans were more freely available but the death knell of that system has now been sounded.  The basic need of any married couple is a house or a decent place to live and this is their ideal.  Money must be provided at cheap rates but the Government are taking the easy way out because people will not be able to afford to take advantage of this scheme.</P>
    <P>I do not know who advised the Government on this subject or what attitude the Labour Party will adopt but if there is any semblance of socialism in that party they must oppose this Bill.  It will certainly be very attractive to capitalists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Raphael Burke did not think so.  He said it would be a flop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not hear my speech.  The Government will not have any difficulty in attracting money because they are offering such attractive terms. They would have no difficulty in reaching a national understanding on pay if they were to offer an increase of 12 per cent indexed against inflation.  Of course, they cannot do so because the cost would be enormous but this is the method which the new agency will use.  Wage earners who are looking for houses will revolt and the housing drive will grind to a halt.</P>
      <P>It will also be impossible for local authorities or semi-State enterprises such as the ESB or Bord na Móna to raise money because those who have money to invest will want their investments insulated against inflation.  We will see the State taking over more and more financial transactions.  I am sure we have all read George Orwell's book &ldquo;1984&rdquo; where big brother takes over, and we now see big brother in the form of the State taking over the local authorities and the private lending agencies.  Everything will be centralised in the State.  We are amazed that the Fine Gael Party, who were always the party of free enterprise, are taking such right-wing measures to raise money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the appalling housing situation in the larger cities and the very low finances available to local authorities <Col N="2318" /> to meet the housing demand I appeal to the Minister and members of Fine Gael to make the Government re-examine this matter.  They have a duty to do so.  I know that we do not have a monopoly of concern regarding housing but they have the power to make the Cabinet reconsider. Committee Stage should be postponed until after the Christmas Recess so that the Bill can be examined further.  The Minister is doing a very bad day's work for the country.</P>
    <P>I notice there are no Labour Members here tonight.  I do not blame them because I can understand their feelings so far as this Bill is concerned.  Some Labour Deputies may have spoken but I did not hear them and I would like to know their reaction to this Bill.  Are they going to submerge their principles for political expediency?  During the first Coalition Government Mr. James Dillon, a Fine Gael Deputy, said the Labour Party in Coalition were as quiet as mice. I wonder if the Labour Party in this Coalition will be as quiet as mice when this Bill is going through?  This Bill will slow down the housing drive and will have serious repercussions on any semi-State body trying to raise money.  This is the most ill-thought-out scheme I ever heard of.  I will be charitable and say the Government wanted to do something about the housing situation, but I suggest they have done a very wrong thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Miss Owen Miss Owen">
      <NameTxt>Miss Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to start by agreeing with one thing Deputy Moore said &mdash; that inherent in our society is the desire of most people to own a house.  It is different on the Continent and in years to come we might have the same situation here.</P>
      <P>I find it hard to believe that a Deputy with Deputy Moore's experience could miss the point of this agency.  The Bill says this is &ldquo;an Act to provide for the promotion by the Minister... either directly or indirectly, for the acquisition and construction of houses,....&rdquo; This Bill will provide another method of financing for young couples wishing to buy their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the Coalition <Col N="2319" /> Deputies expressed the same views I expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Miss Owen Miss Owen">
      <NameTxt>Miss Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer for him. The biggest single purchase in a person's life is buying a home, and the second biggest purchase for most people would be buying a motor car.  There is a vast choice when buying a car and the same range of choice should be available when people are buying their homes.  They are buying money when they look for a loan. This financing agency is providing another choice for a group of people who, over the last few years, have slowly but surely been edged out of the market for buying homes.</P>
      <P>There are local authority loans of £14,000 available for people with incomes below £7,000.  In the Dublin area those loans are not of very great value because it is very difficult to find the finance to bring it up to the house price &mdash; from £14,000 to £25,000 or £28,000. This would mean a great deal of saving for a young couple.  The people who benefit most from the £14,000 loan are those who are buying their local authority houses or young couples who are lucky enough to have somebody who can give them a site for nothing, and then they can build their own homes.  The people on incomes above £9,000 can usually find financing in the lending agencies &mdash; insurance agencies, building societies and so on.</P>
      <P>There are a vast number of couples in the middle area who find themselves in a catch-22 situation where they cannot raise finance.  This is the great advantage I see in this agency.  Making this money available will benefit everybody because it will go through the whole system. There are some genuine people on the local authority housing lists who get houses.  As a member of a local authority I had many couples coming to me and saying they would rather buy a house and they do not really want to go on the council housing list.  I applaud that attitude. With this housing agency I will have another option to offer them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a couple come to me and say they want to go on the council housing <Col N="2320" /> list I give them all the options available and ask if there is any way they can buy their own houses.  It should be the last resort to go on the council housing list. We could get to a situation where couples would automatically put themselves on the council housing list and that would be a bad day for this country.  We must not stifle the initiative and the in-built desire in every couple to own a home.  We must make every facility available to prevent a situation arising where it is accepted that once a father or a grandfather has a council house the next generation also get a council house.</P>
    <P>The great advantage of this agency is that during the early years of a young couple's married life, which is usually the time they try to buy their house, when their expenses are greatest, having their first first baby and so on, there is a tremendous amount of stress and the added stress of trying to find repayments adds greatly to many unhappy situations.  The concept of the borrower being able to pay back an index-linked amount of money relating to their previous year's salary is a step forward in recognising the needs on the ground.  When this Bill becomes law that will be a great step forward.</P>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Moore I got the feeling that new Fianna Fáil style is all right, but new Fine Gael and Labour style is not and that we must be very cautious.  He should not worry.  There will be somebody to hold his hand if he does not have the courage to step forward into new areas, because this Government are prepared to step into new areas.  I am sorry we had to have a debate on this Bill.  I thought this Bill would have received immediate acclaim, that the Minister could have read his speech and that there would be agreement all round. Then we could have moved to the next business.  Yesterday the Opposition carried on about whether we would debate this Bill.  If they had not wasted all that time we could have had those valuable few hours discussing this Bill.</P>
    <P>At present couples cannot buy houses because they cannot raise the necessary finance.  In this Bill they will be able to get a 90 per cent loan up to a maximum <Col N="2321" /> of £22,500 in some cases, or £27,000 in others.  If a house costs £25,000 &mdash; and this is not particularly relevant to the Dublin area where house prices are very high&mdash;with the £1,000 subsidy for the first-time buyer, a couple will be able to borrow £21,500.  This means they will only have to save a deposit of £2,500.  It is important that every couple should have to save some money towards buying their house.  That ensures that they are genuinely interested in buying a house and will make every effort to keep up with their mortgage repayments.  We must not stifle the initiative of people and hand them everything.  The provisions of the Bill will make house purchase a lot easier for many people.  Bridging finance is very expensive at present and those lucky to get sanction for a loan from a building society have to take out bridging finance for the deposit because building societies insist on them keeping their money on deposit.</P>
    <P>The legislation will cater for many people who are in a limbo at present. When it is passed builders should be encouraged to look closely at the market and those anxious to buy houses.  A welcome provision is that single people will be able to raise loans from the agency. Many single people want to buy their own homes.  This should prove an incentive to builders, and developers should look closely at the type of housing schemes they are providing because they now have an opportunity to give a wider choice. The Bill widens the choice and options of people and that is essential.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that the construction of houses is covered in the legislation.  In rural areas many young couples get a site from their parents or relations and that reduces the amount of money they will have to borrow.  The Opposition should view this legislation as a step forward, as another option.  Everything Fianna Fáil did was not bad but one must take new steps forward.  The idea of the agency did not come overnight.  It is a lengthy piece of legislation which has been well researched and Fianna Fáil should not be afraid to accept that a lot of people with ability contributed to its preparation. They should not try to have the matter <Col N="2322" /> postponed.  If that happens more young couples will suffer.  The Opposition should have courage enough to applaud the Government for bringing this forward. It may have to be dealt with speedily but they should remember that new brooms sweep clean.  One of the drawbacks of being in power for too long is that a party get staid and settled in their ways.  This legislation is not retrograde, it is progressive and I urge the Opposition to view it in that light.</P>

We spend hours debating matters and get a lot of repetition on Second Stage but the legislation is not dealt with in detail until Committee Stage.  The previous speaker told us how a new broom sweeps clean but the old one is not too bad going around a corner either.</P>

      <P>This new legislation could affect the financial situation of the State because the Government are about to agree to an agency raising money on conditions never envisaged before.  The system may be correct but the general public have not had an opportunity of considering the matter.  I can recall that on the Committee Stage of many Bills Deputies, having met intelligent people in their constituencies, tabled amendments which improved the legislation under discussion.  Committee Stage is different from Second Stage when Members <Col N="2323" /> are inclined to make long speeches.  The section by section debate that takes place on Committee Stage often leads to improvement of the provisions.  I can recall Bills which were introduced by us and were not all that wonderful but by the time the Opposition were finished with them on Committee Stage they were much better.  It is unfortunate that this Bill will be passed within two days because it involves a complete change in the democratic system.</P>
      <P>County councils wanted money but under this legislation the Minister will be providing money to the agency in a manner that was never done before.  It is a private agency and the Minister will not have any say once the agency commence operations.  If local authorities were given money they would do a better job.  Those bodies are run by elected representatives. This move saddens me.  When I became a Member I stated that the Dáil was irrelevant as far as our agricultural policy was concerned because it was being dictated from Brussels and now we are handing over the financing of our housing schemes to a new agency.  I cannot understand why the Labour Party have remained silent on this matter.  I am a socialist and I do not deny it.  I will not condemn the Bill until I have investigated it in detail but I am not happy that it is being passed in such a speedy manner.  I would not like to see our party voting against the Bill on Second Stage because I am prepared to study it as I am prepared to study anything new that is introduced. Those who think they know it all are foolish.  We do not know what repercussions this legislation will have on the financing of other projects.  If a loan of this type is made available for one agency there is a danger that it will have to be made available to many more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If local authorities were permitted to raise money in this way at least it would go through the democratic process in that the scheme would be run by elected representatives. The Minister is handing over his authority to an independent agency.  When both sides of the House agreed to hand over planning appeals to an independent board I objected and I <Col N="2324" /> am still not convinced I was wrong.  I stated then that it was preferable that the Minister deal with such appeals because he could be called upon to give an account of his stewardship if he made a mistake.  We cannot do that in respect of the appeal board.  It is wrong that Minister who are elected to a position of responsibility should hand over their authority to independent agencies.  This agency is being given special permission to raise money, a method which is not available to other bodies.  It is my view that the Minister is making a mistake but I hope for the sake of housing he is not. It is necessary to have a good debate on Committee Stage and even at this late stage I appeal to the Minister to postpone that stage to give us an opportunity of considering the Bill.  I would like to hear the views of the socialist Members.  I always listen to debates with an open mind and in this case I am not happy that I will get a feed-back from my constituents. I did not know what the agency would be responsible for until the Minister made his speech this morning.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased with the amount of attention that has been given to legislation. All of us have had a long day and we face another long day tomorrow. I do not say this in any sense of being critical but many of the contributions ranged beyond the terms of the Bill. This indicated to me the very genuine interest Deputies on all sides of the House have in all matters relating to housing.  I would hope that at some time in the future we would be able to arrange a full day's debate on all aspects of housing. I have been asked about the White Paper.  I hope to be able to produce that in the spring and, based on that, we might be able to arrange that day-long debate. Several Deputies who would have liked to contribute to the Bill were not able to do so in the time available.  Because of that, also, I would hope that at some time we will be able to arrange the Dáil Business <Col N="2325" /> to provide for a debate as I have outlined.  I am sure that I would learn quite a lot from such a debate and I would be very happy to facilitate arrangements for it to take place.</P>
      <P>Before I reply to the individual points made I should like to make two general points.  Deputy Callanan and a number of other Deputies also asked where the Members of the Labour Party were today but I would remind Deputies opposite that the Bill before us is part of the Joint Programme for Government, 1981 to 1986.  It was published first as a Fine Gael policy document in October 1980 and again it was part of the Fine Gael Programme for Government in May 1981. Therefore, there is no question about the commitment of either of the Government parties to this legislation.  Neither is there any question of Deputies opposite not knowing what is in the Bill.  I cannot think of anything that has had so much advance notice as the intention of Fine Gael in Government to introduce a building finance agency.  Neither can I think of anything that was spelled out in greater detail in the document we produced in October last.  In these circumstances what the Deputies opposite are saying is nonsense and especially so since the contributions of at least half a dozen of them today comprised quotations from an article written by a journalist in which the measure was criticised.  That journalist has a right to be flattered because evidently he is the opposition in relation to this Bill.  However, unlike the elected Opposition he did his homework.  The article which appeared in the press in September last was a good article based on a series of assumptions and it was on those assumptions that the journalist concerned arrived at his answers.  But both the journalist and I are talking about the future and neither of us knows what will happen in the future.  I use different assumptions and I get different answers.</P>

      <P>I am telling the Deputy differently now.  We have had the equivalent of three weeks' debate on this legislation. No legislation is debated for longer than that.  The National Building Agency set up by Fianna Fáil was not debated in this House for three years. They set it up as a private company. Precisely the same happened with the Irish National Petroleum Company which they set up in 1979 and they left office without introducing legislation to set it up.</P>

      <P>I could do exactly the same, I could set up this agency outside the House and have it in operation by the second week in January but I will not follow the path which Fianna Fáil took. I believe in the democracy of this House and in allowing Deputies to have their say.

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have plenty of time. Deputy Leyden spoke last week about spouses' incomes being considered for loans and wanted to know when it was introduced.  I wish to quote from a letter which was issued by the Department of the Environment to Dublin County Council on 6 March 1981:</P>
      <P>In reply to your query about the determination of eligibility on income grounds I am to confirm that income from all sources must be taken into account and in this context there does not appear to be any justification for disregarding the income of a spouse whose employment is of a permanent nature.  In all cases the Council should only advance loans to applicants whose circumstances are such that they are unable to obtain loans from a commercial agency.</P>
      <P>That was sent out by Mr. Raphael P. Burke, T.D., the then Minister for the Environment.  That is the second time I have had to place that on record.  Deputy Burke made the point that we should use existing institutions rather than set up a new agency.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to raise additional finance for household mortgages to meet a growing housing requirement.  The inflow of funds to building societies is still less than satisfactory, despite the increase in investment rates from 1 October 1981.  Because of the acute shortage of Exchequer funds the Government are unable to increase the SDA loan and income limits.  The new agency will tap funds from pension funds and life offices.  That is the source of the funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the previous Government introduced the housing package last April, they estimated they would need at least £9 million extra this year for SDA loans. They refused to make any provision for this expenditure before the change of Government last June.  Deputy Connolly said they had intended to do it by means of a Supplementary Estimate later in the <Col N="2331" /> year but as these are not voted funds, a Supplementary Estimate would have been unnecessary.  They had April, May and June to provide these funds.  As I said a number of times, but it does not seem to have got home to the Deputies over there, we had to provide an extra £30 million on 1 July this year because the amount of money provided by Fianna Fáil for local authority housing in the 1981 Estimates was less than had been spent in 1980.  That is why people building houses in Deputy Moore's constituency were not laid off &mdash; if there had not been a change of Government they would have been laid off in their thousands throughout Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke expressed fear that the existence of the agency would have the effect of slowing the flow of funds into the building societies.  I do not think there is any substance in that because the agency is designed to attract institutional funds whereas building societies rely mainly on savings.  When I opened the EBS offices in Westmoreland Street the other night I assured the building societies that the setting up of the agency would not militate against their operations. On the contrary, I see the agency as being able to assist in stabilising the total funds available for housing mortgages. The flow of funds from the agency could be increased when there is a drop in money available to the societies, thereby relieving the demand on the societies for loans during those periods.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke said the amount of money outstanding would be increased steadily under the new system.  If the Deputies had paid attention to my speech earlier they would have got my point, but in case there might be any misunderstanding, it must be emphasised that the amount of the principal outstanding under the proposed system would normally decline in real terms when inflation is taken into account.  Deputy Burke emphasised that the building industry requires finance and not a new agency. Broadly, that is probably true but what we are doing is providing the means of getting finance to the industry which was not available heretofore.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2332" /> People who want to provide their own houses have three or four choices in the way they will pay for their houses.  They can get their loans through banks or insurance companies, which is an expensive way.  They can get the money through the building societies whose loans are expensive: we heard earlier today that repayments to building societies absorb between 40 per cent and 45 per cent of a person's income in the first years.  People can get finance through the SDA system which is a very attractive way because the interest rate is subsidised.</P>
    <P>Of course people can pay cash.  Only the very wealthy can do that, but it is the cheapest way for a person to provide himself with a house.  It means, of course, that there is nobody in the housing market who can acquire a house as cheaply as the rich man.  He does not have to get a mortgage or a bank overdraft or a building loan.  He does not even have to pay the cheapest rate of interest, which is on the SDA loan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a minute.  The Deputy did not show the same concern when he left local authority housing schemes in a mess.  We had to provide an extra £30 million last July. Deputy Burke said the mortgage subsidies were more effective than the new pay-related schemes.  Mortgage subsidies helped first time purchasers of new houses but the subsidy lasts for only three years and it is not paid at all in respect of about 8,000 first-time purchasers of existing houses.  The subsidy has been a help and it will be reclaimed.</P>

They have been endorsed by a report recently submitted to me by An Foras Forbartha. I intend to discuss these matters with the building societies next month and I hope to get their co-operation to eliminate avoidable expenses and delays.  I feel so strongly on this matter that if such a course proves to be necessary I will promote legislation to ensure that the necessary changes will be made.  I will ask them to co-operate first and if that is not forthcoming the change will be introduced.</P>

I agree with Deputy Shatter that an effective element of competition in the market would provide a stimulus for building societies to operate more economically and efficiently.  I have every hope that the new agency will generate that competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fahey said there will not be a demand for the new loans.  Perhaps we will discover that is so, but I think it is very unlikely.  We must all face up to the fact that the maximum SDA loan available is £14,000.  The average price of a three-bedroom semi-detached house is £25,000.  That means that with the SDA loan, plus the grant, a person buying a house still has to find a deposit of £9,000. That deposit would have to be raised by somebody earning £7,000 a year or less. We all know that in most cases that is almost impossible to do.  The person with an income of more than £7,000 will have <Col N="2334" /> to go to a building society and in the first few years of the mortgage life he would be paying up to 45 per cent of his income. He would be a person with an income of £9,000.  That also is an impossible situation for a young couple.</P>

      <P>I think I am entitled to injury time for the way Deputies are shouting at me.  The Deputy is talking about people in local authority housing. They will get special consideration.  The general run of the mill is, as I said, £14,000.  Deputy Harney expressed worry about the size of the local authority waiting list in Dublin.  I have figures here to show that the size of the waiting list in Dublin has gone down.  There were more houses being built during the 1973-77 period in Dublin than in the last four years, and I am talking about each of the four years.  Fianna Fáil's record there is not very good.  Deputy Reynolds was not correct when he asserted dogmatically that the building society mortgage interest rate was never higher than the rate of inflation.  It is only in the past five years when inflation was at an unprecedented high level that building society interest rates lagged behind inflation.</P>
      <P>Deputies spoke about repayments of mortgages.  This is a further choice available to people purchasing houses.  That is the point which must be remembered by everyone in this House.  It is not in substitution for the SDA loans.  The only way it could substitute for SDA loans would be if the SDA loans vanished, if this scheme proved so popular that there was no demand for SDA loans.  That is the only way.  If that happens&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given permission to Deputy Fitzsimons to raise the matter of the Tara Mines dispute on the adjournment.  It has been agreed that Deputy Fitzsimons will speak for ten minutes and the Minister will reply for five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me this facility to raise this very important and crucial issue.  I should like to thank the Minister for Labour for giving us 15 minutes at such short notice at this late stage of the night.  I felt this morning on the Order of Business that I should raise this matter because it is of such crucial importance. It is an open secret that, if this strike is not settled this week, there is a possibility that Tara could close down in the very near future.  A statement was issued this evening that the mine would be on a care and maintenance basis from 1 January next.  A meeting is being held in Navan in the hope that, even at this <Col N="2337" /> eleventh hour when the issue is on the brink, the situation may be resolved.</P>
      <P>The effect of this strike will be not only local but also international.  It is horrifying to think that 1,000 people are directly affected by this strike in Tara.  Approximately 140 craft workers and 850 other workers are involved.  I cannot quantify the figure exactly but, apart from that, possibly another 1,000 people are indirectly involved in many companies which supply Tara: engineering companies, electrical companies, mining and cable companies, on the ground equipment companies, Cement Roadstone Limited, oil companies, the ESB, Posts and Telegraphs, companies who supply fork lift trucks and even ribbons for typewriters. Because of the security situation and the presence of dynamite a full-time Garda force is there when the mines are in operation.  Many of those gardaí have been transferred temporarily to other areas since the strike began.</P>
      <P>I did not raise this matter before today because I felt, like other politicians in the constituency, that the very sophisticated machinery in the Labour Court to deal with modern disputes could solve the issue and that reason, tolerance, commonsense and goodwill would prevail. They have not, and that is why I thought somewhere somebody must stand up and say: &ldquo;Stop, we must arrest the situation before we have another Ferenka on our hands&rdquo;.  This dispute affects not only County Meath but also other parts of the country.  Industries were set up specifically to supply that mine with equipment. There is an industry in Shannon.  There is an industry in the industrial estate in Navan and there is another industry in Dublin.  These will all be affected.  People from Silvermines and Tynagh come up to work in Tara.  Counties far away from Meath will be affected.  The retail outlets in County Meath will be badly affected. Many of them have been feeling the pinch over the past six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot afford another Ferenka. Our industry was badly damaged internationally by the Ferenka dispute.  We must try to solve this problem even at this eleventh hour.  If the Labour Court machinery has broken down, somebody <Col N="2338" /> in the Government must try to do something. I am not being political when I say that, because we would be in Government but for a few quirks in the PR system.  The Government have a 25 per cent stake in Tara.  Therefore this dispute involves the Government as a whole, the Minister for Energy and the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>In Navan we have had a proud record in our industrial relations for many years. It is 30 years since we had a strike in the furniture industry.  We have had very happy industrial relations in the carpet factory.  I fear that the unhappy industrial relations we have had in Tara for some time will rub off on us in Navan and in County Meath in general, where we have had a good track record.  I hope the tolerance, goodwill and commonsense I mentioned will prevail ultimately.</P>
    <P>We have been affected to some extent in our efforts to attract other industries to Navan because of the situation in the mining industry.  I do not say that in a derogatory way.  When our county development team, the politicians and the IDA tried to attract industry to the area we were asked: &ldquo;How can we compete with the mining industry?&rdquo; The mining industry is welcome in any area once it provides jobs and good employment.  It is beneficial industry.  I hope that the unhappy industrial relations situation we have experienced from time to time will come to an end rather than have this mine closed.  You know, Sir, as well as I do that when something closes down, whether it be a hospital, a factory, a mine or whatever, it becomes then much more difficult to reopen.  You allowed me raise this matter on the Adjournment, Sir, so that I might implore the Government to do all in their power to arrest this situation before it becomes a disaster not alone for Navan but for the county and for the country in general.</P>

      <P>Because the Minister was giving precedence to this case instead of another this evening &mdash; there was another case also &mdash; this was decided at the last moment.  Normally it would have been a 20-minute speech by the Deputy and ten minutes for reply. But Deputy John Farrelly asked if he could speak for two minutes.  We have done it before and there is no precedent being created by allowing him in these circumstances, because we are still within the time limit for it.</P>

      <P>That is incorrect, Deputy.  In fact anybody can stand up if there is time remaining &mdash; anybody can stand up and make a contribution. The peculiar circumstances on this occasion were that, while the Deputy had been granted permission, there were a number of matters to be raised on the Adjournment and his was not chosen. But because of the urgency of the matter and, in the Deputy's interest, I thought he should be given precedence.  I switched it to suit the Deputy.  Deputy Farrelly wanted to make a two-minute contribution only.  I do not think he is imposing too much on the time of the House.  Perhaps we could all be gracious and permit him to speak for two minutes <Col N="2340" /> about this situation and the Minister will then reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you, Sir, for allowing me these two short minutes, Indeed, I would now be finished had not the other two Deputies interrupted.</P>
      <P>I should like to support my colleague, Deputy Fitzsimons, on this grave situation which has obtained now for six months and which appears to be coming to a head in the form of the closure of the Tara Mines at Navan.  This will have an enormous effect on the town, the county and the constituency I represent. It will have enormous effect on the families involved and on the town of Navan itself.  I should never like to see Navan become a dead town and that is what will happen if the Tara Mines dispute is allowed to continue and the mine close.</P>
      <P>I sincerely hope something can be done, even at this final hour, to ensure that the jobs in Tara Mines are maintained, that the mine will be allowed to remain open.  I would hope between management, staff and the Government, whatever else may prevail, that the goodwill in this festive season over the next two days will ensure that this prospective closure does not take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The history of this dispute goes back to August 1980.  In August 1980 a relativity claim was made by craftsmen in the Tara Mines, claiming relativity, including a bonus, with miners and also relativity with other grades in the mine.  A full hearing of the Labour Court on 25 March 1981 held that there was no basis for either the claim for relativity or bonus. As a result of that, from March to June 1981, direct negotiations took place intermittently between the unions and management. I am afraid no result emanated from those discussions.  As result of that an overtime ban was imposed in June and a number of men suspended.  Unofficial action was taken as a result of that.  Later, in the month of July, this unofficial action <Col N="2341" /> was made official.  On 27 July 1981 the company and the unions met and had discussions when once again no progress was made.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions became involved later on and for several months discussions continued, as also did the official action.</P>
      <P>As no finality was reached, on 27 November last a conciliation conference was held.  The official side offered £21 per week to craftsmen working underground and £11 per week to craftsmen working on the surface, the shifts to rotate as between surface and underground.  This offer was turned down by the negotiating committee but was not put to a ballot of the men.  On 9 December 1981 another conciliation conference was held under the aegis of the Department of Labour, when again no progress resulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last evening the company told the men that the mine would be put on a care and maintenance basis from 1 January next. This will result in the laying-off of over 1,000 men and the employment of something between 30 and 40 men only.  Today at 2.30 p.m. the parish priest of Navan, Father Farrell, chaired a meeting between management and unions.  My latest information is that talks are still <Col N="2342" /> continuing.  I am reluctant to prejudice any hopeful result by anything I might say further about the history of this dispute. We can only hope that these discussions will be successful.  I understand that the atmosphere at these talks has been helpful and that there is some hope that an agreement can be reached.  In any event, my Department have arranged a conciliation conference for Friday next, which will take place, if required, and both sides may so request.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the closure of Tara Mines.  We are all aware that this is a very important enterprise, not only for the immediate area but for the whole economy.  Therefore I would not like to prejudice any good result which might emerge from the present discussions.  My Department have at all times been prepared to intervene, although unfortunately on occasions they have not been asked.  Should it be necessary they will be prepared to intervene on Friday next.  I hope this will not be necessary but the Department of Labour will be available.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 17 December 1981.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 617 and 618 together.  While capital expenditure on the erection of and improvements to national schools is met from the Vote for Primary Education, the expenditure under this heading is disbursed by the Commissioners of Public Works on behalf of the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>The relevant records are not kept in a form which permits abstraction of the information sought by the Deputy without an unjustifiable expenditure of time and effort.  A very large number of schools and a still larger number of payments are involved.  The central record of payments does not distinguish between new buildings and other works.</P>
      <P>Payments for this service over the periods mentioned were as follows:&mdash; 1 January 1981 to 30 June 1981, £9,502,000; July 1981, £1,277,000; August 1981, £1,048,000; September 1981, £1,631,000; October 1981, £1,923,000; November 1981, £1,943,000.</P>
      <P>Should the Deputy require the information in relation to any particular school it would be possible to supply it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy the terms of any advice or direction addressed to the ESB, Bord na Móna or Bord Gáis, subsequent and pursuant to the Budget Statement of 21 July 1981 affecting the conduct of collective bargaining or industrial relations in any or all of those bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. M. O'Leary) Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. M. O'Leary)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>Officials of my Department have regular, confidential consultations with the management of State bodies in relation to the implications for individual bodies of Government policy in the areas affecting their operations.  It would not be appropriate that I should divulge the content of such consultations.  However, following the Financial Statement of 21 July 1981, at the request of the Minister for the Public Service, I issued general guidelines to all the State bodies for which I am responsible, including the ESB, Bord na Móna and Bord Gáis Éireann, in regard to the implementation of the policy on public sector pay announced in the statement.  The text of the letter addressed to the chairman of each body is as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.  I attach an extract from the Minister for Finance's Budget statement of 21 July, 1981 dealing with public sector pay.  I would ask you to ensure that Government policy on public sector pay as stated in this extract is complied with in your organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  In order to ensure equality of treatment for all cases it is essential that all public sector employers pursue a coordinated and consistent pay policy.  It would be most unfortunate if the policy were implemented in such a way as to allow a group of workers in one area to benefit from an increase while a similar <Col N="2183" /> group in another area with an equally strong case were prevented from doing so.</P>
    <P>3.  Paragraphs 4-8 following indicate how the budget statement is to be implemented and I should be grateful if you would ensure that they are complied with so far as your organisation is concerned.</P>
    <P>4.  Where my Department or the Department of the Public Service gave approvals to your organisation to offer pay increases or improvements in conditions before the budget statement on 21 July, 1981 such approvals may be honoured. If the increases or improvements were not offered to claimants before the budget statement it should be made clear that the offers were approved prior to the budget.</P>
    <P>5.  Firm offers or formal commitments made before 21 July, 1981 may be honoured. It is the Government's intention that a restrictive view should be taken of what constitutes a firm offer or formal commitment.  In this regard, it should be noted that existing links and relationships do not in themselves constitute a formal commitment and should not be so construed.</P>
    <P>6.  The expression &ldquo;cases currently before the Labour Court&rdquo; covers only those claims which were referred to the Labour Court for a recommendation before the budget statement.  It does not cover claims at the conciliation stage.  All such Labour Court or Rights Commissioners' recommendations should be referred to my Department for consideration.</P>
    <P>7.  In all cases other than the exceptions mentioned above, claims for pay increases or improvements in conditions on whatever basis they are made should be rejected.  Claims where the merits are weak should be rejected on that basis, with the rider that if they are submitted for adjudication the management side will also invoke the terms of Clause 6 of <Col N="2184" /> the National Understanding 1980.  Claims with merit should be discussed but no offers should be made nor should management indicate the extent to which it sees merit in the claim.  Instead the terms of Clause 6 should be invoked at the conciliation stage.  Any alternative arrangement proposed under that Clause must take full account of the fact that no further funds will be available to meet the cost of special pay increases.  Even if your organisation could, in fact, meet the claim from its own revenue the terms of Clause 6 should still be invoked with the management stressing the risk to jobs generally and the damaging effects on the viability of the economy if claims are conceded in the public sector other than the exceptional ones specified in the budget statement.</P>
    <P>8.  The Minister for the Public Service in consultation with other Ministers will be concerned to ensure that Government pay policy is applied consistently throughout the public sector.  To enable him to monitor the situation I should be glad if you would send me as soon as possible details of claims extant in your organisation on 21 July, 1981 in the form set out in the Appendix to this letter.  If further claims are received after 21 July similar details should be supplied.</P>
    <P>9.  I feel I cannot stress too strongly the need for Government policy on pay to be observed consistently throughout the public sector and I feel sure that I can rely on you and your Board to ensure that your organisation complies with Government policy as outlined in the budget statement and in this letter.  If any doubts arise about the status of a particular claim, offer or commitment or about other aspects of the new pay policy the matter should be referred, in writing, to my Department for consideration.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that they are implementing an extensive programme of industrial development in the inner city area of Dublin.  In the north inner city, the IDA have acquired five acres of land at two locations and are currently finalising negotiations for the purchase of a further ten acre site in the port area.  Over 29 individual factory units totalling about 200,000 sq. ft. have been completed or are under construction at present on these sites.  The IDA estimates that these units have the capability to house projects which could provide a total of 800 jobs at full production.</P>
      <P>The total cost of IDA investment in the north inner city amounts to £5.6 million. Whilst recruitment of staff in assisted projects is the responsibility of the promoter, the authority will nevertheless seek to maximise the level of local employment in inner city projects.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 565 of 18 November 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2195" /> The Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930, and the Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation Act, 1953, fixed this maritime boundary of Dublin County Borough at low water mark.  Any development carried out beyond this boundary, i.e. on land reclaimed by infill, is strictly outside the jurisdiction of Dublin Corporation.  I understand that under the terms of an agreement made in January 1972 the Dublin Port and Docks Board gave an undertaking that future developments in the port area would be carried out only in accordance with the terms of Harbour Works Orders made by the Minister for Transport and Tourism and that planning permission for any development (other than exempted development) would be applied for in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts.  I also understand that it is a condition of all leases of lands in the port that the lessee must obtain planning permission.  The position in related to local authority maritime boundaries generally is being examined in my Department.</P>

      <P>The registration of births is governed principally by the Births and Deaths Registration Acts of 1863 and 1880.  These Acts provide for the registration of all births which occur within the State.</P>
      <P>I presume that the type of case to which the question relates is an application to register a birth to a married woman in which it is claimed that her husband is not the father of the child.  I have been advised that it is not legally open to a married person to assert for the purpose of registering a birth that a child born to the wife is not the child of the husband and that the registering authority can only make an entry in the register showing a person other than the husband as being the father of a child where this has been determined by court proceedings. In the absence of a court ruling to this effect the birth may, however, be registered without the inclusion of any particulars relating to the father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case in which a birth of this nature has remained unregistered the <Col N="2198" /> birth can be registered if the mother or other qualified informant applies to the registrar.  Superintendent registrars have been advised that where a registrar is aware of such an unregistered birth in his district and is in a position to contact the mother he should invite her to attend at his office so that he can explain the procedure for having the birth registered.</P>

      <P>The student in question resides in the Moate post-primary catchment area and he is entitled to free transport to the Moate post-primary centre.  Under the terms of the post-primary transport scheme he could avail of catchment boundary facility to Mullingar catchment area provided all eligible children were catered for, that no extra cost to the State is incurred and that there is room on the existing service to Mullingar.  The service <Col N="2222" /> to Mullingar is full at present, catering for a substantial number of eligible children and a small number of pupils availing of catchment boundary facilities, one of whom is this student's brother.  A school-bus ticket was not issued to the student in question and, therefore, could not have been withdrawn.</P>

      <P>The programme for the stimulation of agricultural development in the West of Ireland outlines the details of the measures provided for in Regulation (EEC) No. 1820/80.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2223" /> The programme consists of the following measures:</P>
    <P>1.  Provision of Electricity Supplies &mdash; (a) new supplies to farms; (b) increased supplies to farms; (c) 3-phase supply to farms; (d) supply to agricultural marketing and processing plants; (e) selected network improvements; Aid amounting to 80 per cent of the capital cost of a-d above is available to applicants.</P>
    <P>2.  Provision of Water Supplies &mdash; (a) Private Group Schemes: 80 per cent grants are available to applicants subject to a maximum of £600 per house and £400 per potential farm supply.  Higher rates of grant apply in Gaeltacht areas and on populated islands off the west coast; (b) Public Water Schemes: Selected county council schemes will qualify for grants covering 80 per cent of the cost or 90 per cent in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>3.  Roads &mdash; (a) Local Roads (County Roads); (b) Farm Roads (Access Roads) &mdash; 90 per cent grants are available; (c) Forest Roads and Roads Serving Commonages and Mountain and Hill Grazing &mdash; 80 per cent grants are available (see Items Nos. 4 and 6 below).</P>
    <P>4.

    <P>5.  Orientation of Agricultural Production &mdash; This measure is open to all farmers who: (a) practice farming as their main occupation; (b) are not able to attain the comparable income under the farm modernisation scheme; (c) are not eligible to avail of the farm retirement scheme; (d) undertake to follow a farm improvement plan with the emphasis on <Col N="2224" /> the expansion of cattle and sheep numbers and keep simplified accounts in the prescribed form from the start of the plan.</P>
    <P>The following incentives are available &mdash; (a) Grants: 35 per cent for farm buildings, 25 per cent for fixed equipment; (b) Calf to Beef Interest Subsidy: Farmers following improvement plans orientating cattle production towards an integrated calf to beef system can qualify for an interest subsidy not exceeding 16 per cent on a loan of up to £100 per animal for two years on each calf entering the system in the first and second year of the plan.</P>
    <P>6.  Afforestation &mdash; The aim is to encourage private forestry; Forestry Development &mdash; Forestry development includes ground preparation, ploughing, drainage planting and fencing; Grants: 85 per cent for farmers, 70 per cent for others; Shelter Belts &mdash; Details of this scheme are being finalised at present.</P>
    <P>7.

    <P>8.  Grants for agricultural marketing and processing &mdash; Whilst outside the scope of the Programme, Regulation 1820/80 also provides for a special allocation of £5.2 million each year for three years under the existing FEOGA projects scheme for improving facilities for marketing and processing of agricultural products.  The level of grant now applying in the western region is 50 per cent as against 25 per cent elsewhere.</P>
    <P>9.  Financial Aspects &mdash; The FEOGA contribution towards the cost of the measures in the Programme and of the marketing and processing projects is estimated at 224 million ECU.  FEOGA will reimburse 50 per cent of State expenditure incurred on the programme.</P>
    <P>This may not exceed 40 per cent of the <Col N="2225" /> cost in the case of electricity, water supplies or roads.</P>
    <P>An advance of £2.714 million is expected from the EEC within the next few days.  £0.95 million has already been paid directly by FEOGA to applicants in respect of marketing and processing projects.</P>
