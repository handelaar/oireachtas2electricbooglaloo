      <P>No. A statement describing what happened was issued following the meeting.  It was a first contact between the Secretary of State, the Tánaiste, the Minister and myself and there will be a meeting with the British Prime Minister before long.

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not think it would be desirable that he should give the House some information about this meeting?  Otherwise we shall have to rely on newspaper reports of what may <Col N="562" /> or may not have happened.  Would the Taoiseach not accept that in view of the present situation it would be courteous, at least, and I suggest mandatory on him, to give us some indication of what, if anything, took place?</P>

      <P>No.  I do not think there is any precedent for a statement following such a meeting with a Minister of another Government.  In view of the close juxtaposition of this meeting and that with the Prime Minister, I do not think it is desirable at this stage to make a statement about the matters discussed yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was interrupted by Question Time last week I was giving my views and those of my constituents on why I condemn the supplementary budget introduced by this Government last July.  The Deputies from all parties, big and small, who support the Government must know the feelings of their constituents which I am sure they hear each weekend when they return.  That supplementary budget could be summed up as demoralising for the whole community.  Its effect will be to increase the rate of inflation.  Industry and agriculture are suffering very heavily.  I might mention that a special convention is to be held tonight by the IFA in the Cork Opera House in order to highlight the situation in agriculture and I have no doubt that much will be said about the budget.</P>
      <P>The Government are having great difficulty in putting together their tax package and major decisions on the mode of operation are still outstanding.  Tax officers are demoralised.  I wonder how the 300,000 cheques for the infamous £9.60 will be sent out.  This ploy fooled many people into voting for Fine Gael but attempts are now being made to whittle down this promise and some people are saying it is a mistake.  Will it ever be introduced and, if so, will the amount be increased in line with inflation?  The promise was made last May and it is claimed that the payment will be introduced in April.  Will back money be payable or will the value be updated?  Civil servants say that extra staffing will be needed to deal with this mammoth task, yet it is the policy of the Government to freeze intake to the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This supplementary budget was introduced not because, as was alleged, the cupboard was bare but to provide funds for the implementation of election pledges which were no more than a cheap gimmick to win votes and which are distorting the whole thrust of economic policy.  If the Government carry out these measures we will be faced with Estimates next year which will include substantial reductions.  The IMF, the director of the ESRI and the leader of the Labour Party have all pressed the Government to postpone <Col N="564" /> their tax reforms but, while the Government are very often happy to quote such authorities when it suits them, they will ignore their advice when they choose.</P>
    <P>The Government have abandoned the fight against unemployment.  I referred earlier to the situation in the motor industry and the construction industry is also in deep trouble.  The blame for this lies totally on the shoulders of the Government.  Not since the middle fifties have so many tradesmen been unemployed. Surely Members who support this Finance Bill must be aware of this through their dealings with constituents. The 50 per cent increase in VAT was a major factor in discouraging the development of the construction and allied industries.  Another factor was the interference by the Minister for the Environment with housing loans, grants and subsidies.</P>
    <P>While Fianna Fáil were in Government they endeavoured to hold down unemployment figures and up to June this year the number out of work was rising less rapidly than in most EEC countries, although we were not satisfied that there should be any increase.  There was a rise of 27 per cent here, compared with 60 per cent in Britain and the Netherlands and 44 per cent in Germany.  The unemployment figures showed signs of stabilising in May and June but we have seen a progressive rise since then as a result of this Government's deflationary policies. They have frozen job creation in the public service and placed the whole burden of job creation on the private sector.  The Taoiseach said for the first time last weekend that the creation and preservation of jobs is the first priority.  Why then has he imposed a freeze on the creation of posts in the public sector?  Who will look after the weekly payments of £9.60?  Why has he reduced the number of teaching posts in primary schools and the intake to teacher-training colleges?</P>
    <P>The speaker who preceded me issued a challenge which had something to do with our plan for economic development. I issue a challenge to him, the entire Government and all the parties, small <Col N="565" /> and large, who are publicly supporting the keeping in power of this Government.  The challenge is: go to Cavan-Monaghan and prove your worth if you think your policies are right and this Government have the right to stay in power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>In this, my first speech to the House, I am conscious that this debate is about getting our political priorities right.  It is a start to ensuring responsible control of the nation's financial affairs.  There are many who would like to continue being spared the harsh reality of our foreign debts, our empty cupboard, who would prefer to distance themselves from the operations and affairs of the Exchequer.  I believe that the fact that this Government initiated tough economic measures, almost before they had warmed the seats of this House, brought home to a majority of people the seriousness to them, their children, their communities of a country close to bankruptcy.</P>
      <P>In the intervening time since last July, there has been a growing realisation of the reasons which motivated the Minister for Finance to introduce this supplementary budget.  Mainly these reasons are to do with the fact that the last Government conducted the financial affairs of this nation like drunken spendthrifts.</P>
      <P>In January last the Exchequer borrowing requirement was decided at £1,296 million of which £515 million was to finance the current budget deficit for the year.  Only six months later &mdash; by the end of June almost all of this £515 million was borrowed &mdash; the actual figure was £457 million.  Quite literally, the economy was so sick that it was haemorrhaging massively, and if not checked, the patient, in this case the Irish economy, would have bled to death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I suggest, with apologies to the housewives and mothers of Ireland, that if they handled their household affairs like the last Government, their children would be going around in tatters, hungry and miserable, and they would be &ldquo;in hock&rdquo; to the moneylenders?  Unlike the previous administration, they would not be cavalier about it and dismiss their mismanagement <Col N="566" /> with ear to ear cheer, as Fianna Fáil did.</P>
    <P>It does not help for us to know the reasons for the overspending, and the fudged figures.  For 18 months there was an election in the offing, and the old Fianna Fáil tactic of trying to buy people with their own money was to be tried yet again, except this time, they spread the bounty around before the election, instead of putting it in their manifesto. Voters, they rightly suspected, would not fall for the same trick twice from them. So, in the dying days of the last Government, all kinds of marvellous schemes were thought up, to be paid for with borrowed money, and despite the prudent advice of Deputy McCreevy, these schemes were foisted on an unconvinced public: &ldquo;A new house?  Here is £4,000 to ease the pain.  A new sports centre?  Go ahead, sign the contract, never mind the details&rdquo;.  Fifty-five such schemes were approved by letter, although no funds existed to cover them.  Irish people are human: if a promise seems attractive they are tempted to accept it.  If a Government give the impression that we can live on the never-never, who is to blame the people if they also overspend?</P>
    <P>And yet, despite all the spurious optimism and reckless spending, the people were not fooled.  They realised that you cannot run a home, a business or a country indefinitely on the Kathleen Mavourneen system.  They saw through Fianna Fáil's cloud cuckoo land of economic unreality, and opted for a Government which would have the courage to spend within our means, the means of the people, and to plan for the future.</P>
    <P>Of course it is easier to borrow your way into trouble than it is to live within your means.  But we all know that living within your means, and planning ahead, leads to a far greater sense of security. June 11 last could be regarded as the day the bubble burst for Fianna Fáil.  That day showed that people are prepared to accept that small sacrifices are needed to secure our futures.</P>
    <P>This supplementary budget marks the first essential step in this Government's phased economic programme.  For my part, and I believe I reflect the thinking <Col N="567" /> of a majority of people, I know that if Deputy Haughey's party now occupied these Government benches they would have had to introduce similar or tougher measures if they were not to continue to go abroad with the begging bowl.  Is anyone outside their own party flock fooled by their protestations of innocence now?</P>
    <P>Despite the perilous state of the economy when we took office, we gave an undertaking that there would be no further increases in 1981 in the price of specified key foodstuffs, namely, bread, flour, milk, butter and margarine.  This provision is in recognition of the difficulty such price increases would cause to the weaker sections of our community.  Furthermore, the Minister for Finance has announced the initiation of three schemes to deal with particular problems of the elderly and the young.  These are the Community Care Task Force, aimed at improving the living conditions of the old, the Youth Employment Services Scheme, which will meet particular needs of the community, and the Youth Employment Enterprise Scheme, the purpose of which is to provide information and funding for young people with viable business proposals.</P>
    <P>It is my experience that many people have expressed agreement with the July budget provisions and with the philosophy enunciated by the Minister for Finance.  An even more significant feature of public reaction was the suggestion from many that our measures under this Bill did not go far enough.  I feel this indicates a sharper understanding of the reality of national economics among the general public than they are generally credited with.</P>
    <P>Let us make no mistake, it was neither an accident nor a stroke of fate that the electorate, given the choice of another term under the leadership of Deputy Haughey or a new start with Deputy Garret FitzGerald, voted as they did last June.</P>
    <P>In addressing myself to Irishwomen I should like to record that over the years this House has seen a tiny number of Deputies who have taken a sincere interest in the needs and problems of Irishwomen. <Col N="568" />  For the most part the rights of 51 per cent of the electorate have been virtually ignored.  To an extent, women themselves are to blame for this.  But then they accepted low expectations and played a passive political role in society, because our system moulded them to submit to a mystical and unreal image of what women should be rather than what women could be.  There have been enlightened politicians in the past, but so far no one like the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, who did not merely talk about making politics and elections relevant for women: he actually encouraged their participation, and for the first time ever women's needs were given serious priority in an election manifesto in this country.  It was a new beginning for us, because the sad reality is that since the birth of this State 60 years ago, successive Dáils stand indicted for their negligence and disregard for the needs of our female citizens.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I do not intend in the future to spend my time here carping and complaining about the mistakes &mdash; and there have been many &mdash; of the past.  My objective is to attempt, in a constructive way, to motivate Deputies by raising issues of fundamental importance to the daily lives and future of women and children and seeking their support for necessary changes.</P>
    <P>Women as a group have a vested interest in seeing that our society is wisely managed.  Our nation has the highest family dependency rate, the highest birthrate in the EEC, and, matched to this, we have a neglected record of development and planning in essential areas related to the needs of families.  Just examine our fragmented community health programme.  We do not have a comprehensive public health nursing service, we do not have a comprehensive family planning service, and our preventative and educational medical schemes leave much to be desired.  One example I should like to give is of the important breast cancer screening technique of mammography which is available in other countries but is virtually unavailable for women here, even for diagnostic reasons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> This is in a country where the death rate from the disease is around 500 women per year.  Furthermore, we do not have a structure of playschools to cater for what must be the largest population of small children in Europe.  We cannot finance a meaningful retraining programme for women in mid-life.  Above all, we need maternity hospitals where women, all women and not just the privileged few, can give birth with dignity. The list is endless, but all need money. Available funding is essential, and this in the long term can only be provided by proper economic planning and a sense of vision.  I am glad a start has been made.</P>
    <P>Now I should like to turn specially to the proposed stay-at-home-allowance which will be effective in the coming year. Some of the views expressed in this debate on that provision I have found to be utterly depressing.  I respect everyone's right to hold and put forward their views, but opinions based on prejudice or ignorance should be seen clearly for what they are.  And, likewise, the people who make them.  To those Deputies I say: &ldquo;Hands off the women's allowance; you do not speak for Irishwomen.  Wives and mothers of this State came out with their prams and their toddlers on a wet day and put their approval on our proposed allowance on record.  Do not treat them as nitwits, whose democratic choice is of so little value that it can be overruled in this House&rdquo;.  This allowance is the first step to recognising the role and contribution of women in the home and as such is a response to years of campaigning by individual women and representative groups of women.  Most Deputies can never realise what this modest sum will mean to many women.  Whether we like it or not, society's measure of one's worth has always been in terms of financial recognition for work done.  This allowance establishes the principle that women have rights to financial reward, the same as anyone else.  I can assure those who may question the validity of this concept that there are mothers in this city&mdash;yes, even in the desirable suburbs&mdash;who would not on any day of the week have the price of a bus ride to town.  This state of poverty is called financial dependence <Col N="570" /> and represents the lowest form of humiliation to many wives.  But I must emphasise that the welcome for this allowance goes far beyond the type of wife I have just quoted.  Women out there are saying to us: &ldquo;it is about time you got the message, now get on with the job&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To deal with the spurious argument that in implementing this proposal the State is interfering in the affairs of the family, I suggest that we put this into its proper context long ago.  We heard the same pathetic defence back in 1973 when we had the debate on vesting rights to the children's allowance in the mother rather than the father.  We also had it to a lesser degree when the Government were introducing measures&mdash;not that long ago&mdash;to protect women who were being battered in their own homes.  It is worth noting, as many women have, the level of consciousness of contemporary Irish-women's role we found among the ranks of Fianna Fáil last June.  Where else in the world, I question, would one find a political party taking large expensive advertisements in all newspapers to proclaim their sexual bias to the electorate? They said to women: &ldquo;Your husband is the boss, he does the most important job of earning the income, you can lay no claim to that money&rdquo;.  I will refresh memories of those advertisements for those who have forgotten: &ldquo;Men, Fine Gael are making advances to your wife, and they are doing it with your money&rdquo;.  Yes, Fine Gael have designs on Irish wives, but they address their remarks directly to the wives because we see a wife as a person in her own right.  It is a sad fact that, if those advertisements are a true reflection of the thinking of the largest party in the land, then Irishwomen still have a steep uphill battle to win.</P>
    <P>For most women the £9.60 per week, plus the increased weekly children's allowance of £3, represents the first step in an enlightened programme for women. It is a sound platform to be built on.  For my part I will work to ensure that women are not disappointed, for I know they are watching this administration with hope and expectation.  To be part of a Government who have a sincere commitment to social and legal reform is a joy to me; and <Col N="571" /> to know that we have a determined policy to plan, and are prepared to take necessary though unpopular measures to ensure a prosperous future for all, men and women, is indeed a challenging experience for me, a new female Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have developing now an extraordinary political scene indeed. I am sure that to the political commentators it is a real joy to have the Coalition in power.  They are providing endless type for those commentators in foretelling what might or might not happen from day to day; and, those who suggested this was going to be a lively session are accurate.  It is a bizarre scene when one considers the situation.  We have this extraordinary galaxy of rising and falling stars here daily and I wonder if the Government have taken note that they are in Government because some of them speak as if they were still in Opposition. We have the extraordinary situation of backbenchers, frontbenchers and hopeful frontbenchers criticising each other as to what should or should not be done by the Government.  If the Government claim they were elected to govern the country they should recognise that they are in office and get on with the business. As far as we are concerned, the present situation would lead me to jocund merriment but for the fact that it has serious consequences for Ireland at home and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been enormous damage done since the Coalition took office by the extraordinary preoccupation of the Government in bashing themselves. They are leaving no room for the Opposition to get in on the act.  They should recognise that they are in Government, carry out their duty and leave us to adopt the role that has been given to us by the electorate to deal with them.  Of course, because of the internal wrangling in Fine Gael between the Ministers and the backbenchers and between Fine Gael and the Labour Party, the decent thing to do would be to go to the country and have the matter sorted out once and for all. They should have the test that would <Col N="572" /> decide the matter for a decent period of Government.  I cannot remember who made the comment but it certainly is true that we come in here and pray for guidance, but at the very moment of the prayer we have no confidence in the good Lord that we are praying to and we are thinking up our own answers to the prayers that we are offering up every morning.  Perhaps we could do without that little bit of hypocrisy as well.</P>
    <P>The effect of the budget that this Finance Bill applies to is to reduce growth here and all the political commentators, both national and international, recognise this.  It has increased unemployment and inflation.  There has been a drop in the living standards of ordinary people. I would suggest to the Government that they have no mandate from the people for the inflationary policies that they have adopted since going into office.</P>
    <P>I recognise that Deputy Nuala Fennell was making her maiden speech and it is not political etiquette to interrupt but I found it hard to resist the temptation.  Let us be honest in admitting that Deputy Fennell's party have done more to bring about a situation where there are children going around this town in tatters than any other party since the foundation of this State.  During any of the periods when Fianna Fáil were in Government nobody suggested that such a situation would be reached or had been reached.  So it is not quite honest of Deputy Fennell to come in here and talk of children going around in tatters.  They would not be but for the inflationary policies that have been put through this House by the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>We have the great arrogance of the authoritarian-style Government creeping into this country again.  This arrogance is creeping on the Government Ministers day by day.  We saw some displays of it last week.  If we are to believe some of the snippets that make their way into the gossip columns in political life here, then some of the Ministers have become so arrogant that they must be referred to as Minister.  But so be it.  That kind of arrogance always finds its way into Coalition operations and did in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a moment.  We have a continuation of this non-caring attitude to family hardship. Deputy Fennell and the other Fine Gael Deputies should note that this unemployment misery has been created by them. Fianna Fáil have always recognised that unemployment was at too high a level but were determined to keep a rein on it and stop it going out of control.  But the policies being implemented by this Government leave no hope of that whatsoever and the misery being felt throughout the country because of unemployment can only be gauged when one leaves some of the plusher suburban city areas.</P>
      <P>We have heard no speeches from any Government Ministers about relieving the situation.  They have decided to stop talking about it, to raise smokescreens with other matters.  The only reason that is being done is to divert the people's attention from the hardship they are creating.  I wish some Government Ministers would make at least the occasional speech and express an interest in unemployment, inflation and rising prices.  If we even got some suggestion that they had something in mind to deal with the matter instead of talking about issues that may be important there would be some hope.  These other matters should take their proper place in the order of priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Fine Gael Deputies are preaching and are being told to preach is a policy and an attitude which is not perhaps held by their own Leader.  I refer to the Taoiseach's comments at a recent bi-annual dinner of the Stock Exchange. I am quite sure that the Taoiseach did not have a big audience of unemployed people there.  Perhaps it was hoped that some of his comments at that function might not get the same kind of political press coverage as they would if he were making a speech here in the House.  But the matters that he referred to at that function are well worth bearing in mind. They showed, beyond yea or nay, that the Taoiseach himself has double vision <Col N="574" /> and double thinking on some matters of economic importance to this country. One of the suggestions he made at that function was that the risk of major financial crisis has been effectively eliminated now that the Government commitment to sustainable and convergent strategy for public finances was well understood and recognised.  That is a fine mouthful for any politician to get across to the ordinary voters here.  But it is important to understand the significance of it.  The Taoiseach says that the crisis has been effectively eliminated.  By Jove, what this Government have done has been very severe, and if we are now to believe that the crisis has passed and that the blow struck last July was enough to deal effectively with the matter, how can that attitude be accommodated to Government Ministers trotting around the country saying that terrible harshness is needed to deal with the continuing crisis.  Their own Leader says it is past.  The only thing that I can say about the sustainable and convergent strategy is that there certainly has been a sustained attack on the finances of the ordinary people and certainly we are converging on disaster.  It is suggested that the crisis in public finances is well understood and recognised by everybody.  Most certainly it is understood by the gurus of Fine Gael and those who have been commissioned by Fine Gael to pay due attention to their election manifesto for the next time out, which is not too far distant.  It is well recognised by everybody that ultra right-wing conservativism has crept into the policies, economic, social and otherwise of this country.  That is what is recognised and understood by the people.  I wish the Government would make up their minds. If the crisis is over then let us get a different shape in the policies that are being enunciated daily by the Government Ministers.  The Taoiseach continued at that function to go into some depth about the situation.  He also suggested that in 1981 the current deficit would not deviate at all significantly from that projected last July.  If that is the case then what is all the wild talk about the bankers of the world knocking at our doors?  It is under control.  It was nipped in the bud <Col N="575" /> by Garret and the boys.  It was nipped in the bud by the Taoiseach and his friends in one stroke last July and now the situation is under total control.</P>
    <P>I wish they would be consistent and preach that kind of thing to the general public rather than having poor innocent people coming in here with Government briefs and saying: &ldquo;Things are difficult. We will have to take harsh measures and get a lot of money together to introduce an early goody-goody budget.  Then we will go to the country and get rid of the millstone around our necks called the Labour Party.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I must refer to another suggestion made at that famous function.  The Taoiseach said that their commitment to cutting the budget deficit was not empty rhetoric unmatched by performance when the numbers are counted.  The bingo session has started in Irish politics, and the numbers coming out now are entirely different from what they were in July.  The numbers coming out of the bingo machine and trotted out here every day are matching up and all is well for the stockbrokers but not for the ordinary people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>He went on to ask where to dismantle, where to restructure and where to collect more revenue.  Certainly they are dismantling.  They know where and how to dismantle, and they are going about it systematically.  Their dismantling is to be found in every corner under the control of the Government.  They are dismantling our health services.  I will deal with that at length before I finish.  They are dismantling our educational institutions and services.  They are good at that.  They are dismantling the local authorities and the health boards.  They are good at the dismantling process.</P>
    <P>They are also good at restructuring and collection of more revenue.  They have gone about collecting more revenue in no uncertain terms, not because it is necessary for social and economic reasons, but for political reasons to get in as much money as possible.  The Minister for Finance stated unequivocally that it was the quickest way to get the cash.  The Taoiseach said there is no crisis, that the <Col N="576" /> crisis has moved away.  Why then do they need these enormous amounts of cash, unless it is to finance a programme next year which they hope will lead them into the promised land of running Ireland on their own?  Of course, they are leading us into the no man's land of ruining Ireland, not running it.</P>
    <P>In that very important speech to those very important people who have their finger on the pulse of international monetary funds, it was suggested that the slippery slope is now irrelevant because of the Government's commitment to reform.  That was a fine statement from the Taoiseach who has his Ministers trotting around Ireland preaching doom and gloom to all and sundry.  I will deal at some length with some of that so-called restructuring and reform, and we will see the depths to which this misguided Government are prepared to go to further their own base political aims.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell suggested that the Fianna Fáil tactic was to buy votes earlier this year by putting a programme of goodies in front of the people.  We offered things which we felt were necessary.  I do not know what to call the commitment to reform her Government have in mind, but it left us standing so far as promises of goodies were concerned. Deputy Fennell did not quite appreciate the impact of two sentences she uttered in the House this morning following on her remarks about tactics.  She said that during the election Fianna Fáil offered a grant of £4,000 for a new house and also promised sports centres.</P>
    <P>I know she is a caring and concerned person about the needs of the ordinary people in the community.  It was less than honest of her to suggest she was against those provisions.  I would regret it greatly if I thought people like Deputy Fennell were now suggesting it was not right and proper to help young people to build their own homes by giving them a decent grant or mortgage subsidy.  I would regret it even more if I thought Deputy Fennell really believed sports facilities were not an essential requirement.</P>

      <P>I want to get back to political reform as against taxation or economic reform. We had a fine example of political reform on the day this Dáil met for the first time. It is important to remember it because it is a significant aspect of Coalition government.  I refer to the Taoiseach's attitude in the appointment of his Government. To say he handled it most maladroitly would be to put it very loosely indeed.  In his appointment of his Government, he not only humiliated some long-standing upright members of his party but he also alienated them from his own party, and that is more important.  There is now a gang who would be as happy as Larry to be rid of the good Deputy Dr. FitzGerald as Taoiseach.  The significance of this is now beginning to show.  The strategy of those alienated and humiliated souls is growing and festering.</P>
      <P>All and sundry are beginning to see that there is no cohesion in the Government and no loyalty to the Taoiseach. They want to get rid of him.  This happened so quickly that people cannot credit it.  Leading members of the Fine Gael Party are openly defying their party Leader even here in the House.  That is nothing compared with what is being said in the corridors.  I am not talking about the corridors of power but the corridors where adjustments of attitude are being made by people who were humiliated and alienated.  This serious internal political crisis is pre-occupying the Coalition Government so much that all they can discuss, I understand, is how to deal with &ldquo;your man&rdquo; or will &ldquo;your man&rdquo; step out of line again and, if so, what will they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have that coupled with the sham situation which is now the Labour Party. The people know well, by tradition and experience, that coalitions do not work but have taken the electoral decision on occasions to put Fianna Fáil out of Government.  We were only out a month when all the people who were saying that it was time for a change are now saying that we <Col N="578" /> should keep at them until we get them out.  Many of those are Fine Gael people. They know that it will not work on this occasion either, even with the great Garrett.  The Government are expending a lot of energy dealing with the Independent Members who keep them in the &ldquo;brown leather seats&rdquo; a previous speaker referred to.  The question of dealing with Independents has a debilitating effect on any Government's performance.  I would like to know from some Minister what political procedures are now adopted and is permission to proceed with a particular piece of legislation achieved before or after the policy is formulated?</P>
    <P>People would like to know those things because they have a great bearing on the legislative programme we are getting.  The credibility of the Government is in shreds.  They have to humour the Independents and meet them privately. No important decision can be taken until the lines are cleared with those people. They are entitled to their opinion, but are they entitled to as much opinion as they are being given?  The people want to know if they are being credited with more attention than they are electorally entitled to.</P>
    <P>How does one deal with this?  We see the Taoiseach and some of his Ministers arranging their schedule, no matter what is on or how important nationally or internationally it is, to humour the Independents before they can get the all-clear to deal with a legislative programme which the Taoiseach says is so important and which has been the cause of putting aside all other things, including the Cavan-Monaghan by-election.  The result has been that we are getting some legislative goodies that would not normally have been given at this time when there are so many other pressing matters which we say need to be attended to but which the Taoiseach in one of his recent speeches said have now been dealt with. We are told that the crisis has been fixed since 23 July last.</P>
    <P>The Independents are now playing a role which it was never intended they should play in a democracy and we are getting some legislation which they particularly want and have made arrangements <Col N="579" /> with the Government about.  Has it the full support of the people?  My biggest disappointment last week was the performance of Deputy Noel Browne, for whom I always had a sneaking regard. I always regarded him as a purist in the socialist sense but I am afraid he deviated from that last week in a very telling way. Last spring he found it absolutely essential and important democratically to move the by-election writ for North Tipperary.  He was entitled to that view.  He felt the people should have their representative in here for a day, a week, a month or a year.  However, he found it in his heart to change his tune last week and say that it was not now necessary, that it was the start of a Dáil session which we are told will go on for four years.</P>
    <P>What makes a man like Deputy Noel Browne change his view so radically on such a fundamentally democratic issue? It is because he had made an arrangement for certain legislative matters to be dealt with.  They were matters essential to his thinking over a long period.  One of those would deal with capital punishment.  I would not like to pre-empt what might happen in relation to this issue over the next few days, but the good Deputy might be disappointed that even his best laid plans to have this matter dealt with may be thwarted.  He may find that among those he made the deal with there are some who would sabotage his effort to implement that arrangement.  He might also find there are those in other parties who feel that the time is not ripe for this legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne said last week that it is important that corporal punishment be removed.  I must admit, as a person who worked in the area where corporal punishment was once the order of the day &mdash; in recent times the position has changed and corporal punishment is fading away &mdash; that there might be second thoughts about that as well.  I wish that some of the people who are so obsessed by the idea of having corporal punishment banished from our society were just as forthright in regard to other forms of punishment which are handed out to our youth.  There are more ways of beating a <Col N="580" /> child than giving him a slap on the hand. Mental abuse is also punishment handed out to our young people.  I mean by mental abuse total freedom in television and radio to broadcast programmes which are not suitable for young people.  Perhaps a tightening of the laws in that area might be more important at this time than the question of corporal punishment.  I have not finally made up my mind on that matter yet, because I have seen the results of corporal punishment.  I have also seen good done by a little slap at the appropriate time at home and I have also seen the good done on occasions in schools by a slap in dealing with certain matters.  It did not leave any mark subsequently on the child.  Perhaps I will get the opportunity of going into that on another occasion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne said last week there was also to be an arrangement about a new Family Planning Bill.  It will be very interesting to see what happens in relation to that.  I wonder what arrangements will be made to change the existing situation?  Is it part of the deal being done to guarantee the support of some of the Independents that perhaps we are on a slippery slope to abortion and other kinds of legislation?  People do not want these things and are afraid that deals will be done for political purposes to bring about such situations.</P>

      <P>There were to be arrangements with other Independents on capital taxation and that probably touches the Minister's heart strings.  It is suggested that the Government are about to attempt something like a new 60 per cent band on capital taxation.  That would be a nice trick.  If a deal is done on that the Government will not be around to see it put through the House.  One Independent in a casual remark last week stated that inside of 12 months the banks would be nationalised.  I do not know what the Government will nationalise.  As far as I am concerned they are nationalised already.</P>

      <P>The Government have a strangle-hold on the banks.  They refuse to allow them to lend by way of bridging. The banks are not allowed to use their surplus to make money available in the money market to people who wish to borrow.  The truth is that the banks are all but nationalised in name.  Ask any bank manager and he will tell you that. Banks have surplus funds but they cannot get their hands on them because the Central Bank says &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The Government are utilising all this money.  Are we now to see the final act in the splitting of the banks' throat?  The few hundred million pounds the Government would get if the banks were nationalised would be frittered away in one fell swoop.  We would be the laughing stock of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are these parts of a deal done with the Independents because, if they are, why do we not have the new legislative programme we will have to endure over the next year or so?  There was a change of tactic in this budget and we now have punitive indirect taxation which is supposed to deal mar dhea with the budget deficit.  It has nothing to do with that because if it had we would not have had the speech the Taoiseach trotted out last week to the stockbrokers.  The budget deficit was well known before the election.  How else could the Taoiseach have spoken about what was necessary to reduce it over a four year period?  When he was questioned by astute political commentators he said that was a question that should be left until they got a look at the books.  However, both the Taoiseach and his Minister for Finance were telling all and sundry about the deficit and they quoted figures.  They did not want to talk to political commentators about it before the election.  What happened at the election?  Fine Gael stated that nothing positive would be done about this matter until 1983 at the earliest.  What made it so acute that this savage attack had to be made as soon as they got in the door? Was all revealed to them on the road to Leinster House?  Did a light shine on them when they thought they had a <Col N="582" /> chance of getting onto the brown leather seats over there?</P>
    <P>In advance of the election they stated they had no knowledge of the deficit.  We made no secret that the deficit was what it was.  They said nothing positive would be done until 1983 but that in the meantime &mdash; it is now not as serious as it was last week &mdash; it would be reduced through buoyancy of revenue.  That is a mouthful. Things have changed utterly.  They stated to the electorate before and during the campaign that there would be no supplementary budget in 1981.  Buoyancy of revenue would look after the deficit this year and next year until they got their tune set up in 1983.  I bracket with &ldquo;buoyancy&rdquo; the simple term &ldquo;sinking&rdquo;.  That is what the Government are about to do now.  They are determined to sink us all.</P>
    <P>The excuse after the election, when the light shone on them coming up the steps of Leinster House, was that they were alarmed at the extent of the deficit despite the fact that they are on record as saying they knew all the figures.  They castigated us here daily because of the figures.  This new-found information was the justification for all the brain-bashing and income-bashing that has taken place since then.  The Government knew well the extent of the deficit before and during the election.  It was no more news to them than it was to us.  It is a cruel deception of the people to try to keep up this propaganda that it was otherwise.</P>
    <P>Why did the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance not say they would cripple the electorate with new taxation?  Why did they not tell the farmers there would be nothing for them or, as the Minister for Agriculture so eloquently put it last week, &ldquo;Tighten your belts, boys, that is the way it has to be&rdquo;?  Why did they not tell the workers they would not be compensated for price increases as a result of their harsh budget or that their standard of living would be lowered?  They could not tell the electorate this because their campaign would be in ribbons.  However, the election is over now and the Government think they can cod the people by this half-baked tax restructure and the other policy, which can only be referred to as a seduction of some unfortunate <Col N="583" /> housewives.  These are the women about whom Deputy Fennell is so concerned and whose needs, according to her, are being recognised now for the first time. I would remind the good Deputy that any worthwhile step ever taken to further women's rights was taken by Fianna Fáil. While I accept to a large extent what she says I am not confident that women's rights are best being served in the way in which they are being dealt with now.  We had a full programme dealing with this whole area but to continue to hack this question about is to lessen the status of women and their femininity.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose that we are paragons of economic virtue but we are snow-white in purity compared to the perpetrators of the Coalition's mismanagemment from which we have suffered in the past few months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us consider some of the changes that are being suggested in the taxation system as part of its restructuring.  All that is involved is a switch from direct to indirect taxation.  There is nothing new or extraordinary in that.  The basic elements would be the reduction of the deficit by way of the imposition of further indirect taxation but further increases will have to be imposed in order to pay for that reduction and, in addition, there will have to be more indirect taxation to further the new and laughable price tag of £9.60 per week on the married bliss of Irish people.  These three impositions, or millstones as they might be called, would provide the formula for social unrest and national despondency and would lead to a depressed, frustrated and impoverished population.  That is <Col N="584" /> generally recognised by all the pundits at this time.</P>
      <P>On this whole question of the tax reform package we should like to hear which side of the Government will have their way.  There are those on both sides of the divide in furthering this new package, a package which is being recognised as folly and as having no relevance in Irish terms to economic revival.  Instead, it will do enormous damage to the economy as has been recognised both nationally and internationally by those who are supposed to know.  The reason for this is that the changes would require massive increases in indirect taxation. Among those who have spoken against these proposed changes are the IMF, the ESRI, the Leader of the Labour Party, the disgruntled and, perhaps, disappointed Fine Gael members, the Revenue Commissioners, some of the Labour gurus as well as independent bodies and others, many of whom this Government have used in the past to promote their ideas for the necessity for taking certain steps but whose advice is not being taken this time.  It is so easy to change one's ground and to find excuses for doing so but we must ask who will benefit from these tax changes.  Obviously, the poor and the needy will not be among the beneficiaries because if the reforms are implemented there will be new pay demands, many of which will be justifiable, with subsequent price increases and the inevitable industrial and agricultural cost increases.  This will bring us back to the same old system of generating that spiral that will put the roller-coaster economic policies to shame next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can appreciate readily the ideological argument taking place between the various elements of the Coalition in endeavouring to put the tax reform package into something presentable, to give it a Christmas dressing, so to speak, in order that it might be sold to the pundits.  It is important to emphasise the proposed cuts in income tax.  The Government are on record as saying that these cuts will be paid for by way of higher prices.  As one of them said &mdash; I think it was the Minister for Finance &mdash; anything that is given to taxpayers will be paid for by taxpayers. <Col N="585" /> That is some truism.  There must be an enormous chasm between the various elements of the Government &mdash; the ultra-conservative Fine Gael Party, the pseudo-socialists of Labour and the others &mdash; struggling to find a label at this time.  The budgetary strategy is very difficult to achieve in this kind of situation, with such ideological argument going on at that high level.  Naturally, everybody welcomes a tax cut but the problem is the financing of any such cut and in this context we must ask if at this time of recession we can afford tax cuts.  That is the burning question and the one that is causing the greatest problem for the Government.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the policies of this Government as enunciated by them in the election campaign are irreconcilable.  Fine Gael said they wanted tax reform but that in order to achieve this there would be a 3½ per cent increase in indirect taxation.  The Labour manifesto, though that has been totally shelved since, proposed cutting prices by 4 per cent.  That was one of the goodies trotted out.  We will cut prices by 4 per cent.  By Jove, that promise has not been honoured, has it?  The prices for the housewife will be cut.  They have not been cut. Regarding the 3.5 per cent increase in indirect taxation which the Fine Gael manifesto said was necessary to accommodate their tax reform, why does Brendan Halligan say, &ldquo;No, no, it is going to cost a lot more than that&rdquo;?  He says that inflation will go up at least 8 per cent next year.  If it goes up 8 per cent next year we are going to pass the 30 per cent mark.  I suppose that the Government will not be there long enough to see it and that will be a good job for everybody.  These figures are being trotted out now by some of those who say they would be in support of the Coalition Government at this time. Of course, there are those who are not in favour of a Coalition because they see in it the death knell of Labour in that not only have they not delivered on the basic promise they gave to the electorate during the campaign, but they are now being out-manoeuvred daily, and we have the political gaffe of the Leader, Deputy O'Leary, to prove that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="586" /> Will the taxpayers be better off if these tax bands are changed?  I do not know who is going to be better off, but certainly the needy will not.  The gains that will be achieved by whatever group of people achieve them will be eliminated subsequently by income levies.  This country has had bad experiences in the past about levies but the Coalition have not learned the lesson.  Therefore, they are going to have the levies again but this time they will be income levies and these income levies will pay for the tax cuts.  Also we are going to have increased health charges and a reduction in the mortgage interest tax relief, but the levies are the most important.</P>
    <P>It is in the Fine Gael pre-election manifesto that we get an insight into the extent these levies might go, and they will achieve nothing for the vast majority of the people and certainly nothing for the needy in so far as promoting tax reform or tax restructuring is concerned.  That manifesto stated unambiguously that 2.5 per cent would be levied on all incomes &mdash; it is important that we appreciate that it is on gross income &mdash; and 4.75 per cent on incomes over £8,500.  I do not know what one would call that kind of levy, but to my humble way of thinking it is income tax in another form pure and simple.  The only difficulty is that at least in income tax you get your allowance but these levies are to be put on gross income.  All your income for the year is to be subjected to these new tax levies.</P>
    <P>There is to be a 1.5 per cent health charge on all income also, and 1 per cent on all income to support the Youth Employment Scheme.  Of them all I prefer to support the latter, the 1 per cent for the Youth Employment Scheme if it generates money and if that is the only way it can be got for that cause.  People are prepared to give support to generating jobs and providing job opportunities for the youth of this country.  If the money has to be found, let us find it.  A PRSI levy of 3 per cent is proposed on incomes over £8,500.  The present charge applies to income up to £8,000.</P>
    <P>What is the grand total of these levies, the other word for income tax for 1981-style <Col N="587" /> Coalition?  It is 2.5 per cent on income under £8,500 and 7.25 per cent total additional levy on income over £8,500.  That is what is in store and not on my say-so.  That figure was not dreamed up by Deputy Padraig Flynn. These are figures drawn up in the pre-election manifesto of the Fine Gael Party.  The Labour Party were not in favour of that, but they have no choice now, as is obvious from the U-turn their Leader has been taking concerning some of the tax proposals.  Therefore, this programme will be implemented.  The only people who can stop it are the other party still looking for a name, but they will not do it because they have been given a promise of a programme of legislative goodies some of which are going to go wrong right from day one, starting today.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that these levies are on all income in addition to direct taxation and in addition also to the indirect taxation increases perpetrated by the Coalition since they came to office. There are VAT increases across the board.  I thought it most telling to hear a young lady on television last night or the night before talking about 25 per cent VAT paid on some equipment for the handicapped.  Somebody asked her if it was essential for the needy.  &ldquo;Well, it is in the luxury bracket if it is 25 per cent&rdquo;, she said.  We are not talking about the luxury bracket now, we are talking about the VAT increases in the everyday bracket, the 10 per cent moved to 15 per cent.  There are enormous increases in excise duties and these increases apply to everybody including the needy, the less well off, those whom Fine Gael and the Labour Party especially should be beating their breasts about in here, whatever about the other party.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that the IMF came over here to have a routine look at the economy some time ago.  Of course, it was projected to the general public that the IMF had to be called in. A serious situation had to be tackled and the experts from abroad had to come along to prognosticate what might or might not happen and to deal with the tremendous crisis which the Taoiseach <Col N="588" /> last week said had now been eliminated. The slippery slope is no longer there, but the IMF were here to consider the economic situation.  Of course, they were here for a routine look.  They come regularly and have been coming for years.  It is easy enough to get a banker, especially in the national banks, to say anything you want, especially if you are borrowing.  Your own bank manager will tell you that you are spending too much, that you must cut back.  You would not expect anything else from the bankers, would you?</P>
    <P>When Fine Gael were in opposition they were always telling us that the IMF were knocking at the door, they were breathing down our necks, they were about to take us over and to close the shutters on us.  If the IMF have made a recent recommendation to this Government to stall on their tax structuring and restructuring and their new tax reforms, why will the Government not listen to them, if they have such great confidence in their ability to deal with all matters, if they were being held up as the paragons of economic virtue here for a number of years?  We should be careful about them. They have the key to the finances and future growth and development of the country.  Did the IMF warn of the inflationary aspects of the new proposals or were they merely flying the kite for the Government because they had been told that there was a serious situation and like any good bank manager said, &ldquo;We suggest that you cut back on expenditure and watch the deficit&rdquo;?  The two are not compatible; otherwise the Government would be taking their advice.  They are not taking it, they are flying in the face of it.  Of course, the Labour Party take that advice because they are not on public record before the election as saying that they would do this thing.  The Fine Gael commitment to the electorate is firm, conclusive and final.  Therefore, irrespective of what anybody says, ex-Ministers for Finance, the IMF, the ESRI or anybody else, we are locked into that commitment now and down that road we will go irrespective of the results.  The Coalition know well that they will do it and Fianna Fáil will pay for it.</P>
    <P>Everybody, including the IMF, knows <Col N="589" /> that these income transfers and tax changes were nothing more than election stunts.  This was the package at the time and it had a limited success.  The stark reality is that it is economic nonsense.  It is encouraging more pressure for increased pay and it is making it impossible for this Government today to achieve industrial peace or indeed to achieve any kind of settlement with the unions.  Whatever about tax changes, when you consider the price tag of £9.60 on the housewife Irish style, you begin to get some inkling of the depths of economic nonsense to which this Government are sinking.</P>
    <P>Lest anybody should accuse me of not being in favour of housewives getting £9.60 per week let me say that on the contrary, I would love to see all housewives getting £19 or £90 &mdash; pick a figure &mdash; they are entitled to it and I would not put a price tag on their worth.  The sum of £9.60 is an insult to them.  But the Government are committed to giving it. People are saying it is not wise, that there are too many anomalies, that it is dangerous politically and economically.  The Labour Party might say it should not be done at this time, some of the backbenchers who know the score might settle but the Government are locked into this situation because their credibility is at stake if they do not implement it.  When a Government lose credibility they lose everything.  It is like taking away a man's reputation, you leave him stripped.  If you take credibility away from a Government they are as naked as a new-born babe.</P>
    <P>We are all waiting to see how it will be done.  Who is going to get £9.60?  Will the weaker sections of the community, those most in need, get it?  As I understand it, they will not but I am speaking from little knowledge because nobody on the Government side has categorically stated how the scheme will work and who will benefit from it.  We know why &mdash; because they are at loggerheads, not only with themselves, but with those who are going to administer the scheme.  If what we are told is true, the wife whose husband is in receipt of social welfare will not get it because he is not paying tax, he is on the dole, drawing disability or unemployment <Col N="590" /> benefit.  Because he pays no tax his wife is not entitled to this sum.  The wife of the old age pensioner cannot get it because, in the vast majority of cases, he is not paying tax either.  Certainly the wives of non-contributory pensioners, who are most in need, will not benefit from the scheme.  I presume widows will not get it as very few of them are paying tax.  Wives of small farmers will not get it because they cannot afford to pay tax. They are on subsistence level.  Wives of small income earners will not get it either because their husbands are not paying enough tax to warrant the credit being transferred.</P>
    <P>I presume the wives of small businessmen will not get it either because their husbands pay tax back over three or four years and the Government would not be able to administer that in advance of the scheme.  Who is going to benefit?  Only well-off people will benefit, wives of well-off people who, by and large, can afford to stay at home.  I put this very succinctly to people during the election campaign and, because I felt I understood its implications, we were able to tell some people in the west that this was the case and that the poorer sections would not benefit under this scheme.  What happened in the cities?  Housewives were conned into believing they would get it.  It was also stated that it would cost the Exchequer nothing to implement the scheme.  Of course it would cost nothing if you are taking £9.60, £19 or £29 out of a husband's pay packet and giving it to his wife.  That will cost nothing in tax although there will be administrative costs which will be met by further indirect taxation.  Why not?  It is all being met by indirect taxation.  The Government are on record as saying that is how these schemes will be funded.  Is it a simple transfer of part of the husband's income, without his permission, to his spouse? Will somebody state unequivocally if this is so?</P>

      <P>I was speaking about the £9.60 and whether it was a cash transfer or a tax credit transfer to the unfortunate, much talked about, housewife.  Many people have tried to get the necessary information for their constituents about this matter but they have failed.  Direct questions must be asked now and perhaps then we will all be in a position to say who is going go get what, whenever it happens.  Who will administer this £9.60 transfer or credit?  Will it be the Department of Social Welfare through the benefits system, or the Revenue Commissioners through the taxation system?  I would like to know also if it is to be a simple transfer of part of the husband's income, without his permission, to his spouse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who will benefit from this new scheme?  Fine Gael, during their election campaign, said unequivocally that this money would be paid immediately the election was over &mdash; within a month as one now Cabinet Minister said.  That promise has not been lived up to.  I can understand that there might be administrative difficulties in putting this scheme into operation; but Fine Gael, when challenged in certain areas, said that this money would be paid to all married women at home.  Is that accurate?  If it is accurate, all the unfortunate people whom I have listed, the less well-off and wives of unemployed, will get this money.  However, they will not get it if it is to be a tax credit transfer, because their husbands are not paying tax.  Government Ministers &mdash; Opposition spokesmen <Col N="593" /> that were &mdash; were very quick to say that all would get this supplement as soon as the Coalition Government got back into power.  Neither of those things happened.  The truth is that our housewives were conned and they know it.  That was one of the fundamental reasons for the Government not being prepared to take up the challenge in Cavan-Monaghan. That was the main reason, not the legislative programme, because that programme is decided by the Opposition as well as the Government &mdash; not just by the Independents.  Without the co-operation of the Opposition one would get no legislation through without using the guillotine, which is the last refuge of a dying Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell in her maiden speech referred to this £9.60.  She stated that she was depressed about it all, and I must feel a little sympathy for her.  However, there are at present a lot of people depressed about it.  We may find a backbencher or a Government Minister prepared to put his neck on the line and pre-empt present discussions.  This scheme was not thought out.  Had it been, we would have had the details spelt out in clear terminology long ago.  Somebody might risk lifting Deputy Fennell's depression and the frustration of so many who thought that they would have been paid this money by Christmas 1981.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell states that Fianna Fáil used large advertisements in the newspapers during the recent campaign, but I must say that Fianna Fáil lost that race. When it comes to bombarding the public with full page advertisements, I give the victory to Fine Gael.  That £9.60 was the fundamental reason for those big campaign advertisements.  Every time they appeared, those advertisements never stated who would be paid.  They stated that there would be a tax credit transfer which would cost the Exchequer nothing. Would someone enlighten the people and the depressed Deputies in the Fine Gael ranks as to how it will cost nothing when the Revenue Commissioners say that it is impossible to administer it with existing resources?</P>
    <P>We will move away from that laughable situation to something which is very <Col N="594" /> important at present, the prospects of a national wage agreement.  These prospects now seem so remote as to be negligible.  The Government must bear some responsibility for plunging this country into a free-for-all situation, which can only result in industrial chaos next year. Apart from these so-called tax reform packages and credit transfers there are unknown increases yet to be perpetrated on the unfortunate public &mdash; the cause of the unions being so cautious at present. What self-respecting union would stand idly by and see its members not compensated for these devastating increases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Indeed, the unions at present see no possibility whatever of a curb on inflation and some trade union leaders, some ex-Members of this House, forecast an inflation rate of perhaps 30 per cent next year.  How can any union, in that rarified atmosphere, act on behalf of its members in a sit-down wage agreement situation?  The Government are to blame for that breakdown.</P>
      <P>The purchasing power of disposable income has been considerably reduced since the last session &mdash; some say by about 13 per cent.  The economists tell us that next year there could be a reduction of 16 per cent.  We could say that this country is at present being run by economists, not politicians.  Those economists, quite normally and naturally, decided to commission other economists to do some thinking on their behalf &mdash; the three wise men, Irish style.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>They dealt with the committee on cost and competiveness.  Those three wise men were not like the Magi, who were wise &mdash; they brought presents and tidings of great joy.  More importantly, those three wise men of the New Testament were waylaid by King Herod who tried to get them to deviate from their line of action but they were not easily put off.  They carried on.  They were wise in the real sense of the word.  They brought their presents, tidings of great joy and went back another way.  The three wise men, Irish-style 1981, were waylaid by the Coalition Government. They were brought in and told about the <Col N="596" /> volatility of economic matters in other parts of the world and the rate of exchange.  The wise men were sent scuttling.  They changed their package from 9 per cent to 6¼ per cent or 6½ per cent because they were told to do so.  There is no similarity between the Wise Men in the Bible and the wise men who have been making recommendations in this country.  That is a pity.</P>
      <P>If the tax strategy of the July budget is to continue, the needy will suffer most and there will be an end to a practice which existed for many years, that is progressive taxation where the needy got most help and taxation bit hardest at the top of the scale.  That has gone out the window.  The idea now is to savage the worker while at the same time hit the wealthy, but it should be the other way round.  The Coalition have no compassion for the poor.  How could they when one considers that they decided to increase the VAT on the 10 per cent band, raising it to 15 per cent?  These are the everyday purchases of the ordinary people.  The Government did not single out the 25 per cent tax band and the Minister for Finance told us why.  He said it would not bring in sufficient money quickly enough.  He is on record as saying he wanted to introduce measures which would bring in the greatest amount of money in the shortest possible time.  If that is not hitting at the needy, I do not know what is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They also decided to increase health charges and they have ideas about education, transport and so on, about all the everyday activities of the ordinary people.  They also decided to hit the motorist.  When people begin to forget what this Government have done it is well to remind them.  Motoring costs are being pushed up inexorably.  There were VAT increases on the cost of the car, on servicing cars and on car parts.  Motor tax was reintroduced.  There were increases on petrol, excise duties and insurance.  I realise mentioning this list of increases is very tedious for Deputy Kemmy and Deputies in the other parties, but they should be resisting these increases at every juncture.  Deputy Kemmy cannot, because he is locked into a programme of <Col N="597" /> legislative goodies which will not be delivered.</P>
    <P>Before the budget the Government got 31.2 per cent of the value of the new car; they now get 37.5 per cent.  Car parts came under the hammer and the duty is now 37½ per cent plus 15 per cent VAT. The strategy of the Coalition had to encompass so many ideologies that we are only now beginning to see how truly incompatible are the partners in this inglorious Government.  They are ideological opposites.  I will give a few examples to prove what I say is accurate.  Earlier we had the peculiar &rdquo;divi-up&ldquo; of the Department of Industry and Commerce between the Tánaiste and the Minister for Industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair asks the Deputy not to go too deeply into political ideologies.  Could he stay with the taxation provisions of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Ideologies are the basis of fundamental Government policy.  The Coalition have to deal with ideologies which are diametrically opposed and they try to accommodate each other in this kind of package&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>They are important because the taxation issues are the culmination of the deal done between the different ideologies expressed by the various components of the Coalition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently Deputy Kemmy attacked the Government social policy in a speech he should have made in Claremorris.  This speech was printed and circulated but he did not make it and I will tell somebody some time the reason why.  He is on record as having made this speech and it is stated as his policy.  He challenged the right of the homeless to State-aided housing; he challenged the right of the sick to subsidised treatment; he challenged the right of people to free education and he challenged the right of Government created jobs for the unemployed.  This is in <Col N="598" /> writing and I have the document here if anybody wishes to challenge what I am saying.  If that is an indication of Government policy and Government thinking, it is a no hope situation for the weaker sections of our community.</P>
    <P>How can Labour live with that kind of ideology, with that kind of expression of Fine Gael thought?  If that is not an example of the most ultra-right wing monetarism and conservatism ever heard, what is?  Surely there is nothing more fundamental to a Labour man than providing houses, whether by grant or by sudsidy, to those unable to provide their own houses?</P>
    <P>The Government talked about dismantling the health services.  I want somebody to tell me if it is true the Minister for Health, through the Minister for Finance, said next year's Health Estimate had to be cut by a minimum of £200 million.  When asked how this could be done he said.  &ldquo;Can we not kill off thousands of medical cards?&rdquo; This is the kind of dismantling which will be perpetrated by Fine Gael but how can Labour, not to mention the members of the other parties still looking for a name, live with that? There was talk about dismantling the educational services.  Take the recent circular from the Minister for Education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was talking about the dismantling of services, which involves the whole question of the need for money and payments by the Government.  There will be widespread unemployment of teachers.  This is something which has been unheard of in the past when plans were devised to entice more people into the profession.  The social patterns which have existed for many years will be seriously disturbed and those who will suffer most are the children of the needy.  I can understand how Fine Gael can live with this, but how can the Labour Party or the Members of the other Coalition party live with it?</P>
      <P>The July budget has had a devastating effect on the farming community, who have been virtually crippled by price increases.  The agricultural industry is in need of very considerable support and incomes have been falling at an alarming rate.  There is no point in the Minister for Agriculture telling farmers that the Government recognise their dilemma.  That is throwing in the towel and abdicating responsibility for dealing with this crisis. The only efforts to aid farmers were made by Fianna Fáil and that is recognised by farm leaders.  If farmers were asked what one present they would like for Christmas they would say they wanted this Government out and Fianna Fáil back in office. Sympathy is a fine thing but it will not bring about an improvement, especially while inflation is kept at the level which the Government are determined to maintain.  The Labour guru has indicated that this level will be at least 30 per cent next year and this makes a nonsense of price increases for farm produce negotiated abroad.  Direct Government intervention is needed.</P>

      <P>Some of the money being raised by this budget might be expended by paying some of the grants approved by the IDA.  For the past three months no grants have been paid and small industries which had been approved for cash grants have been left without them.  The credibility of the Government is gone and they are now trying to undermine the credibility of the IDA.  I do not know of any reason why they do not honour their commitments to meet job approvals by the IDA, unless it is that they are trying to nurse it all for one packet and hand it all out together when they are going to the country in the hope of getting reelected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to a statement on 3 July about recruitment in the public service.  It had been said in the budget speech on 21 July that there would be an embargo on recruitment in the public service, to apply throughout the State, semi-State and local authority services, including health boards.  Every activity in Irish public life was to come under that embargo as from a certain date.  I cannot think of any more retrograde step ever taken than that.  It has had a detrimental effect not just in the matter of job opportunities, job creation, but on the hopes and aspirations of young people.  On top of that it has put in jeopardy the future development programmes of State and semi-State bodies and local authorities.  These bodies have had to shelve development programmes until some future occasion when they can be re-activated under Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if anybody on that side of the House realises the terrible effects that embargo has had, particularly on school leavers.  It has thrown employment figures way out of line, it has left a desperate situation for young people not only in secondary and university institutions but also for those who attend technological institutes.  Parents are asking why they should pay vast sums of money to have their children educated when there will <Col N="603" /> be no job opportunities because of the Government's stranglehold on recruitment, on the opportunities usually there to absorb school leavers.</P>
    <P>It has had an enormous effect as well on the number of services that can be provided by local authorities.  Members of local authorities and health boards appreciate this and that is why they have been holding their budget meetings behind closed doors, in committee.  They are broke.  They have been begging for funds to maintain their ordinary services until the end of the year but the Government will not give them that money.  If, as the Taoiseach has said, everything is in check and that these bodies have nothing to worry about, why has this money to be re-assigned to restructure daft tax reforms and daft payments to certain individuals.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the seduction of the housewives of Ireland with this £9.60 payment, which will put a price tag on their shoulders which has no relevance to sane economic thought.  This attitude to public service recruitment is a well-known short-term technique used successfully before by Coalition Governments.  They want to stall approvals. They leave certain sectors of the public service short staffed so that there will be a stalling of departmental activity and the money to meet new job approvals will not have to be put up.  The same applies to local authorities and health boards, and the result is a process of grinding down economic activity and development programmes.</P>
    <P>This Government have destroyed the people's national spirit.  The economic proposals outlined last July and the future ones they are thinking about are being objected to by their backbenchers and gurus who have recommended that they do not proceed with them.  The rollercoaster of the Coalition is out of control and it is leading to economic chaos. The electorate, the passengers on that rollercoaster, have to stand by while the driver stands at one end and the engineer at the other, squabbling about who will pull which lever on that merry-go-round. The people of Ireland have had enough <Col N="604" /> of it, as any public representative will learn if he seeks the opinions of the electorate.  He will be told that coalitions have not worked in the past and the Coalition are not working on this occasion.  They are looking forward to the day when the Coalition will be routed out of Irish political life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The only accuracy I can find in Deputy Flynn's long speech is that the taxpayer must pay for everything, including the cost of borrowing. The attitude of this Government is that not only should nonsensical borrowing be stopped but that the sections of the taxpaying community who can best afford to do so should be required to pay.  Working according to the truism that taxpayers should have to pay for the facilities provided for them, this Government are concerned that there should be a more even distribution of the tax burden.  In dealing with the Finance Bill it is necessary to look at the situation that arose which required the implementation of the provisions of this Bill.  I will give some of the figures which gave rise to the present predicament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of the 1977 General Election the National Coalition, led by Deputy Cosgrave, had to face the first real recession of modern times.  They did not have experience, and the advantage of it, of having had to deal with the sort of recession which beset us.  They did not have an educated public sympathy behind them.  Nevertheless, that Government set about putting the country's economy on a proper footing.  They were berated by an even less sympathetic Opposition than they are faced with now, an Opposition who lacked knowledge of the problems and were unable to comprehend the techniques required for good management of the economy in such circumstances.  That Opposition formed the next Government and, as a result of the most outrageous promises, false promises, ever made to an electorate in a Western style democracy, they succeded in obtaining possibly the largest Parliamentary majority in a Western style democracy.  That Opposition had no confidence in themselves and believed, quite justifiably, <Col N="605" /> that the electorate would never consider putting them in Government in the first place.  They never thought they would have to implement the outrageous promises they made.  It is from that starting point that this Bill has been brought forward to try to deal with those problems.</P>
    <P>That background and that batch of promises contributed to the present very worrying state of the nation's finances.  The National Coalition brought the country through the first modern recession and at the time of dissolution in 1977 unemployment was 106,000 and inflation 6¼ per cent.  At that time the budget deficit was £201 million.  Lest any Member states, like the last speaker, that I am taking these figures from my head or, perhaps, from a telephone directory, I should like to quote from the <i>Economic Review and Outlook, July 1978,</i> under the heading of &ldquo;Prices&rdquo;.  That review states:</P>
    <P>There was a significant decline in the rate of price inflation in 1977 with the Consumer Price index rising on average of 13½ per cent compared with 18 per cent in 1976 and 21 per cent in 1975.  The rate of increase was particularly low in the second half of the year.  In the six months to November the index rose by only 2¾ per cent, about one-third of the increase in the preceding half-year.  The improvement in the rate of inflation continued in the first half of 1978.  In the twelve months to May inflation had fallen to 6¼ per cent, the lowest increase for over eight years.</P>
    <P>That was a remarkable performance by a courageous and talented Government but that was not followed on and this is the problem we find ourselves with now. If the incoming Government of whatever political shade, had followed on and built on the very good economic performance at that time we would not be in the position we are in now.  The current equivalent figures, at least current at the time of the change of Government which is relevant to the introduction of this Bill, whatever about the Opposition blaming the Government about what has happened <Col N="606" /> in the meantime, something I dispute and something any person wishing to offer logical debate would dispute, cannot be blamed on the Government because those figures existed when they took office in June.</P>
    <P>At the time the Coalition took office in June there were 124,700 people unemployed, despite the fact that jobs had been created where none existed and that people had been pulled into the public sector lending itself to further retardation in bureaucracy which is in need already of energetic reform.  The figure for unemployment increased by 40 per cent alone during the period of office of Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach.  That is an undeniable fact.  Inflation when we took office was 21 per cent and the deficit for the year would have been £945 million if corrective action had not been taken there and then.  The figures speak for themselves.  The January budget set the overall Exchequer borrowing requirement at £1,296 million or 13 per cent of GNP.  Of this figure £515 million was needed to finance the current deficit.  If corrective action had not been taken that figure would have been £945 million, or almost double.  Such is the level of tomfoolery and naked subterfuge engaged in by the last Government with resulting disastrous consequences on the economy that excesses on capital expenditure would, if unchecked, have brought the overall Exchequer borrowings to almost £2,000 million or 20 per cent of GNP, not 13 per cent which had been forecast less than six months previously.</P>
    <P>I do not believe I require to say more on this matter.  The figures I have given can be checked and I challenge any Member to deny them.  I challenge those who feel it necessary to look at this debate constructively to look at facts.  I should like to quote, briefly, from the statement of the then Minister for Finance on 27 February 1980.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy O'Kennedy, in introducing the budget said, under the heading of &ldquo;General Approach to Budgetary Aggregates in 1980&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Borrowing, the balance of payments and the external reserves are all interlinked. <Col N="607" />  Government borrowing allows a higher level of expenditure in the economy, which generates a demand for further imports and adds to the external deficit.  A reduction in borrowing is required in the short-term in order to help reduce the balance of payments deficit to a sustainable size.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil would have us believe that that was never their policy, that they never felt that borrowing had to be brought into check.  If that is the case I should like to ask those interested why any reasonable party, with a 20 seat majority, who were not concerned about borrowing would run away from the scene with 18 months left to run in office. I doubt if that would have happened in any other Western democracy.</P>
    <P>It is amusing but nonetheless disturbing to hear Deputies opposite lecture the Independent Members, and the Government, on matters relating to Government finances when the state of those finances is the direct result of irresponsible indecision on the part of those Deputies and in particular, because of reckless behaviour in hiding those figures until after the general election, an election which need not have been held for a further 18 months.  The previous Government, with a direct majority of 20 Deputies, had a golden opportunity to take whatever steps were necessary to put matters right but instead we got incompetence, arrogance and Ministers appointed on the basis of the way they voted rather than on ability.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of &ldquo;Indirect Taxation&rdquo; in the same speech I referred to, Deputy O'Kennedy went on to say, as reported at column 737 of the Official Report of 27 February 1980:</P>
    <P>There is of course no escaping the fact that the income tax improvements and social welfare improvements being announced today must be met from taxation and the only realistic source for the vast bulk of this is indirect taxation.  There is no scope through other forms of income taxation or of direct taxation otherwise for raising the amounts involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="608" /> Deputies opposite have forgotten that. They have forgotten that it was put on the record of the House.  They must not forget also that in that same speech the Minister for Finance, under the heading of &ldquo;Food Subsidies&rdquo;, said:</P>
    <P>It continues to be the Government's belief that food subsidies applying as they do irrespective of individual need do not sufficiently discriminate in favour of the less well-off sections of the community.</P>
    <P>That was the Minister's excuse for going on to say:</P>
    <P>We gave very full consideration, therefore, to the question of further reducing them in line with our declared intentions.</P>
    <P>The intention was to reduce food subsidies which were reintroduced on the eve of an election which that Government had to win, not because they had to stay in government but because the leader of the party had to stay at the top. If they had lost that by-election they were in serious trouble and they knew it.  The last Government, because of the opportunities they had, because of the strength dealing seriously with the problems which any economy faces from time to time will go down as one of the most dreadful Governments of all time.  I do not say that Fianna Fáil Governments have all been dreadful just because they are opposite to me.  There have been some very good Fianna Fáil Governments, one of them being a minority Government like this one.  When people look back in history and ask who took the necessary steps to look after the best interests of the finances of the country the last Government will not be among those who will be getting the laurels.</P>
    <P>The Deputies opposite have the temerity to throw out figures which are totally irrelevant and introduce arguments which are absolutely without substance in that they cannot be backed up with facts and figures.  As Minister for Finance, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald who was here a short while ago, said in the budget statement of 1981 that it would be <Col N="609" /> contrary to Government policy to increase the rates of direct tax at that time.  In 1981 Fianna Fáil felt it was necessary not to increase direct taxation &mdash; the taxpayer was already overburdened because of the small base &mdash; but instead go for indirect taxation, a policy for which they are now berating the present Government.  There are a number of other things which Deputy Fitzgerald said about the balance of payments and energy conservation and, because of those needs, the need for increases in the price of petrol, tobacco, beer and spirits, which they are now saying are disastrous increases brought about by the policy of the present Government.  If one looks at some of the facts and figures behind my argument it will be seen that the Deputies opposite are making hollow, empty speeches to an empty House.  In 1977, 32 factories closed, causing 3,332 redundancies.  In 1978, 41 factories closed, causing 2,824 redundancies.  In 1979,37 factories closed, causing 2,294 redundancies; and, in 1980,82 factories closed, causing 4,158 redundancies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be pleased to supply the Deputy with the 1981 figures. From January to June 1981 there were 40 closures, causing 3,279 redundancies.  If that rate had continued for the whole year it would have brought the figure to an all-time high of 6,500.  I hope that meets the Deputy's requirement.  Those factories closed because of action taken by the Government of the day.  Deputies rise in this House and express concern about Tuam, and rightly so.  If it was affecting employment in my constituency I would be very concerned about it.  But let us be honest.  Tuam is not the only centre in the country.  What about the other factories which have been closed causing loss of employment through the years of office of the last Government?  It is the policy of this Government to try to put the finances of the State in such order that there will be a reversal of the closures and that we will have a surplus of new factories over the number of closures in <Col N="610" /> a period, thus giving greater employment.  It is for that reason that the Government are introducing the Youth Employment Scheme, which will put a levy on the wealthy in order to contribute to the work prospects of our youth population, the fastest growing in western Europe, coming out of school and institutions with no job prospects.  As a former youth leader, I support that.  These are the policies that have been needed for some time and I make no apology for supporting and voting for a Government Bill which provides for youth employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things that disturbs me greatly is that the media have not, for whatever reason, conveyed the situation as it is to the public at large.  What we have been getting is propaganda.  I suppose I could be accused of putting forward Fine Gael's propaganda now.  But surely somewhere there is the possibility of conveying to the public the situation as it is and why the steps which are being taken are in their best interests.  If we continue for purely party reasons to undermine each other, the public will be the losers, because we are going to pursue economic policies which are not in their best interests.  The present policies are in their best interests.  Independent commentators who have spoken on this matter &mdash; the Governor of the Central Bank, Independent Senators who are not members of any political party, business leaders in the community who have nothing to lose by stating the situation as it is&mdash; have come out and said that these policies are necessary.  This morning's newscast on the national radio station carried the NESC report which also said that the Government were right.  They said that borrowing for day to day expenses must be reversed.  Somebody said that the difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael is that we do not want to borrow and Fianna Fáil do want to borrow, but they can justify the borrowing because it keeps us going and at the end of the day everything is rosy.  The real difference in the economic sense is that the Government are opposed to borrowing for day to day purposes, which is akin to throwing £1 notes off O'Connell Bridge and <Col N="611" /> saying goodbye to them.  The last Government knew that that could not continue because it would bleed our economic resources and lead to disaster.  I challenge anybody to say that that is not the case.  I want to make it clear that that is where we differ from Fianna Fáil.  We do not want to borrow for day to day purposes because it is not in the interests of the people that we were elected to serve.</P>
    <P>I would like to come to the contents of the Minister's budget speech.  It is with regret that the Government have been compelled to adjust certain taxes and to take steps to control budget finances. Many of these steps are not going to be popular.  Nobody is asked to accept them as being popular.  They may not even be popular with Members of this House.  But the Government were not elected to do what is popular but to do what is in the best interests not only of that portion of the electorate which sent us in but of the whole country.  If the real arguments for those steps were communicated to the public they would accept that the Government are doing what is necessary and right.  It would have been simple for the Government to have ignored the problem and introduced a couple of popular measures and then to call a quick election.  But the Government did not do it that.  The public must ask themselves why they did not do it.  They did not do it because it would not have been in the best interests of the public to do it.  That is where the commitment of this Government is shown.  We cannot afford to let the finances of the country dry up, with resulting widespread chaos and hardship, for the sake of being popular.  Unfortunately, this attitude has prevailed for too long.  The overriding aim is to do our best for the country and to try to give equal opportunities and decent living standards to all our citizens, including the farmers and the industrial workers, but excluding nobody.  There are many excellent proposals contained in the budget.  The incentives for agriculture, of which I have particular knowledge having worked with a farming organisation for some time, <Col N="612" /> with their resulting effect on the whole community, are most welcome.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is important to all of us, even to those who may not have farmers in their constituencies.  There are very few small farmers in Dublin South-Central but I recognise, particularly from my time in the agricultural sector, that agriculture is important to the community, that approaching 50 per cent of our exports depend on agriculture and about the same percentage of our work force, direct or indirect, depend on agriculture. I welcome the incentives the Minister has announced but I also say, in fairness and justice, that not only must the industrial worker, the white collar worker and every other worker tighten his belt but farmers, as the Minister for Agriculture said, must also tighten their belts.  The whole community must face up to the realities and not expect one sector of the community to carry the can.  The social welfare increases for a wide range of people in need are very welcome.  They are in excess of the increases in indirect taxation and I welcome them.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about the reforms promised in Government accounting and planning with the greater involvement of Deputies and the public in this area.  I was pleased to hear the Minister say this when he introduced this Bill to the House.  I particularly welcome the Minister's announcement to reform financial planning procedures so that proposals for public expenditure are presented to and debated by Dáil Éireann in a timely and businesslike way.  The publication of public expenditure Estimates in the autumn preceding the commencement of the financial year is a very welcome innovation.  A specific Dáil debate on the Government's capital expenditure and borrowing plans is also a very welcome innovation not only because the Government are introducing it but as a private Member of the House I feel very strongly that the powers of private Members from any side have been eroded. The more involvement there is for the private Member from whatever party in debate, committee work and any other sphere the better it will be for the people <Col N="613" /> we represent and from whom we have got a mandate.</P>
    <P>The improvement in the format of the Estimates and the improvement of procedure relating to the presentation and debating of the various annual reports of State-sponsored bodies to the Oireachtas are welcome innovations.  It is time we interested ourselves in more of these spending bodies, not only the Tuam factory but all the other factories.  If the Government are putting funds into a lossmaker for some social reason let us examine the position and be prepared to say that is the reason because sometimes that can serve the greater good.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to hear the Minister announce that Dáil reform and facilities for Deputies will be given priority.  I would like to use this opportunity to say that as a backbencher and a new Member of Dáil Éireann.  I am very disappointed, with the facilities which exist for Members.  I sympathise with Members who have been here for many years.  I know that the facilities have been greatly improved.  I know that when Deputy Haughey was Taoiseach he took certain initiatives and the present Taoiseach is continuing those initiatives.  I feel disappointed at the role of the legislator and I feel that has to be developed.  I am not talking about facilities that increase the size of the Deputy's wallet or financial increases.  I am talking about facilities to do the job we were sent here to do, to keep in touch with the people, to look at the legislative proposals which come before us, do some research, and bring the various Government Departments and the various State bodies to account in a reasoned and positive way.  I believe those facilities are not there.</P>
    <P>It was through the initiative of certain Deputies over the years and through the use of their own private resources that they have been able to participate in that role.  Now that there are more full-time Deputies who are intent on staying in touch and working on behalf of the people who sent them here I feel the facilities in this House are appalling. There are former Government Ministers in offices which no junior civil servants would accept.  There are Deputies sharing <Col N="614" /> offices which no junior civil servants would accept.  I welcome the changes that are being made and the changes that are being pursued.  The Minister for Finance will certainly have my support for the Dáil reform measures he has promised will come before us.  I believe all sides of the House agree that those are overdue.</P>
    <P>The Government programme to include a £5 million levy on banks next December is appropriate and is long overdue.  The sectors of the community which can afford to make a greater contribution to the national need must be obliged to do so.  I hope this is the thin edge of the wedge and that those institutions which for many years have been getting away without paying their fair contribution will now be obliged to do so.  We must remember that in many cases those institutions who draw their employees from the four corners of the country bring into Dublin a very substantial number of people.  They add to the commercial life of the city but they also present problems which are particular to the banking sphere.  One of those is accommodation.  It is left to local authorities to house those people while they are in Dublin.  I believe banks should be obliged to take their responsibilities seriously in relation to those people.  If they are not prepared to do so the funds which will be extracted from them should be used for the benefit of the large number of young people who are brought to Dublin and are left in offices to fend for themselves.</P>
    <P>The action of the previous Government in abolishing food subsidies and then restoring them shortly before the election is deplorable, and everybody has seen through it.  After making all sorts of arguments against food subsidies they proceeded to reintroduce them on the eve of the election.  The Government have committed £11 million to assist those members of the community who are most in need.  On top of that they have introduced the combat poverty contigency provision of £100,000 which I hope will be increased as finances allow and before too long.  The allocation of £50,000 extra for modification work necessary to afford facilities for the disabled <Col N="615" /> in public buildings is timely as this is the year of the disabled, as well as the commitment to implement the 3 per cent employment quota for disabled people in the public sector.  I hope the Government will oblige local authorities to adhere to the same criterion.  I know many local authorities have already decided to do this.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not feel that the purchasing of Irish goods is a matter of trade?  How does he explain that the promotion of Irish goods on the home market is attached to the Department of Industry and Energy and the promotion of Irish goods abroad through CTT is attached to the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism?</P>

      <P>The Deputy has put his finger on it.  The objective of the Irish Goods Council is to promote sales of Irish products on the home market and, as such, they are a supporter of Irish <Col N="617" /> industry with activities including encouraging import substitution and encouraging Irish buyers to buy home produced goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

Mr. FitzGerald has, of course, retired from the firm in which he was senior partner and surrendered his proprietorial interest therein as well as resigning from his business directorships.</P>

It is relevant to remark that a number of the more important developments in our provisions to attract new industry here originated from advice given by him in the past in different categories such as the establishment of the Industrial Development Authority and the tax reliefs on industry.  These past examples indicate the quality of the advice Mr. FitzGerald is in a position to offer.

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment having regard to difficulties, delays and avoidance of legal responsibility which arise because of the absence of any visible record on a motor vehicle of the insurance policy covering it, if he will introduce legislation to require, as in many other countries, that there should be exhibited on the windscreen of every motor vehicle a small certificate indicating relevant details of the insurers, the period of insurance and policy number.</P>

      <P>The display of particulars would not be evidence that the person driving the vehicle is covered by insurance and a car bearing such a disc could have an uninsured person driving it.  However, I am aware that such a scheme operates in Italy and I am arranging, with my colleague in the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism to have this scheme examined to see if it would help reduce the burden of car insurance.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that this idea was sown in his Department many years ago?  Is he not aware also of the considerable concern among the motoring public in general regarding the long delay in the implementation of this quite simple measure which would at least provide some source of information as to whether a vehicle was generally insured for driving at all?  Would the Minister seriously consider introducing the relevant legislation to ensure that the period of taxation and of insurance would be simultaneous?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <P>I am not aware that this idea was floated in my Department some time ago but the Deputy may be right about that.  I have had contacts with the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism on this issue and he is very keen that some sort of system be introduced in this area.  I am having an urgent examination of the position.  However, there are problems involved in any such system.  In this country the person is insured so that the display of a disc on a car windscreen would not be any guarantee that the person who was driving was insured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will now hold a public inquiry into the large number of road traffic accidents, many of which had fatal consequences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that the holding of an inquiry on the lines indicated by the Deputy would be necessary or appropriate.  The incidence of road accidents is continuously monitored and reviewed by the Garda who investigate accidents on the spot and by the road authorities, who are concerned with road accidents.  Details of the number of road deaths and injuries together with an analysis of the contributory factors <Col N="628" /> involved are published on an annual basis by An Foras Forbartha.  Specific research is also undertaken from time to time by An Foras and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety into particular factors which can contribute to death and injury on the roads.</P>
      <P>All of these activities provide the basis for the formulation and implementation of traffic accident counter measures in respect of such matters as road planning and construction, the management of traffic, legislation and regulations and the promotion of road safety generally.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the importance of good road conditions is reflected in the objectives of the Road Development Plan, which include the elimination of accident black spots and the provision of adequate signs and markings.  Regulations have been made providing for the introduction of a scheme of compulsory testing of heavy goods vehicles, buses, ambulances and taxis.  In the interest of better driving standards a new driver licensing category, Class H, with appropriate test, has been introduced for articulated vehicles.  I am also at present considering the views of interested parties on a proposed scheme of voluntary registration of persons giving driving instruction. I shall, further, be introducing in the near future a Bill in relation to the problem of drink and driving intended to strengthen the measures provided for dealing with this major menace on our roads.  The work of the National Road Safety Association and the research activities of An Foras Forbartha will continue to receive support from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the final analysis, however, road safety is a matter for the individual. Research has shown that the human factor contributes in nine out of every ten accidents.  Legislation, engineering and enforcement measures must be accompanied by a positive response from road users themselves.  Otherwise factors such as excessive speed, drinking and driving, the failure of drivers and passengers to wear safety belts, careless crossing of roads by pedestrians and their failure to make themselves more visible on the roads at night, which account for the major proportion of deaths and injuries <Col N="629" /> on our roads, will continue to be reflected in our accident rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for that comprehensive reply and while I have no desire to under-rate the part being played in the area of road safety by the various agencies referred to by the Minister &mdash; they have been doing an excellent job &mdash; why, when so many people are being killed and injured on our roads, can the Minister not see his way to holding an inquiry, even of a limited nature, as to why we continue to behave like this on our roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced that an inquiry would add anything to the volume of information available on road deaths, but I share totally the Deputy's concern in this regard.  The carnage on our roads during the past ten years, which has resulted in more than 5,000 people dead, reflects on our individual regard for other road users.  The number of people who drive with an excessive intake of alcohol is an absolute disgrace.  Of the total number of convictions for drunken driving in 1980 more than 40 per cent of those convicted were shown to have had levels of alcohol that were twice the permitted levels.  We do not need an inquiry to provide us with such statistics. Another factor is the number of defective vehicles on our roads.  The quality of our roads, too, is not good enough, though I am not blaming anybody in particular for this situation.  For generations we have neglected to make the capital investment in our roads that might help to eliminate dangerous driving though the standards of the roads are no excuse for such behaviour.  In the last analysis if the individual in charge of a mechanically propelled and at times lethal weapon is not prepared to concern himself about the lives and safety of other road users, these figures will continue to come before us.</P>

Would the Minister agree that most of the carnage is taking place on new roads, the main arterial roads, on which every other day we see wrecked cars and people either dead or badly injured?

      <P>I am delighted to hear the Minister speak in such strong terms on this matter.  In view of his sincerity and of his conviction that something should be done about the problem would he not consider forming a traffic corps having regard to the extent to which the Garda are overstretched in regard to law enforcement in the area of serious criminal offences and so on and also <Col N="631" /> because of extra security duties in Border areas?</P>
      <P>I am talking in terms of traffic corps such as those in Sweden or Denmark where such groups of people have limited powers to deal with traffic offences such as speeding, parking, dangerous driving and so forth.  Will the Minister consider seriously the formation of such a group?  Again I would like to congratulate him on the manner in which he has dealt with this very serious question.</P>

      <P>Certainly I will look at this and I will be willing to consider anything that will bring down the number of injuries and deaths on our roads.  However, I want to be convinced that it is not merely something cosmetic and that it will really be effective.  I will talk to the Garda, the Road Safety Bureau and any other body who might have a view on this to find out if there is any point in pursuing that idea.  A number of things could be done.</P>

      <P>Yes, I will be glad to do so.  I will contact the Deputy directly or maybe report to the House on my own Estimate or something like that.  I repeat that in the end we all have a responsibility in this, not only the Minister and the Government.  All of us as parents primarily must teach our children when they are going to drive that what they have in their hands is as dangerous and as lethal as a gun.  There is no point in saying that they were only doing 80 in a 60-mile zone.  If they kill somebody, that will live with them for the rest of their lives, leaving aside altogether the fact that perhaps a man is dead and his widow and children left without a breadwinner.  The responsibility of driving a car is something that we all have a constant duty as parents, teachers and legislators to bring to the mind of the public continuously and we must tell them that they are handling <Col N="632" /> something as lethal as a gun and which should be handled just as carefully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment whether he encourages local authorities, particularly the Corporations of Dublin and Cork, to instal plants to convert abandoned cars to scrap on a profitable basis; having regard to the large number of abandoned vehicles which clutter urban roadways, if he is satisfied that existing legislation is adequate to deal with the problem; and, if not, when he will introduce legislation to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the local authorities concerned to consider the need for, and viability of, such plant in the local circumstances.  I understand that an arrangement for the conversion of abandoned cars into scrap operates in these areas in conjunction with a commercial firm.</P>
      <P>Under the Road Traffic Acts and Regulations road authorities are empowered to remove and dispose of vehicles which have been abandoned on a public road or car park.  The working of these provisions is at present being reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Litter Bill which it is intended to take in the current session the powers of local authorities for dealing with vehicles which have been abandoned in other places will be considerably strengthened.  The abandonment of a vehicle will be made an offence subject to a substantial fine.  There will also be a <Col N="633" /> duty on local authorities to make necessary and reasonable provision for places where vehicles and scrap metal may be abandoned with a view to recycling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister be good enough to consider tightening up the definition of abandonment to avoid the present situation under which literally thousands of cars in Dublin city have not been moved for months on end, many of which are incapable of being moved except by crane? It appears from the inactivity of the authorities and what they themselves complain of that one of the difficulties is trying to arrive at a satisfactory definition of abandonment.  Would the Minister, if necessary, investigate how cities in other countries are able to avoid this farce of the public thoroughfares being obstructed for long periods by cars that cannot be moved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that.  The Litter Bill proposes that it will be an offence to abandon a vehicle &mdash; that does not answer the Deputy's question &mdash; on any land, whether it be a public road, car park, private land or land such as fair greens, public parks or unclaimed sites without the consent of the owners.  The maximum penalty for contravention will be £500.  The local authority will be empowered to remove and dispose of vehicles abandoned on any land other than a public road or a car park.  The latter vehicles will continue to be dealt with under the road traffic legislation. Probably the mind of the parliamentary draftsman has been engaged before now in defining the word &ldquo;abandon&rdquo;, but if it can be tightened up any further in relation to abandoned cars under the Litter Bill I will do that.</P>

Further, is he aware that this toxic dump at Finglas has been the subject of great contention, discussion and argument towards effecting a satisfactory resolution that would enable this dump to be transferred from this area, which has one of the highest densities of young children in the Dublin area?

I should underline again that it is not waste which is dangerous within the meaning of the relevant EEC directive which is being put into this tiphead. <Col N="635" /> What is going in there is monitored extremely carefully by both Dublin County Council and the IIRS.  It will be dumped there for only a limited time, and failing to obtain a disposal site for this waste could endanger jobs.  I do not want to make too much of this, but it is one of the reasons why Dublin County Council said that it was incumbent on them to provide such a facility in their area.  Jobs in certain industries within the Dublin region could be endangered.  I appreciate the concern of the people living in the area in this regard and, as I said in answer to a question here, I am pursuing as the most urgent priority in my Department the establishment of a facility that will allow waste from industries to be disposed of in a safe manner.

Is the Minister aware that the siting of this dump in such an area was most ill-advised, with the decision taken as it was by Dublin County Council as distinct <Col N="636" /> from Dublin Corporation?

I <Col N="638" /> think it is in the same category as the road Deputy Sheehan was asking me about.  I hope the inquiry will take place some time between now and Christmas. They will be reporting back to me.  The inquiry will depend on how much is involved.  There may be various local factors which will make one inquiry longer than another.  I cannot even guess how long it will take.</P>

      <P>The employment of workmen is a matter for the local authority, who have the responsibility to programme their various operations throughout the year.  I am aware that the local authority claim to have found it necessary to lay off workmen in order to contain expenditure within the limits of its income and states that the money available for road maintenance works is inadequate to maintain existing levels of employment in 1981.  In this connection the local authority have been advised that it is not possible to allocate additional road grants for 1981.  I may add that the total allocated to the county council in road grants this year represents an increase of 54 per cent on last year's allocations.</P>

      <P>Under the scheme of house improvement grants which I announced recently grants are available for the provision of bathrooms in all houses without them, both local authority and private.  Tenants of rented local authority houses who provide bathrooms with the consent of the local authority qualify for grants.  Alternatively the local authority may do the work with the aid of a grant from the Department.  The grants are also available to tenant purchasers of local authority built houses who are providing bathrooms.</P>

      <P>The ordinary local authority house purchase loan scheme is, however, restricted to first-time purchasers and an applicant who purchased and subsequently sold his local authority house does not, therefore, qualify for such a loan.

      <P>As I said earlier, I welcome the allocation being made for the modification work necessary to provide facilities for the disabled, particularly as this is the Year of the Disabled. I also welcome the implementation of the provision of the 3 per cent employment quota in the public service for disabled persons.  I hope this will be given force of law not just for the public service but also for local authorities, of which many Members have experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The announcement by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment <Col N="676" /> of an additional £30 million for housing is very welcome.  In the Dublin area the biggest proportion of houses is being built, but an even greater number is required.  In 1979 or 1980 &mdash; I cannot quite recall the year &mdash; the increase in allocation was in the region of 5.26 per cent.  This appalling increase did not match up to even one-third the rate of inflation.  During the term of the previous Coalition Government there was a substantial injection of funds into the house building sector in the Dublin region.  I hope the House will forgive me if my comments are confined to that area since it is the region with which I am most familiar.  This additional £30 million is the sort of injection which the house building programme requires.  The lion's share has already been allocated to the Dublin area because of the huge population explosion in that area and it will go some way to alleviate housing problems, together with the Minister's package to make loans more available to house purchasers.  These are particularly positive steps in view of the problems faced by the Government.  They are not prepared to borrow to meet day-to-day expenditure but they are prepared to do so to make funds available for necessary investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister's intentions with regard to VAT registration for small businesses are welcome.  As an accountant I am often consulted by people running small businesses who have great difficulty understanding the system.  This will be a source of information as to turnover and this is an important factor in view of the need to bring into the tax net those in the business sector.  I would hope that sole traders and businessmen would be required under this provision to have their turnover figures certified when submitting their annual accounts.  This could help to avoid tax evasion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcements regarding saving schemes, particularly those for the aged.  They are the people in our society least able to defend themselves or speak for themselves since they do not form a pressure group.  While the trade unions are appropriately active on behalf of their members, they do not seem to <Col N="677" /> take sufficient interest in the aged.  We are not doing enough to help old people, although they are very thankful for the smallest assistance.  I hope they will be encouraged to use the index-linked saving scheme.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy of transferring from direct to indirect taxation is also welcome.  I indicated this morning how groundless was the accusation from the Opposition that there was no need for increases in indirect taxation.  Deputies who made this charge said in the same breath that the taxpayer must pay for what the taxpayer gets.  It is our proposal that the sector which can afford to pay most will start to pay proportionately more than they have been paying to date in an attempt to create a greater tax spread.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the PAYE measures which the Government intend to introduce in next year's budget.  Those in the non-PAYE sector are best equipped to find loopholes in the anti-evasion laws. The incomes of those in the PAYE sector are known and they must pay the optimum amount of tax.  One way to bring justice into the sphere of taxation is to give the person in the PAYE sector some of the options which are open to those outside that sector.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that many of the self-employed have experienced great difficulties during the past two years. Many people have been using personal reserves to keep their businesses going and often they have very responsible attitudes to taxation.  Rather than paying their tax annually in arrears, many would prefer some sort of incremental scheme similar to PAYE.  While I welcome bringing the PAYE workers nearer to the sort of freedoms enjoyed by non-PAYE people, I would also welcome at least the possibility for people in the non-PAYE sector to pay tax incrementally or as they make profits.  Many people would take advantage of such an opportunity.</P>
    <P>The long-term objectives of the Government is to bring national finances under control.  This is an enormous task but if it could be accomplished it would be to the benefit of the community generally.  Those who now feel hard pressed <Col N="678" /> would reap the benefits.  Those people who feel that there are easy options, that there are easy solutions which the Government cannot see, should realise that the steps the Government are taking now are in the interests of the fastest-growing youth population in western Europe.  It is in their interests that we control our national finances.  We still have people spending money foolishly, even after the election has been lost.  I will quote from <i>Economic and Social Policy, 1981: Aims and Recommendations.</i> It was published in September 1981.  It is stated at page 5:</P>
    <P>The balance of payments deficit on current account indicates the amount the country is spending in excess of its income.  The size of the balance of payments deficit is now a fundamental constraint to policy.  The deficit is, in large part, the result of expansionary fiscal policy and the growth of nominal incomes in excess of output growth. The net external indebtedness of the State and State-sponsored bodies more than doubled between December 1978 and December 1980.  The repayment of the debt incurred will amount to an estimated £460 per employed person in 1981 and could rise to £820 by 1983 if the present Government did not take corrective action.</P>
    <P>At page 6 the report continues:</P>
    <P>The main problems now facing the Irish economy are unemployment, the high balance of payments deficit, the high current domestic deficit, the high rate of inflation and the high rate of unit labour cost increases.  These problems are similar to those faced by the Irish economy in 1980 but they are now more severe.  There is urgent need for policies to tackle these problems effectively.</P>
    <P>The document states that one of the ways to tackle the problems is to cut out borrowing for day-to-day expenditure.  That is the cornerstone of the economic and fiscal programme put before the House by the Minister for Finance in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> The NESC, the Governor of the Central Bank, independent Senators and all who have raised independent voices have told us clearly that the steps being taken are necessary.  As I said earlier, we are not asking the people to accept these moves as popular measures.  Anyone who examines the proposals objectively must ask why we have done these things.  We have done them simply because we believe they are in the country's best interests.  Anyone who has examined the situation objectively believes that.</P>
    <P>I do not have to put on record the situation the Government found themselves in when they took office.  It was that situation that gave rise to the need for this Finance Bill in the first place. Many Departments would have run out of funds if some of these measures had not been taken.  In the Department of Social Welfare and other Departments there were not funds to pay the day-to day expenses essential if those Departments were to continue.  For instance, there would not have been funds to pay old age pensions.</P>
    <P>That is the background against which the Government were obliged to take the steps now incorporated in the Finance Bill.  We introduced a balanced budget which took into consideration the best interests of the country.  I have no doubt that will be followed up by steps to encourage further correction of the national economy in the short and medium terms and also in the long term. I expressed earlier my dismay at the facilities available in the House for Deputies. However, I should like to join with the Minister for the Environment in congratulating local authority members who through voluntary steps have contributed to the growth of community efforts.  It is in the public interest that there should be proper accountability by public and local authorities.  It is essential that there should be closer examination of public accountability at national and local level. This could be responsible for cutting out unnecessary waste, resulting in the saving of resources which could be put to better use.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I would welcome an <Col N="680" /> extension to all local authorities of the system begun by Dublin Corporation through a public accounts committee. Dublin Corporation are responsible for an annual expenditure of £200 million. That sort of public spending should not be allowed without the closest scrutiny. That sort of scrutiny should be done throughout local authorities, many of whom spend vast sums of money.</P>
    <P>I am tired of listening to well-dressed, articulate, nice-sounding people lecturing the average man on how he should cut back.  Many people in this city do not have the luxury of a car or even the luxury of a job.  Our leadership should be giving example rather than lecturing.  We should be encouraging all sectors of the community, without exercising political prejudices, without looking over our shoulders wondering how many votes we will lose, to appreciate that the system of taxation we are promoting is a fair one, a system to which all sections will contribute appropriately.  Deputy Flynn this morning referred to many things, including unity in the Government.  I do not want to be drawn into that, but I note we do not have a front bench in the Opposition yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flynn should be the last to make any comment on such matters.  We on this side do not run away from taking necessary financial measures.  We certainly would not have done so if we had the sort of majority that would have facilitated us in our job of dealing with the economic problems facing us.  Deputy Flynn referred to the fact that the Taoiseach addressed members of the Stock Exchange and said he probably would not find much unemployment there.  We are lucky we do not have unemployment there on the same lines we had in the thirties after the mess the economy was left in.  The Deputy can rest assured that under the Coalition that sort of economic catastrophe will not occur because we are going to take the economy in charge and see to it that the <Col N="681" /> necessary steps are taken in the interests of all.</P>
      <P>Another misquote was attributed to the Taoiseach, that the deficit will not now significantly exceed the deficit budgeted at the beginning of the year.  The Taoiseach did not just say that.  He said that it would not now exceed the deficit budgeted at the beginning of the year because of the corrective action that had been taken.  It will exceed it by something like £200 million, but if corrective action had not been taken it would have exceeded it by something of the order of £500 million.  It is because of the corrective action that was taken by the Government that we are now more on course, but even with that action the deficit at the end of the year will be in the region of £250 million more than the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance said it would be in January this year, in spite of the steps we have taken.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to grants for community purposes.  I do not wish to get involved in any personal wrangle over these things but the fact is that such grants, which were announced I am sure with the best intentions and on the best information, were announced without a fund being made available.  That fund has now been made available.  Some Deputies have said that those community grants were being withdrawn.  They are not and they will be made available to the community from a fund that has been established, a fund that did not exist prior to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why a Member from a constituency such as that which Deputy Flynn represents is opposed to the banks paying £5 million in December next towards the running of the country. No matter what way the Government of the day moves &mdash; whether it is composed of Fine Gael and Labour or Fianna Fáil &mdash; some Deputy takes upon himself or herself the mantle of protector of the person who is obliged to contribute no matter how well off or how able that person is to contribute.  The banks are well able to provide £5 million.  It is a wonder, and a pity, they were not asked to do so before now.  I hope that next <Col N="682" /> year they will be required to contribute even more to the cost of running the country.  We must consider the very high security cost to the country of bank security.</P>
    <P>The same attitude prevailed some years ago when reform was introduced in the area of capital gains tax and wealth tax and I cannot understand why Members take positions on such matters.  Perhaps it is because they have some particular interest but, in my view, it leaves a lot to be desired.  We should be able to say here what we view as right or wrong or else stay quiet.  There is little point in saying things for the sake of getting our contribution on the record of the House or, perhaps, with the desire to talk ourselves on to the front bench.  Reference was made in the course of the debate that Members on this side of the House were anxious to get over here to occupy the brown leather seats.  I should like to say that the brown leather seat I sat on this morning was well worn &mdash; in fact, there was a hole in it &mdash; from people sitting on their backsides.  The time has come when we must take ourselves seriously as a Government and as a Parliament to ensure we work fulltime to put matters right.</P>
    <P>I do not accept Deputy Flynn's attack on workers while he at the same time taunts a member of the Government for suggesting that farmers should tighten their belts.  I accept the importance of agriculture to the community, having had experience of it in the course of my work with a farming organisation, but it must be clear that workers should not, and cannot, be the only people asked to constantly tighten their belts.  This has to be done across the board involving industrialists, farmers and workers, no exceptions, and Members should not be making apologies here for a reasonable and reasoned attempt by a Minister to ask all sectors of the community to contribute equally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn said Fianna Fáil were like Snow White in economic terms.  It occurred to me at the time that they were more like Snow White and the seven dwarfs but since it has occured to me that they were probably more like Snow <Col N="683" /> White and the 78 political and economic dwarfs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome an opportunity to debate some of the issues involved in this Bill, even though it is being introduced rather belatedly.  Has the House ever waited so long for the introduction of a Finance Bill, a piece of legislation which normally follows the introduction of a budget?  This Bill must be seen as being truly representative of the Government's economic strategy.  Therefore, I shall spend some time analysing that strategy or, in most cases, the lack or misuse of it.  The Government's strategy is in conflict with the Fine Gael manifesto and the Labour manifesto when they went before the electorate.  The Coalition were returned to power on a litany of promises which they knew they could not fulfil and which they knew were unsustainable because of the lack of back-up services.  Nevertheless, at the end of the election both parties considered it necessary to get together to draw up a third manifesto which the Irish people were not asked to vote on.  I am referring to the manifesto which was drawn up in the Gaiety Theatre, the one on which the Government's economic strategy appears to be based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Bill reflects the cruelty of the Governments strategy it is being introduced against the desired wishes of the Irish people because the Coalition Members were elected on a different programme.  For that reason those parties have broken faith with those who elected them to the Dáil.  The Bill reflects a complete U-turn as far as Fine Gael are concerned.  It is clear now that Fine Gael were prepared to sacrifice anything to secure the reins of Government.  They sacrificed 90 per cent of their manifesto while the Labour Party sacrificed all their manifesto.  That was done because the parties wanted to get into Government to demonstrate to the Irish people what they could do or felt they could do.  There is little need for me to elaborate now on their failures because the Irish people were quick to realise those that occurred <Col N="684" /> due to the poor judgment and bad planning of the Government.</P>
    <P>I have never known a Government to lose their popularity so fast, but that does not surprise me.  I am not surprised because the people expected so much after reading the manifestos of Labour and Fine Gael.  Labour promised to reduce the cost of living by from 4 to 6 per cent.  They could have done it if they were sincere in their election promises. But they were more anxious to get into Government by fair means or foul.  They got in and they abandoned the idea of a 4 per cent decrease in the cost of living and abandoned their plans for full employment.  We know what has happened since then.  There is more suffering in Ireland today than there has been for many years due to the cruel finance policies and to the lack of planning of this Government.  There must be planning if we are to achieve any measure of progress but there has been no planning by this Government because there is no agreement among the Cabinet on the day to day running of the country.  Those people got together without the realistic and researched planning that was needed to advance the economy and to create the thousands of jobs necessary to stabilise the cost of living.  No effort has been made to do this.</P>
    <P>Various Government Ministers and spokesmen have blamed Fianna Fáil for everything.  But they are in control.  They have it in their power to introduce any measures they wish.  But the only thing they introduced is this Finance Bill which is being debated in this House today, and they have done nothing to improve the situation or to improve the economic mess which they blame Fianna Fáil for. We all expected corrective measures to be taken.  We all believed the magic wand was about to be waved and that the people would enjoy immediate benefits. But nothing has happened and we are still living with galloping inflation of a higher rate than was even anticipated by the people.  It is no wonder that there is such frustration among the people.  They do not know where to turn.  They were promised so much and got so little and <Col N="685" /> the result is despair and complete lack of confidence in the Government.</P>
    <P>How do we tackle this situation?  Have the Government any plan?  What is in this Finance Bill to indicate that any creative measures will be taken?  The cost of living has increased by from 6 to 7 per cent in the last three months.  Why did the Government not introduce measures to reduce the cost of living?  Everybody expected something on these lines to be done.  Nothing has been done.  We have galloping inflation and there seems to be no end to it.  The standard of living of millions of people has been reduced by the introduction of the budget last July and this Finance Bill now.  Let me start with the old age pensioner.  Some old age pensioners got an increase of 10p which would not cover a fraction of the cost of the printing of the new pension books or a fraction of the cost of the additional administration involved.  Some were lucky and got an increase of 80p.</P>
    <P>These increases were nothing but an insult to the people who are least able to fight for themselves.  This is the Government who promised so much in the field of social welfare.  They promised to eliminate poverty completely from Irish society.  How in the name of God can they do that by giving an old age pensioner an increase of 10p per week?  What about the wife who lost her husband and was left with many household bills and a young family to rear and educate?  What did she get?  What did the orphans get? What did the deserted wife with the young family get from this Government? They got next to nothing when one realises that the cost of living has increased by from 6 to 7 per cent.  Many social welfare recipients were told they would be getting a 3 to 4 per cent increase in social welfare benefits.  We saw what happened.  I can be forgiven for reiterating what all those people have been saying. This is another year of Government failure and lack of Government concern in providing for the weaker sections of our community, the people who are unable to look after themselves.  The first priority of any Government should be to look after the weaker sections in society.  This <Col N="686" /> is an area where this Government have failed miserably.</P>
    <P>Let me deal with the taxation increases in this budget for which this Finance Bill makes statutory provision.  Every taxable commodity in this country has been taxed more.  The motorist who is an average citizen, not a man of wealth or excess means, is now contributing 37½ per cent tax when he purchases a motor car because of the increase in VAT and because of the increase in excise duties. On top of that he must pay the increased cost of petrol, oils and car parts which are the most expensive in all Europe and carry the highest rate of tax in Europe. This Finance Bill goes all the way towards killing the goose that lays the golden egg because the motorist can take no more. Recently I got figures from some of the companies with regard to oil and petrol sales.  I discovered that petrol sales were down by 12½ per cent during the month of September, that car sales have dropped by 16 per cent.  That is a clear indication that the people cannot afford to provide themselves with transport to enable them to get to their place of employment if they are lucky enough to have a job.  This Government have not only killed off the motoring industry but have deprived thousands of people of employment as a result because most garages are now on half time; some garages are on a three day week and have let go staff and other garages have taken on no apprentices as they would normally do in September or October because there is no work for them.  The Government are responsible.  They went out to bleed the motorist.  They felt that he was some sort of individual with unlimited financial resources.  But they have now discovered that there is an end to the tank in which he carries his few bob and the result is that we have more and more unemployment in the motor industry than was expected.</P>
    <P>Then, of course, the hardy annuals were taxed.  They received another belt in this budget.  There were increases in the price of drink and tobacco resulting again in a fall-off in the consumption of beer and tobacco.  This is not surprising <Col N="687" /> because the impositions were penal and the people just had to call a halt and decide that they could not go on having an odd jar in the same way as they did before.  They have discovered they have to smoke less because there is no way they can meet the additional costs.  This results in more unemployment, more people living below the breadline and less revenue collected in the long run.  If you really want buoyancy in revenue you must ensure there is a greater demand for the products which carry the tax.  How can you have a greater demand for a product if the price goes beyond the reach of the average citizen?  That has happened as a result of the budget last July and the people have decided they will not tolerate this any longer.  There is, because of this budget, a fall off in the consumption of drink and tobacco as well as the purchase of petrol and oil.  We will be told that this will save our economy because it will help to cut down oil bills. That may not be good for the country because we may have more unemployment as a result.  If we want a booming economy we must ensure that John Citizen has as much money as possible in his pocket.  When the Government decide to take the maximum from John Citizen he has less money to spend and our economy suffers.</P>
    <P>That is what is happening now as a result of last July's budget.  I believe this has all been caused by the lack of policy by the Government.  It appears to me that the Government did not carefully research their policies before they introduced those penal measures.  The sales in every sector have fallen because of the VAT increases on cars and excise duties and increased taxation on all the other commodities.  I remember on one occasion when a Fianna Fáil Government were defeated because they put a penny on the pint.  Nobody would bat an eyelid if only one penny was put on the pint today.  In 1948 a former leader of the Fianna Fáil Party lost the election because he put a penny on the pint.  The Opposition based their strategy on the poor man's pint.  He now discovers he <Col N="688" /> needs a pound before he can buy that pint.  I do not know how an old age pensioner can buy a pint today in view of the fact that many of those people have only been granted an increase of 10p per week.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Government may intend doing something next year.  Perhaps they have some magic wand available so that next year people will enjoy huge benefits. There is nothing in the Finance Bill to indicate that the Government will do anything drastic to compensate the lower income groups for the reduction in their living standards.  There is a reduction in living standards because of the deliberate policies of the Government.  I hope the people get an opportunity to correct that situation.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that nothing has been done for agriculture in the last few months except the abolition of part of the farm modernisation scheme which was to encourage farmers and assist them to become more efficient and more productive.  Sections of this scheme have been abolished completely.  This deprives farmers of the opportunity of becoming more competitive, increasing their production and becoming more efficient.  It is not surprising that there is an air of despair among the farming community at the present time.  I am, however, surprised that farm leaders are not as vocal as they were when Fianna Fáil were in power.  During the last six months of Fianna Fáil Government farmers got benefits to the tune of £340 million.  There is no evidence of anything like that happening today.  Farmers are being told they must tighten their belts and must accept a lowering of their living standards.  Fianna Fáil were conscious that farm incomes had not kept pace with other sections of the community during the last two years.  It appears the Government are determined not to do anything for the farming community except to punish them whenever they get an opportunity.  We have clear evidence of that in the withdrawal of portion of the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Government will realise the folly of what they are doing.  I hope <Col N="689" /> for the sake of agriculture the Government will do something for that important section of the community.  Agriculture has always been one of the most important elements in our community because we are producing a product on which we can base our economic growth rather easily.  The farming community only require small incentives and a guaranteed market for their produce.  Markets are available to them because of our accession to the EEC but costs have outpaced farm incomes.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the Government's lack of concern for farmers.  We all remember when the new Ministers were appointed that they were going to do this, that and the other.  I expected the farming community would be a privileged section. This has not happened.  The Government are punishing them in the same way they are punishing old age pensioners and all the other less well-off sections of the community.  We have only to compare this kind of treatment with the efforts of Fianna Fáil to improve the position of farmers during their last 12 months of Government.  The Minister for Agriculture at that time expressed concern for the farming community because he realised their importance to our economy. We have a completely different situation now even though the Government received a strong farmer vote in the General election last June.  It can be said that the farming vote in all of Leinster went to the Fine Gael candidates.  Those farmers are now disillusioned.  They have been let down by the Government who promised so much.  Their expectations were high, they expected their position to improve but they have got their answer from the Government.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government are not showing any concern for that basic industry which has meant so much to our economy over the years.  Every farmer throughout the country is receiving demands today for income tax which he does not owe and has no means of paying. I am inundated with farmers calling to my clinics and my home every day with bills from Revenue and the county registrar for money they never owed, money <Col N="690" /> based on assessment.  I wish some member of the Government would wake up to the situation and realise what they are doing.  They are paying good wages to the staff in Revenue.  They have sheltered conditions unlike farmers.  Those people are harassing the farming community day in and day out, demanding money which farmers have not got.  Am I to assume that, as a follow-up to all this punishment, farmers will be jailed if they do not pay those assessments, even though they have not got the necessaries of life?</P>
    <P>I will await with interest the Minister's reply to all the points made in this debate. I am very concerned about the way the Government are allowing those people to spend so much time and money trying to extract money from people who are without income.  This is the saddest situation which I could ever envisage for the farming community.  Is this a deliberate attempt to bleed them white?  Are they expected to let their wives and families starve in order to pay money which they do not owe?</P>
    <P>The farmers of Ireland cannot keep accounts in the same way as a businessman does because their system is completely different.  When the Fianna Fáil Government were in power I argued for the introduction of a simplified method of filling in income tax forms.  I expected this Government to continue to simplify that method, but nothing has happened. Whether or not farmers owe income tax, and whether or not they are in a position to pay it, they are expected to pay an accountant £300, £400 or £500 to do their books and send them up to Revenue. Then they discover they have no taxable income.  That is another way of extracting money from farmers.  It is unjust and unnecessary, and it has put the farming community in dire straits.</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil had introduced many of these measures, what would the agricultural correspondents be printing in our newspapers?  What would the farm leaders be saying?  Farm leaders are not as militant now as they were when Fianna Fáil were in office.  Fianna Fáil were the only party who demonstrated beyond <Col N="691" /> doubt that they were concerned to see farming incomes holding their place with other sections of Irish society.  It appears that the farming community have been written off.  This is a sad day for Ireland and the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Finance to try to control the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  Surely he can find other work for them to do. They must have nothing to do if they can spend time and money writing letters to farmers and to the county registrar, the sheriff as he is known in rural areas, demanding payments from people who have been deprived of an income.  Something has gone wrong somewhere.  This situation cannot be tolerated much longer.  I never saw farmers in such an angry mood as they are in at present. They have reached saturation point.  If they become militant next year, the blame for their militancy and their actions must rest squarely on the shoulders of the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the Government who promised so much to the farming community and gave them so little.</P>
    <P>I now come to the greatest gimmick in modern electioneering which played a major part in putting this Government in office, the promise of £9.60 a week for the stay-at-home wife.  That was the greatest con job of the century.  I am not surprised that so many women voted for that part of the Fine Gael election manifesto.  They believed they would get an envelope with a cheque for £9.60 in their letterboxes each week, which they would have for themselves, and which would enable them to enjoy a certain amount of independence.  That was last June.  We have now almost reached 1 November and there is no sign of that £9.60 per week being paid.  I do not know whether it will be paid.  A previous speaker asked do the Government intend to take that £9.60 from the husband and give it to the wife without consulting the husband. That question remains to be answered.  I hope it will be answered before the conclusion of this debate.  It is a vexed and burning question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> I do not blame women if they are angry.  We all appreciate the great contribution women have made to Irish society.  I would not begrudge them £40 or £50 a week if the State could afford to pay it.  Society owes a great deal to women.  I should like to see something definite given to the stay-at-home wife. If we could encourage more married women to stay at home, we would make more jobs available for single people and young people.  It will take more than £9.60 a week to encourage the working wife to stay at home and make jobs available for others.  Have the Government carried out any research into the cost of paying this £9.60?  Enormous administration costs must be involved.  Hundreds and hundreds of additional civil servants would be required to administer the scheme.  In the end the scheme will cost more to administer than to implement. Compared with its value last June, the figure would need to be a great deal higher to keep pace with the inflation and the fall in money values in recent months.</P>
    <P>The payment of £9.60 was to be very limited.  It was to be confined to the wives of PAYE workers in the upper income bracket.  It was estimated that 250,000 women would benefit.  Further thousands of women were convinced by Fine Gael canvassers that every wife would get a cheque for £9.60 every week in her letterbox.  Later it was discovered that farmers' wives would not get it, even though they had no income, that the unemployed man's wife would not get it &mdash; and we have 160,000 people unemployed.  The wife of a self-employed man would not get it unless her husband was paying over £600 a year in PAYE.  It was the greatest con job of modern times and will go down in history as such.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised that Fine Gael Deputies are embarrassed.  They did not research this proposal before it was introduced.  If they did, they might not have accepted it or put it in their election manifesto.  It paid off from the point of view of votes.  The Government have a very slim majority.  The real Government is a man who occupies a seat over there. Unfortunately he is not here now.  He <Col N="693" /> was here all morning.  He represents the real Government and the real Taoiseach. He is the man who holds the Irish people to ransom.  Perhaps he will answer sooner or later for the lack of Government action on their manifesto.  Perhaps he will be able to explain why this proposal was so limited.  The women of Ireland were conned.  They are highly intelligent women who genuinely believed that they would benefit to the tune of £9.60 each week.</P>
    <P>How many men were consulted and asked if they were prepared to have £9.60 deducted from them to give to their wives?  We should bear in mind that 95 per cent of family homes are happy ones. The husband and wife get on well together and there is family unity.  What can be achieved by taking £9.60 from a husband and giving it to his wife?  It does not make sense.  It never made sense to me or to most Fianna Fáil people.  We believe it is unworkable and unacceptable and the greatest con job of modern times.  The sooner the Government give the electorate an opportunity of voting on the issues on which their expectations were based last June the better for the country.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Mitchell and he referred to the talented men in Fine Gael. This scheme must be the work of those talented men.  He spoke about energetic reform.  Will the talented men carry this out?  Perhaps when the Deputy is a little longer in this House he will not be as enthusiastic as he is about the talented men in Fine Gael.  They spent the last three months arguing among themselves about Government policies and insignificant details which did not concern the majority of the people.  That is the work of the talented men.  If they are the talented men then God help Ireland.  They promised to introduce reform in Irish society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is so involved, wide-ranging and varied that one can be forgiven for wandering from its terms. There was an old character in my county of Westmeath who said: &ldquo;Young fellow, if you want to get to Mullingar go around by Tullamore&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not indicate to me that any worthwhile reforms are in train or that the people can expect anything significant in the future.  Many people expected that the IDA would be revamped and reformed.  The latest opinion expressed to me is that the Government have plans to abolish the IDA.  The IDA played a significant role in our industrial revolution in recent years.  The Government should make a decision with regard to it.  Have they plans to run it down, supplement it with something else or replace it?  I have received complaints that no grants have been paid out for several months and that would indicate that the Government have done some thinking in regard to the future of the IDA.  There is no mention of it in this Bill but Government strategy is based on every Finance Bill.  The work of the IDA must be of serious concern to everyone with a job and to those who expect to get one in the near future.  I hope this matter will be clarified by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The building industry is in chaos.  Only last Thursday I met an architect who told me he had no work for the first time since he established his business.  He was faced with the choice of closing the door and letting seven people go or trying to survive on his savings until some building project came along.  Due to the Government's curtailment of housing grants many people who contemplated building have now decided otherwise and the result is more and more unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the election campaign an issue was made of the lack of finance for road construction.  We have waited patiently for the last five months to see would this Government inject capital into the road fund.  Nothing has been done in that area. Local authorities have received no special notification about any additional funds.  It would appear that promises <Col N="695" /> were beneficial to the Government and they paid off.  The same applies to our infrastructure.  We have sanitary and telecommunications services which are vital to advance the economy.  There is evidence of cutbacks in health board areas.  There is a slowing down of the hospitalisation programme which was pursued by Fianna Fáil.  Where is there evidence of concern for people in need? Where is there evidence of concern for the aged and under-privileged?  There is none.</P>
    <P>We know that medical cards are being reviewed and it has been alleged that thousands are being withdrawn from people in an effort to cut down on health board demands.  Another blow to those who can least afford it.  Where is the combat poverty programme which we believed would be pursued so vigorously by this Government?  They appointed a Minister of State to deal with that aspect of Government policy.  Has that been shelved together with their other promises?  I believe it has.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill to indicate that the Government have any plan to alleviate unemployment.  The Government have abandoned the fort in regard to unemployment and have just written the unemployed off.  The only evidence we have of Government or ministerial policies are statements we read in the newspapers.  The unemployed can expect nothing from this Government.  There is a clear example of this in the fact that jobs have been frozen in the public service despite the fact that some proposed legislation will require additional staff to administer it.  I do not know how the Government can reconcile these two things.</P>
    <P>We had another typical example of the Government's lack of concern for jobs by their decision to close the Tuam sugar plant.  Beet that was processed in that factory was grown in the midlands.  That industry was vital to the economy of the west.  The impending closure of the Tuam factory represents a sad day for Ireland and especially for the thousands of <Col N="696" /> people in the Tuam area who have become so dependent on that great industry around which the whole economy of the area was built.  However, we can only hope that in the meantime there will be a change of Government and, with the return of Fianna Fáil to office, the people of the west and of the midlands can rest assured that the wheels of industry will be kept revolving in Tuam.</P>
    <P>The area of youth employment is referred to in the Bill.  Regarding the Government's proposal to set up another agency to deal with this area, have we not enough agencies already to do this work?  The youth employment scheme has been an outstanding success.  It was operated by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle when he was Minister of State.  That scheme was responsible for providing a lot of work for young people.  All we need to do now is to improve on it in order to ensure that it works more efficiently.  The machinery is there so there is little point in setting up a costly new scheme.  The Government should forget about any such idea and continue to use the IDA and the schemes already in existence in creating jobs.  In this way it would be possible to find jobs for thousands of young people.  Much credit is due to AnCO for the part they have played in preparing people for employment.  The success of that scheme has surpassed all the expectations of those involved.  The training centres have been established in strategic centres around the country. Agencies such as AnCO have given hope and encouragement to thousands of boys and girls who are anxious to have permanent employment at home.  These young people have no wish to join the dole queues.  They want the opportunity of earning a living and of playing their full role in Irish society.  The agency that the Government are talking about may be all right up to a point but it might result in an over-concentration on the needs of youth while ignoring the redundant workers who have wives and children to look after and who must meet their mortgage repayments.  There could very well be a conflict to that extent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell spoke of Dáil reform. <Col N="697" /> I do not know how much might be done in this area.  He raises the question, too, of additional office space but I would remind him that the many thousands of people who are anxious to come in here are not concerned about such matters or about the colour of the seats.  If we are to have a further period of economic recession we should consider the needs of others and leave reform of the Dáil and the improvement of services in the House to a later date.  Somebody has said that civil servants would not accept the standards that Deputies must accept but somebody must make sacrifices and we, as Members of this House, should be content in the present economic climate with lower standards and get on with the job of trying to improve the standards of those outside.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the Bill also to our foreign debt.  We should remember that every country has a foreign debt in that they borrow from some foreign agency or other.  Such borrowing is nothing to be ashamed of.  The fact that we have a foreign debt is a clear indication that we are regarded as a credit-worthy nation, that those who lend us money are confident that there is a future for our economy.  Consequently, I would not be too concerned about our foreign debt. Instead, I would be concerned with putting people into productive employment. I might add that even West Germany which was the strongest economy in Europe now finds itself in the red.  One must borrow in order to expand whether one be in farming or in some other business.  If an industrialist is to provide jobs he must have the money first but if he is not able to obtain the money from a lending agency he has little hope of expansion.  The austere policies being followed by this Government will not achieve anything other than a lowering of living standards, the creation of greater depression and the killing of confidence among the people.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the levy on banking and said that Deputy Flynn was concerned for the bankers. That is not so.  Deputy Flynn said that the Government introduced the levy by way <Col N="698" /> of a sop to the Labour Party who have been talking for years about nationalising the banks.  Incidentally I am surprised that there has been no speaker from the Labour benches so far in this debate.  I hope that the Press take note of that.  The banks are not worried about that 5 per cent levy.  They will get it back by way of levying increased charges on their customers and they have increased charges twice since the levy was introduced. Surely there is somebody in the Government who is level headed enough to realise that.</P>
    <P>This Bill fails to set out anything new as to the prospects for this nation.  It is regrettable that there is no sign of any positive action being taken that would give back confidence to the people and thereby help them to face the long winter ahead.  The whole situation is very sad indeed for our people who have been through so much in the past 50 or 60 years.  Let us not forget that we were on our knees between 1916 and 1923.  There has been a long revival since then.  Surely we owe it to those people who have made such sacrifices in the past to continue on the road to progress.  This is not progress. Nothing in this Finance Bill would indicate that the Government are concerned about progress.  I do not know what has got into their heads.  As a Fianna Fáil Deputy I expected more from this Government.  I expected some type of organisation and planning and nothing whatsoever has come.  Am I to assume that there will be millions and millions surplus at the end of this financial year and that all the goodies will be handed out next year?  Why are they preaching gloom, gloom, gloom all the way?  Surely it is their responsibility to introduce confidence at present, to boost the morale of the Irish people which is so low at this time.  I never saw a new Government become so unpopular so quickly, and I am glad to say that many of our political correspondents and commentators realise that fact.  The Government, for the sake of the people must change course if necessary now; otherwise they will lead us down the path of no return.</P>

      <P>Anyway, they got rid of that decent man.  I listened with great interest in January or February 1980 to a television address of the new leader of the Government at the time, and I did not expect to find myself here at that time.  I felt that that man had impeccable qualities to deal with the economic problems of the country.  His speech on television was not unlike the sort of speech which Deputy Bruton has been making from this side of the House on the need to get our finances into some kind of order.  I am not criticising that man in particular but I just do not understand what he was about.  He said the kind of things that the country was ready to listen to.  He had two-and-a-half years of which he could have afforded 18 months of the kind of unpopularity which we now are faced with, and I will never know why he did not take that opportunity.  However, that is history and I do not want to dwell too much on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keegan mentioned a few things on which I would like to comment. First of all he talked about our manifesto, our programme, which he said we were reneging on.  Our manifesto is a programme for government for four years, not four months.  It is ludicrous to suggest, whether in good times or bad, that any Government could deliver on all their commitments in four months.  He went on in an interesting speech to talk about economic planning, despite the fact that his Leader was the one who abolished economic planning in that he abolished the Department of Economic <Col N="700" /> Planning and Development.  We are in the business of re-introducing economic planning and we have set aside a Ministry of State to do just that.  I find it difficult to follow the logic of some of the Deputy's comments.</P>
    <P>He spoke also about militant farmers and the fact that they do not now seem to be as militant.  I am sorry to have to tell him that about 1,200 of them will be in the Cork Opera House tonight and they will be very militant.</P>

      <P>I am afraid they will be, but I do not think that they will be suggesting for one moment that all of their misfortunes have arisen out of the actions of a Government four months in office. Again we have to take some kind of time perspective when we are talking about this Finance Bill and the economic factors that gave rise to it.  I agree with the Deputy on the question of the mess of farm taxation that successive Governments have presided over.  My constituency is not predominently rural but there is a rural arm to it.  A number of farmers have phoned me and said, &ldquo;Can anything be done about this crazy situation where I have to pay £500 or £600 to a chartered accountant to tell me what I already know, that I could not possibly be liable for tax?&rdquo; I accept those comments and this is something we must deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of this Government being accused of presiding over the abolition of the IDA certainly needs to be dispelled. The Deputy knows, I hope, that his Government initiated a study by a firm of consultants on the efficiency and performance of the IDA.  That was a good thing to do.  Since the change of Government that report has come through and our Government must and should look at the result of that to see whether the IDA needs to be revamped or strengthened. Certainly it is not to be abolished.  It was our party who started the IDA in the first place.  We believe absolutely in the function of the IDA and it has done a tremendous job.  I do not think there is any <Col N="701" /> disagreement in this House about that.  If anyone were to suggest that we were going to abolish the IDA I would have said that that is not so.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the scheme to combat poverty.  Again, we have appointed a Minister of State to deal specifically with that subject, but we must have some time.  The previous combat poverty programme had much to recommend it.  It was a pilot scheme.  The results of it need careful analysis and clearly it cannot be reinstituted in a matter of a couple of months, but it will be reintroduced.</P>
    <P>A rather cavalier statement was made about the foreign debt which I found a little frightening, particularly when it was followed by a comment about now reaching the bottom of the well.  I would have thought the two things were contrary in the emphasis put upon them.  I am sorry to dwell on those things but it is only fair that some of the comments made across the floor should be commented upon in a fair way, and I hope I have been fair about it.  Some measure of the debasement to which politics has sunk is that almost anything said by politicians tends to be regarded by the public at large&mdash; in my experience anyway &mdash; as either blatantly partisan or at best highly suspect, and that may well be the case all over the world.  However, it presents problems when we are in the real difficulty of trying to get across to the public in a fair way what the economic state of the country is and the response of the Government of the day to that condition. No Government, certainly not a Government who have a nil majority, would willingly enter on the kind of rescue operation on which this Government are embarked at present.  Unfortunately, it seems that we have no choice in the matter, and if the party now in Opposition were in government I doubt very much whether they would have much choice.</P>
    <P>At the risk of repeating over and over again the kind of statistics about which no great doubt arises, it is important not so much to talk about the statistics as to <Col N="702" /> talk about a comparison with comparable countries with which we have to live, namely those in the EEC.  On three of the main criteria, balance of payments, current budget deficit and our national debt, we are in a serious position relative to our neighbours in Europe.  In 1978 our balance of payments deficit was £200 million and this year it is estimated it will reach a staggering £1,400 million.  In percentage terms that places us at the bottom of the nine EEC countries.  Despite the measures which were taken in the budget our current deficit is estimated at £787 million, or practically 8 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>Some of our European partners have no budget deficits.  Even the next worst to us, Belgium, has a rate which is half ours.  The figures, although mind-boggling, are less important than our relationship with our neighbours and our trading partners in particular.  This morning we got a copy of the NESC Report. By any standards that is as authoritative a document as there is.  It hammers home the same message, which the Government believe and which the Opposition apparently do not, that we are in a perilous position.  It says the council's principal recommendation in Report No. 53, which was last year's report, was the elimination of the current budget deficit over the three-year period from 1981 to 1983. It goes on at some length about that subject; but, by and large, it is the same message as this Government are trying to hammer home: that we simply have no choice but to take unpopular measures in an economy that is in a perilous position. It is against that background that the budget has to be viewed.</P>
    <P>I wish these statistics were exaggerated, but they are not.  The underlying trends simply have to be reversed and the Government have to take a number of unpalatable and unpopular measures.  It is ludicrous to suggest that these measures amount to nothing more than monetarism or Thatcherism.  It is equally untrue to state that this Government are not prepared to borrow heavily.  They have no choice.  However, we must reduce and ultimately cease borrowing for day to day Government spending; we <Col N="703" /> must work towards the elimination of the current budget deficit.  I believe that fair-minded people on all sides of the House are not in disagreement with that. There was a very interesting interview in the <i>Sunday Press</i> with Deputy O'Malley in which he said he considered it one of the primary tasks of the Government to eliminate the current budget deficit over the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>We face a series of extremely difficult options and problems.  We have the daunting task of bringing the nation's finances under control while at the same time reversing unemployment, reducing inflation, increasing competitiveness and protecting the socially and economically deprived.  That will be a difficult task.  I believe it will take nothing short of a real national effort, as well as a major improvement in the international climate, to bring about that result.  We have no influence over the international climate but we can do something about our own affairs provided we show restraint and moderation and perhaps a lowering of our expectations in the short term.</P>
    <P>One of the first tests of our resolve is in the area of national wage agreements and what might replace them.  Already we have seen that the social partners have fired their fairly predictable opening shots.  For the first time in many years they appear to be poles apart and a basis for a national wage agreement looks very difficult, if not impossible.  However, I believe there is a fairly widespread appreciation throughout the community of the need for some restraint in the present economic climate.  This appreciation will quickly disappear if equity and fairness are not perceived in the spreading of the burden throughout the whole community.  The kernel of the problem is to find a method which is not only fair but is seen to be fair.  That may require the wisdom of Solomon but it is a matter for the Government to try to convince people about the fairness of the measures they are taking.  It is not on to suggest to wage and salary PAYE earners that they should moderate their demands if other sectors, which are more difficult to monitor, <Col N="704" /> appear to be unaffected.  The challenge to the Government is to be seen to be bringing about a fair sharing of the burden.  It is a very difficult task but I hope it is not impossible.</P>
    <P>In my private capacity I am a professional quantity surveyor.  I run a private practice and architects, consulting engineers and so on operate in the same field as I do.  We normally charge fees on the basis of a percentage of the cost of a construction project.  That means, in effect, we are virtually inflation proof because, when building costs go up, we usually charge a fee on the basis of the final cost.  I suggest to people in that sector that it would not be unreasonable for the Government in the present climate to say to people in the building industry that in the foreseeable future Government contracts should pay fees on the basis of tender figures, not final costs. That would be a contribution towards lowering inflation and accepting a certain level of moderation, or practically freezing in a sense one's expectations in the short-term.  The whole area of monitoring restraint in business without interfering with enterprise and with people's incentive to invest must be tackled if the PAYE sector are to accept that there is a fair level of burden spread across the board.  In the coming weeks and months it is vital that we all address ourselves to the problem of a reasonable wage settlement throughout the whole community. If we do not get that we are going to lose more and more jobs and our competitiveness.  Our industry will be put at risk and we will be in a much more serious situation than at present.</P>
    <P>This morning my colleague, Deputy Lyons, said he was getting a very depressing feedback from his constituency about the state of the nation and the Government.  I suppose that is par for the course. I find an amazing resilience among people.  They know we have a difficult job to do and that the state of the economy is worse than it has been for many years.  They do not like what we are doing but they accept that it must be done sooner rather than later.  That is the predominant feedback I am getting. <Col N="705" /> Other public representatives might get the reverse.</P>
    <P>The Deputy said that industry was in a sorry state as a result of our couple of months in Government.  We look to the Government to handle national finances in a prudent fashion, to tackle inflation and the underlying difficulties in an economy which has over-borrowed and is facing enormous interest repayments. Business confidence will not be restored until that job is done and that is what we are about.  Methods of doing that job are obviously open to debate, but the principle, surely, is not.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that agriculture is in dire straits at present.  It is not fair, however, to suggest that that has happened in the last four months or, to be fair, in the last two or three years.  The real problem has nothing to do with agriculture itself, it has to do with inflation.  Costs and prices are going up because of the inflation rate.  That is the problem in agriculture which we must tackle.  If in the next two years we do not get inflation down to a manageable, single figure, no amount of props or grants will save agriculture.  This, or any Government, must tackle inflation and the main underlying economic problems of gross over-borrowing, over-spending in the public sector and continual fuelling of inflation. These are the problems which Minister Deputy Bruton, has bravely and courageously faced in the budget.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lyons and Deputy Keegan mentioned a serious depression in the construction industry.  I have worked in the construction industry.  It has been in recession for a couple of years, there is no question about that.  It is no better now than last year, but it is no worse. There is a major commitment by this Government to productive capital investment in the construction industry.  The most recent evidence of that is one of the largest construction projects ever undertaken in this State, the Cork-Dublin gas pipeline.</P>

      <P>Not at all.  Another interesting development &mdash; the largest urban renewal ever undertaken &mdash; is about to commence in the centre of Cork city.  It involves half a million square feet of shopping, car parking, hotels, offices and so on.  The developer is banging on the door of Cork Corporation, asking for planning permission.  If that is not long-term confidence in the economy and in the building sector I do not know what is.  We should not be too depressed, nor should we be complacent, about the state of our construction industry.  It is not at anything remotely approaching full capacity and has not been for a number of years.  However, this Government are not about to preside over its destruction, far from it.  Our hope for the future lies in the freeing of funds spent on day to day expenditure so that they can be put into major capital infrastructural projects which will benefit the construction industry and the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some comments were made about unemployment.  A number of speakers from across the floor have commented on the apparent contradiction between the desire of this Government to create employment and the imposition of a freeze in public sector employment.  One does not need to be a genius to know that unemployment cannot be solved by creating more and more public sector employment.  If only that would work it would be a panacea for all politicians. The great majority of Government services do not earn revenue and must be paid for by the taxpayer or by Government borrowing.  We are committed, and rightly so, to the reduction of the current budget deficit.  It logically follows that we cannot continue to increase the wage bill of the public sector.  It is a crude mechanism to simply chop off finances.  There are, clearly, areas of real need.  Presumably, in the fullness of time, these must be analysed carefully.  We cannot open a floodgate of expansion in the public sector in the erroneous belief that that will solve the unemployment problem.  It will do the reverse.  If we do not free our meagre funds to be spent on real job creation, on the creation and expansion <Col N="707" /> of infrastructure and industry&mdash;jobs which, in themselves, have the power to recreate more jobs, we will not solve the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Regarding the national understanding or wage agreement or whatever replaces that, competitiveness in our industry has, for the first time, become a serious worry. When we entered the EEC, and particularly when we joined the EMS, we had a fairly distinct cost advantage in our price structure.  One of the many advantages advanced for joining the EMS was that it would somehow force us to lower our inflation rate in line with the lower inflation economies of Europe.  We have not done that.  Between 1978 and 1981 our wage costs have risen by 25 per cent more in real terms than those of the EMS countries.  There has not been a corresponding increase in our productivity relative to that of the EEC countries with which we trade, which is a serious matter. For example, in the Netherlands for the past 12 months prices have increased by only 6½ per cent and wages by 1½ per cent; In Germany, prices have increased by 6 per cent and wages by 5 per cent; even in Britain the inflation rate has dropped to 11 per cent.  While we are not a country which pays high wages&mdash;far from it, we are amongst those who pay the lowest wages &mdash; in terms of the combination of wages and productivity we are, nonetheless, getting badly out of line, which will inhibit the essential expansion of our industry and our ability to sell our products.  It is as basic and fundamental as that.  That is a national discipline which we do not, and will not, easily accept but which we must accept if we are to create jobs which we, above all the countries of Europe, uniquely need.</P>
    <P>I do not find many of the measures in the Finance Bill palatable, nobody does. However, these must be seen against the background of a very difficult economic climate and an essential attempt to get our finances into a position from which we can expand and grow.  The message must be got across, in the midst of that gloomy summary of the position, that there is a reason and a purpose for what <Col N="708" /> we are doing, that above all there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  Irish people are not fools.  This is not the first time they have been asked to make sacrifices. They have, in the past, made much bigger sacrifices.  With prudence, understanding and moderation, we can come through this difficult time and look upon it as simply an interruption of our forward progress.  Unless we take the difficult, unpopular and essential measures to get our economy right for growth and future prosperity we will never know that growth and prosperity.  That is what this Government are about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the previous speaker on his maiden speech and wish him well in his political career.  However, the reality of his speech is another matter.  While I agree the situation is one of gloom, there is also a feeling of hopelessness in the country.  People are confronted daily with internecine strife between the Coalition brothers.  From reading the newspapers one gets the impression that the Government are settling the arguments between the socialist and conservative partners. We have the Coalition arguing and presiding over an economy in drift, but apparently doing very little to control the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming from an urban constituency I know that one of the strongest complaints is in regard to increasing prices.  The average housewife gets a weekly allocation for the household budget but inevitably she must go back to her spouse&mdash;or to the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; if she is working&mdash;for more money.  Consequently she cannot budget. If a husband or wife goes to the supermarket he or she will find that a product which cost 20p last week can be 25p this week.  This means there is a very big percentage increase in the family budget each week.  This is one area of complaint where the Government are not doing anything to control prices, particularly at supermarket level.  I am not suggesting supermarket owners or shopkeepers are dishonest, but this is an area over which the Government should have control and <Col N="709" /> should give a lead in relation to the ever-increasing cost of living.</P>
    <P>In their recent budgets the Government attacked the motorist.  Five years ago&mdash;and it is on the record of this House&mdash;I said the car was no longer a luxury but a necessity, especially in this city where public transport is seen to break down daily.  On every road one finds a CIE bus broken down with the result that people must provide their own transport.  That is a reality.  The motor car is an necessity in getting from A to B.</P>
    <P>Petrol prices are increased monthly, road tax has been re-introduced and VAT on cars is 25 per cent.  This is outrageous.  Today I raised a question on road deaths and road injuries and I will continue to raise this issue as long as I have the privilage of serving the people of Dún Laoghaire.  By increasing the cost of car parts we are frightening people from keeping their cars in proper order. There has been a considerable increase in the number of defective cars on our roads because people cannot afford to replace defective parts&mdash;for example, bald tyres.  The cost of tyres increased by 25 per cent.  All these increases have been introduced in the space of a few weeks, compliments of the Government.  The price of petrol has jumped.  People who would use public transport cannot do so because it is not available.  I am speaking now for the people in the city and county of Dublin.  This is a catch 22 situation. There is very little public transport and people must provide their own, with the result that public transport cannot get from one end of their route to another because of the number of cars on the roads.  The roads and streets are choc-a-block.  One has only to leave this House between 5.30 p.m. and 7 p.m. to experience what I am speaking about.</P>
    <P>The sooner this Government recognise that the motor car is a necessity the better.  They should give the motorist a break.  They stand accused of economic terrorism.  The people are terrorised by their attitude to ever-increasing prices. House prices are increasing unabated. One of the most insidious features of private house purchasing is penal stamp <Col N="710" /> duty.  The Government sit back, do nothing but take a percentage of the sale price by way of stamp duty.  This mean, penal, unsocial and unjust tax should be abolished.</P>
    <P>Price control under this Government is a joke.  The housewives are bamboozled and suffer shocks because of daily price increases, but nothing is done by the Government.  Almost every day we hear on the radio of price rises.  That brings me to the inevitables&mdash;beer and spirits.  Is it really necessary for successive Governments, and this Government in particular, to harass the decent pint drinker?  Is it reasonable for the Government to harass the publican?  People who condemn publicans should remember that they have families too and are entitled to sell their products at a reasonable price.  What are the present Government doing?  They are pricing the publican out of business.</P>
    <P>The pub is part of the community.  We congregate there for an hour or two each day.  I do not think that is unreasonable. I am talking now about the social drinker. In the city and county of Dublin, according to representations made to me in the matter, the publican is being priced out of the market.  The Government's policy in relation to price increases is counter productive.  They are pricing cars out of the market and pricing the drink of the average man off the counter.  The result is that fewer people are drinking and consequently there is less revenue for the Government.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of wishing every success in his new position to Mr. Joe Malone, the former director general of Bord Fáilte.  He did an excellent job and I would describe him as an economic patriot.  He gave much of his time to the introduction of millions of people to the advantages of this country. Just before the general election I met a group of hoteliers in my constituency who were very upset at attitudes to their industry.  They wished to be treated for grant purposes as the IDA treat enterprises which approach them for grants. The hotel industry is fundamental to the <Col N="711" /> economy and gives a great deal of employment.  It also gives a lot of tax to the Exchequer.  This is one of the matters I intend to raise during the lifetime of this Dáil.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the abuse of unemployment asistance.  I find the word &ldquo;dole&rdquo; an offensive four letter word and feel that this payment should be called by its proper name.  There are certain areas, such as the west, where unemployment assistance is badly needed as a supplement.  It would be unjust to envy these people their entitlement to unemployment assistance.  There is, however, abuse of the system The majority of people receiving it are no doubt entitled to it but there are some who see unemployment assistance as fair game.  It is an evil point of view indicating an evil mind. Unemployment benefit is entirely different in that it is obtained by people who have earned it through their contributions.  The abuse of unemployment assistance is a social crime and those engaged in it should be treated as offenders against the weaker sections of the community.  They are just as guilty of thieving as someone who steals from an old woman or takes money from a bank. Those engaged in it should be exposed.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill represents the implementation of the first stage of the Government's economic strategy.  Much has been said about the Government's counter inflation programme, but it is fair to say that their actions during the past few months have added 5 per cent to the cost of living and pushed the rate of inflation from 17 per cent when Fianna Fáil left office to 22 per cent.</P>
    <P>One is amazed at the Government's surprise on the breakdown of the national pay talks.  We must all be responsible in relation to this matter and political capital should not be made of it.  A successful outcome to these talks is in the interests of economic stability, but it is very difficult for trade union leaders to accept a pay pause when the wives of their members are being asked to pay massive increase in the price of food.  Income has <Col N="712" /> been so eroded during the past three months that it is not unreasonable to say that paypackets should be adjusted accordingly.  That would appear to be economic logic, but Government speakers say that the country cannot afford it at this time.  Apparently it is a question of forcing people into making false economies.  There are certain families who have not had a square meal during the past few months because of the necessity to cut back on food bills.  This is false economy and part of the terrorism of which I accuse the Government.  Some people may think this is a funny point of view but it is a very serious matter which we will continue to expose.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which a number of Government speakers have referred, not least Deputy Richie Ryan who, when Minister for Finance, had a difficult task to perform and did not create for his policies a great reputation.  It is very difficult position to fill and is probably made even more difficult in the present economic climate.  May I ask the Government to reconsider their attitude to this £9.60 which they allege will make the average household so much better off once a week?  I do not think any Member more than I would like to see more money going into the handbags of housewives or the pockets of their husbands, but it is clear to me that the sending out of 300,000 cheques of £9.60 will not make any household any better off.  Others more able as economists will tell about the estimated administrative cost of this, and we must remember that this is being done at a time when the Government have frozen recruitment to the civil service.</P>
    <P>This is a false, dishonest gimmick.  The husband will be paying for it in his income tax, so what the husband is giving the Government are taking and handing to his wife.  There are many other reasons why this gimmick should not have been introduced, but of course it is not a matter for the Opposition to be making a case why the Government should not be giving money to the electorate.  This is my point of view, and it might get me into trouble with my party &mdash; I do not think it will and <Col N="713" /> it should not.  I suggest that the Government should have another look at this irresponsible gimmick.  It must be exposed as such.  My belief is that the majority of the people whom the money is aimed at see it as a gimmick, as an economic falsehood.  I am asking the Government to have another look at this in that light, particularly since they have frozen recruitment in the civil service, and the people who would administer this piece of gimmickry have already indicated that they have not sufficient personnel to administer it.  It would take hundreds more people to issue 300,000 cheques per week.  It may be 350,000 cheques per week, but give or take the odd 50,000 it will present a major problem for the economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat Mr. Kieran Kennedy, the director of the Economic and Social Research Institute, at the recent conference, attended by the Taoiseach, on Irish society and the economy in the eighties.  Mr. Kennedy said that unemployment figures up to June 1981 had risen less fast than in most other EEC countries: they rose by 27 per cent here by comparison with 60 per cent in Britain and the Netherlands and 44 per cent in Germany.  In May and June, he said, unemployment showed signs of stabilising, but now it has begun to rise because of the Government's deflationary policy. He said the Government had frozen jobs in the public service and had put the whole burden of job creation on the private sector.  If, as the Taoiseach said for the first time at the weekend, the creation and preservation of jobs are the Government's first priorities, why has he frozen the creation of posts in the civil service; why has he reduced the number of teaching posts in primary schools and in teacher training colleges?</P>
    <P>I do not have to give details of the hardships and miseries caused by unemployment.  There is a feeling of drift and helplessness throughout the country, as well as hopelessness.  The Government have not shown any leadership in respect of fundamental, almost constitutional, human entitlements.  A man was entitled to a job.  A woman is now entitled to a <Col N="714" /> job, and why not?  The disemployment of the husband, the primary income earner, presents all sorts of problems for a family. I often think it leads to family breakdown.  Therefore, the Government are not only adding to the breaking up of families but they are contributing to the demoralisation of husbands who feel less than men when they are not able to come home to their wives and families with the dignity a wage packet confers.  Why can the Government not do anything more? There must be something they can do other than giving unemployment benefit or assistance.  Something more must be done to maintain the dignity of the heads of families.  The Government seem to think that coming home from the labour exchange with unemployment benefit or assistance is a substitute for jobs.</P>
    <P>A matter which upset me very much during the summer holidays was the Government's announcement of the closure of the Tuam beet factory.  This has nothing to do with my constituency.  However, we are national politicians and, though our primary function is to legislate instead of to mediate, certain things are done outside one's constituency which one regards as anathema to the principle of social justice.  Apparently the Tuam factory is not up to the standard required by economists for survival, but would the economists who are presiding over the death of the Tuam factory &mdash; the Minister for Agriculture must take the final decision &mdash; take a look at what the closure of the factory will cost, the hardship it will cause in that area?  We are talking about the west of Ireland.  We are not talking about a factory being closed at Shannon where there are many, or of factories that can be closed down anonymously in the industrial estates on the outskirts of Dublin day after day.  We are talking about a desirable social policy for the west of Ireland.  I genuinely appeal to the Government to reconsider their attitude in this case.  They are putting decent people out of work in a part of the country which is underpopulated.</P>

      <P>The Chair has given the Deputy an opportunity of <Col N="715" /> making what it regards as a passing reference to the Tuam problem and would be hoping that the Deputy would not wish to develop it at any great length because it would not be appropriate here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Government, as a matter of social justice, to adjust their philosophy.  I am basing their apparent lack of philosophy on their decision to close the Tuam factory.  I am asking for a reawakening of the old Sinn Féin philosophy, the philosophy of the first Republic.  That is what we should be reawakening. I appreciate the latitude the Chair has given me but I appeal to the Minister for Agriculture who is present to have another look at that matter. It would be a move in the right direction. Economists are not infallible although they have become the social soothsayers of our time.  If one asked ten economists to give a point of view on a common subject they would give ten different points of view.  The attitude of the economists to the Tuam factory is all wrong, as is the advice the Minister received, as a matter of social policy and social justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another indication of the Government's lack of social conscience is their decision to increase the VAT element on school books from 10 to 15 per cent.  Why should education be taxed?  I am talking about successive Governments.  This is a matter that must offend all Members.  It certainly offends my attitude to education.  I have children but I am not making any special case on their behalf or engaging in any special pleading.  I am raising the subject at the request of the many people who brought it to my attention.  I would not like it to be suggested that I am engaging in a special pleading, quite the contrary.  I am asking the Government, and the Minister for Education in particular, to deal with this matter.  The Minister for Education appears to be a reasonably energetic sort of person, albeit energetic in making certain wrong decisions.  Nevertheless, he appears to have a high public profile.  I should like <Col N="716" /> to ask him to make that one of the planks of his platform.  He should work towards the abandonment of value-added tax on school books.  It appears to me that there is no economic sense in the existence of such tax on school books.</P>
    <P>In national schools some parents cannot afford to buy the books and they must go, cap in hand, to the decent teacher who gives them an undertaking that they will not have to pay for the books on the basis that the health board or the local authority will pay for them.  The main reason for this cap-in-hand-syndrome is the VAT on school books.  Education should not be taxed.  Certainly, the tools of education should not be taxed and I regard school books to be very fundamental to learning.</P>
    <P>Another element I said I would bring to the attention of the House is the problem of youth unemployment.  In this regard we seem to be directionless.  There have been sounds by the Government recently in relation to this matter but yet the number of unemployed young people continues to grow.  If we continue to leave our young people unemployed we will cause a serious problem for the country. I am concerned with those between the ages of 18 and 30.  We must bear in mind the opportunities young people have for going astray in present conditions.  The fact that more of them have not gone off the deep end is an indication of their discipline.  They must cope with the problem of drugs and other social problems which are becoming a real threat to the stability of the community.  Unless we, the present generation of legislators, can provide the next generation, our children, with employment we are doing the nation a great disservice.  It is the Government of the day who are to blame for not providing jobs for young people. Young people without jobs are very open and defenceless and subject to all sorts of unreasonable threats.  In some instances they succumb to them.  The reason they do so is because they do not have jobs.  I appeal to the Government to do something about that part of their programme. That programme becomes less of a reality daily and more like something out of <Col N="717" /><i>Alice in Wonderland.</i> The document has become a piece of unreality and I cannot see the Government implementing their so-called great programme mainly due to their lack of direction.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one final point based on the report, <i>Economic and Social policy 1981, Aims and Recommendations,</i> produced by the National Economic and Social Council.  An interesting paragraph in that publication states:</P>
    <P>The forecast current budget deficit, at 7.9 per cent of GNP, is the largest ever recorded and the forecast balance of payments deficit on current accounts at 13.8 per cent of GNP is the largest recorded since 1951.  The deficit on current account will be largely financed through official external borrowing by the Exchequer and by the State-sponsored bodies.  New official external borrowings will amount to £1.15 billion in 1981.  The end-year external debt is likely to reach £4.3 billion&mdash;a 40 per cent increase during the year.  Given the output environment, total employment is unlikely to show any significant increase in the twelve months from April 1981 to April 1982.</P>
    <P>The Coalition will have been in power for most of that period, if they survive.  I should like to ask the Government to take note of what has been said today. They are guilty and stand accused of economic terrorism and their tactics are forcing people into situations which are becoming untenable.  In the final analysis they must take responsibility for this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about a Bill which implements the budget strategy we brought before the House last July.  In talking about the Bill it would be useful if occasionally we were to look at what that strategy consists of and what its aims are. It is ironic that Deputy Andrews, who has now left the Chamber, should have read out what must be in everybody's eyes one of the major indictments of the previous Government's policy, the statement that the current budget deficit this year will be at a record level.  I should <Col N="718" /> like to remind the House that had we not acted last July in the way we did the current budget deficit outturn for this year would have been even higher than the level now expected and we would be entering next year with an opening deficit which would exceed even the record levels which the publication Deputy Andrews referred to outlined.  That is the essential nub of the problem.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews and some of his colleagues on the Opposition benches have been amusing themselves recently&mdash;and I suppose in a way it is harmless amusement&mdash;with various fly remarks about economists.  I wondered, listening to Deputy Andrews, and to Deputy Killilea the other night, if Deputy Martin O'Donoghue was listening to them since he is one of that profession who played no small part in bringing Fianna Fáil to power in 1977, if what we are told is true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not taking it at all personally.  I am coming to the point which, perhaps, the Deputy might have some interest in.  It is that the science of economics, whatever about the persons who practice it, is available only as a means to help policy makers make decisions, whatever the field they are involved in, whether it is Government or private enterprise, farming or any other area.  It is in particular an instrument to help them to make decisions about the allocation of scarce resources.  That is a matter in which the previous Government were lamentably inexpert, because to a great extent their policies consisted of trying to fool people into believing that resources were not so scarce after all and that, even if at national level our resources were somewhat scarce, we could always borrow abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had this debate in this House already and no doubt we will have it again.  I want to make the point in the context of this debate that of course there is nothing inherently wrong in borrowing. Indeed, for a country such as ours there is a great deal to be said for borrowing in <Col N="719" /> order to build up our productive capacity for the years ahead and to build up our capacity to employ people in this country, to employ our own sons and daughters, our own young people, to maintain employment for our people in our country.  But when we get to the point where a large proportion of our borrowing is being incurred in order to finance current expenditure which is not creating revenue earning capacity, which is not creating productive capacity and which is not creating the potential to employ new people in the years ahead, then it has got seriously out of line.  That is the situation we were faced with on taking office last July and that is the situation which our budget strategy was aimed at redressing, because at the end of the day there is only one pocket the money can come from, at the end of the day there is only one group of people who can pay for the things we want to do for our underprivileged people, for sectors in difficulties, for our farmers, for firms closing down, for people who have not got jobs, for people who have not got access to medical services.  There is only one group of people who at the end of the day can pay for all of that, and that is ourselves.  There is nobody anywhere else in the world who has got free money in order to enable us to do all these things.  If we borrow to do those things we must make sure that we use that borrowing in a way which allows us to increase our own capacity to repay the borrowing.  It is rather ironic that Deputy Andrews should have put me on this track and reminded us of the basic problem that we are facing.</P>
    <P>Coming to the more particularly agricultural aspects of the budget, I would point out, as I did last July, that in a budget in which we reduced total Government expenditure we had to provide extra spending in the agricultural sector and we also provided&mdash;it was submitted to this House and accepted last July&mdash;a Supplementary Estimate of £35 million for my Department.  Between now and the end of the year&mdash;quite shortly, in fact&mdash;we will come forward with a further Supplementary Estimate for my Department to provide the finance necessary to <Col N="720" /> keep going not only the schemes which were in operation when we took office but also the new schemes which we have introduced in the meantime and which were designed to deal with some of the aspects of the serious farm income problem we face.  I would make the point that provision of extra funds for the agricultural sector in a budget in which we reduced the total amount of Government expenditure below the level it would otherwise have reached can only be seen as the very clearest indication of this Government's commitment to rectify the serious problems that we now have in the agricultural sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the Deputy's interruption, we have had to provide £35 million in July and a further sum of money between now and the end of the year to make up for what was not provided for in the budget of the last administration at the beginning of this year, because the provisions made in that budget were not sufficient to cover the expenditure that would have arisen under the programmes which we inherited at the change of Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will have a little patience he will get an answer to the questions which are obviously burning him up at the moment.  There is no doubt but that we did not make the money available only in regard to Kildare.  Some of the measures we took in the July supplementary budget have been aimed at dealing with some of the problems in agriculture and indeed at offsetting the effects on agriculture of some of the measures which we were obliged to take in the July budget.  One example of the <Col N="721" /> latter category is the fact that we have increased the flat rate pay-back in respect of VAT to farmers from 1 per cent to 1½ per cent.  The difference between the two is equal to the extra charge that would arise for farmers in this year, and indeed over the whole of next year, from the fact that some of their inputs now bear a higher rate of VAT than they did previously.  This increase in the flat rate pay-back is designed to ensure that extra VAT, which is not intended to be a tax on production, does not fall on production.  That is the reason we have increased the flat rate pay-back.  In addition to that, and in recognition of some various specific difficulties which have been found in the agricultural sector for some time past, we have reduced the rate of VAT on contractors' charges from 10 per cent to 3 per cent, a measure also provided for in the Bill before us.  This is a measure which will relieve farmers of some of the burden of harvesting charges, preparation charges, sowing charges and so on, because at the end of the day the bill which the contractor would have to charge the farmer would be reduced compared to what it would have been had we not made that change in the VAT rate.</P>
      <P>Another measure which we have provided for since coming into office is a substantial increase in the sheep headage grants in the disadvantaged areas and in the designated sheep areas.  We have increased the subsidy to £9.50 per ewe for the first 150 ewes in the flock to £6.50 for each of the next 50 ewes.  That is a measure which will have a very substantial effect on farm incomes in those areas. Although not being directly designed as a measure to aid production, because it is paid under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, which is basically an income transfer scheme to the disadvantaged areas, I would think nevertheless that one of the effects of it would be further to add to the confidence which exists now in the sheep industry and I would hope that it will assist in securing further expansion in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have provided also in this year funds to operate here the EEC scheme of interest subsidies for developing farmers. Our estimate is that the total cost of this <Col N="722" /> measure this year will come to some £5 million.  That subsidy is payable on foot of interest payable on loans outstanding for investments carried out under the Farm Modernisation Scheme.  All of those who are now working on plans drawn up under the Farm Modernisation Scheme, the development farmers who are working on the basis of those plans, will qualify for that interest subsidy to the extent of taking out loans and there are amounts outstanding in respect of loans for investment activities eligible for grants under the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    <P>It is also my intention to bring forward in the very near future a parallel interest subsidy measure which will apply to farmers other than developing farmers, farmers in the commercial category, broadly along the same lines for the same kind of loans so that we will have the same kind of measure applying to the non-development farmers as we have under the EEC scheme for development farmers. Those two measures will provide a substantial relief for many of the farmers concerned who are now having some difficulties in meeting repayments on loans they have taken out for farm development.</P>
    <P>It is not my contention &mdash; it would be idle to pretend otherwise &mdash; that these schemes will solve the credit problems being encountered by farmers.  That is certainly not the case.  There is a substantial number of farmers throughout the country whose problems in relation to the repayment of development loans of one kind or another are so big that the interest subsidies I have just mentioned, the EEC scheme and the parallel national scheme, will not meet their problems.  A different approach is required in the case of farmers who find themselves in that position.  I am working on this matter at the moment.  We are having consultations with the lending institutions.  I hope before long we will arrive at a series of measures which will allow positive action to be taken in the case of farms which are essentially in a viable situation but because of the rapid increase in interest rates in recent years now find themselves in a position where the interest burden of <Col N="723" /> development loans is not currently bearable.</P>
    <P>All of these measures are designed to respond to problems which have not simply emerged this year but which go back some time into the past.  There has been a series of developments which have brought us to the point where we now have a serious farm increase crisis.  We have had, on the one hand, rapid inflation for a number of years which inevitably has had its effect on the level of farm imput costs.  In addition to that, that rapid rate of inflation has put pressure on the living costs of farm families just as it has put pressure on the living costs of families involved in every other sector of economic activity.  We have had a slower rate of price increase in terms of the prices realised by farmers for their products than the rate of cost increase so that we have had a classic cost price squeeze in the farming sector.  We have also had the factor I have just mentioned, a rapid rise in interest rates.  We now have a situation where difficulties in farming have been compounded by a cost price squeeze and a situation in which rates of interest now payable on development loans are far higher than the rates of interest prevailing when those development loans were taken out.  I am sure Members of the House will appreciate that a plan which is profitable and economic when money is available at 10 per cent or 12 per cent rapidly loses its profitability when the cost of that borrowed money increases to 17 per cent or, as we have seen in some cases lately, to almost 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>That situation is not one that has emerged only this year.  It has been building up for at least two and a half years.  It has certainly been building up for the two and a half years during which farm incomes have been declining in real terms.  In 1979 and 1980 taken together we had a 45 per cent reduction in overall farm incomes in real terms.  That is looking at the situation before any adjustment is made to take account of the cost of servicing debt for farm development.  It would be idle and misleading on my part to try to pretend that that situation can be resolved in a very short time.  It certainly <Col N="724" /> cannot be resolved in the space of a few months.  The measures we have set out in our programme are designed to counter that problem and to alleviate parts of that problem.  We will continue with the implementation of those measures.</P>
    <P>Some of those measures have been set out in the programme for Government. Those which will come most immediately to mind are the incentives we have provided for in that programme for re-stocking.  There is a subsidy of £100 on each additional calved heifer in herds in June next year over and above the level of June this year.  I hope to be able finally to announce this in the very near future. That is one of the measures we propose to take.  It is designed to help restore confidence in farming and in bringing back into focus the basic point which all of us need to bear in mind when looking at our agricultural problem, which is that the whole economy of the country needs buoyancy in agriculture and that measures we can take in order to put buoyancy back in to agriculture, in order to restore the level of confidence in agriculture, are ones which are vital not only for our farming population and for the population of our rural towns but vital for our economy as a whole because so much of our industrial fabric is bound up in one way or another with the business of farming.</P>
    <P>We will proceed to implement those programmes and in addition we will continue with the efforts we are making to have specific measures adopted at national level and at the level of the European Community, which will respond to our problems and, even more importantly, we will continue in the efforts which have been carried out in recent weeks by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and by myself to ensure that there are no changes in agricultural policy at European level which would be detrimental to the basic interests of this country.  I am sure in that particular respect the procedure we are following, the view we are taking, the points we are putting across are ones which would have the agreement of all sides of the House because I believe we all recognise that a <Col N="725" /> continuation of the kind of policies which we have been accustomed to and which we have built our system to respond to in relation to agriculture are important for the well-being of our agricultural sector and for our economy.</P>
    <P>The next point I will refer to is the Government's commitment to easing the burden of inflation.  One of the areas in which we need to take action in this respect is to take whatever action we can to relieve some of the burden of uncontrolled public expenditure on our taxation system, on our ability to use the funds we have at our disposal, and to relieve, where we can, a part of the burden of this on the ordinary taxpayer, whatever kind of taxes he is paying, PAYE, VAT or excise duty.  We are all in it together.  It is essential for the further development of economic activity that we succeed in that kind of action.</P>
    <P>One of the main influences in keeping people out of jobs, and in depressing the level of activity on farms and other productive enterprises, is the high rate of inflation which we have seen over a period of years.  Unless we can get that under control we can do very little to improve our prospects of employing our own people and being able to compete abroad in markets where we must sell and on our own home market with products imported from abroad.  That is a central feature of this Government's programme and we will continue with it energetically because it responds to the needs of all the productive sectors of our economy.</P>
    <P>There was some discussion recently on the decision we made some weeks ago on the exchange rate of our currency in the EMS system.  It was said in a number of quarters that we should have decided at that point to devalue the central rate of our púnt, and that consequently we should have devalued the green rate of our punt and that, as a result of that course of action, we would have had a possibility of increasing farm prices and of moving to some extent in the direction of alleviating our serious farm income problems.  I do not dispute, nor would the Government as a whole dispute, the fact that, were we in a position to devalue <Col N="726" /> our green rate, certain benefits would necessarily follow in the agricultural sector.  The essential point is that that is only a partial view of the situation.  An overall devaluation of our currency would bring with it a number of inflationary pressures with which, at this point, we feel it would not be appropriate to burden the economy and which would have their effects on the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>At this time of the year in many important sectors of agriculture we are at a low point so far as production is concerned. In a number of sectors&mdash;and the milk sector is only one&mdash;we would have to wait for some time before the benefits in terms of price increases and increases in guarantees became real to any significant extent.  Equally we are at a time when farming is sensitive to cost increases.  We are coming to&mdash;and in some parts of the country we are at&mdash;the cultivation season and for certain crops we are at the very beginning of the cultivation season.  We are at a point in the year where inputs are going into farming and where expenditure is being incurred on inputs for next year's production season.</P>
    <P>To the extent that those inputs are sensitive to cost increases arising abroad, whether through price increases abroad or as a result of a devaluation on our part, we would pay the penalty immediately. While the beneficial effects of such a move on agriculture would not come immediately, some of the ill-effects of such a move on agriculture would probably come sooner.  For that reason, and having regard to the wider and more general inflationary results which would have followed at that point from a devaluation, the Government took the decision that we would maintain our central rate.</P>
    <P>It has also been said in a number of quarters that, even in the context of maintaining the central rate of our currency, as we did on that occasion, nevertheless we should have devalued our green exchange rate.  That does not seem to me&mdash;and I am quite sure it would not seem to our Community partners&mdash;to be in any way an appropriate response to the situation.  Over a period of years successive Governments here have followed a policy of bringing the green exchange <Col N="727" /> rate of our currency into line with the market rate.  Normally that meant we were bringing down our green exchange rate because the market exchange rate of our currency was going down and we were making sure that the green rate caught up in a sense with the downward slope of the market rate.</P>
    <P>At a time when our market rate has been maintained more or less, at the pre-adjustment level, to say that we should devalue our green rate and deliberately bring it further away from the market exchange rate is not the kind of policy which would commend itself to our partners in the Community.  It would be exactly the reverse of the kind of policy which successive Governments here have been promoting over the past eight years since we joined the European Community.  That is one aspect of the situation where, in the context of this debate, a further exposition of the Government's views was appropriate.</P>
    <P>We are not entirely alone in the measures we want to take in the agricultural sector.  A number of measures are open to us in the context of our membership of the European Community.  When we are constructing our approach to the fixing of European prices for the coming year my concern will be to include among those measures any measure which is appropriate for inclusion in that kind of package and which holds out a promise of making a substantial dent in the kind of farm income problem we are dealing with now.  We have included some of these measures in our programme.  I have no doubt that other measures will be included, and that other measures will be found to be useful in the context of that kind of discussion.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that, not only in the context of price fixing but in the more general context of the discussion now going on, culminating in the European Council meeting towards the end of November, my concern and the Government's concern will be to make it quite clear that we expect the European Community to continue to live up to the obligations they undertook and the obligations <Col N="728" /> we saw very clearly as being there when we joined the Community.</P>
    <P>Finally I want to make the point&mdash;coming back in a sense to where I started&mdash;-that the kind of measures open to us in the agricultural sector and in other sectors of the economy may be wide, but proper management requires that we make the right choices as between different measures.  I want to repeat the point I made at the beginning that the previous Government showed themselves unable to make these choices and for that reason we are now obliged to include in our calculations measures which will allow us to wipe out or even to keep up with the burden of debt with which they saddled us for non-productive purposes.</P>
    <P>Within the constraints imposed by that situation we will take all the measures open to us in order to respond to the economic problems we face at the moment and to deal with what I repeat is a very serious income crisis in the farming sector, one which has extremely grave implications not only for our farming population but also for people in country towns and for all the people working in industries which depend directly or indirectly on agriculture.  We are determined to take all measures open to us to get over that problem.  We will proceed with the measures in our programme and other measures which may be put forward to us or which we may develop ourselves as being legitimate responses to that problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker indicated that they had a distinct advantage over our Government in the last Dáil.  He said his Government were able to make decision which we are unable to make.  However, we were united in the decisions we made, viewing the problem from every angle.  We felt the decisions we took were the correct ones, and they will prove to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were two big questions facing the people before the last election.  Leaving aside idealism and nationalism, these were employment and inflation.  Those matters engaged the attention of the people.  They engaged the attention of one of the partners in the Coalition to the <Col N="729" /> extent that they had a slogan: &ldquo;We want jobs, not promises&rdquo;.  That poster is still hanging on poles in my parish.  I think I shall take it down and put it among my souvenirs.  I challenge anyone to point out anything the Government have done since their term in office that has improved the situation with regard to jobs and inflation.  If anyone has anything to offer in that regard, now is the time to do so.  I cannot find anything they have done to reduce inflation or create jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister renewed his commitment to reduce the burden of taxation.  Nothing has been done to reduce the overall burden of taxation.  Moves have been made which increased inflation to the highest level we have experienced for many years.  I am aware of people who took a decision to provide themselves with a house and not ask their local council to do it.  Their mortgages were 13.15 per cent last March.  Now they find they have a mortgage of 16.25 per cent.  These people were prepared to make a sacrifice and find £50 a week to house themselves. They may not be developing farmers but people trying to set up a home.  They need help.  When the Government are prepared to help people who have incurred big debts to increase their standard of living, they have a duty to help those on the lowest rung of the ladder.</P>
    <P>People do not appreciate the significance of the increase in VAT, which will prove a heavy burden.  I heard the previous speaker say that conscious decisions of the Government added 5 per cent to annual inflation.  I believe that is correct.  I would remind the Minister for Agriculture that before the election we met representatives of the IFA.  At that stage Deputy MacSharry was bringing home considerable benefits every week in what we called the Brussels package. I got the impression that they were inclined to dismiss these and that their main concern was for the future of farming and the problem of how to counteract the galloping inflation we appeared to have no answer for.  I was asked to what level did I feel this inflation could be reduced, inflation that affects inputs and inbuilt costs which effectively would make our products less competitive <Col N="730" /> abroad.  I felt that, because we import about 6 per cent of our inflation and have no control over it, with good management we might be in a position in three years of sensible, steady Government to reduce the annual rate of inflation to 12 per cent.  That did not appeal to the farmers I met from Kildare on that occasion and they seemed to be unhappy with anything Fianna Fáil had to offer.  I do not know what they were told by the parties in Opposition at that time.  Since they were so ready to make promises in other directions, I am sure the farmers received some too.  What possibility is there that in two and a half years' time the inflation rate will be brought down to anything like 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>When we look at the problems of inflation and employment we can see the differences in approach between this Government and the previous one in the attitudes displayed in the television appearance some nights before the election of Deputies FitzGerald and Haughey.  I have no doubt who won the debate.  Everyone is in doubt about who won the election.  Certainly the people did not win it.  Deputy Haughey displayed a certain human sympathy in his approach.  I felt that the man who was so glib with his figures, book-keeping and economics would have a business like economic approach to his problem.  That was to be seen in the budget brought in shortly after the new Government took office.  It was a public relations budget.  It was strictly a book-keeping exercise.  I did not see any consideration given to human relationships.  They took second place.  The middle way pointed out by our Government is possibly the best way to operate.  If it is necessary in a recessionary period to borrow to provide jobs and plan for the future, one has a duty to borrow.  Those who tell me that because we are borrowing today we are placing an impossible burden on future generations might do well to remember that the present generation of young Irelanders deserve a chance and those leaving school deserve a chance.  If needs be, should we not borrow to try to help them find jobs?</P>
    <P>On the day the budget was introduced we were treated to an instant appraisal of <Col N="731" /> our finances by the Taoiseach.  He told us he had a quick look at the books and was amazed at the situation we were in.  If one read that in a novel one would say it was a poorly constructed plot.  It lacks credence.  Nobody believed it.  It is an indication of a poorly designed plot to prove to the people that any strict measures which the Government had to take were because of the condition in which the previous Government left the country.  Our party was to be blamed for leaving a huge debt behind it.  People ask me, and it is an indication that the seeds that were sown germinated to a certain extent in their minds, if Fianna Fáil were in today would things be any better?  I can say that they would be better.  Conscious but petty decisions have been taken by the Government.  While certain moneys have been recouped certain other moneys were thrown away.  I am confident that the only reason for the reintroduction of car tax on vehicles of less than 16 horse power was that Fianna Fáil had abolished tax on such vehicles.  I am confident, too, that the increases in petrol prices would not have been sanctioned at that time by a Fianna Fáil Government. These impositions have hit hardest those motorists who are lucky enough to have jobs and who are prepared to drive up to 30 and 40 miles to work and home again each day, whether they be employed in the building trade in Dublin or elsewhere.  They are very many such people in the counties surrounding Dublin.  No Government have yet designed an income tax code that would give relief to those people for the money spent travelling to and from work whereas others in more lofty professions&mdash;people who do not have to wear smocks and who do not have calloused hands&mdash;are in a position to write off such expenses against their tax free allowances, thereby saving themselves a considerable amount of money.</P>
    <P>Some of the measures taken in the July budget would indicate that there is a vendetta of some kind against the motor industry though I expect that some Members on the Government side are involved in that industry.  We must now <Col N="732" /> have what is the dearest motoring in Europe.  I would not be too concerned about the increases in drink and cigarette prices because while these may be tough for the public there is a choice in that regard whereas very few motorists have any such choice.  There is very little motoring for pleasure.  That is an activity that is fast disappearing.  If the Government consider it necessary to abolish the various subsidies and to reintroduce car tax in order to bring in a few million pounds and if it was necessary to put more tax on petrol, why do they have to throw away £400 million merely to let it be seen that they are keeping a rash promise made to the electorate?</P>
    <P>The Government tell us that they made conscious decisions as to what should be done but in regard to one item at least they do not have the backing of all their people.  I refer to the promise to pay £9.60 per week to the stay at home wife. As I said before the election, most people on hearing that proposal, assumed that the money would be paid to all stay at home wives.  I hope that the Government manage to stay together long enough to enable them to bring in the next budget when people will realise that if 300,000 women will receive this payment, there will be about three times as many who will not get it.  I regard the proposal to take £9.60 per week from a husband's wages and to post it to his wife as an insult to family relationships.  Most married couples work together to make their marriages a success.  They share their resources but they share also the difficulties.  If there is the odd case of a husband who will not give his wife a fair amount of housekeeping money it is unlikely that the Government's measure will remedy such situations because the husband would be likely to stop a similar amount from the housekeeping money as that paid by the Government to his wife.</P>
    <P>Apart from throwing money away in the ways I have described, there is the question of reducing the basic income tax rate from 35p to 25p.  That is a proposal which does not appear to have received a unanimous welcome among the Cabinet having regard to the fact that the Tánaiste was not aware of its being made <Col N="733" /> public and on coming home from one of his many trips abroad thought the matter was still open for discussion.  My advice to the Government is that if they have £400 million to throw away there are better ways of spending it than they suggest.  They should give a little to those whom they have persecuted.</P>
    <P>On the question of employment, I am aware that apart from the lack of commitment on the part of the Government to reducing unemployment there is a cutback in jobs.  I am familiar with a simple case involving a job that was done on the Curragh by four employees of the Department of Defence.  One of those people died early this year and has not been replaced with the result that three people are now doing the work of four and when one of these is on holidays, two are doing the work of four.  Despite the fact that a recommendation for a replacement has been sent to the Minister and that the interview board have decided on a suitable replacement, the fourth employee has not been replaced.</P>
    <P>I am disturbed by the murmurings I hear through the grapevine regarding the forestry Department.  In this Department, more than any other, it is necessary to have long-term planning.  The Department must continue to built up a land bank and to plan ahead.  Even if they wish to increase the acreage under planting there must be planning.  We cannot afford to have valley periods but if we have them we will feel the resulting pinch in about 20 years time.  As Minister in charge of that Department I had a mandate from the Government to buy all the land possible.  The money was there for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Resulting from a recent development whereby an industry from Oregon intended basing itself here for the purpose of utilising the timber thinnings that would become available during the next ten years and beyond&mdash;these were thinnings for which we did not have a market a year ago&mdash;we had a commitment to that firm regarding suitable roads in forests and the availability of the more sophisticated harvesters to allow us to extract 300,000 tonnes of thinnings each year.  I suspect strongly that there has been a big <Col N="734" /> cutback in that regard.  The American firm concerned asked me if I could give them an assurance that the planned continuity of our forestry programme would not be interfered with.  Having looked back on the records I assured them that at no time did any Government, even the two previous Coalitions, effect any dilution in the amount of money and effort being put into our forestry programme. However, I fear that the present cutbacks will undo all the good that has been done up to now.  Our history in afforestation must be considered a success story.  If an exile who had returned home after spending, say, 40 years away, were to ask me for an indication of how we have used our freedom, I would show him the State forests.</P>
    <P>However, if the Cabinet have decided that no money is to be found or that there would be a cutback and that there is a possibility that 500 forestry workers would be laid off before the winter, that is a grave mistake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the action of the Coalition parties in maintaining a policy of dual membership of Dáil Éireann and the European Assembly.</P>
      <P>There is an amendment which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>notes that when the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities is being established the Government proposes to ask both Houses that its terms of reference should require it to examine again and report on the question of Dual Membership <Col N="735" /> of Dáil Éireann and the European Assembly and to consider and report on the relations between the Irish representatives in the European Assembly and the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The motion speaks for itself.  On the amendment, I am sorry that the Minister Deputy Desmond, has left the House because he and I were on this very committee in 1975 and a report in regard to dual membership was adopted as far back as that.  It was a very far-seeing report in that both Deputy Desmond and myself amongst others made positive contributions as practising politicians to the real problems involved in the dual mandate and the impossibility of operating membership of the two Houses simultaneously and effectively.  Time has proved the view expressed by the committee in 1975 to be correct.  It is superfluous at this stage to have an amendment put down by the Government asking the committee to look at this matter again when the committee reported categorically in their report of 4 June 1975 in paragraph 10, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Under the present Treaties, members of the European parliament must be members of their national Parliaments.  The draft Convention provides that &ldquo;membership of the European Parliament shall be compatible with membership of a Parliament of a Member State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The conclusion was:</P>
    <P>The experience of the members of the Joint Committee who are also members of the present European Parliament suggests that dual membership will, in fact, be difficult to sustain particularly when the powers of the European Parliament are extended.</P>
    <P>That was in a very limited parliament in which the members concerned were nominated members, where the workload was not 25 per cent of the workload of the present parliament, where the membership was less than half the membership of the present parliament and where the <Col N="736" /> number of committees has been increased substantially in the present parliament.  There is a growing and positive view within the Community that some form of real function must be assigned to the parliament to work in conjunction with committees so that there can be real pooling of political views and Commission views within the Community to bring to bear on Council decisions.</P>
    <P>We adopted an enlightened attitude in 1975 and the report is there.  I see very little need for further examination of the matter at this stage because all the factual evidence and all the data in regard to the matter were collated, collected and dealt with in that report.  There is no point in having the sort of padding that we have in this amendment.  It is quite evident that the dual mandate representing two parliaments at the one time is impossible from the physical, mental and work points of view and from any aspect that one can care to mention.  It is evident that the members seeking to perform the two functions in Dáil Éireann and the European Parliament are in effect not performing each of these functions effectively, and cannot do so.  This is not a reflection on the members concerned.  It is a physical and mental impossibility to apply oneself to one's committee work fully in the European Parliament in its regular plenary sittings and its much more regular committee meetings, to make a real and positive contribution that means something, and at the same time maintain membership of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I take it that the House is fully aware of the way the European parliament works, and the members here will bear me out.  It is primarily a committee-style Parliament.  It works very much on the European system in which very great emphasis is placed on committees. Committee-type work can be long, painstaking, arduous, a matter of detail and time-absorbing above all else.  It requires reflection, study and research if one is to make a real contribution.  In the committee-style structure of the European parliament if worked properly by the members to the fullest extent of their membership of these committees along with the regular plenary sittings that are <Col N="737" /> running now at least one full week per month, apart from the committee meetings that take place every other week and meetings of the groups to which members belong on top of that, one faces a situation of either a committee meeting or two committee meetings every week apart from the plenary session that will take place right through a work week at least once a month.  This is the sort of workload that, taken with the travelling and, in particular, with the precarious position of the present balance of membership within this Dáil, makes it absolutely impracticable, ludicrous and ridiculous in the extreme to maintain any semblance of dual membership.</P>
    <P>I say this particularly in regard to political parties.  The arguments that I am putting forward are not as cogent in regard to independant members who are in a special category.  In regard to political parties, the two parties represented in the Coalition Government and my party as the Opposition party have a very important function to carry out in maintaining the House here, in maintaining the business of the Dáil and in ensuring that that business goes through and that people are here for votes when they arise and to make contributions in debates in this House.  Members of this House cannot engage in the two processes at the one time.  They cannot maintain the sort of workload that I have mentioned in regard to the European parliament and at the same time play their part within the political party system that is designed to make our democracy within this parliament here effective.</P>
    <P>What did Fianna Fáil do about this? We did one very practical thing.  Before the last general election with all of this in mind the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary party met.  We had a full meeting and we are on record as issuing our decision subsequently before the general election campaign started.  It was a specific statement that as far as we were concerned after the general election we would not allow any of our Deputies to continue in a dual mandate situation.  The decision was that they could opt after the general election as to whether they would stay in the Dáil or continue in the European parliament. <Col N="738" /> That was the position facing our members before the general election campaign started, before the writ was moved here for the general election.  Deputies Davern, Cronin, de Valera and Lalor, four out of our five members, were faced with that decision.  It did not apply to ex-Deputy Flanagan as obviously the dual mandate aspect did not apply to him.  In regard to our four members, all of them eligible Dáil candidates, after considerable deliberation among themselves and in consultation with their colleagues within the parliamentary party, Deputies Cronin, Davern and Lalor all decided in good time to vacate their Dáil seats and stay in the European Parliament.  They announced their intention to vacate their Dáil seats to us, the parliamentary party, and they informed their local organisation within their constituencies that they would not stand for the Dáil, that they would instead concentrate on the single mandate, the work of the European Parliament for which they were elected.</P>
    <P>The former Deputy de Valera knew the consequences of her action.  She decided, in accordance with a party decision, to wait until after the general election.  It was made quite clear to her that if she was successful in the general election she would have to give up membership of the European Parliament and a by-election would have to be declared or, a casual vacancy declared, as the phrase is in section 15 of the Act dealing with this matter which was passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The former Deputy de Valera contested the election on the basis that she was seeking a Dáil seat.  If successful in the Dáil she was going to resign her European seat by decision of the parliamentary party or, if she was in breach of that decision, she would face expulsion.  She decided to run for the Dáil and, in the event of succeeding, was bound by our parliamentary party decision to cease forthwith membership of the European parliament.  A casual vacancy would be declared and filled by the Fianna Fáil Party, as has been filled by the Labour Party in regard to their casual vacancies that have arisen since the general election.  The former Deputy de Valera did not succeed in gaining <Col N="739" /> a seat in the general election and has opted, naturally in those circumstances, to stay in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>That is the clean, clear-cut situation in regard to the Fianna Fáil Party, and is a responsible attitude in regard to this matter.  It contrasts sharply with the situation in the other political parties.  I am not referring to Independents.  Three out of four Fine Gael Members are trying to limp along as members of the two Parliaments.  Deputy O'Donnell, Deputy Ryan and Deputy McCartin know in all honesty and integrity that it is an impossible task to perform fully their functions of the European parliament and perform their functions contemporaneously and simultaneously in this Parliament.  It is just not possible on any criterion that one might adopt.  Deputy Clinton made an honourable decision to go strictly for the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>However, the situation was compounded even further by the Labour Party which had a chance since the election to do something positive and constructive in regard to the dual mandate which was, quite frankly, becoming a scandal.  I use the word advisedly.  The Labour Party, since the election, has had four seats to fill.  It has filled two of them from regular, practising Members of this House, Deputy Pattison and Deputy Treacy.  The other two, former Deputy Cluskey and former Deputy Horgan, are not Members of this House.  The Labour Party have two out of four who are working TDs in this House and also pretending to function as members of the European Parliament or vice-versa, working members of the European Parliament and pretending to function in this Parliament. The Fine Gael Party have three out of their four members in the same invidious position.  We made the right decision and our five members are members solely of the European Parliament.  The situation will remain that way as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned because we have complete party commitment to this.</P>
    <P>This is not just a Fianna Fáil attitude. It is the progressive, considered attitude of most parliamentary parties within national parliaments and it is the considered <Col N="740" /> opinion of all the groups within the European Parliament also that, to the greatest extent possible, we should move in the direction of having specialised membership of national parliaments and the European Parliament and should avoid the obvious anomaly of dual membership.  To this extent there has been positive movement within the European Parliament itself and, of the total of 410 members of the European Parliament, only 125 are now members of a House of the national parliament and members of the European Parliament.  Almost 75 per cent of the members already are specialists in the work of the European Parliament and concentrate on one job within the European Parliament.  Unlike their counterparts in Britain, the Irish Labour Party have not followed the trade union principle of one man one job.  The British Labour Party have adopted a positive policy in this respect within the European Parliament.  Any member of that party who opts for the European Parliament has to concentrate on the work of that assembly and ceases to be a member of the House of Commons.  The British Labour Party are adopting a policy of a single mandate.  Most of the Conservative Party members are in a similar category. Most members of political parties who are working out the implications of this within the whole Community system at national and European level agree with this to the extent that only 25 per cent of the members, and that includes a number of Independents, are now operating as members in both the national and the European Parliaments.  The trend is obviously in that direction.  That is why we condemn the action of the Coalition parties in maintaining a policy of dual membership of Dáil Éireann and the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The institutions of the State here and the institutions of the European Community are being brought into disrepute. There is a way out.  In the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EEC, there is a positive recommendation that we can meet the obvious flaws and weaknesses by allowing for a right of audience on the part of members of the European Parlia- <Col N="741" /> ment in this House.  That is one of the matters recommended by the Committee in 1975 which I unhesitatingly support.  It is only right and proper that there should not be a complete cut-off between the members of the European Parliament representing our interests in Europe and this Parliament.  They should have a right of audience but not a right of vote or representation in respect of a Dáil constituency, but certainly a right of audience in this House or in the other House. That is a positive recommendation which I should like to put subject to whatever amendments of rules of procedure would be necessary.</P>
    <P>This is a matter in which we should behave with a certain amount of dignity and decorum.  We should look on it as a practical problem which has to be faced. We cannot allow this situation to continue.  We can maintain a link along the lines I have mentioned by giving our European Parliament members a right of audience and, of course, they will continue to have the right of membership of our respective political parties.  By maintaining that link through our political parties and through a right of audience in this House, there would be a sufficient flow of information and communication from them in regard to the European activities and a fertilisation of knowledge as to what is going on nationally and in Europe between the members of both the European Parliament and this Parliament.</P>
    <P>That is a practical way forward.  I reiterate that that recommendation is contained in the 1975 report.  It is my considered view that, as a small country, it is important that our 15 members of the European Parliament of 410 members really function in top gear.  Bigger countries, with their large bureaucracies, administrations, influence and finance will not depend, as does a small country, upon the quality, calibre and attention to work which can be given by members in the European Parliament.  I am not doubting any of the members of the European Parliament in that respect, I emphasise that.  There is nothing personal in this amendment.  All these 15 members of the European Parliament <Col N="742" /> could give that type of attention and dedication, as well as their energy and time fully to it, and represent Ireland well, if they were not also Members of this House.  The effect, from the national point of view, of our 15 members can be maximised by their putting the fullest possible input into the work.  That argument in Ireland's case is ten times stronger and more important than in the case of any other country in the Community and certainly much more important than in the case of the larger countries which have other areas of influence available.  We must use whatever influence we have in our limited way to the maximum extent.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes that when the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities is being established the Government proposes to ask both Houses that its terms of reference should require it to examine again and report on the question of Dual Membership of Dáil Éireann and the European Assembly and to consider and report on the relations between the Irish representatives in the European Assembly and the House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments for the against the dual mandate have been rehearsed many times, recently in this House in the debate on the nominations of Deputies Pattison and Treacy.  For a variety of reasons the desirability of maintaining the dual mandate has been questioned in the past.  Perhaps insufficient thought has been given to the consequences of its removal and, in particular, in the event of removal, to the effect on relations between the Irish MEPs and the Oireachtas.  I will deal with that subject in more detail later.  Deputy Lenihan has referred in his speech to one possibility which was discussed in 1975 as to what the linkage <Col N="743" /> between the MEPs and the Oireachtas should be.  That was one suggestion and there are a number of others to which I will refer later.  On that point, it should be made clear that the Joint Committee have, even since 1975, not accepted the inevitability of the ending of the dual mandate.  In 1980 they were suggesting an amendment to the Standing Orders to provide that representatives in the Assembly of the European Communities who are also Members of either House be notified of meetings and be allowed to attend and take part in proceedings, without having the right to vote.  That was a different aspect of the problem which was under discussion last year.  The origin, of course, of the dual mandate predates the election of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage.  The European Parliament was then entirely composed of members of national legislatures delegated to it by those parliaments.  The result was that the dual mandate among European parliamentarians was universal until direct elections were held for the first time in 1979.  Direct elections to the European Parliament also marked, as it were, the coming of age of that parliament and encouraged a healthy desire to see that parliament move away from any suggestion of tutelage by national legislatures.</P>
    <P>In considering the motion and the amendment, it is relevant to refer to the present position in other member states. Deputy Lenihan has done this.  I accept that it is clear that the process of phasing out the dual mandate has begun.  At the same time, it is relevant to point out that only two member states out of the ten have, in fact, totally dispensed with the dual mandate.  The Dutch, while it is permitted by their national legislation, have totally phased it out, and the Greeks, who, as new members, had direct elections recently, have legislation which prohibits the dual mandate, unlike our own.  They are the only two nations who do not have the dual mandate.  The other eight members, including ourselves, still operate it.</P>
    <P>The Act of the Council establishing the first direct elections to the European Parliament <Col N="744" /> does refer to the dual mandate. In fact, it states that membership of the European Parliament shall be compatible with membership of national legislatures. Generally speaking, therefore, where the dual mandate has been discouraged, this has been done through more or less informal arrangements by one or several political parties.</P>
    <P>While the dual mandate existed the relationship between the Oireachtas and the European Parliament was quite clear. Deputy Lenihan referred to this.  I was glad to note that he considered that it was important that there should be a relationship.  In the old days, members travelling to Europe were fully in touch with the atmosphere and mood of this Parliament. There was contact on a day to day basis with constituents&mdash;most of them were TDs.  At this time, this was valuable and helped them to formulate views they expressed in Europe on issues of concern to Ireland.  I accept that this involved a very heavy burden on TDs.  Perhaps Deputy Lenihan, on reflection, may feel that he does not give enough credit to members of all parties, including his own up to recently, who have carried the dual mandate since we joined the EEC in 1973.  The present position in regard to Ireland's MEPs is that each of the three main parties have members in the European Assembly who are not Members of the Dáil or Seanad.  In Fine Gael, Mr. Mark Clinton is not now a Member of the Oireachtas.  Similarly, in the Labour Party, as mentioned, neither Mr. Framk Cluskey nor Mr. John Horgan is a Member of the Oireachtas.  It so happens at this point in time that all the Fianna Fáil MEPs fit into this category&mdash;although one wonders whether this would have been the case had Miss Síle de Valera been successful in her bid to retain her Dáil seat.  In regard to the Independents, one, Mr. Neil Blaney, holds the dual mandate, while Mr. T.J. Maher is not a Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Members of the European Parliament who are not currently holders of the dual mandate do not have any right of access to either House of the Oireachtas.  Their sole links are party links.  However, one must also have regard to Irish members <Col N="745" /> of the European Parliament who are not members of any political party in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The problem of the dual mandate is central to the overall nature of the links that should exist between MEPs and the Oireachtas.  This, as mentioned was adverted to in 1975 by the Joint Committee.  In their view at the time it was desirable to give all members of the European Parliament rights of audience in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is one of a range of options being considered by the Government with a view to making the role of the European parliamentarian more effective.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm if I referred to some of the other options which the Government are considering as ways of giving members of the European Parliament the opportunity of closer association with the Oireachtas.  It is necessary to examine in depth any proposals for change in this area and the consequence thereof and this is the main reason why we think the matter is deserving of further consideration in the Joint Committee.  There must, of course, be no suggestion of diminution in the status of the MEP.  His or her status derives in the normal way from election. There ought to be no suggestion that this is an attempt to &ldquo;renationalise&rdquo; the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>What we must do is to establish clear channels of communication between the Members of the Oireachtas and the Irish members of the European Parliament, to the mutual advantage of both.  The need for such channels has, perhaps, been obscured by the existence of the dual mandate, and the advantages which, up to now, have been taken for granted. These will disappear if the dual mandate is phased put.  Our desire is to make arrangements to ensure that, whatever the circumstances, the informal, unrecognised but valuable benefits are retained.</P>
    <P>Any of the proposed solutions I will mention raise fairly basic issues of principle.  These will have to be the subject of inter-party consultation and I am sure that I can count on the goodwill of everybody to ensure that we reach a satisfactory outcome.  We may also, in due <Col N="746" /> course, need the views of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the suggestion that the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation made in its report on 4 June 1975 was that members of the European Parliament should have the right of audience on both Houses of the Oireachtas.  On reflection that is a far-reaching proposal and it is important that the Opposition should consider its implications, although it may be the right solution ultimately. There are serious questions arising from this.  For instance, should the rights of audience be general?  Should they be restricted and if so, in what way?  To take an extreme example: should an MEP be entitled to speak here about improving the roads in Connemara or West Cork? Is that the kind of thing the Opposition have in mind?  As I said, there are aspects that need to be teased out if that is the course the Members of this House and the MEPs, who are not Members of this House, feel is the best solution.</P>
    <P>Another possibility is to arrange for members of the European Parliament to be Members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EEC.  This, as Deputies know, was the position originally adopted by the Oireachtas when all the Members were dual mandate holders.  Subsequently the committee decided to exclude members of the European Parliament from membership of the committee.  The last committee suggested a modification of this to make it optional for political parties to nominate dual mandate holders to the committee.  This suggests that the committee saw merit in associating members of the European Parliament with the work of the committee.  This suggestion raises, as does the previous one, fundamental questions of principle concerning the involvement of non-members of the Oireachtas in the work of the Oireachtas. The implications of these suggestions must be further examined, if that course is considered the best in the event of the dual mandate ultimately being phased out.</P>
    <P>A further alternative which could be considered would be the establishment of a Joint Oireachtas &mdash; European Parliament <Col N="747" /> Consultative Committee which could meet a number of times a year. While this suggestion would confer benefits, they would clearly be less than those conferred when an integral relationship by virtue of the universal dual mandate existed.</P>
    <P>It will be clear therefore why the Government propose the amendment to this motion.  It is an area where I hope we can count on constructive co-operation from all parties and Members.  The role of the European Parliament is important in the decision-making process of the Community and these decisions have a very direct bearing on crucial areas in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The influence of the European Parliament is going to grow rather than diminish.  The proportion of Irish members is going to fall with the further enlargement of the Community.  Clearly, a beneficial two-way process between the Oireachtas and the European Parliament is highly desirable, especially if this process enhances the standing of Irish members in the parliamentary and party committees in Europe.  I would hope that the Opposition would recognise that further consideration on an all-party basis needs to be given to the nature of the global relationship which ought to exist between members of the European Parliament and the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The problem is, as I have already said, delicate precisely because, while establishing adequate and effective links between the two institutions, it is vital to preserve the actual and perceived integrity of both.</P>
    <P>That is the situation and I would urge the Opposition to further consider the situation.  I do not think this is a case of the Opposition having changed their position in the last few months and coming here and condemning the other parties for continuing the dual mandate, which may or may not continue much longer.  This is a continuing situation which exists in eight of the EEC member states.  I have tried to explain today that there are advantages as well as disadvantages to the dual mandate system.  If it is to be phased out we would wish to have some form of link which would in some <Col N="748" /> sense allow mutually beneficial contacts to be maintained.  As I said however, the nature of any such arrangements is a delicate question with political, practical and even legal overtones.</P>
    <P>The Opposition will be aware that the Joint Committee changed their mind on more than one occasion on whether MEPs should be members of that committee.  We do not want to move too quickly.  We would like to look at this question in its broadest context, on an all-party basis, with Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and with MEPs who are not members of any party, in the event of the dual mandate being phased out.</P>

Until such time as our Oireachtas Members have acquired, through divine inspiration or otherwise, the powers of bi-location, I must oppose the dual mandate because in my view it is beyond human endurance that a person should belong to the Oireachtas and the European Parliament at the same time.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;I do not claim that we are infallible; we are generally inspired &mdash; decided not to approve the dual mandate.  During the election our candidates gave a written undertaking that should he or she be elected to the European Parliament he or she would resign his or her seat in Dáil Éireann. This would be in the interests of the Oireachtas as well as the European Parliament.  In my opinion, dual membership demeans both institutions.  The Minister admitted that and the Government in their amendment admit the wisdom of our motion.  They admit there is cause for concern and appreciate that the situation must be reviewed.  We say that now is the time to carry out this review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last few weeks we heard disturbing rumours of what is happening on the European scene about neutrality, abortion and other serious problems. I doubt if our Members, even though they are very able people and good Members of both Parliaments, can keep these problems in proper perspective, if they <Col N="749" /> have to dash from Strasbourg, Luxembourg or Brussels to Dublin.  It is too much to expect them to give their best to both Parliaments.  I am all for EEC membership and believe in the future of the European Parliament.  That is why I want our European members to give their best to the debates in Europe.  They should not have to work in both parliaments. What would happen if they had a very important vote in this House and a very important decision to make in Europe? Which House would these Members serve?  Would they go to the continent to vote or would they stay here?  No matter what they do, they are bound to offend some school of thought and one institution will suffer by their absence.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party have no intention of allowing pairing for European Members because we think it would be wrong.  If we agreed to pairing we would be condoning membership of both Parliaments and this we cannot do.  I would like that to be fully understood.  It is not an attempt on our part to win a vote.  We want to bring home to these people the seriousness of the position in relation to dual membership.  There may be some excuse for people who were elected to both the Dáil and the European parliament but to our amazement we saw the Labour Party, when some of their members withdrew from the European Parliament on being appointed to the Government, appointing in their place sitting Deputies to the European Parliament. This caused grave concern in the Labour Party but it did not stop the hierarchy of that party from showing their contempt for this House by making these appointments.  Their attitude seems to be that this House does not need these Members and that they can do better in Europe. Perhaps they can, but they cannot serve two masters.  They are able people but not sufficiently able to carry two mandates.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to influence his colleagues to end this situation.  He made a brave attempt to justify it but in his heart he knew he did not succeed.  I believe he feels as I and Deputy Lenihan do on this issue.  He should put it to his colleagues that Fianna Fáil were quite <Col N="750" /> right in telling their members that if they opted for Europe they had to leave the Dáil.  This is the best policy.  The Minister has hinted that the dual mandate may not continue so why should it not now be ended?</P>
    <P>When we joined the EEC it was said that we were joining Europe.  Of course we were always part of Europe and as Europeans we wanted to play our full part in the European Assembly so that Europe would be prosperous and without the spectre of war which haunted it so often in the past.  The European parliament deserves Members who can give their full time to its deliberation so that it will develop in the right way and not to the detriment of this country.</P>
    <P>It takes all the time of a parliamentarian to do one job, whether here or in Europe.  The majority of us are fairly experienced parliamentarians and we realise the strain it can be to do one's work in this House in serving one's constituents and trying to be a legislator.  As one who claims to have no more than average intelligence, I have come to realise that one should do one job well not try to spread whatever talent one has over the European continent.  It may be said that parliamentarians from other countries have a dual mandate but that is their concern.  Our Parliament is comparatively new and we need all the talent we have concentrated here.</P>
    <P>There are many who would like to serve in the European Parliament and it is a mark of distinction to be elected there.  Those who succeeded in being elected are to be congratulated on their success but they should not push their luck too far by trying to serve two Parliaments.  It is almost impossible to do. Apart from mental ability, one would also need great physical strength to cope with all the travelling and workload involved.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to drop their rather weak amendment.  It endorses our stand but the Government cannot see their way to saying that the Opposition are right on this occasion.  Both Parliaments are suffering as a result of the dual mandate.  Democracy is the master of both but it is a fragile thing which must <Col N="751" /> always be nurtured.  We run the risk of bringing democracy into ridicule by appointing to the European Parliament someone elected to serve constituents in Dublin or Cork.  The people have no opportunity to endorse the candidature of those who have been appointed through this House to Europe.  They should have the means to express their verdict.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan has made the case very forcibly that we should end the dual mandate.  I hope that my contribution will help to focus attention on this problem.  We must not bury our heads in the sand.  The Government are well aware that there is a weakness in their case. They are immersed in dealing with great problems and they need all their Members here.  They have not so much ability on their benches that they can afford to send five or six people to Europe.  They should concentrate the energies of all their Members on domestic problems such as unemployment and the rising cost of living.  It must be very annoying to the unemployed to read of a Member of this House going off to solve the problems of Europe.  There are 140,000 people unemployed here and the rate of unemployment in Europe, except for two countries, is lower than here.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to end the dual mandate and withdraw their amendment.</P>

      <P>There are no standard guidelines, but the Chair will be following the normal practice of calling on speakers from the two main parties and then endeavouring to accommodate an Independent.  I have sought, and have received, the co-operation of Deputies McCartin and Briscoe, each of whom is prepared to forfeit five minutes so that I can allow Deputy Blaney to speak for 12½ minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that we should discuss this subject, but I suggest it might have been brought up by the present Opposition and discussed in good faith at a time when they themselves were in a position to make decisions.  It could have been brought up at a different time and an accommodation could have been found for the problem of having cross-representation in the two parliaments with a view to having an understanding between parliamentarians in the two Houses.  I would have accepted that as sincere.</P>
      <P>I understand a decision was made, as Deputy Moore has said, but after the direct elections the decision was rescinded temporarily.  If the outgoing Deputy Síle de Valera had been reelected to the Dáil we might well have seen the Opposition decision rescinded for a second time.  Deputy Lenihan knows what he is talking about.  I remember him being a Member of the European Parliament while he was Leader of the Opposition in the Seanad.  He tried to fulfil that role and I am not saying he did not do it adequately.  In the Seanad he made things as difficult as he could for the Government in office at that time; he went to Europe and he was a member of his shadow cabinet and of various committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers of the European Parliament have not changed since then&mdash;indeed it was a smaller parliament with smaller representation at that time.  At that time there was all the more need that every Member should have been present, because the EEC were growing and developing their policies&mdash;we must confess they are not doing so at the moment because we now find ourselves in a kind of cul-de-sac in Europe.  If Fianna Fáil felt so strongly at that time, why, instead of nominating to that Parliament Members <Col N="753" /> of the Seanad who had less responsibility than Members of the Dáil, did they say that Members of the Dáil should continue to be in Europe?  The responsibility to represent Ireland in the European Parliament was just as great then as now.</P>
    <P>Today Deputy Lenihan spoke about &ldquo;dignity, decorum and honour&rdquo;.  Was the representation given to Europe at that time by Fianna Fáil without dignity, decorum or honor?  Was Deputy Lenihan's representation then without dignity, decorum or honour?  He had a democratic mandate and he could have moved to the back benches of the Seanad where his responsibilities would have been less if he could not have done the two jobs properly.</P>
    <P>The Whip has indicated to us that we cannot get pairs because it is felt it would not be appropriate to the needs of the Dáil to allow us to go to Europe to fulfil the mandate given to us.  On the other hand, it is all right to keep us wandering in the corridors of this House for entire days, waiting for divisions while six or seven Fianna Fáil speakers, one after another, make identical points, marking time, looking at the clock to see how they can fill the hour, one speaker making the same point six or seven times.  Pairs had been offered through the years to people who did not want anything more than to go to the races, to go back to their own businesses, to attend funerals of people they had never known.  Today we have qualms of conscience to ensure that Deputies fulfil their mandate to those who elected them to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In many respects I would welcome a debate on this subject but I do not welcome this sort of make-believe, of hypocrisy.  The decisions were made by Fianna Fáil at a time convenient to themselves, without considering alternatives, without asking themselves what means should be established so that a proper relationship would exist between the two parliaments. I am not here making a case for the continuance of the dual mandate.  There is the question of whether it was honourable to continue with the dual mandate for two years and then suddenly, overnight, it becomes dishonourable at a time <Col N="754" /> when Fianna Fáil have not got anybody else to throw into that position.  It is not a reasonable approach to a discussion on this subject, and that is why we must make another opportunity to debate the matter in more reasonable circumstances.</P>
    <P>I remind the Opposition that in the European Parliament they are in partnership with a group.  Just like here, I appreciate the importance of political parties in Europe: if you do not belong to a political party you have not got real power.  Fianna Fáil are attached to a political party in Europe who set so little value on their mandate to represent their people in that parliament that they alternate: they send Members there for a year or 18 months, then they disappear and others are sent in.  It is just a perk or a holiday.  They are the group Fianna Fáil sit with in the European Parliament, a group who have no genuine belief in the European Parliament as an institution capable of being developed and making a contribution to Europe.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of insincere talk today about concern for giving the sort of representation that the Irish people deserve. I it is a difficult task but half of the argument represented by part-timers.  I do not think a person should give all his time to either parliament.  For years we saw this Parliament represented by part-timers.  I do not make any comment on that: I am just saying that that was the situation &mdash; farmers, business people, sometimes professors in universities, practising lawyers, occupied benches here but they could only give it part of their time.  We saw as Members of this House people who were members of health boards, county councils, local authorities of all kinds. They carried on business as well.  I do not know how they did it, but they were the people who represented us.  It is difficult to do the two jobs but I do not say that if you do the two jobs at the same time your performance will be less satisfactory.  We do not find it easy, but if you are prepared to work a seven-day week, like I am, not to take any holidays, to travel by night, it can be done.</P>
    <P>My group in the European Parliament is a very big one, so if the Irish members <Col N="755" /> of the group get their will accepted at a group meeting we can be assured of the backing of 110 Christian Democrats in the Parliament.  It is much more important for Fianna Fáil Members of the European Parliament to be there at all times because they are members of a group whose sole interest is the protection of the French position.  The Christian Democrats, with whom we sit, represent the interests of the peoples of Europe who believe, as we do, in the CAP, in European unity, in peace and Christian principles throughout Europe.  If we sometimes are not able to be there our interests are fully represented.  I can understand Deputy Lenihan's position because of the group they sit with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to come across as reasonable as possible in my contribution.  From the beginning Fianna Fáil have been consistently against the dual mandate.  When Fianna Fáil candidates first contested an election for the European Parliament it was clear that there was no way that if elected they could then resign their Dáil seats thus precipitating by-elections which would have been expensive.  It has been our approach from the beginning that those who sought election to the European Parliament and were successful would at the time of the next general election have to resign their seats in Dáil Éireann.  That was accepted by all members of our Party, including former Deputy Sile de Valera.  If the people of the country feel strongly about anything in this connection it would be the fact that the European Parliament is now being held out as a sinecure to failed Dáil candidates.  The two members of the Labour party who lost in their efforts to secure a seat in this House and were later appointed to the European Parliament do not have any mandate from anybody. They have not received even one vote from the people to go to Europe.  That is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government amendment is flannel to cover up a situation which is&mdash;we must be honest about this&mdash; a little embarrassing and uncomfortable for <Col N="756" /> them at present.  They are anxious that we should sit around the table and talk about this.  We know that only 25 per cent of the membership of the European Parliament have a dual mandate and that will be phased out over a period of time.  We should not be the last to do this.  Fine Gael and Labour Deputies on radio and television always call for a greater role in the legislative process here.  They feel that they are left out and would like to be more involved.  I do not know how they can claim this and at the same time expect to represent their Dáil constituents and also the multi-Dáil constituency which is their European constituency. This is not a viable task for anybody.</P>
    <P>I can understand Deputy McCartin getting a little hot under the collar about this because he is a member of both Parliaments.  I accept that he has a mandate to be here as well as in the European Parliament because he was elected to his House at a time when his constituents were aware that he was also a member of the European Parliament and would almost certainly continue to retain that membership.  However, I believe that when it comes to the next European elections his people will be looking for a different type of person to represent them.  Dual membership tends to reduce the currency of the European Parliament.  That Parliament has some very important work to do and there are always important issues coming before that body.  I wonder how many days Deputy McCartin has been able to spend in attendance at the European Parliament this month.  It is possible that it will be stated that he has not been able to attend because we would not give him a pair, but from the beginning we made it clear that we would not grant a pair to those holding dual membership after the election last June.  We are not going to pair people who are absent on European parliamentary business.  We are not going to shift from that position.</P>
    <P>It is clear to everybody what the issue is.  We have stated our opposition and we believe that ultimately the European Parliament will make its own ruling on this matter because it is at present being treated like a county council.  I suggest <Col N="757" /> that the Government have another look at this matter and act speedily to remove the dual mandate which they know is not correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to say that I was surprised that Deputy Lenihan was the mover of the motion but even more surprised at what he had to say.  He gave us all the reasons why there should not be dual membership and at a later stage gave a clear indication that Fianna Fáil took their decision as a party with all those good reasons in hand.  That is not my recollection and I am not a member of Fianna Fáil or any other party in this House.  The decision was reached for different reasons and did not have anything to do with one's capacity to represent a constituency here and represent a larger one in Europe.  I will not say anything more about that matter.  It is difficult to do both and it is true to say that in many cases, as constituencies differ within this Parliament, it is difficult in many cases as between one constituency and another to do the single job.  However, some Deputies do that single job better than others and there are Deputies who do the two jobs better than some can do the single job.</P>
      <P>We have heard talk about democracy but what has not been mentioned is the position of the electorate.  The members who contributed tonight did not mention the electorate.  It is for them to decide who goes to which Parliament.  It is for the electorate to decide at any given time who ceases to be a Member of this House and who ceases to go to Europe.  They are the people we represent and if that is their choice we must accept it.  We are talking through our hats when we refer to what we should or should not decide here or what a Joint Committee should decide.  The electorate made their decision and will make others.  They should be allowed make such decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the experience of members of the European Parliament, such as Deputies McCartin and O'Donnell, myself or Deputy Lenihan, who was a member of that Parliament in his time, so determines in our minds that we cannot do both jobs then we do not stand for some one or the <Col N="758" /> other but if our belief is that we can and we will stand for both then the electorate in the large and small constituency make the decision.  We are only wasting the time of the House talking about this matter, talking about a Joint Committee considering it and talking about the 1975 Committee.  We must talk about the electorate we represent because they are the people who must be satisfied.  We are merely there in their name and if they want any Member to represent them here and in Europe we are the last people who should take it upon ourselves to say: &ldquo;No, you, the electorate, have not the right to make such a choice.  We determine that someone who is a Member here cannot go to Europe on your behalf even though you may want him.&rdquo;  This is something the people will decide.</P>
    <P>Let us not waste the time of the Government or the Opposition, or anybody else's time, going into whether or not it can be done or how well it can be done. There are Members on both sides of the House who have had experience as Ministers in Government since we joined the EEC.  Let us take the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Everybody will agree that his job is a mighty task on its own.  But he also represents a constituency.  Anybody can check how long he also spends in Europe.  But would anybody say that the Minister for Foreign Affairs cannot do it and suggest appointing three people instead?  Nobody does because the man who carries that portfolio does so because he is elected by the people and represents the people in one way or another and, arising from that, he is appointed as Foreign Minister.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the Minister for Agriculture.  He is another Minister who spends a great deal of time abroad and at home on matters pertaining to the European Parliament, to the Commission, to the Council of Ministers.  The same applies to the Leader of the Government of the day.  Would anybody turn around and say that this is too much for one man and that if he is a TD and represents a constituency we will have to put somebody in his place if we make him Taoiseach?  That is the way it would have to be worked out and those positions are of <Col N="759" /> far greater importance and carry far more responsibility than the position of Members who are made dual representatives in this House and in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Ministers of this Government right up to the Taoiseach have these chores to do and I have not heard anybody say that the job should be split and that somebody should be appointed in place of the Taoiseach, that we should have a by-election and appoint somebody but leave the Taoiseach as Taoiseach.  The Constitution would have to be changed, but even if it was would it not be stupid?  It would be silly and if anyone proposed it he would be laughed out of the House.  What is being proposed here tonight is just as ridiculous.  Let the people that we represent, either in Europe or in this House, be the judges.  They are the people who are entitled to judge and we speak only in their name.  If they give us the mandate, dual or single, that is their right and it is not for us to take it from them.  So let us not allow ourselves to get bogged down in the merits or otherwise or the capacity or otherwise of any individual, because no two individuals have the same capacity and no two individuals with a dual mandate have the same problems and no two Members of this House representing the same constituency necessarily carry the same load.  We all know this from our experience.  Both Deputy Joe McCartin and I represent eight counties out of the thirty-two and in the national parliament represent large scattered constituencies where the population is all too low.  But I have been doing this for a while.  I found it difficult with a single mandate.  I found it even more difficult when I was in Government and had to look after a constituency and many other things as well.  But nobody ever said I could not to both.  One has to be one before one can become the other.</P>
    <P>But there is an outstanding problem recognised by everybody in Europe and that is the total lack of liaison between this House and the European Parliament. Instead of talking about doing away with the dual mandate &mdash; let the people decide on that and let the Members who fail to <Col N="760" /> go back for either one or the other decide that &mdash; we should be talking about giving every member representing us in Europe the right of audience and all other rights, except voting, in this House.  This would not be extraordinary; it would not be revolutionary; it would be common sense.  I would go further and say that in every quarter there should be a day set aside when matters pertaining to this country that transpire on the European scene, whether at Commission, Council of Ministers, Summit or parliament, can be reported back to this House and discussed here.  In this way this parliament, those of us who belong to both parliaments, those who do not belong to this parliament but belong to the European Parliament, can come in here and debate what has gone on on the European scene in the previous two or three months that affects us.  That is what we should be talking about rather than who can or who cannot carry the dual mandate.  That is the approach that I would like this House to take.</P>
    <P>The Government should consider this rather than setting up a committee to do so.  Who would be on such a committee? Where would they get the knowledge and how would they represent the people of the various constituencies, half a million people?  Yet the suggestion is to have a committee of a dozen or so people sitting down to determine whether or not the electors of any of the constituencies may elect a Member of this House to the European Parliament or <i>vice versa.</i> Leave it to the people and let them decide.  They are the people who will detect whether or not any of us have failed in either or both respects of our dual mandate.  They will be quick to detect this and they will give their answers and make the choice.  But the choice should be left open to them.  There is no harm in the people agreeing that any Member may be here and in Europe. Why should they not be allowed to have sent that person rather than somebody else?  It is they whom we represent and let us not forget that.  We tend to forget it.  We tend to think we are here as of right.  The only right we have derives from the people who sent us here.  The <Col N="761" /> right that we have to speak in the European Parliament derives from our people.  So let us not get into a tizzy because of a motion by Deputy Lenihan that we should not have a dual mandate. Until we find some other way of having proper liaison between the two elements we need the dual mandate.</P>
    <P>From my own short experience in the European Parliament I know that if we had no connection with this House we would be very far removed from it in so far as what is going on and in so far as what should be happening in Europe to keep in line with what we want as a national parliament.  It is vital that this thing should be put together rather than taken apart.  We are too far apart as it is. The dual mandate is a good thing.  If it is a virtue in Fianna Fáil not to have it and it is not for all these reasons that we were talking about tonight that that decision was made and that it was ultimately confirmed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Even if it was all virtuous on the part of Fianna Fáil to have made this decision, that is their prerogative; it is their right as a party to do this, but at the same time they are answerable to their own organisation and to their own instructors in denying those of the electorate who support them throughout the country the right to make their choice as electors of who they wish from the Fianna Fáil candidates to go to Europe.  Those in Fianna Fáil around the country are now debarred from voting for a man or woman who is a Member here to go to Europe or <i>vice versa.</i> This is what has happened by that virtuous decision taken a couple of years ago.  The other parties are not so virtuous as they did not take such a decision.  If Fianna Fáil had not taken such a decision they would be in government today.  Decisions are taken &mdash; this is the sort of one we will be taking if we pass this motion tonight &mdash; willy nilly without thinking, for the wrong reasons, and before they need be taken.  In politics, if one takes a decision before it must be taken it is not only <Col N="762" /> stupid but more ridiculous than one might imagine.  That virtuous decision taken by Fianna Fáil leaves them in opposition and the other parties in government today.  Was that a verdict from the people telling Fianna Fáil they should not have made such a silly decision?  If it was analysed it might well be, but whatever may be the reason I say to the parties on the Government's side they should not take a decision until they have to take one on this matter because they might find if they took the same decision as Fianna FÁil did they could change over again.  I know that Fianna Fáil think the parties in government will change over to the other side of the House for other reasons but that is another days' work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had some pyrotechnics from Deputy Blaney.  I want to emphasise one point.  We are staying with our decision in regard to being against dual membership of the European Parliament and Dáil Éireann.  We believe it is wrong to hold on to the two jobs; we believe the Member concerned who tries to do so is doing ineffective work in the European Parliament and ineffective work in the Irish Parliament.  I believe that anybody who thinks fully about the matter will have to agree with me that it is not just physically, mentally, or psychologically possible to give one's fullest energy and ability to full-time work in each of the parliaments to the maximum benefit of Ireland and the constituents who send us to the respective parliaments.  I believe everybody in his heart of hearts agrees with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have adopted a decision with which we are staying.  I am certain if we set up some joint committee of all parties in the House they will come up with that conclusion as the 1975 Joint Committee came up with the conclusion also that it was an unsustainable and untenable position then even in the light of the limited activities of Members of this Oireachtas in the European Parliament before the elected parliament came into being.  It was the feeling of all the Members in the House, Deputy Desmond <Col N="763" /> who was there for the Labour Party, Deputy Charlie McDonald from the Fine Gael Party, myself and others, that it was untenable and unsustainable to maintain the two jobs.  There is no point in making a speech here doing a con man job as far as the public are concerned.  It is not possible, physically, mentally, or psychologically for a person to travel out by plane to Strasbourg, to work on the committees that are meeting two and three times a week apart from the plenary sessions that are held at least once a month, and to do the two jobs simultaneously.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil faced up to their responsibility in this matter and decided that party members going forward for election must opt if they are Members after the election of the two assemblies.  That resulted before the last election in three of our Deputies opting for the European Parliament and not standing for the Dáil and the fourth Deputy standing for the Dáil and on her defeat opting for the European Parliament.  I said very deliberately in my opening remarks that what I was saying was pertinent largely to the decision in regard to political parties.  I specifically exempted Independents because they in my view are <i>sui generis</i> in this matter.  They are a particular case because Independents, as Deputy Blaney stated, go forward on their own to the people and ask the people to support them for wherever they are going, local authorities, Dáil Éireann or the European Parliament.  They are responsible to the people alone.  Independents are a very small minority in the European Parliament of 410 that is largely a party-orientated parliament.  That is why the groups have been established there.  They relate to national political parties.  Independants, with all due respect to Deputy Blaney, are a very freakish product in the European Parliament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Parliament is primarily a party-orientated parliament.  That is why in every country apart from Britain and Ireland you have <Col N="764" /> the list system of election where you have party lists prepared and they decide the people on those party lists.  Deputy Blaney is well aware as an ex-member of our party that within our system it is the political party who put forward candidates for national election and for European election.  The political parties, the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party have an obligation in our system and within our society to the public as a whole which Independents like Deputy Blaney may not feel, because Independents do not have the overall national conception that political parties have to hold.  It is the duty of political parties in the national interests to consider the matter and decide how best to deploy their particular members in their activities in the European Parliament, the national parliament or local authorities.  It is up to political parties to distil the wisdom of their membership and decide at party conventions who to put forward for these particular bodies in the overall national and European interests.</P>
      <P>That is what political parties are for and that is why they are structured the way they are.  Before the last election Fianna Fáil decided, and we are staying with that decision, that we can deploy our party members better by ensuring that whatever people are nominated by conventions of our party, selected by our party, put forward for election and elected by the people, concentrate on one particular body only.  That is a responsible attitude of a party doing their job for society and the nation as a whole. There is no question of people in that situation being forced into a position where the party decide to put forward people whom the party know well are unable do the two jobs at the same time. The party make a decision that the people must be served to the maximum extent by selecting people and electing people who would specialise in their respective parliaments, the Irish national Parliament and the European Parliament.  That is the reason we came to that decision.  There is no other reasoning behind it and we will stay with that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point I would like to make, which was mentioned by the <Col N="765" /> Minister of State and also by Deputy Blaney in some of the more constructive moments of his speech and also by some other Members, the question of the linkage between membership of the national parliament and the European Parliament.  That needs to be strengthened.  I agree with Deputy Blaney, the Minister of State and other speakers in this respect.  I am against the dual mandate but I feel the linkage must be tighter. European Parliament members should be entitled to the right of audience here for specified debates on European matters in this House.  European Parliament members should make regular reports to this House and a specified debate on European membership should take place at which they would contribute along with other Members of this House.  They should be members of specific committees related to European matters and be in a position to be co-opted on to committees where a European perspective or a European view is required.  I agree with all this.</P>
    <P>We should be devoting our minds from here on to acknowledging that the dual mandate is a hopeless concept in terms of allocating time, energy, resources and ability to the day's work involved in trying to work in two parliaments hundreds of miles apart.  That is not on. <Col N="766" /> What is on is a system whereby people specialise in one or the other parliament but if elected to the European Parliament maintain regular contact here through right of audience in relation to European matters, right of membership of committees, right to make reports to this House and to the other House of the Oireachtas and in that manner to maintain a linkage apart from the linkage involved by their continuing membership of the political parties represented in this House.</P>
    <P>We will push this motion to a vote.  We feel the action of the Coalition parties in maintaining this policy is dishonest.  It is not doing a service to the Irish people. The maximum is required from all of us in this House and in the European Parliament where 15 members only out of a parliament of 410 represent this country. With maximum attendance and the specialisations required of them, I do not think we can get this service from a dual mandate situation.  Therefore, we are opposed to it, but certainly we will support any effort to have all-party consultation on any of a number of variable dimensions in which we can establish stronger links between this parliament and the members of the European Parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the ESB that the position on the provision of electricity supply to the islands in question is as follows: it was originally proposed to supply the small number of houses on Inishturk by means of individual generating sets and this was acceptable initially to the islanders.  They have recently indicated that this proposal is not acceptable and have asked that a central generating unit be provided.  This is being examined by the board and, if approved, would require the design and construction of a low tension network to cover all houses and the erection of a generator house and the specification and purchase of a suitable generator.  Allowing for the normal difficulties and delays in construction on these islands the board consider it is unlikely that the system now required could be operative before summer 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Clare Island, in reply to <Col N="654" /> the Deputy's question of 21 July last it was indicated that provision of supply was dependent on the generator building being completed.  While an order has been placed recently with the successful tenderer, building work has not yet started and again, allowing for the delays and difficulties in building on an island site, it is not now expected that the building could be completed and the system operative before the summer of 1982.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is not entitled to pay-related benefit because entitlement to this benefit is subject to the statutory condition that the sum of weekly unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit may not exceed 85 per cent of a claimants average net weekly earnings.</P>
      <P>As the person concerned is presently receiving unemployment benefit at the weekly rate of £60.65 and as this amount exceeds 85 per cent of his earnings, namely, £48.58, pay-related benefit is not payable in his case.</P>
