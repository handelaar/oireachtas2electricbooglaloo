    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the representations that were made to the Government by or on behalf of the British Government or the Northern Ireland Office, or by any other British or Northern Ireland interest, following the adoption by a group of the European Parliament of a resolution in relation to Northern Ireland; and the action that he, or any person authorised by him, took subsequently to influence or attempt to influence actions of members of the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No representations as suggested by the Deputy were received by me or by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I must accept the assurance that the representations were not made to the Taoiseach by the British Government, is he aware that such was the case made to Fine Gael Deputies in the European Parliament who conveyed it to their colleagues in the Christian Democrat group?  Is he aware that such representations have been made by the British Government and were conveyed by a high official in the Department of the Taoiseach to the Deputies concerned who promptly on the following day withdrew <Col N="942" /> the motion which they had mooted and moved within the Christian Democrat group asking the European Parliament to interest itself actively in the Northern Ireland problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Beyond the facts of the deferment of the motion I am not aware of any of the other things alleged by the Deputy none of which bear any relationship to anything that has come to my notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach state here categorically that this contact was not made by a high official in his Department with his colleagues in the Fine Gael Party who are members of the European Parliament and that it was not on that basis that the motion was withdrawn on the following day, 14 October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any contact of that kind.  I have my own contact from time to time with members of the European Parliament.  I am not aware of any other contacts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must accept the Taoiseach's word.  Is he aware that the case was made by Deputy McCartin and Deputy Ryan to their colleagues in the Christian Democrat group, to other colleagues in the European Parliament and to the press in Strasbourg that such was the case and that on that basis the motion to which the Christian Democrat group had subscribed unanimously on 13 October was withdrawn on 14 October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  I would be rather astonished to hear that anything of the kind had happened because there was no point of any kind to be discussed.  I do not know what the Deputy is talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to accept what goes on between the Taoiseach and the British Government.  All I am asking the Taoiseach at this stage, in order to get this matter on the record with regard to the Taoiseach's credibility, is whether he is aware that a high official of his Department, recently transferred from the <Col N="943" /> Department of Foreign Affairs &mdash; that indicates the person to the Taoiseach &mdash; rang the Deputies of the Fine Gael Party who are MEPs, in particular Deputy McCartin and Deputy Ryan who received that call and that message from the Taoiseach that I have just adumbrated, and that such was the case they made to their colleagues in the European Parliament, to the Christian Democrat group and to the press, and that this fact which I have mentioned was widely reported by the press in Strasbourg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware and I find it hard to conceive that any official in my Department would be communicating any messages of that kind alleging a statement of the British Government when none took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter touches on the credibility of assurances given by Deputies of the Taoiseach's party in Strasbourg.  Would the Taoiseach investigate the matter and ascertain if such a communication by telephone was made by a very high official in his Department on his behalf to the Deputies concerned whom I have mentioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly satisfied that nothing of the kind took place.  I do not know what the Deputy is talking about.  I am afraid he does not either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an indication of the sort of credibility that is hanging around the Taoiseach's neck like an albatross.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach in view of the outcome of the ICTU Delegate Conference on Thursday, 29 October and the statement from the FUE the previous week, the action the Government now proposes to take on pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement which I issued <Col N="944" /> today, copies of which are available in the Dáil Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the unprecedented response by the Taoiseach to a question of such urgent and national importance, can he tell the House first of all what the Government's attitude is to national understandings? Were any efforts made by this Government to explore the possibility of securing a national understanding; were talks held with both sides of industry and, if so, what was the outcome of those talks?  If they were not held why were they not held?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware from public announcements and the copies of the statement I have referred to which were given to him and the Leader of the Opposition a few minutes ago, the position is that I have invited the Chairman of the Employer-Labour Conference to discuss the possibility of an initiative to reopen discussions with me.  He has accepted that invitation.  I will add nothing to that at this stage and I think that the Deputy would not wish me to do so in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have not had an opportunity of seeing the copy of the Taoiseach's reply, may I ask if it is a very lengthy reply and could the House be informed of its contents?  If it is a very lengthy reply&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is only two pages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this procedure by the Taoiseach in accordance with the rules of order?  The oral question was addressed to the Taoiseach by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald. Apparently the Taoiseach now is seeking to avoid answering the question by referring us all to a statement which none of us saw before we came into this House and of which I think only two members of the Opposition have copies. Were you, A Cheann Comhairle, aware that this procedure was to be followed and, if so, is it in order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have replied to the <Col N="945" /> question and as well as that I have indicated as a substantial point in the statement that I have invited the Chairman of the Employer-Labour Conference to discuss the possibility of an initiative to reopen discussions.  I have added to that the fact that he has accepted the invitation which, of course, is not in the statement itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to find out what is going on.  Will the Taoiseach say when this statement, of which I have just been handed a copy here a moment ago &mdash; which is headed &ldquo;Government Statement&rdquo;, nothing more than that &mdash; has been laid on the table of the House? At what time today was it laid on the table of the House?  What device is this that he is resorting to in order to avoid answering oral questions in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said in my reply that copies are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Since when?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not tell the Deputy the exact time.  I do not undertake that task myself and I could not say exactly when, but as the statement was prepared in the course of the Government meeting this morning and was issued just in advance of the RTE 1.30 news, it must have been placed in the Library sometime in the last hour or so, I would think in the nature of things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach now telling us that it was issued to RTE before being placed in the Library of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have made an announcement on this subject through the normal channels of the GIS. In the circumstances I thought it might facilitate Deputies who might not have heard the broadcast, if it were placed in the Library of the House.  I thought that facilitation would have been appreciated rather than being a cause for complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of appreciating anything.  The situation here <Col N="946" /> is that, apparently, the Taoiseach has cobbled together some sort of a statement at the very last moment, has issued it to the news media before putting it on the table of the House and now, in response to an oral question by a Deputy of the House, refers that Deputy to this statement.  I believe, Ceann Comhairle, you should take very serious note of this behaviour on the part of the Taoiseach. It is an abuse of parliamentary questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>During these exchanges I have had an opportunity of hastily reading the Government statement. Arising out of that, which I take it is the Taoiseach's reply to the question, the concluding sentence is that the Taoiseach has invited the Chairman of the Employer-Labour Conference to discuss the possibility of an initiative to reopen discussions.  Arising out of that suggestion, while I am happy, like the Taoiseach, to pay tribute to the skills of the Chairman of the Employer-Labour Conference, I would have thought something more substantial would be needed to reopen any worth-while discussions.  Has the Taoiseach given any directions or has he made any additional information or guidance to the Chairman of the Employer-Labour Conference which might enable him to have some substantive basis for approaching the parties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Deputy should suggest that the involvement of the Chairman of the Employer-Labour Conference is not helpful or adequate. That kind of comment is very unhelpful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can speak for himself and can do so from the back benches as he once did from the front benches before he was expelled from them.  With regard to the second part of the supplementary question, as I have explained to the House I will be meeting <Col N="947" /> him at 5.15 and discussing the issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach is, apparently, seeking refuge in the statement by way of avoiding answering the second question on the Order Paper, could I ask you to insist that the Taoiseach reads out his statement for the benefit of the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Taoiseach that he has no option, in deference to the rules of procedure in this House, but to read the statement.  Deputy Fitzgerald and I have copies of it but no other Deputy has a copy.  Is the Taoiseach afraid to read out the statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no procedure under which statements issued by the GIS to the press are read out in this House.  I do not propose to initiate that procedure which would be a most extraordinary one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that he has referred the House to this statement by way of answer to question No. 2 on the Order Paper?  Is the Taoiseach not prepared to read out his own statement to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to initiate a precedent by reading out in the House statements issued by the Government to the press.  My predecessor did not do so when he was in office and I am not going to start it now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <P>After meetings of European Councils it was the practice of <Col N="948" /> Taoiseachs, including Deputy Haughey, to refer Deputies to the communique in the Library of the House.  The whole communique is not read out.  On several occasions statements were not in the Library when they were supposed to be.</P>

      <P>While I am not happy about it, I recognise that the Chair has no control over the form in which Ministers reply to questions.  I accept that.  I hope I may be allowed a little latitude before I frame my supplementary question.  I cannot resist noting that the Taoiseach appears to be attempting to reply to questions by making snide remarks.  I do not think that is a very satisfactory mode of reply.  I also wish to point out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government statement, on a quick reading, does not appear to contain any new information. Could the Taoiseach say why either of the parties who are involved in the breakdown of the talks should be expected to resume substantive discussions since there is not the slightest indication given of any advance?  Incidentally, the leaks to the papers this morning implied some advance rather than retreat on the part of the Government and may I ask the nature of such advance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to support the protests of my party leader because it has reached the stage that when a Deputy submits a question through normal channels he is refused an <Col N="949" /> answer and a copy of a statement is put in the Library, probably at the very same time as the question is being answered in the House.  This matter should be raised at the Committee on Procedures and Privileges.  Arising from the statement, what was the Government's attitude to a national understanding and were any efforts or attempts made to achieve one? I asked if any consultations had been held but I did not get a reply.  In the communique that was issued the Taoiseach referred to the Committee on Costs and Competitiveness.  Would the Taoiseach agree that the setting up of that committee, the reporting of that committee and the subsequent revised reporting of that committee hindered rather than helped any prospect there was of a national wage agreement or national understanding this year?  Furthermore, regarding this meeting which the Taoiseach obviously arranged at very short notice, as a result of the question I put down, is it his intention to meet that excellent person whom I highly commend, the Chairman of the Employer-Labour Conference, at 5.15 this evening?  In view of the way he has handled this, will he subsequently make a statement to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be drawn any further on a matter which is of such grave importance.  The Deputies opposite should act more responsibly than in seeking to draw matters of this kind out and to make imputations or draw implications from what is happening which could be inimicable to the objective which we all share, the achievement of a central pay agreement with provisions which will make a substantial contribution to resolving the unemployment problem.  We all share that wish and I do not think it is helpful for Deputies on the other side of the House to pour cold water on it or otherwise undermine initiatives being taken.  Any further statements in this vein from the other side of the House would not be helpful.  We should let the matter proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In all your time in the House, Ceann Comhairle, you have never seen an approach like this to a question by a Taoiseach.  Surely it is <Col N="950" /> unprecedented?  In view of the unsatisfactory nature of the Taoiseach's reply, would he indicate to the House what options now exist in achieving a national understanding or a national agreement? Have discussions been held with anybody? He must realise he has a responsibility to govern and that the Opposition are entitled to ask him relevant questions on matters of national importance.</P>

      <P>The most recent estimates for the number of married women in employment are based on the 1979 Labour Force Survey.  On the basis of this survey, it is estimated that there were some 91,900 married women in employment in the State in May-June 1979.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Herring larval surveys are conducted by my Department in the area up to 25 miles offshore between Rosslare and Baltimore from October to February each year.  Eight such surveys were conducted in the period October 1980 to February 1981 and a further series of ten such surveys has just commenced and will run until the end of February 1982.  In addition to these larval surveys, a continuing sampling programme on adult fish is carried out throughout the year.</P>

Am I right in thinking that the Minister said that the survey was confined to a stretch of water 25 miles off the coast?  Surely that is a very tiny fraction of the Celtic Sea, which could hardly indicate the true nature or extent of the stocks of herring in the Celtic Sea?</P>

My information is that if a more recent survey was carried out the Minister might as a result allow boats up to 65 ft. to fish in this area.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the difficulties these boats are experiencing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> It might be well if I gave a short history of the Celtic Sea fishery which collapsed in 1976-77 when only 7,000 tons was recorded as against a catch of 30,000 tons in other years.  Fishery scientists, acting through ICES, advised that the fishery should be closed until there was a stock size of 40,000 tons.  The fishery was closed in 1977 for herring and remained closed because the desired level had not been reached.  I should like to tell the Deputy that conservation matters such as the closure of the Celtic Sea are matters for the EEC Council of Ministers and it is not possible for Ireland to act in isolation. This year, following considerable pressure by Ireland, it was decided by the EEC to open the fishery on a limited basis with a quota of 1,000 tons confined to Irish boats not exceeding 50 ft., not 40 ft., as is sometimes thought.  The fishery is being fished on that basis at present. The only option was to accept the quota of 1,000 tons or allow the fishery remain closed.  I do not think it could be reasonably argued that it would be in the interests of the Irish fishing industry, or Irish fishermen, to leave it closed.  The matter will, of course, be reviewed again next year.</P>

Their main breeding grounds are the Inishkea Island, County Mayo, and various small islands and caves along the west coast from Lough Swilly to west Cork.  In addition, there are small colonies off the Waterford and Wexford coasts and in Dublin Bay.  Whilst precise numbers for each individual location are not available, the seal population at the Inishkea Islands was estimated at almost 800.

In regard to ensuring that this does not happen again, I know that the Garda Síochána will play their part and I know that the rangers of my Department will play their part.  But it is just not possible to give a guarantee that people will not break the law and that they will not behave in a reckless and cruel fashion.  With regard to the culling of seals, in future any licences issued by my Department will be issued subject to conditions which will ensure that if the licences are complied with the seals will be dispatched in a humane and painless manner.

Does the Minister not feel that the ideal way would be that monitoring of the culling should be done by his Department? When the culling is done somebody from the Department should be there and be involved in it.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>As the House will no doubt be aware, I have already publicly deplored the recent unauthorised killing of seals on the Inishkea Islands and adjacent areas off the Mayo coast.  I have also appealed for local public co-operation in helping the Garda and my Department towards identifying the culprits.</P>
      <P>Last Sunday, at my request, departmental officials, assisted by some outside experts, carried out a special survey of the islands to make an on the spot assessment of the situation in the wake of the killings and to treat any seals which had been left wounded or helpless.  Fortunately, those animals which they found were in good condition and did not require treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am having the general situation in relation to seals fully examined with a view to taking all practicable measures to avoid a repetition of the recent unhappy incident.  In this context I will be looking to co-operation by fishermen in the implementation, within the Wildlife Act, <Col N="971" /> of a lawful system of control so as to minimise seal damage to fish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on ordering the survey last Sunday.  He deserves the gratitude of all of us for that.  In view of the fact that the brutal killings to which he referred are a repetition of such behaviour two years ago, would he not agree that there is an urgent need for some education programme on the provisions of the Wildlife Act?  It is hard to believe that the Act has been in existence since 1976 and we had these killings in 1979 and repeated in 1981.  Would the Minister not agree that there is need for an education programme for the public on the provisions of the Wildlife Act and in particular as it affects protected species.</P>

In view of the manner in which the seals were killed, which is an indictment of us all, would the Minister not consider it a matter of urgency that some public seminar or some public programme should be organised by his Department to draw attention to the inhumane way in which the seals were killed?  I hope the Minister is not suggesting that the existence of the booklet is sufficient.  If it could not stop people killing seals twice in two years, How can it be regarded as sufficient?  It was a brutal form of killing.  What does the Minister propose to do about it?</P>

The publicity which has been given to this wanton act and might I take this opportunity to congratulate the Wildlife Confederation on <Col N="972" /> the part they played in publicising it&mdash;will do a great deal of good.  I have been considering how I can help.  I am advised that the most vulnerable season for these animals is the pupping season in the months of October and November.  Perhaps it would be possible to mount a little campaign to draw the attention of the general public and the people in the area to that fact.

We agree with the Supplementary Estimate but I want to ask a few questions.  In which specific areas were there savings of £25,000?  What apparatus and equipment were not provided, and why?  Would the Minister be more specific and tell us if this Supplementary Estimate was introduced because of increased numbers, or because of increased salaries not envisaged, and whether the Government's embargo of 21 July has put the State Laboratory in the same position as many other Government Departments of having vacancies?  As I said, I would like to have this information but we are not opposing this Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>The original allocation for 1981 under subhead A, which covers wages and salaries, was £470,000.  By the end of September 1981 all but £4,400 of this allocation was spent.  Put in another form, the original allocation was totally inadequate.  This Supplementary Estimate is needed for the following reasons: there was a substantial pay award granted to technicians from 1 January 1979.  and to chemists with effect from 1 January 1980, amounting to expenditure of £145,000 in 1981.  There was a consequential Government decision&mdash;your decision &mdash; to reduce all the 1981 Estimates by 5 per cent and this led to a <Col N="1021" /> reduction of £25,000 in Subhead A of the State Laboratory Vote.  In addition there were special pay increases with arrears payable to clerical and subordinate staff amounting to £6,000.  This was during your period of negotiation.</P>

      <P>The State Laboratory were unable to secure the savings at B by the non-filling of vacancies but a corresponding saving was made under Subhead D&mdash;Apparatus and Chemical Equipment&mdash;and this will offset this increase in expenditure on salaries and wages.  Nevertheless, the net effect is that an additional Supplementary Estimate of £151,000 is required.  I do not want to be contentious but this is the picture which emerges throughout the public sector in terms of last year's Estimates.  This is only a small sample.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>My basic point in introducing my observations on this Bill was that if we adopted the correct economic and social strategy in our budgetary and general economic policy we could ensure our future development. This year and again next year there will be an additional 15,000 people seeking employment.  We are a rich country in terms of agricultural land, our seas and our mineral, oil and gas resources and if we exploit these resources properly we should be able to sustain our economic and industrial development.  We built up during the sixties a strong industrial sector and a sustained export record.  I am convinced that if we extend that industrial sector and improve exports we can provide good jobs at reasonable earning levels for all our people.  For that reason I am not pessimistic in my approach to this Bill.  In general I am optimistic but if there is one area about which I am pessimistic it is the inability of political parties to get to grips with the need for courageous policies.  There is a great deal of progress to be made towards the development of our economy on a rational basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stated many times in this House and elsewhere that there are no soft options open to us in economic and social development.  Anybody who suggests that we can simultaneously increase Government expenditure for job creation, job maintenance and the expansion of social programmes and also reduce direct or indirect taxation is simply codding people.  An attempt to do such things would wreck the economy.  We need a sustained period of very careful management of the State finances and we also need an economic and social plan which will not be messed about by party political programmes.  We need, too, a national planning board to advise politicians on the best strategies to adopt.  We need an understanding in regard to <Col N="1023" /> income increases and very definite agreement between the social partners and the Government on all these matters.  Unless we adopt that approach we will simply go along from budget to budget chopping and changing, making promises, half implementing them and borrowing money for political expediency, funding projects which are half baked and half defined and ending up in the mess we experienced in 1980 and 1981.  We are at a watershed in terms of budgetary policy.</P>
    <P>I hope that those who have some responsibility for examining the strategy will learn some unpalatable lessons from what happened during the term of the former Taoiseach and the former Minister for Finance.  If I have been bitter and scathing in my reaction to the policies they followed it is because, despite the former Taoiseach's indication on assuming office that he would take some hard options, he reversed that course immediately for transient political popularity. Nothing was beyond the greatest toucher of all times in seeking money for any project.  The money was made available but there was not a taxation policy to pay for that kind of expenditure.  That is not good enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from Deputy McCreevy, it is not unfair to say that not one Deputy from that side, when they were on this side, expressed serious concern <Col N="1024" /> about the economic and social strategy of the Fianna Fáil Government.  I make these points in a political way because in the next two or three years we will need massive taxation finance, massive financial resources, in order to overcome present difficulties.  For instance, next year 15,000 additional persons will come on the labour market seeking jobs and if we are to be able to create jobs for such persons we will need massive national financial resources to undertake the work.  We will need money in order to eliminate poverty.  These days it is out of fashion, almost totally out of tune, to use the word &ldquo;poverty,&rdquo; but if we are to make any serious dent in real poverty we will need every shilling we have in the Exchequer and more.  The only way to get that money is by way of contributions from those who can afford to contribute.</P>
      <P>Having been in the House since 1969 I may be regarded as being very jaundiced. In that time I have not met many politicians who have met many people on social welfare, because there are very few politicians who have been forced to live on social welfare.  Perhaps some politicians are from relatively poor families, but most politicians do not have to live on, for instance, non-contributory old age pensions, disability pensions, social welfare benefits, pay-related or otherwise. As we talk now, there are 950,000 people living on social assistance, and of them 275,000 are children, children of people on unemployment benefit or assistance, or those on disability benefits or supplementary benefits or deserted wives' allowances or prisoners' allowances, or the various other allowances such as widows' contributory or non-contributory pensions.  I will repeat that out of our total population of about 3.46 million, 950,000 people, of whom 275,000 are children, live on social welfare incomes, and often those incomes are not as much as a politician would spend on a round of drinks in a pub at election time, not that urban politicians are wont to do that kind of thing because the people would not have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk about elimination of poverty we must remember that the top 20 per cent of Irish families enjoy 45 per <Col N="1025" /> cent of the country's income, and we all know that we are not wealthy as a country by world or EEC standards.  Therefore, the income of our society is not distributed or utilised in an egalitarian way.  If we take the other end of the scale, the lower 20 per cent of our population have only 4 per cent of the income.  I will repeat those figures because they have to be shouted from the rooftops since the vast majority of the people do not believe them.  If an opinion poll were taken of the country's poverty, we would find that what I have said is correct.  The top one-fifth of the population enjoy 45 per cent of the income and the bottom one-fifth have only 4 per cent of the income.</P>
    <P>Recently I attended a Cabinet subcommittee meeting in which we debated among ourselves the matter of home improvements grants.  People want back boilers, they want windows glazed, they want these things done by way of improvement grants, and politicians have been going around the country distributing application forms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get back rapidly to the Bill.  I am talking about the purposes for which we tax people.  It is true that 25 per cent of our old people living alone do not have even a standard water amenity, a bath or a toilet.  That is the reality of Irish life.  I will not prolong the point, but one can go to the inner city areas, to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency, and one will find those severe problems and deprivations.  That is why we need taxation, direct and indirect, that is why we need capital taxation, why we need resources to pay for the elimination of poverty.  We need money <Col N="1026" /> to spend on job creation.  I have referred to the 15,000 people coming on the labour market this year.  In his excellent report, &ldquo;Population and Employment Prospects for 1986&rdquo;, Brendan Walsh states that the net increase in non-agricultural employment between 1975 and 1986 in order to provide jobs for the growing labour force and reduce the unemployment rate to 4 per cent lies in the range 23,000 to 28,000 per year.  One has a formidable task.  There are 15,000 people entering the labour force and the current unemployment figure is well up to 130,000.  If that is to be reduced we need massive State resources.</P>
      <P>We urgently need to look at the taxation system in order to bring about equality in education.  People may ask what education has to do with direct taxation. It has a lot to do with it.  There are people who have their children in college and obtain a tax rebate for keeping them there.  We perpetuate a system which is totally regressive and class-orientated in terms of educational structures.  The evidence is so blatantly obvious that one gets tired of reiterating it.  I see my colleague from UCD on my left, appropriately enough, a man for whom I have great admiration.</P>
      <P>The McHale Report stated in relation to the social and economic background of students at UCD that 1.5 per cent of students came from semi-skilled and unskilled occupational categories.  These categories comprise 14.2 per cent of our population.  In the greater Dublin area the population is one million.  The fact that only 1.5 per cent from this category attend university is the outcome of the taxation and incomes system we have.  It can be traced back to the Finance Acts we have had.  Let us take the higher professional category.  To what extent do they comprise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall correlate it without any great difficulty and the Chair will see when it all unfolds precisely what I mean.  In UCD the higher professional category provide 19 per cent of university students and constitutes 2.6 per cent of the population.  That is the reality.  That is why I believe that the taxation system must be radically overhauled.  Semi-skilled and unskilled people should have massive tax incentives to send their children to university just as the higher professional groups have that incentive. Rather than annoy the Leas-Cheann Comhairle further, I shall just say that the ratios have declined over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 25 per cent of those in Northern Ireland are unemployed.  We talk about articles 2 and 3, God help us.  If we are to attempt to eliminate poverty, promote employment and job creation and introduce real equality in education and if we urgently need to spend resources on the State sector we need taxation.  To what extent are these resources available for the Government and the politicians to do something about the problems I have referred to?  What has happened is very simple.  The failure has been documented in terms of State finances.  There was massive political dishonesty particularly in the period 1977 and 1981.  The former Government funded health programmes, education programmes, social welfare programmes and job creation programmes without facing up to the need to raise taxation.  In other words there has been an excessive reliance on borrowing. Fianna Fáil borrowed all over the place, for this, that and the other, without any acceptance of the fact that they might have to pay the money back in three or five years time.  Some trade union leaders <Col N="1028" /> are nearly as bad as the Fianna Fáil Party in this.  Fianna Fáil regard our approach, which is essentially one based on the need for taxation and the need to cut down massive foreign borrowing, as totally monetarist.  The word &ldquo;monetarist&rdquo; flung around by Deputy Fitzgerald and his colleagues is a good jingle.  It sounds well but it has nothing to do with the measures taken last July.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a report which was published last week and urgently recommend all my colleagues in government and in the Opposition to read it.  It is the NESC Report on Economic and Social Policy, 1981.  That was one of the strongest exposés of the stupidity of over-borrowing, particularly on foreign markets. I am not so sure that Deputy Haughey would regard the membership of the NESC as a gaggle of monetarists.  Some of them were appointed by him.  I am sure those nominated by the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society or the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers or the IFA would bitterly resent being called monetarist by Deputies Haughey or Fitzgerald. Every page of the report is riddled with firm advocacy of the need to reduce and eliminate the current budget deficit as one of the most important things to be done in the economy.  The report warns us strongly &mdash; it is signed by members of that body &mdash; that if the present policies advocated by Fianna Fáil are pursued in respect of the current budget deficits, adjustment will be forced upon the community and there will be reaction from our creditors.</P>
    <P>I would be very interested in hearing the reaction of Fianna Fáil spokesmen to the NESC report because they see fit to condemn the July budget and to say that it was entirely unnecessary and unduly extreme.  The NESC report highlights the abject failure of Fianna Fáil to manage the ordinary budget arithmetic of the economy during 1979 and 1980 and this failure was in the interest of winning the general election, an interest to which everything else had to take second place. I quote from paragraph 1.29 of the NESC report in the context specifically of the current budget deficit:</P>
    <P>The failure of tax increases to match <Col N="1029" /> the increase in Government current expenditure resulted in an increasing current budget deficit.  The current budget deficit increased from 3.8 per cent of GNP in 1977 to 7.3 per cent in 1979, although it fell slightly to 6.6 per cent in 1980.  (Table 20) The scale of budget deficits and the expansion of Government capital expenditure have resulted in substantial increases in the borrowing requirement of the Exchequer, which has increased, relative to GNP, each year since 1977.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement in 1980 amounted to £1,217 million, 14.6 per cent of GNP, compared with 14.0 per cent of GNP in 1979 and 13.0 per cent in 1978.  (Table 25) The more broadly defined public sector borrowing requirement, which comprises the borrowing of the Exchequer, State-sponsored bodies and local authorities has also increased relative to GNP in each of the last three years, and amounted to 18.9 per cent of GNP in 1980.</P>
    <P>These, according to Fianna Fáil, are the figures of the monetarists Senator Whitaker who was nominated by the Government, Professor W.J.L. Ryan, who was nominated also by the Government, Mr. Paddy Cardiff of the ICTWU and so on. These are men who are concerned about the Irish economy but who, perhaps, do not meet a Monsignor on the hillside and tell him that he will be given £8 million to build an airport, who do not meet a group of striking workers and tell them not to be concerned because their redundancy payments will be topped up.  Neither do these people phone a Department of State and ask if they would like £3.6 million for the purpose of building sports complexes.  Neither do they invite someone to accept £1 million for the purpose of building an oyster factory.  That was the sort of situation that we inherited but in our anxiety to try to rectify matters we shall probably lose the next election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal now with the question of taxation as it relates to the Finance Bill.  At this stage, even allowing for the July budget which we must admit was not very pleasant for anyone, we face an opening budget deficit for next year of £1,100 million.  Our balance-of-payments deficit was £700 million in 1979.  It remained at that level in 1980 but this year the figure is likely to be of the order of £1,300 million.  The foreign debt of the State-sponsored bodies has trebled since 1978 so that it stands at about £900 million.  The cause of this was the attitude of the former Taoiseach in telling the chiefs of these bodies that they should build, invent, produce jobs and so on while failing to say that the Irish people would have to pay for all of this.  That debt has to be serviced.  We all know that if one approaches a bank manager to inquire about the facility of a bridging or any other type of loan, one is asked how one proposes to pay back the money and in what period of time.  The same applies to the Department of Finance.  I do not walk around to the Bank of Ireland each week and collect about £2 million to pay the public service. We borrow in accordance with strict arrangements at both domestic and international level.  In 1981 the cost of servicing our foreign debt plus some repayments is £380 million.  Next year with a budget deficit of £1,100 million to start with we will have to find £650 million for this purpose alone.  This will leave us with a very difficult budgetary situation, so much so that, as I pointed out in general <Col N="1031" /> simple terms on a recent radio programme, we now owe to foreigners, to use the pejorative term for which I apologise since we suffer unduly from that type of phraseology, about £800 for every man, woman and child in the country, and for every industrial worker in the country we owe now £2,500.  That kind of servicing must come from taxation if we are to make our way because there is nowhere else to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I met some of the chief executives of various State-sponsored bodies at the IMI on 8 October last I pointed out that by last July's budget the outlook was that in 1981 almost £2 billion would have to be borrowed.  That is equivalent to about 20 per cent of GNP of which about half, or 10 per cent, would have been required to finance the deficit on current account.  That is why I sound so harsh today in my disgust and distaste at the behaviour of the former Taoiseach, an accountant, a man who knows what money means, who can read both sides of a balance sheet, but who, for appalling, narrow, short-term political gain &mdash; despite the famous television speech of January 1980 when he made it quite clear to the Irish people what the real problems were &mdash; did an about-turn in 1980 and 1981 simply to win an election.  I reiterate that that kind of opportunistic policy which was followed, that kind of ill-defined borrowing which is wholly corrosive to economic growth, and every piece of stupid expenditure for current needs which was incurred unnecessarily to quite an extent by the previous Administration mean that our children will have to do without jobs in the eighties.  That is the legacy to which my reaction here today is revulsion.  There is no doubt that prolonged and increased borrowing, particularly for current account purposes, carries with it a legacy of growing debt service and it pre-empts larger and larger shares of ordinary tax revenue.  Despite the measures we took last July, increased debt service cost will absorb two-thirds of the increased revenue from existing taxation in 1982.  I do not want to sound unduly pessimistic but it is essential that we know the realities of the situation <Col N="1032" /> because all politicians have a degree of responsibility on this issue.</P>
    <P>As if that is not bad enough, successive party political programmes in this country have also done their utmost to destroy the basis of ordinary taxation.  I say that in respect of the previous Coalition and the previous Fianna Fáil administration. Why do I say that?  Because the previous Government in the second half of the decade took over responsibility for that part of the health costs of the country which was met previously from local taxation. I sat in government and in opposition. I was in over there from 1969 to 1973 and here from 1973 to 1977.  I am sitting here again and the scenario has not changed much.  In that period the previous Government, the Fianna Fáil Government, eventually in 1977, took responsibility for that part of the health cost which had been met from local taxation and did away &mdash; all parties were in agreement with this &mdash; with the remaining aspects of local taxation.  We abolished rates.  We could not do it fast enough.  Even the Conservative Government in England were flabbergasted.  My colleagues in the Council of Europe, Social Democrats from Germany, Communists and Socialists from France or any other&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Previous Governments have abolished local rates taxation on domestic dwellings and simultaneously introduced a whole series of new subsidies without any provision to pay for them.  The ultimate recourse was, of course, to fund these expenditures from borrowed money.  We have failed to bridge the gap with our own tax resources.  That is the nub of the point I am making.  I make the point strongly because I want to come to the question of direct and indirect taxation. I regret that some people in the House do not seem to be able to understand that in terms of sources of State revenue you must take into account rates, income tax direct and indirect, local charges and a multitude of resources that go to make up a budget.  That is why I refer in this context to the points I have made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Following that peroration I come to the point I want to make on the question of taxation.  The Taoiseach yesterday, 2 November, said in a speech that he made to the Goldsmiths Company: &ldquo;I would like to take this opportunity of reiterating the Government's commitment to the introduction of greater equality in the taxation system.  This we will do not only by intensifying measures to combat tax evasion and reducing opportunities for tax avoidance but by the implementation of all proposals to reform the income tax code, to eliminate income limits for health and PRSI contributions and to introduce a youth employment levy on that part of incomes over £8,500 a year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the commitment of the present Government and the Taoiseach to introducing an equitable taxation system. Our present system as it is structured is inherently inequitable and provides entirely legitimate grounds for dissatisfaction among those who feel they are being heavily taxed.  PAYE taxpayers, notwithstanding the reliefs which are proposed in the Government's programme, claim they are required to carry an undue burden of income tax.  We must find means of achieving a contribution from all sections and incomes of the community. Under successive Finance Bills, we must find a way of ensuring that persons make contributions in proportion to their true ability to pay.  If we fail to demonstrate in the eighties that our taxation system is scrupulously fair, politicians will deserve the odium in which they are <Col N="1035" /> held by many people for failing to reform our income tax system.</P>
    <P>The inequalities within the present income taxation system have become a source of friction between different sections of the community and this is a matter which should be of very serious concern. When we talk about national pay settlements, or policies to direct or redirect public expenditure, or controlling Exchequer expenditure, unless all these strategies are accompanied by a socially just system of taxation, they are not worth the paper they are written on.  I hold that view strongly.  In any examination I have done of tax rates in the Department of Finance and the impact on different families and different tax structures, the key issue is the relative total impact of all taxes.  That is why, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you may have found it hard to follow my train of argument. One must take into account the total impact of all taxes, direct and indirect, social insurance contributions and PRSI contributions on the family, not just on the individual.</P>
    <P>If one examines the relative impact of taxation on different income groups, it is evident that, far from being progressive, in many respects the system of taxation is, in many areas, regressive.  It helps those who have money to spend and who have high incomes.  I do not believe, from a three or four month examination of any of the data which I have seen in the Department of Finance, that the taxation system transfers resources from the better off sections to those who are less able to look after themselves&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Did it take the Minister longer than the Taoiseach to examine the books?  It took the Taoiseach ten minutes to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will treat the matter more seriously than that.  Detailed analysis will show that in some areas, especially education and in tax relief on house mortgages, there is, if anything, a net transfer from lower and middle income groups to the higher income <Col N="1036" /> groups.  I can give case studies in that regard.</P>
      <P>We come to areas of reform which are relevant to the Finance Bill before us and other Bills which will come in the future. Some aspect of the current taxation system can only be described as scandalous. Any Government has a fundamental obligation to ensure that the taxation system is reasonably equitable.  Perhaps the absence of effective direct taxation on some incomes gives rise to a very interesting situation where some people in the community who have money can speculate £40 million in one week on oil shares, on what might come up the stem of a pipe from hundreds of miles out in the Atlantic. Apparently there is no great problem facing some members of the community. One might ask where they get this money.  In the stock exchange there were gains of £8.6 million in one day's trading in one company alone.  That £8.6 million was in respect of the shares of 11 shareholders. Then we are told there is no money here and that we have a fair system of taxation.  We had a situation where £130 million of capitalisation of the Irish oil sector was described as the most prominent boom sector in the economy, or at least on the Dublin Stock Exchange. Where did the money come from?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a property up the street, Seán Lemass House, where one man made a profit of £2.1 million on the purchase and sale of the dwelling, all on an outlay of 10 per cent deposit.  In terms of bank profits, the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks are in the top eight of the world league.  Why?  They are enormously profitable and, despite the recession, are making enormous profits which are not subject to much taxation.  One has to go to trade union members, shop floor members, industrial workers, public sector workers and tell them there is a recession, the Government have no money and we cannot pay for extra expenditure.  You must accept moderation, responsibility and control of your incomes, you will be lucky if you get 8, 9 or 10 per cent.  Simultaneously one can pick up the financial pages of Irish newspapers and it is easy to see signs of conspicuous wealth.  That is why the question <Col N="1037" /> of taxation must be taken on a broad canvas if one is serious about doing something about it and exorcising the scandal which exists in terms of taxation.</P>
    <P>ESRI reports have suggested that proposed taxation measures should be phased in and that a more gradual approach be adopted towards the implementation of the direct tax reform, linking it perhaps with overall progress and reducing the deficit, and to growth and revenue which could arise from exploring other possible sources of taxation.  It is a matter for the Government to decide and also a matter out of which the Opposition can take pleasurable opportunistic short-term gain, if they so wish.  We are all democrats and must all face up to the implications of our actions.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that we could substantially change our taxation system on a phased basis.  We urgently need basic public expenditure revenue to carry through ordinary social programmes while not, simultaneously, making such rapid changes as would increase the consumer price index.  If we are to change value-added tax, this change should be tilted in favour of things bought predominantly by the higher income groups. Admittedly, what we would get in terms of millions of pounds would not be great but it could relate to goods with a very high import content.  Perhaps there should be some investigation in that direction.</P>
    <P>There may be scope for re-examining the category of goods now included in the different bands of value-added tax to see if some luxury goods and goods with a high import content could possibly be shifted to higher bands.  The report of the Committee on Costs and Competitiveness states, on page 25, that increases in indirect taxation implemented in recent years have not been a major contributory factor in relation to the general rate of inflation.  I do not know if one could call the so-called three wise men monitors. They make the useful point that the prices of beer, spirits and cigarettes are between 5 and 11 per cent higher than they would have been if the share of the retail price taken in taxes had remained <Col N="1038" /> unchanged between June 1975 and September 1981.  They also maintain that petrol is actually 4 per cent cheaper than it would have been on a constant percentage tax, which is an interesting point. These figures put the July tax increases into a more sane perspective.  The VAT situation needs to be examined in terms of a movement from direct to indirect taxation. I would be very concerned about the effects which a changeover to direct taxation would have on the consumer price index.  We must do our utmost to avoid that type of general development.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Finance Bill impinges on the current budget deficit, that situation also must be examined.  Deputy Haughey believes that academics should stick to their academies.  That was his famous retort to Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a political realist and I hope that I am honest.  There is need to eliminate the current budget deficit. I am, however, not so sure that one should try to eliminate it in one fell swoop over three or four years.  It should be slightly longer, certainly not longer than five.  One must assess the extent to which the recession is likely to last.  It has lasted longer and bitten deeper than many of us anticipated.  Unemployment figures are <Col N="1039" /> not likely to be reduced dramatically in the months ahead and they are now running at 10 per cent of our labour force.  It may be that an alternative strategy of phasing out the current budget deficit over a slightly longer period would not impose further hardship on our people in terms of adopting the correct budget strategy.  This is something of which the Opposition will probably want to make hay.</P>
      <P>While looking for a fairer system of taxation the political obligation is on us of deciding where the money comes from.  Tax reliefs on non-mortgage interest should be examined.  Here I am talking on an entirely personal basis and throwing out ideas which might be examined on a general basis because we should be politically honest.  Fianna Fáil have great difficulty in understanding the present Government because we talk honestly about issues.  I am speaking about one of the issues which we should examine under the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>Much of the tax interest reliefs on non-mortgage interest goes into, for example, the purchase of motor cars which here have a massively high import content, affecting considerably our balance of payments.  Also, nominal interest rates are below the rate of inflation, which gives a negative real interest return or rate.  There is a case for examining in the years ahead whether or not it is wise to continue subsidising a negative rate of interest on an unspecified range of items, with cars as an example.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I own a 1964 house with a £3,000 mortgage, which at that time was an expensive mortgage.  If I want to buy a holiday home, or to go up market as people do, I get tax relief.  Is it socially or morally just that that special favoured tax treatment should be given to those with money while, at the same time, there are 27,000 families on the waiting lists of our local authorities who have no house of their own tonight and are either accommodated by in-laws or in lousy flats for which they pay £25 or £30 a week minimum rent?  Last weekend in Dún Laoghaire I met a young married couple who are paying £45 a week out of an income of £85 a week for three rooms plus gas and electricity on top of that. There is no 9 ft. by 10 ft. room available in Dún Laoghaire for a young married couple at less then £25 per week minimum rent.  I often wonder if landlords declare such incomes for tax purposes. While that is going on we give tax relief to someone who wants to go away up market and might be in a position to screw a bank, a building society or a commercial finance undertaking for a loan of £25,000 or £45,000 on top of their previous mortgage and get tax relief for it.  We have to examine this; I am not making proposals at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to quote what Paul Tansey said, by way of support. In the course of an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> Paul Tansey pointed out in relation to tax relief on house mortgages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average price of new houses on <Col N="1041" /> which loans were granted in 1973 was £7,095.  A young couple buying their first house that year might have paid about £6,000 for their home.  With a deosit of £1,000, they would have required £5,000 in loan finance to purchase their house, representing a mortgage of 83 per cent.</P>
    <P>At mortgage rates prevailing in 1973, gross monthly repayments before tax relief would have come to £49 a month on a 20-year mortgage. Eight years ago, when the average yearly earnings in industry were less than £1,500, this represented a substantial sum.</P>
    <P>However, in 1981 the average annual repayments on a £5,000 mortgage taken out in 1973 would be only £67 a month before tax relief, despite the fact that mortgage rates have risen sharply in the intervening period.  With average earnings in industry running at about £6,000 a year at present, it can be seen clearly that the burden of monthly repayments has diminished severely.</P>
    <P>He went on in that article to give other interesting examples and he concluded, as we all know, that the best possible investment for anybody here is in buying one's own house or property because of the tax relief available and the extent to which property appreciates.</P>
    <P>I should like to give another example. If one were to abolish tax relief for persons who bought houses up to ten years ago I do not believe the hardship would be a major factor.  Present repayments on a loan of £7,000 which would have been adequate to buy a house costing £9,000 seven years ago and which would be worth £30,000 today would be £100 per month.  This level of repayment on a house is below current rents charged for small flats in many areas and, therefore, the question of hardship would be relative. I have made those points because there are a number of anomalies in the taxation system.  I do not believe one should give relief where people want to massively up-trade in the house property market.  I do not think it should be permitted. I do not think one should give tax <Col N="1042" /> relief to people who want to buy holiday homes or other aspects of property.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude my comments on that aspect of my reaction by referring to the very interesting report of An Foras Forbartha. I should state that the reason I have a particular interest in the housing end is that I am a member of Dublin County Council.  As chairman of that body last year I signed many contracts for house building.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State should not resign his seat on the county council just yet, if he has not resigned already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that about 80 per cent of new house building in the Dublin area in recent years consisted by and large, of detached houses, four bedroom houses geared quite an extent to the up-market end.  We should consider the extent to which that kind of development has absorbed land, skilled labour and mortgage finance in the greater Dublin area.  That should be geared&mdash;the taxation system can do this&mdash;to the 8,000 or 9,000 young families in Dublin who do not have any house at all and cannot afford mortgage repayments of £260 to £350 per month.  That would be a crucifiction.  If we are to use scarce national resources we must use them in a direction to help those who are least well off.  That is what I call social democracy, that is what I call christianity. I know that the political reaction from many people who have loans will be: &ldquo;You are not going to interfere with my tax relief.  What I have I hold because I had to pay through the nose when I became a householder early on in life&rdquo;. The reaction would be: &ldquo;We do not want to make any great sacrifice&rdquo;.  However, if the sacrifice is not made then the country as a whole cannot eliminate the kind of poverty I have spoken of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some other aspects in relation to the Finance Bill deserving of comment. There is a bank levy in the Bill and the banks are being asked to make a contribution to tax revenue through a special levy.  It has been suggested that this is only a temporary measure pending <Col N="1043" /> the review of the taxation system affecting banks generally.  I hope that the Commission on Taxation examines in depth the taxation of financial institutions generally. I look forward to receiving that report.  There is a great need to examine the method of taxation of banks in that regard.  With regard to housing and the banks, I believe there is a need to examine why certain staffs of financial institutions get house loans at 3 per cent or 4 per cent.  I appreciate that mobility is a question.  Should it be taxed as a benefit in kind?  Why should certain staffs of financial institutions, lending institutions, hire-purchase institutions, perhaps, the staff of the Central Bank, or pension companies get preferential treatment over and above the unfortunate young married couple who have to pay through the nose to building societies? They must pay the full rate.  Why should that be done?  Is that not a source of concern, of friction between certain sections of the community?  Should it be taxed as a benefit in kind or not?</P>
    <P>I pose that as a question.  It will be argued that these are conditions of employment which staff have managed to accumulate.  I have no objection to any bank giving a 3 per cent or 4 per cent house loan to an employee.  But I do not see why State money or public money should be used to enable the banks to do so.  If the banks want to negotiate the finest conditions of employment with their staff, so be it.  That would be the outcome of trade union negotiations.  But it should not be done at the expense of my having to pay higher bank charges to enable it to be done.  These are fundamental issues that we should consider under a Finance Bill.  I know that I will bring the wrath of some staffs down on my head for raising the issue.  But it is an issue that has to be faced.  I am not suggesting that this Government are necessarily going to face it or that the previous Government faced it.  But to get back to the bank levy, I believe that next year we should look for £25 million and make no apology therefor.</P>
    <P>I believe that our financial institutions here, which can afford to build massive <Col N="1044" /> office blocks and invest in substantial properties, can also afford to fund part of State finances without necessarily increasing their charges.  That is my suggestion and I would stress that it is only a personal view.</P>
    <P>In terms of capital taxation the yield should be about £100 million next year. I do not think it would be very difficult to get it.  For example, the question of tapering relief under the capital gains tax code should be amended.  We should amend the roll-over relief provision which was available under capital gains taxation. Where a developer gets a re-zoning of agricultural land worth £3,500 an acre in County Dublin automatically with one stroke of a pen and the value of the land goes up to £35,000 an acre, there should be a penal tax on the profits of that land if it is sold.  Overnight that land, without a sod being turned over or a service provided, is worth £35,000 an acre.  I would go further and say that where it happens in relation to the Dublin County Development Plan the tax should be made retrospective. I do not believe that we should go around collecting direct and indirect tax, VAT, PAYE, social insurance and income tax and providing roads, sanitary services, water supplies, power connections&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The airport is in a class of its own.  All these services are provided right up to farmland and then the man who happens to own these farmlands automatically gets the benefit of State expenditure.  That should not be permitted.  I know of no country in the world, including America, where this is allowed to happen.  Even under Ronald Reagan, Americans pay through the nose in tax on their property.  On that kind of transaction tax should be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would impose a tax on derelict building sites in urban areas and in rural areas. It is outrageous that somebody can buy a building, say, a domestic building, pay no rates on it, let it go to rack and ruin, crumble away&mdash;the local authority try to get out of an enforcement order to keep it in sanitary condition &mdash; it does not cost <Col N="1045" /> a shilling and it appreciates at 30 per cent per annum.  It is an investment lying there with nobody living in it and no tax being paid on it.  Derelict sites and unused buildings should be taxed at a percentage of their market value and that percentage should be such as to discourage leaving premises vacant.</P>
    <P>In regard to farm taxation we are again in hot water because every time we increase taxation it involves individual families and so on.  If we are going to continue with the current prospective yield from farm taxation, we might as well abolish it, because the yield this year is about £50 million.  It probably costs a fortune to collect.  There are 159,000 full-time farmers in the country paying £50 million in income tax.  If we are going to be serious about farm taxation we have to look at the years ahead, not just the current year which is a year of depression.</P>

      <P>If we are to have equity between one section of the community and another &mdash; and no doubt farm incomes will improve during the years ahead and the current recession in incomes will pass &mdash; it is absolutely essential that all incomes should be taxed on a fair and objective basis.  That is why I have always advocated the farm accounts system.  I make that point even though I <Col N="1047" /> can appreciate that it might get a severe reaction.  Indeed I would make the overall point that in 1980 the total State expenditure on agriculture was £227 million and in 1981 it was £310 million.  So some of the figures and some of the arguments currently being used have to be relevant.  It is arguable that the current agitation in relation to a particular State bank under the auspices of the Department of Finance is counter-productive because the last thing on earth which any farmer here should want to see happen is a drifting away into the hands of the commercial banks if the equity base of, say, the Agricultural Credit Corporation could be disfigured because of such agitation. So I think that agitation is wholly misguided and wholly undesirable.  It is counter-productive and it will be seen to be such.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of comment in the House about the £9.60 payment under the Finance Bill.  This is payable to the wife who works at home.  We have been told that this is an unwarranted intervention in family affairs.  It is no more than a small recognition of the reality that many women work at home.  Housework by a housewife is work.  The State is providing a system whereby couples can arrange if they wish that the partner who works at home will have some money in his or her right.  It has nothing to do with the argument of Deputy Haughey that all this will diminish family responsibility.  It is an enlightened change.  The £9.60 is very modest but on balance it is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>With regard to VAT why should various services be emempt from this tax? Why should the bloodstock industry be exempt from VAT?  Barristers go to court and charge fees for services rendered but this is totally exempt from VAT.  Doctors and dentists do not pay VAT.  Why not? Is it fair to other people who have to pay VAT?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are so short of money for social welfare I am not so sure that in relation to the Finance Bill and indirect taxation we have not reached the stage of diminishing returns in terms of duty on alcohol.  We spend about <Col N="1048" /> £2,500,000 a day on alcohol but there are limits to the extent it can be taxed.  We also spend a lot of money on other things. We spend about £300 million a year on chartered holidays abroad.  If we are looking for £15 million and we impose a 5 per cent surcharge on such holidays we will get £15 million from it.  I would like to spend £15 million on the elderly and the deprived in any constituency in the country.  One assumes that chartered holidays are discretionary and I do not believe that a 5 per cent surcharge will deter a person from going on such a holiday. I am not suggesting that this be formally introduced but it is something that might be considered.  We are great at spending money but nobody has any suggestion about measures which might bring in taxation increases for such expenditure.</P>
    <P>In relation to sources of State revenue it should be appreciated that future budgets will be enormously constrained because we have virtually dismantled the main sources of central Government tax revenue.  We have abolished rates and, for all practical purposes, we have abolished capital taxation.  We have abolished wealth tax and we have abolished capital acquisitions tax for all practical purposes. We are now stuck with customs and excise duties, income tax and VAT.  We have failed to broaden the base of taxation to pay for essential services.  In 1981 32.6 per cent of all Government tax revenue is represented by customs and excise duty.  Capital taxation is represented by 0.5 per cent this year.  One wonders if we should even bother collecting this tax as it is presently structured. Stamp duty yields 2 per cent and income tax 36 per cent.  Corporation tax is very low.  The 10 per cent which this collected represents 6.7 per cent of the total State revenue.  That is very little. We get approximately 18 per cent from VAT for State revenue.  Agricultural levies yield 0.2 per cent and motor vehicle duty yields 1.3 per cent.  The country is very dependent on about three sources of revenue to pay for the money we give to old age pensioners and other social welfare benefits as well as payments we give to farmers in the current recession. <Col N="1049" /> There is a very urgent need to consider the whole question of resources of taxation.</P>
    <P>The only safe person to quote at this stage in relation to the Finance Bill and the general reaction to it is a bishop I particularly admire in relation to his political attitudes, Bishop Cathal Daly. A newspaper report reporting Bishop Cathal Daly's last Lenten address said:</P>
    <P>Quoting the words of James Connolly, Dr. Daly said that the man who was bubbling over with love and enthusiasm for Ireland, and yet would pass unmoved through out streets without burning to end all the wrong and suffering, was &ldquo;a fraud and a liar in his heart&rdquo;.  For too long we had encouraged the politics of promise, the Bishop said.  We had voted for politicians who promised the most for us or our interest group, he said.</P>
    <P>The newspaper report said that Bishop Daly went on to ask how seldom were matters of social justice or a fair deal for the poor made into election issues.  He asked how seldom and by how few politicians were elections made an occasion for challenging the social conscience of our people to build a just society.  He went on to ask would voters think of asking the candidates in an election where they and their parties stood in respect of Government aid to the Third World.  He said what was called a recession in Ireland would be unimaginable prosperity for millions in the Third World.</P>
    <P>He asked if voters would ask politicians for a specific commitment regarding old age and windows pensions, increased welfare benefits for deserted wives and single parent families.  He asked would we raise with politicians the question of the forgotten men and women who are homeless, who sleep and live rough, and would we ask the politicians where they stand on matters concerning drink legislation and our drinking and driving laws, their impartial application and interference-free enforcement.  He concluded with the saying that there are no votes in education. He asked were we prepared to make an issue of adequate budgetary provision <Col N="1050" /> for all levels of education and all types of schools and for services to young people. The heading in <i>The Irish Press</i> was, &ldquo;Bishop attacks the `politics of promise' &rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Fianna Fáil manifesto was published in 1977, it epitomised all that was worst in our society in terms of the politics of promise. The former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, succeeded in running Jack Lynch out of office towards the end of 1979.  One of those implementing that policy, my constituency colleague Deputy O'Donoghue, was pilloried by the aspiring leader of the party as the man who was responsible for the manifesto.  He ran him out of the Department of Economic Planning and Development and then he abolished that Department, which was an absolute catastrophe from the point of view of social and economic planning.  He then came in here and said: &ldquo;It is all changed.  I am not a politician of the politics of promise.  They were the academics of 1977 and that was their manifesto.&rdquo;  He went on television and spelled that out to the Irish people and, within six months, he epitomised everything that Bishop Cathal Daly attacked. For 12 months nothing was sacred.  Political promises were made without any effort to introduce parallel taxation provisions.</P>
      <P>Later in the year we will need Supplementary Estimates to cover social welfare payments.  I had to bring in a Supplementary Estimate for the State Laboratory today because last January, to get the books right for the budget which was to precede the general election, the general estimates were cut by another 5 per cent. The Stardust disaster intervened and we did not have the general election until later.  The figures then began to emerge. This Finance Bill deals only partially with the problem.  The budget deficit is now £1,100 million even after all we did.  The Irish people did not welcome what we did but, if we are kicked out of office, we may go down in history&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have no intention to leaving for a long time, but at least we have the record of putting it straight to the Irish people that these are the realities of taxation and income.  If you want to pay for social welfare, health, job creation and all the other programmes about which all politicians make promises at election time, they have to be paid for out of our own resources.  They cannot be paid for out of taxation on booze, or VAT and income tax.  The taxation base must be broadened.  That is my message today.  If we broaden it we will have a fair society, not a society based on sectional greed, sectional increases and a free for all where the wealthy, the strong, whether or not they are in trade unions, and the large farmers dominate the market place.  We have to change that kind of society.  I am convinced there are some politicians who can do that.  Provided we get rid of the kind of nonsense I exposed in relation to Knock, and provided other outrageous projects are stopped and public money is spent with public accountability and sanity in terms of their cost benefit to the nation, we can achieve full employment and build a fair and just society.</P>
      <P>I have outlined taxation issues which I believe are important.  I want to put on record a word I used last Sunday.  I was revolted at the mendacity of the previous regime in the non-provision of money for projects which were gaily trotted out like confetti at a toucher's wedding.  After 13 years in this House that disgusted me and I wanted to react against it in the debate on this Finance Bill as strongly as I have reacted against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not give me any particular pleasure to speak on the Finance (No. 2) Bill, 1981.  Unaccustomed as I am to speaking from this side of the House and from this bench, I wish to state that the act of the Minister of State is very hard to follow.  Since his involvement in the Gaiety Theatre last June or July, and having regard to the <Col N="1052" /> fine performance he gave there, they say in theatrical circles that he is second only to the late Jimmy O'Dea.  He gave another performance here today.  I wondered what Ministry he was in charge of. It is seldom that I have to bother Deputy Desmond with my representations as a Deputy.  He has assured us here today that he reads reports.  If that is his sole duty and responsibility he will be doing a good day's work.  Unlike other reports sent to the Department of Finance they will not gather very much dust while he is there.  He has so little responsibility for the day-to-day running of the Department of Finance that he has plenty of time to browse through the books.</P>
      <P>Today he expressed many views which he states are personal views.  I find it very hard to differentiate between the personal views of Deputy Desmond and those he expresses as a Minister with responsibility for a Department.  To me that is a characteristic of this Government. What they say at party meetings or in the House are personal views which do not reflect the thinking or the philosophy of the party or the Cabinet.  It reminds me of a speech that was not delivered but which was circulated by Deputy Kelly to the Claremorris Chamber of Commerce some time ago.  The speech was issued to the media &mdash; it appears the first requisite of this Government is to get their speeches to the media and then to make the speeches &mdash; but the Minister when he went to Claremorris found a very unresponsive gathering.  He was advised by senior members of Fine Gael who were members of that Chamber of Commerce that it would be ill-advised to deliver the now infamous &ldquo;piglets&rdquo; speech.  I understand the Minister was quite annoyed and irked but he could not stop the media publishing the speech.  It is now history that the wrath of his leader, of Deputy O'Leary and others fell on the Minister's head.  Reports of the speech were received with shock.  I remember at the time I had a complete inability to understand the philosophy and the mentality behind the statements in that speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to go back in time to understand what happened.  At one time <Col N="1053" /> Deputy Kelly made a speech saying that when Fine Gael got back into office they would bring back car tax but the leader of the party, I think Deputy Dr. FitzGerald, stated it was not Fine Gael policy.  I think I am correct in this.  What happened when they got into office?  We found that the statement of their frontbench member, Deputy Kelly, became Government policy.  If the speech he made in Opposition, and which was disowned by his own leader at that time, now becomes Government policy what will happen to the philosophies and the theories expressed in a speech prepared for the Claremorris Chamber of Commerce?  I would say that speech was more right-wing than statements of Ronald Reagan, President of the United States and Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister of Great Britain.</P>

      <P>It was an extremely right-wing speech and it put fear and trepidation into the hearts of my constituents and all the people.  I do not wish to take in isolation sentences or views expressed in that speech but the general philosophy was that we should get rid of social welfare and State housing and that each of us should become more self-dependent. Yet, the Bill before the House indicates clearly where the Government stand and because of the imposition of heavy taxation it will not allow people to help themselves.  We had the thoughts of Deputy Kelly, the Rasputin and the guru of the Coalition.  His thoughts were set out clearly in that infamous speech at Claremorris.</P>
      <P>Today we heard the views of Deputy Desmond, not as senior a member of the Government as Deputy Kelly.  He has expressed many views today that will cause fear and trepidation to many sectors of the community.  However, he has said that the views he expressed are personal views.  We have two conflicting gurus: the guru of the Labour Party &mdash; as our leader said, the once great Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The comment was made by John Healy in <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash; I think I am correct in attributing that comment to him.  I have said before and I repeat now, there are more socialists and socialist policies in Fianna Fáil than were ever in the Labour Party.

I am proud to be one of those members from a rural constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The many views expressed by the Minister of State today will be analysed in the days and weeks to come.  They provide considerable food for thought.  There is little point in making comment on what he said because he said they were his personal views.  I always thought that personal views of Deputies were reserved for humble backbenchers like myself.  We can express our personal views on legislation. When Fianna Fáil were in Government I expressed personal views on many occasions but when a Deputy takes on the responsibility even of a junior Ministry the views he expresses should no longer be personal but should be the philosophy of the Government in which he serves.  That was the norm when we were in Government and it will be the practice when we return to office.  When Minister speak they do so with responsibility and as Ministers.  They do not, or should not, express personal views, which they rush to disown or to pull back from, as was the case of the infamous <Col N="1055" /> Claremorris speech which was disowned by the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>This speech which the Minister did not make was very important especially when we see the Coalition housing philosophy.  Young people cannot get a county council loan unless they are married.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;piglet&rdquo; speech referred to self-help, do your own thing, build your own homes &mdash; a fine philosophy &mdash; provided you can get assistance from a State agency.  Young people do not have large sums they can call on, or wealthy parents or relatives to help them build their houses.  To a great extent they rely on the State for financial help.  What did the Coalition do in government?  After two or three weeks in office they decided to remove the £3,000 subsidy for single people, first-time builders or house buyers. We announced at the 1981 Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis that this scheme would apply to all first time builders or buyers. We did not deny that subsidy to single people.  The Coalition are prepared to give the £1,000 grant &mdash; very generous of them.</P>
      <P>Now the young people apply to the county council for loans and they are asked if they are getting married.  If the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, they cannot get the loan. This would be amusing if it were not so serious.  The public found it very hard to believe this and the media, in a sense, are ignoring this injustice.  If the applicants are getting married they have to go to the parish priest for a letter saying their intentions are honourable and that they intend to get married within 12 months.</P>
      <P>Recently a priest asked a couple if he had to fill in a standard form.  Perhaps the Minister would arrange for the Cabinet to provide forms which the clergyman &mdash; a Roman Catholic priest, a Protestant gentleman or another person responsible for giving the letter &mdash; could fill in.  When the couple have the letter they go back to the county council and they are told they will be given the loan provided they both supply a P60.  If their joint income is under £7,000 the loan will be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody will appreciate that it is embarrassing to have to ask a boyfriend <Col N="1059" /> or girlfiend how much he or she is earning. That question was never asked when I was looking for a wife.  To have to ask a boyfriend or girlfriend to provide their P60 is a serious invasion of privacy.  I am not making this up.  This is a measure the Coalition are implementing.  How could relatively sane Ministers like Deputy Kelly stand over this kind of philosophy.</P>
    <P>As I said, the couple looking for a county council loan must have a joint income of less than £7,000, although they realise that after they marry they may have only one income &mdash; of course, the wife might get her £9.60 some time, which would be a great help in repaying a county council mortgage costing perhaps £30 a week.  Before the money can be paid over &mdash; and this is the catch &mdash; they have to produce their marriage certificate. Then they will get the county council loan.  There is no way the house will be available at that stage.  What housing agency would build a house for a couple intending to marry, and who would only get their loans after they were married?  These conditions will eventually be cited in annulment cases because this is interfering with our marriage system. Couples now have to produce letters, P60s, fill in forms, have the house built in two names and they have to get married.  It is a new system of shotgun weddings with the bank manager putting a gun to their heads.  If they do not get married they do not get the loan.  What kind of pressure are the Coalition putting on people today?</P>
    <P>It galled me when I read the advertisements issued by Fine Gael during the election campaign.  As classic examples of misleading advertisements one could not get better.  Maybe the Minister did not read them, but in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 31 May 1981 the headline read &ldquo;Give us a chance&rdquo;.  The leader of the Coalition Government, Deputy FitzGerald, was surrounded by young people who felt he would do something for them. What has he done?  He removed the subsidy which we introduced to help first-time house purchasers and builders to get their houses and to get married.  How much responsibility must he accept for a <Col N="1060" /> Government which brings in those conditions.</P>
    <P>Some days before the general election Fine Gael published an advertisement in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> stating that there would be a £4,000 housing grant for first-time buyers.  They also referred to a pay-related home mortgages scheme and apparently there is a proposal to introduce this at some stage.  Perhaps Fine Gael had to break their commitment when they joined with Labour in government. There is no doubt that they had given a clear commitment to young people that they would continue to pay the £3,000 subsidy plus the £1,000 grant. They did not state that they would remove the £14,000 loan from young people.  At a meeting of Roscommon County Council I said that I would launch my own crusade to rectify the situation and use every opportunity to highlight this abuse of power.  The Minister opposite may deny what I am saying because he is dealing with individuals who have not been affected by these decisions.  I appeal to him to change back to the rules which applied under the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <P>When that time comes I will make every effort to ensure that these restrictions are lifted.  I am publicly committed to this and when our spokesman on the environment returns as Minister we will be back to a situation of helping people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no apologies to make for detailing cases in my constituency because I have been elected to express the views and fears of people in an effort to change the policies of this Government.  As a <Col N="1064" /> rural Deputy, my views may differ from those of the Minister opposite and I make no apology for raising these sensitive issues.</P>
    <P>I advise the Minister to take a strong dose of realism and then come down to a constituency in Roscommon to make a speech.  Naturally he will not be invited to a Fianna Fáil dinner.</P>
    <P>The policies announced by Fine Gael during the election compaign have not been realised, and throughout the country there is a strong feeling of disgust and despair because of those broken promises. I deliberately do not refer to Labour because Fine Gael were stronger on the ground in my constituency and they are the bigger party in the Coalition.  I have not referred to Labour's policies because they did not put up a candidate in my constituency.  I have been highlighting the misleading advertisements of Fine Gael.  Their housing policy will cause serious unemployment in the building industry in the next 12 months and I suggest that between 1,200 and 1,400 jobs will be lost straight away.  This is a sad comment on Fine Gael's advertisement in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 31 May: &ldquo;Let us stop the rot now: Fine Gael will create new jobs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They have not done so since they came into office.  On the contrary, in his budget speech and in the Finance Bill Deputy Bruton has restricted recruitment to the public service, thereby cutting off job opportunities for young people in that area.  So where are the new jobs Fine Gael were to create?  The evidence can be seen in Tuam where Fine Gael policy means that there will be 280 more people on the dole in 12 months.  That is some job creation, some record.  The people of Tuam last summer were misled into voting for them and now they see the result. Unemployment in the west is soaring and will continue to soar because Fine Gael are convinced that the monetarist policies of Prime Minister Thatcher in England will succeed here, that the more unemployment that is created the greater the recovery will be in the economy.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised at the philosophy of the Minister now in the House but I suggest to him that if he does not do something <Col N="1065" /> quickly unemployment will be in the region of 150,000 by early next year. Is that not the unacceptable face of Fine Gael policy and Coalition mismanagement? As I have said, the budget and the Finance Bill debar recruitment in the public service and in semi-State agencies, evidence of which can be seen in the operations of the Irish Sugar Company in the west.  All we can do is hope that the Government will change course.  They must be concerned at the soaring level of unemployment.  I suppose the Minister is well able to justify rising prices, but surely the people in his constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy came a cropper the last time he referred to my constituency. He would be well advised not to get back on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no people unemployed in his constituency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Why then did the Minister put a ban on recruitment to the public service?  It was a serious decision for the Government to take because of its serious effect on employment.  We are facing a winter when more young people will be on the dole queues.  Unemployment assistance is totally inadequate, and another undesirable aspect is the requirement that young men and women looking for jobs have to go to Garda stations to sign on.  Does Deputy Flaherty, described as the Minister for Poverty, agree with that requirement?  Hers was an appropriate Ministry to appoint in these days of widespread poverty.  Young single women deserve better than to have to go along to Garda stations to sign on the employment register.  It is not a criminal thing to be unemployed and the Garda have a lot to do already detecting crime and apprehending criminals.  Will the Minister in charge of poverty at least give some consideration to this?  It is bad enough to be unemployed but it is completely undesirable that young men and women should have to go to Garda stations to sign on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> More people will find themselves in this situation in the next 12 months, particularly young people who if they have not obtained jobs may be on the dole queue for a long time.  We must be concerned about this position.  The Government would be unfeeling if they were not concerned at the plight of such people. The should do something about this. They should try to create jobs and have a youth employment scheme.  In our first months in office in 1977 we were faced with a serious situation and set about bringing forward policies which helped to alleviate the situation.  In 1981 we lost office but since the Government have taken over they have not taken any steps to create jobs.  I have already highlighted that.</P>
    <P>Going away from the major social problem, unemployment, to discuss a Constitution which is quite adequate is the wrong thing to do and the Government should come back on the right track as soon as possible and concentrate the combined wisdom of the Cabinet and their adviser, Mr. Alexis FitzGerald, to consider ways and means of creating jobs.  The situation is serious and people have very little confidence in them. During our tenure in office we were prepared to borrow money to invest in job creation.  It is honourable and justifiable to borrow money to create jobs and wealth.  It is a good investment.  The policy of the Government, where they feel they are not in a position to borrow and do not wish to do so, should be reconsidered. When we were in Government if I went to different Departments for grant assistance for building advance factories and so on in any part of my constituency the Minister did not say: &ldquo;Deputy, the money for that has to be borrowed&rdquo;.  We knew it had to be borrowed but we borrowed it for constructive purposes.  We built schools and factories and provided sewerage and water schemes.  They were good investments and will repay in time. That policy was right and justified.  It was a policy of progress.  The present policy of cut back in public expenditure is a negative approach to planning and to the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>In rural areas the effects of the present <Col N="1067" /> inflationary policy of the Government are more evident than in the eastern part of the country.  Unless there is a sharp change in direction the emigrant ship will start off again.  Where will people go? There is unemployment in Britain, America and other countries.  We stopped that ship and will not allow it to start again.  I hope the Government will see that their policies will lead to massive unemployment and that our young people will have no opportunities to develop their full potential.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy, which will be discussed at Private Members' Time this evening, will create a situation where there will be a serious job loss in the teaching profession.  That is a serious situation. It will put young teachers on the dole queue which has been swelling over the last few months.  I appeal to the Minister for Education to change his philosophy in relation to this.  Not only will it cause job loss in the teaching profession but it will close many two and three teacher schools in rural areas.  If enrolment at four years of age is done away with, many of these schools will not have sufficient numbers to justify having two or three teachers.  I do not know how much consideration was given to this by the Cabinet but in discussing it they must have realised the implications for young children and the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>As regards poverty I should like to congratulate the junior Minister, Deputy Flaherty, an able Deputy who was elevated on her first day in the Dáil.  She has an onerous task.  She was provided with £100,000, a sum of money which would not eliminate hardship or poverty in one county let alone 26.  How can anyone proudly boast that this Government are concerned about poverty when all they have done is appointed a junior Minister, given her a Department, a State car, staff and £100,000 to spend?  She could spend that by giving an increase of 50p to long stay patients in welfare homes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>They will come into that category at some stage.  Long term patients receive £5 a week pocket money. For them the day of having a bottle of stout or a glass of whiskey has gone.  The Minister for rising prices made sure of that.  A packet of cigarettes costs 94p. The Minister would probably say they should not smoke because it affects their health.  These people are 80 years of age and upwards.  They have less than 80p a day to spend.  What can one buy for that today?  <i>The Irish Times</i> costs 30p and other morning papers around 22p.  Those are the types of costs that are involved. They might want to buy a pound of sugar or a loaf of bread or indulge in a luxury such as backing a horse but the Government are making sure such people will not have an opportunity of enjoying their last days.  I ask the Government and the Minister to consider an immediate increase of this allowance to at least £10 a week, which would be modest.  The £100,000 the Minister got this year would merely give an increase of less than 50p to long stay patients.  What would that £100,000 do?  Would it alleviate a poverty which we accept exists, whether this be in the nature of psychological deprivation or whatever?  Would it compensate for the increases which are leaving so many people impoverished or would the Minister for rising prices be satisfied that the increases in the budget are adequate to counteract the increases in prices that he has sanctioned since June 1981?</P>

      <P>I am speaking about the £100,000 which the Government have included in the anti-poverty plan.  We were criticised for abolishing our combat poverty programme but we had other plans for that whole sphere which we would have implemented had we been returned to office.  This £100,000 will not do much to combat poverty and there is poverty now on a scale that has never been known before as a result of the increases sanctioned by the Minister in respect of a large range of commodities. These increases in prices impose a serious burden on the less well off in particular. What effect can an increase of 5p per week have in the face of such increases in prices?  I used to hear at election rallies in the past about the shilling that Fine Gael took off the pensioners but now they are the people who are granting an increase of 5p per week to some social welfare recipients.  Is it any wonder that the Minister should qualify for the title of Minister for rising prices?</P>

      <P>Almost every item that one can think of has been the subject of an increase in price since June last, yet the Government were not embarrassed to give such paltry increases to social welfare recipients.  Perhaps the Minister is not aware of the plight of these people since there are not likely to be many of them in his constituency.</P>

      <P>There are plenty of social welfare recipients in my constituency and if they have problems they are real problems not like the problem of the person the Deputy was talking about a short while ago, the one who did not know whether he wanted to marry or to get the £3,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Social welfare recipients were shocked, as were many others, on receiving the current ESB bills because included in those bills is a 25 per cent surcharge increase.  It is difficult to understand the philosophy of an administration who would allow such an increase to a semi-State body who showed a profit of £6 million this year.  We refused to grant that increase to the ESB when we were in office.  Apart from those depending on social welfare payments there are many others who live in modest homes but who will find it very difficult to pay this extra charge.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that this Government should have a Minister who is responsible for the area of poverty.  We did not need any such Minister when we were in Government. We tried to help the people as much as possible and to alleviate their problems.  We gave social welfare recipients a 25 per cent increase early this year.  That was a realistic increase.  Such people as widows, deserted wives and others are being granted a mere 80p per week increase by this Government.  I look forward to hearing the Minister defend such paltry increases and at the same time to defend the increases in the prices of food, fuel and almost every other commodity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something must be done immediately to counteract those prices so far as the less well off are concerned, even if this means introducing a further supplementary budget this year to increase social welfare payments by between 18 and 20 per cent at least.  The Minister looks as if he is not interested.  He does not think very much about these things.  He wants to debate the Constitution, hanging and such academic things.  Back-bench TDs from rural constituencies are concerned about bread and butter issues, the young <Col N="1071" /> children who cannot go to school staying at home to be looked after and their parents having to stay at home to look after them.  They are not the things that concern Deputy Kelly, Minister for Labour.</P>

      <P>It happened by accident. He had made a few notes before I came into the House and he happened to be here.  He is one of the Ministers in the Cabinet who must be reminded of the realities of life today.  He is living in an ivory tower.  If I was in his Cabinet now I would be advocating an increase across the board for all social welfare recipients of at least 20 per cent to allow for the increases which were contained in the budget and which have been granted since in the mini-budgets which have occurred.  Since this Finance Bill was introduced and announced on 21 July 1981 the situation has changed dramatically. We are concerned about this as working full-time rural Deputies because we are meeting the deprived, the poor, the people who find it very hard to live. I appeal to the Minister for Poverty, Minister of State Deputy Mary Flaherty, that she concern herself with trying to solve the problems in that area by coming out publicly and informing this country where she stands on the relief of poverty in the State.  The one way we will do that <Col N="1072" /> very quickly is at least to give social welfare recipients a decent income at this stage.  People who are unemployed, sick, widows and disabled have not a very strong lobby.  They have no trade union, unfortunately, to act for them.  They have no advocates except us in this House, concerned Deputies who would make their case before this Parliament.  I, for one, am very dissatisfied with the approaches being adopted by this present administration in the alleviation of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We go on to what is not contained in this Finance Bill but which was referred to by Minister of State, Deputy B. Desmond, in relation to the infamous £9.60 per week for the stay-at-home wives of PAYE workers.  This is the greatest &ldquo;con Job&rdquo; of the general election of 1981.  The young married women whose husbands are working and pay PAYE expected this money to come winging its way through the letterboxes, the week after the Government was formed, or at least by the end of July.  They would allow that.  They are still waiting.  They are being told now that they will get it in 1982 in the next Finance Act.  At that stage what will £9.60 be worth in real terms compared with today's values?  Possibly £8 or £7.50 or less.  It must be pointed out also that this £9.60 per week tax credit will not apply to the wife of somebody on unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit or to the wife of a small farmer in the west of Ireland or anywhere else.  When you read the infamous advertisements of the general election campaign in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Tuesday, 2 June 1981 you find: &ldquo;Women deserve better&rdquo;.  I agree with that; women do deserve better.  It goes on: &ldquo;On June 11 you can do something about getting a fair deal by voting Fine Gael.  Here is what the Fine Gael tax proposals will give you.  Wife working at home £9.60 per week tax credit payable direct plus new child benefits&rdquo;.  It goes on to outline what they will get from one child to five children.  &ldquo;Wife on social welfare: full payments for wife and children paid direct&rdquo;.  Nobody has explained that yet.  &ldquo;The Fine Gael programme includes many other benefits to help women in practical ways in Irish society. <Col N="1073" /> Vote Fine Gael, and put them in and put those policies into action&rdquo;.  We are still waiting for those policies to be put into action.  This has been the greatest &ldquo;con job&rdquo; exercised in this country in any general election campaign.  We expected promises, but promises at least should be honoured as quickly as possible.  The wives of many farmers in my constituency and throughout this country were under the impression that they were working at home.  If you ask the wife of a farmer she will tell you what work at home is all about.  This advertisement said, &ldquo;Wife working at home £9.60 per week tax credit payable direct&rdquo;.  The Government are saying that the £9.60 will not be paid to the wife of a farmer because seemingly they do not regard her as working at home.  She sits around the house watching &ldquo;Peyton Place&rdquo; or some other programme on television, or listens to the radio.  She does not work.  It applies only to the wives of PAYE workers.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister, Deputy Kelly, in charge of that Department which deals with unfair descriptions in advertising? Some woman should take the Government to court on that misleading advertisement which was placed before the electorate before the 1981 election.  The urban voters particularly voted in great numbers, feeling that they would get this assistance.  As our leader said, it is an insult to the couple and to married life that the State would interfere between husband and wife.  If the Government propose now to implement this scheme then they must bring it across the board. If it applies to the wife of somebody on PAYE, then it should apply to every wife in this country.  Then you would have fairness and across-the-board payment.</P>
    <P>Regarding misleading advertisements I have just one other point.  I feel it is right to highlight the many cases in which the electorate were misled in 1981.  The classic example of misleading advertisements was published during the election campaign on Friday, 29 May, only eleven days before election time.  It said, &ldquo;can we afford more of the same?  Fine Gael will bring prices under control&rdquo;.  That is the laugh of the century.  That should be <Col N="1074" /> published in every music hall in this country including the Gaiety Theatre.  It would be a characteristic joke in Maureen Potter's &ldquo;Gaels of Laughter&rdquo; if she caricatured the present administration and said, &ldquo;Fine Gael will bring prices under control&rdquo;.  The advertisement went on to say: &ldquo;The Fine Gael anti-inflation plan will subsidise basic food prices&rdquo;. There has been no subsidy.  &ldquo;It will hold ESB, postal and telephone charges down&rdquo;.  Postal and ESB charges have soared since they got in.  &ldquo;We will increase child benefit to £3 per week per child&rdquo;.  This has not been done.  That is the type of misleading advertisement presented to the Irish electorate before the election of 1981.  It is inconceivable how responsible Ministers and a responsible Government could stand over that type of misleading approach to the electorate. It has been the greatest &ldquo;con job&rdquo; and the most cynical exercise ever perpetrated in this State.</P>

      <P>Before I open this debate I have something very serious to raise with the Chair.  On the Order Paper we got this morning there were two amendments, one in the name of the Minister for Education and the other in the name of Deputy Browne.  There has been circulated to us here now, and to Members generally, a different version of what is on today's Order Paper, namely, an amendment in the name of the Minister for Education and an amendment to amendment No. 1 standing in the names of Deputy Browne and Deputy Kemmy, practically the same amendment as Deputy Browne has on today's Order Paper in his own name as an amendment to my motion.  Now it is down as an amendment to amendment No. 1.  This is unprecedented.  I am asking for guidance from the Chair and I want to know what the position is with regard to this.  There is an attempt there to <Col N="1075" /> undermine my resolution and the amendment to amendment No. 1 is a botch of a botch job.  Is there any precedent for this?  I do not believe there is.  Other people, with whom I have consulted, have also indicated that there is no precedent for it.  Is it in order as it is at present?</P>

      <P>I move motion No. 23:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Education to withdraw circular 24/81 and to allow Boards of Management to admit pupils to National Schools in accordance with the regulations obtaining up to 30th September 1981.</P>
      <P>Firstly, I want to let the House know what Circular 24 of 1981 is.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of enabling better organisation of classes</P>
      <P>&mdash;and that, mind you, is the classic introduction&mdash;</P>
      <P>to be affected in national schools the Minister for Education has made the following amendment to Rule 64, which governs the enrolment of pupils:</P>
      <P>(i)  delete existing section (1);</P>
      <P>(ii)  substitute the following as section (1):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Pupils who have not yet reached their fifth birthday may be enrolled only in accordance with the following provisions:</P>
      <P>(i)  pupils may be enrolled, with effect from the previous 1 January, during the course of the week commencing with the second Monday in January, if they have attained their fourth birthday not later than the previous 1 July:</P>
      <P>&mdash;That is a contorted piece of prose&mdash;</P>
      <P>(ii)  pupils may be enrolled, with effect from the following 1 July, during the course of the week ending with the last Friday in June, if they have attained their fourth birthday not later than the previous 1 January.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment will have effect from 1 October 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> That is Circular 24 of 1981, which is the subject matter of this motion.</P>
    <P>The position before 30 September 1981, before Circular 24 of 1981 was issued, was that a child who had reached the age of four years could be enrolled in a national school.  The startling result of this circular is that a child of four, born on 2 July, may not be enrolled in a national school until the following 1 July and will not be admitted to the school until 1 September.  A child whose fourth birthday is 2 January will have to await enrolment in a national school until the following 1 January.  These are facts so stunning that the whole country is up in arms about them.  Emerging from this circular, they were sprung on the public at the end of the school holidays without warning and without consultation with anybody.  One of the most startling aspects of the issue of the circular has been that the managerial boards were not consulted, nor were the teachers, nor the parent's groupings.  There was no consultation whatsoever.  It was simply a ukase coming from the Minister &mdash; flat, let it be so, let this be done &mdash; a ukase that would do credit to the originator of the ukase, the Tsar of Russia.  It has been commented on very adversely by everybody in the educational world, that the Minister has simply chosen to crack his fingers at all who have an interest in the educational scene and not consult them in any way.</P>
    <P>Circular 24 of 1981 is only one example &mdash; there are many others &mdash; of the lack of consultation and of trust in those who are involved in the educational scene with whom we are concerned here tonight. The Minister is into confrontation policies. If there is any one area of national life, social or economic, where confrontation is dangerous and non-productive, it is in education.  Education and learning will not, and cannot, flourish in a situation where there is conflict between the Department of Education and the teachers, conflict between the teachers and the officials, conflict in any way interfering with the smooth running of the school and the educational process.</P>
    <P>We are getting used to it in other spheres as well, but one of the typical <Col N="1082" /> Coalition Government ploys is, somehow or other, to involve the previous Government. I want to read for the House the paragraph at the end of the introduction to the White Paper, because it has been quoted by the Minister to support him in the action which he has taken.  In big print, bigger than the print of the rest of the paragraph, the following words can be read:</P>
    <P>... such indication of Government thinking need not at all inhibit wide ranging discussion since it is nowise intended that the proposals of this White Paper be regarded as rigid or inflexible.</P>
    <P>In that paragraph are the seeds of the type of consultation which is necessary wherever major changes are to be made in the organisation of schools or in education generally.  This consultation did not take place.  The present Minister did not think it worth his while to take into his confidence the professionals in education, to have discussions with them or to come to a consensus on this very important matter.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point which the Minister has made in trying to use Fianna Fáil as a shield when the arrows began to fly at him &mdash; and, mind you, over the past few weeks the arrows have been flying, and deservedly so.  He has claimed that Fianna Fáil policy, as outlined in the White Paper of December 1980, had shown that we intended raising the school entry age for national schools.  This is a lie.  We did not so intend.  Apart from the invitation which I have already mentioned to wide ranging discussion and the abduring of rigid and inflexible proposals, the White Paper said, at paragraph 4(20):</P>
    <P>Attendance at school is compulsory in this country from the age of six to fifteen.  Ireland is, however, virtually unique among European countries in that it makes provision in public primary schools for children from the age of four.  In the normal course of events, children receive their primary education in a single primary school or in a group of such schools on a single site. <Col N="1083" /> At present a child may be enrolled in school as soon as it reaches four years of age.</P>
    <P>The following is the part of the paragraph which I want to read to the House very carefully:</P>
    <P>Enrolments, taking place as they do at different times during the school year, can give rise to difficulties in the organisation of classes and in the provision of an adequate programme for such pupils at junior level.  In future first enrolment of pupils under the age of five will be permitted only on two dates each year, namely the first day of the school year and the first school day ...after they have reached their fourth birthday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;The first school day in January&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;The first school day in January after thay have reached their fourth birthday&rdquo;.  The fact of the matter is that the context in which that was written was of school organisation.  Indeed, the Minister has tried to capture that one for himself also.  What about the pupils I mentioned a moment ago?  I hasten to add that discussion and consultation was to follow upon that with the relevant managerial and teaching bodies and, in fact, had taken place and both bodies were quite satisfied with the tenor and trend of those discussions up to the end of May 1981.  Under the White Paper suggestion the child born on July 2 would be enrolled on the first day of the school year following, no delay at all.  In fact, if the child was born on 31 August the child could be enrolled on 1 September.  This the Minister failed to say when he was talking about what was in the White Paper.  Of course, the emphasis there was on school organisation, the organisation of classes and the provision of an adequate programme &mdash; the words used in the White Paper for junior level pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A totally different emphasis from this is in circular 24/81.  It is blatantly and bloodily designed to save money at the expense of the children of this country <Col N="1084" /> and that is the only motivation, the only purpose of 24/81.  It does not have anything to do with sound educational theory or practice; it does not have anything to do with making a better education available but it has everything to do with saving money and the Minister for Education was sold a pup by the Department of Finance.  This motion is calling on Friedman to go back to Chicago where he belongs, we will not have him on our education scene in Ireland.  The motion also calls on the Minister for Education to stand up to the Minister for Finance and his mandarins in the Department of Finance and reject suggestions that are deleterious to the Irish educational process. A pathetic effort was made to justify the changes on educational grounds.  No educationalist or administrator in the Department of Education advocated this change on educational or any other grounds.  This was pushed on a non-suspecting Minister as soon as he took office, before he could settle down, before he could see through it by the Minister for Finance, heavily nudged panjandrums in order to save money and for no other purpose.</P>
    <P>I should like to read for the House an extract from a speech I made on the budget in July last, as reported in the Official Report, volume 329, column 1023.  The Minister for Finance had said that substantial savings had to be made in Education, Environment and Defence.  That set the alarm bells ringing, as the House may remember, and I was speculating as to where the Minister for Finance thought he might make these savings in Education.  It drew a response from all the teachers unions at that time, the INTO, the TUI, the ASTI and the Irish Federation of University Teachers. They were amazed.  They were shocked to think that we had a Minister for Finance who thought so little about the educational scene that he felt he could make serious cuts in the budget which had been prepared by the outgoing Government. I asked the question:</P>
    <P>Where are those substantial savings to be made which caused such alarm to parent associations and teachers <Col N="1085" /> unions since the Minister made his statement.  There is no room for such savings, as I indicated.  There are rumours of a pay freeze and that the Minister for Education is being pressed to raise the age of entry to primary schools and save 1,700 teaching posts. I hope the Minister will give a commitment that he will not entertain such a suggestion.</P>
    <P>The Minister, however, kept away from that budget debate and we did not get that commitment.  The House, and the country, now know that what I had foreseen at that time was in danger of happening. For that reason I appeal to Members, no matter what party they are in, or support, to give support to my motion and have circular 24/81 thrown out.</P>
    <P>In that budget debate I went on to list other areas where cuts might be made.  If it happened in case one there was no guarantee that they would not go on on capitation grants, on the distance learning project, on school transport and on the charge for post primary education. They all got into the news media and there is no smoke without fire.  At that time I put the House on notice that there was this danger and, mo léan géar, the danger materialised and the Minister put this circular 24/81 into circulation.</P>
    <P>I have said that no educationalist or administrator in the Department of Education could possibly have thought this up.  I spent four years there and I knew their minds.  It just could not come and we know what the views of the Minister for Finance were in the budget.  We know exactly where this came from.  Of course, the Minister for Education has to take responsibility for what has happened but he should remember that when he puts his knees under the Cabinet table he is Education and he must defend Education, even to the point of resigning, if the Minister for Finance pushes on him theories, policies or money cuts he does not agree with.  The considered view of the Department of Education on this whole matter was indicated to me when in office.  It was that the raising of the age of entry would have implications for the school curriculum, school organisation, teacher employment, supply of teachers, <Col N="1086" /> school accommodation, special education for handicapped and socially deprived pupils and might lead to calls for a raising of the school leaving age. That initial statement, in summary, means that the primary school curriculum which had gained the approval and admiration of many educators outside Ireland, as well as at home, was on a four module, two years to each module, basis. It was organised in that way.  The basic philosophy underlying the curriculum takes account of the natural stages of the development of the child.  The content of each of the aforementioned modules has been fixed so as to reflect this philosophy and to ensure logical sequential learning in keeping with these stages.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education's considered opinion was that the eight year minimum period was required for the coverage of the full programme in order to achieve the educational objectives of the curriculum.  It is very carefully and delicately contrived.  The mechanism is delicate and very well thought out.  We have not been told whether it is the intention of the Minister for Education to cut the programme to seven years or to seven and a half years.  A question also arises about the school leaving age because of the compulsory period of education. Many children who follow a three year course to intermediate certificate will not, if they are pushed back, have completed their course until after the school leaving age has been reached.  That brings in the question of raising the school leaving age and also the question of minimum age of employment and, of course, legislation is needed in relation to both of those.</P>
    <P>The change in entry age would mean that in a particular year many schools would find themselves with additional staff.  The staff there would be put on the panel and would from a blockage for those who are at present in the colleges of education.  As the House is aware, the system is that a teacher who is a supernumerary to a staff is put on a panel and has to take a position within a ratio of 28 miles of the school in which he or she has already been teaching.  There are 1,700 teaching posts on the basis of children <Col N="1087" /> starting in primary school at the age of six.  The INTO is vitally concerned in this whole matter and they have circulated the Members of this House with their own findings in this regard on the basis of the change that has been made.  The Minister has the figures before him.  I will refer later on to a very careful survey made by that organisation with regard to teacher employment.</P>
    <P>There are also implications for teacher supply.  The output of our colleges has been about 1,000 per annum for some time and, as the House knows, these were being used to replace those who retired and to improve the pupil-teacher ratio. Fianna Fáil have an excellent record in that regard, having improved the pupil-teacher ratio and improved the schedules for employment in primary schools every year from 1977 to 1981 inclusive.  I want to emphasise the word &ldquo;inclusive&rdquo; because, in the piratical way that members of this Government have, they are arrogating to themselves the credit for doing what the previous Government had already done.  I myself approved of the employment of 300 extra teachers for improving the pupil-teacher ratio and the changing of the schedules.  In fact this had Government approval in the previous administration.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the considered views of the Department of Education.  I want to emphasise that I am not talking about the considered views of the Department of Finance because I know what they are <i>vis-à-vis</i> education. I know what Minister Bruton intends to do.  He intends to cut and pare and take off money at the expense of the children of this country and I hope that the House will realise that if they support my motion they are in fact supporting Minister Boland in the Government.  They will let him know and he will let the Government know and he will let the Minister for Finance know that they cannot monkey about with the finances of education to the detriment of the pupils and students of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> The implications for the physically and mentally handicapped are also very serious. If they do not start school until they are five years of age the effect of the handicap is going to be increased and parents are going to have the burden of having them at home for one or two more years.  In certain handicaps such as Downe's Syndrome the early years are all-important.  As the Ceann Comhairle himself will know, in that disease the growth rate of the brain slows up as the child gets older.  I refer to the Ceann Comhairle's medical expertise.  It must be remembered that education for handicapped children includes a large element of training in social living skills.  Indeed that is highly relevant to the ordinary child and it is highly relevant in the field of the curriculum that was laid down for the four year old and the five year old in the new curriculum of 1971.  It must be remembered that education for handicapped children includes a large element of training in social and living skills as distinct from the normal academic learning and these include personal care and hygiene, social interaction skills and training in self-help and independence. The sooner they are commenced the better.</P>
    <P>In the case of children living in disadvantaged areas one of the reasons for backwardness at school is the lack of stimulation in the home, especially in the earlier years.  I know there are Deputies on all sides of the House who are particularly concerned with this problem of the socially disadvantaged.  I am appealing to all of those, whatever their party, to keep this in mind when voting on this motion, because if those children are not admitted at four years of age and there is no stimulation or very little stimulation in their background they are going to suffer educational disadvantage for the rest of their lives.  This is very important and should be kept in mind by anybody with the interests of those children at heart. There are Deputies in this House, not all of them from my own party, who will realise that bending the rules as far as possible to supply extra teachers in such areas was part of my way of life in the Department of Education and that was <Col N="1089" /> at a time when four year olds were admitted and there was not the problem that has arisen as a result of this circular.</P>
    <P>The question of kindergarten schools and pre-schools has been raised.  Most European countries have pre-schools, a structured type of pre-school with heavy emphasis on cognitive skills.  But there are others which have more of a play school idea of learning through play and so on.  Both ideas are incorporated in the curriculum in use for infants in our schools.  When pressed in this House &mdash; as I often was &mdash; to start specific pre-schools, I always maintained that we were unique in that we admitted children at four years of age and that those children were put under the charge of trained teachers, of people with professional qualifications, with dedication, who very often specialised in infant teaching in the training colleges and the colleges of education and that this was far better than what was available in many European countries.  I still maintain that and will argue it with anybody.  In fact some of the countries in Europe that have a separate pre-school system are thinking of changing over to a unified system along the model that we have had here until the icy fingers of the Minister for Finance, ably abetted and agreed to by the Minister for Education, were laid on the education kitty.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go into details of the estimated savings.  The Department of Finance were pushing for six years and were in fact convinced that over 1,600 teachers salaries could be saved &mdash; they were talking in the context of six year olds.  I would ask Members of the House to read the document that they got from the INTO, which was the result of a survey of all the schools in the country, to get an indication of how many teachers in fact would be out of work as a result of the introduction of this circular.</P>
    <P>Some of the newspapers &mdash; and I am reluctant to go on in a kind of partial or even sectarian basis &mdash; have emphasised the difficulties of Church of Ireland schools which in the main are small schools, particularly in rural areas, and are scattered all over the country.  I do not know if the Minister for Education <Col N="1090" /> has backed off from circular 24/81 so far as Protestant schools are concerned.  I listened to him on the radio last Sunday and he seemed to be either backing off as far as the Protestant or minority schools are concerned or he was backing off over the whole range of two-teacher schools.  I taped what he said and I listened carefully and it seems to me that he seemed to be backing off on the whole range of two-teacher schools.  If he is, thanks be to God.  I ask him to back off the whole thing and revert to the situation of 30 September 1981.</P>

My recollection of the Standing Orders is that, in relation to Private Members' Time, the only time a matter can carry over into the following and subsequent weeks is when a Bill is presented during Private Members' Time.

      <P>I was talking about the uproar in the minority schools when circular 24/81 was circulated and had sufficiently well sunk in.  I quoted from Gullivers' World School Age Protest.  What seems to have had a most depressing effect on parents and teachers is that Dr. Garret FitzGerald as Taoiseach mounted a campaign of friendship towards Protestants when the same Dr. FitzGerald, as the Minister for Education's supervisor, condoned a measure endangering vital Protestant interests.  Will the Minister say what is the exact position of the minority and two-teacher schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The INTO's survey indicated a loss of 921 posts as a result of circular 24/81. This will mean confusion on the panel.  It will mean 28-mile journeys for some teachers when a vacancy occurs.  In a situation where travel costs are escalating as a direct result of Government action, it is no wonder the INTO are worried.  As I said already, the Minister for Education, acting as the agent for the Minister for Finance, has made a savage attack on their position, has refused to have consultations with them and has interrupted a steady improvement in the education <Col N="1093" /> being provided in our national schools. A drop of 36 per cent from 48,065 actual for 1980-81 to an estimated 30,774 in 1982-83 is traumatic for parents, for the pupils, for the teachers and, I venture to suggest to the House, is traumatic for education in our community.</P>
    <P>The House must not tolerate this.  That is why I am appealing with all the passion I can command to people to support my motion and see to it that circular 28/81 is withdrawn, and particularly those who claim to have the interests of children from disadvantaged backgrounds and disadvantaged areas should come forward into the lobby and support this motion.  As I mentioned already where the stimulus is weakest for pupils, where there are problems at home, where motivation is weak there is a school needed with skilled teachers, professionals, to stimulate the pupils and to give them at least in part in the school what they lack at home with regard to educational stimulus.</P>
    <P>The House knows that at the moment many families send two parents out to work and with the steep rise in the cost of living and inflation the pressure for this is greater.  Indeed, with the withdrawal of subsidies in a different area, on mortgages, the pressure is greater for two parents to go out to work.  Consequently, in those cases, mostly through no fault of theirs, there is not enough time for the parents to spend with their children, to stimulate them, to interest them in education, something which will be, without doubt, available to people who are better off because they will understand in the period from four to five years that the stimulation is needed and they will have the money to provide the wherewithal for education playthings, and so on, for their own children.</P>
    <P>With circular 24/81 the Minister is damaging the education of those children for all time.  He should cause this circular to be withdrawn.  It emanated from a highly respected Department, the Department of Finance.  They have their role to play, but so have the Department of Education. The sole role of the Department of Education is to defend the educational <Col N="1094" /> expenditure on and the interests of our children.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies say that if we had a proper pre-school system this would be better.  I maintain that is not so.  I maintain that we have the professionals. Nearly 90 per cent of the teachers are now girls, and they are supposed to have a special strength in teaching infants. Their reactions are quick also.  We have the professionals and we have been using a system in the schools which is unique in Europe and is better than most of the pre-school education being provided.</P>
    <P>Does the House think for one moment that the Minister for Education will be able to go to the Minister for Finance and get £40 million, £50 million, £60 million, £70 million or £80 million to start a new system of pre-school education?  I doubt it, on the evidence we have seen so far. Why not use a system which has been proved and tried and tested?  Why interfere with that system by issuing such a circular as 24/81?  I mentioned the type of pre-schools before.  I am pinning my faith on the professionalism of our teachers, and the particular strengths they have in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the Minister to have a change of heart even at this late stage. We have an enlightened curriculum which is organised in four modules of two years, the first two being concerned with infant education.  Everything is there that is needed for a proper education geared to the stage of development psychologically suited to them.  We have the qualified teachers who have been trained in our colleges of education.  All is available. Let them at it.  Withdraw this dreadful circular.</P>
    <P>From 1977 to 1981 inclusive the P/T ratio was improved through reducing by 2,610 the number of classes with over 40 pupils.  I already mentioned why I say 1981 inclusive.  There is another little gimmick, a ploy by the Government about finance.  I want to tell the House that the outgoing Government had costed education very accurately so far as 1981 was concerned.  A 3.7 per cent increase &mdash; and we have Supplementary Estimates every year &mdash; was all that was <Col N="1095" /> needed.  The Minister has been bragging about a 3.7 per cent increase by way of Supplementary Estimate which was already in train before the Fianna Fáil Government left office.  In the last year in which the Coalition were in office, 1977, the Supplementary Estimate was as much as 4.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>A quick word on the colleges of education. If this circular 24/81 is not withdrawn there is a bleak future for the student teachers being trained at this moment.  The INTO reckon that 484 teachers will be put on the panel as a result of circular 24/81.  All these will have to get positions before new graduates are employed.  The scene is black and depressing.  I am asking the Minister to withdraw circular 24/81.  If he does, their worries will disappear and our educational scene will improve.  The intake is down from 1,078 in 1980 to 900 in 1981. That is a straw in the wind, and a dangerous one.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not listen to the parents, let him listen to the boards of management.  If he does not listen to the teachers in their organisation&mdash;and all four teachers' unions have appealed to him&mdash;perhaps he might listen to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who have roundly condemned circular 24/81.  Being a Dublin man perhaps he might listen to Dublin Corporation.  Perhaps he might listen to the minority religions.  Perhaps, in the secrecy of the cavernous interior of the Department of Education in Marlboro' Street he might listen to his advisers off the record.  He should be fully convinced that the local councils, Dublin Corporation, the ICTU, the parents, the unions, and so on, are right, that 24/81 is a nefarious document and withdraw it.</P>

The welfare of the children, and particularly the young children, should be the kernel of our concern in this area.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I could be listened to with reasonable courtesy.  We did not interrupt.  I suggest with respect that, in the welter of emotion and debate which has surrounded this whole issue, far too little attention has been paid to the educational well-being of young children. The point has been made that the children who will be disbarred, as it were, would benefit from a more highly developed pre-school system.  The Government agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to hand today a document from the Irish Pre-School Playgroups Association in which the Government are asked <Col N="1097" /> to give more attention and more resources to this area.  In a letter dated 2 November 1981 they say:</P>
    <P>Other countries do have higher school starting ages than ours, and there is much to be said educationally for starting formal school later than four.  But it is vital to realise that these are countries where pre-schooling is freely available to every child.</P>
    <P>This is not the case in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government agree that everything is not ideal in the area of pre-school facilities. They are undertaking specific commitments which the Minister will outline in detail tomorrow night but which can be summarised as being a composite, comprehensive set of proposals which will insist on the mandatory regulation of the present completely <i>ad hoc</i> and arbitrary arangements for pre-schooling, the grant-aiding of pre-schools in areas of disadvantage and deprivation.  I consider it deeply offensive for any member of the Opposition to suggest that this Government would be less than totally concerned and committed to such areas of disadvantage or deprivation.  This was, is, and will be until such time as the aims of our party are achieved, the party of the just society.  Despite the jeers and jibes, we will not sacrifice those principles. We believe in them.  Fianna Fáil got their chance to do something in the past four years.  The Government should be given that chance now.</P>
    <P>The approach to pre-schools will include the setting of at least minimal criteria for the establishment of such schools.  We must admit that not all is satisfactory in that area but there will be progress and the commitments are quite specific.  In that context it is perfectly reasonable for the Government to adhere to their proposals to bring about the adjustments they have suggested and which are referred to in the circular which is the kernel of the debate here.</P>
    <P>I am a little perturbed that too little attention has been given to the educational well-being of the children with perhaps an overemphasis on other very <Col N="1098" /> understandable concerns such as the question of jobs for teachers.  I am not new to the classroom myself and I share the concern of those who may fear their jobs are in jeopardy.  There is no reason for anyone to believe that somehow we would sacrifice teachers or wish in any way to disenfranchise or disemploy them. That is not our intention.  I regret also the tone of confrontation that has emerged, particularly from a tradition of loyalty and service to young children which is the symbol of the teacher organisations.  In the context of this discussion it is not inappropriate to pay full credit and to give full respect for the many decades of loyal service to children.</P>
    <P>The most fundamental question raised by the motion we are discussing this evening is not how many teachers go on the panel.  The panel regulations are subject to administrative change and no later than last July a change in the schedules for the appointment and retention of teaching posts meant that a substantial number of teachers who might otherwise have gone on the panel were spared this inconvenience.  It is an important issue but not the central one.  Nor is the central issue the employment prospects of graduates of colleges of education.  We must deal sensibly with fears and anxieties but there are people who would say that those graduates have to some extent been more fortunate than others in our society in that in times of rising unemployment they were virtually guaranteed jobs.  The situation in the future is that jobs will continue to be available arising from retirements and resignations, from growth in the numbers of pupils and from such adjustments as may be feasible as resources become available in the teaching services to national schools.  I do not suppose any Government would be satisfied as long as pupil-teacher ratios would be anything other than minimal, as long as there were teachers in need of jobs who could not be employed.  This Government will make every effort to improve those circumstances.  There is no point in pretending there are easy options, that any Government or party have a magic wand.  We are endeavouring in a genuine way to tackle the many problems <Col N="1099" /> that exist in education and it is on the educational criteria that I want Members of this House to make their judgment, and the audience also.</P>
    <P>Neither is it the central issue whether four-teacher schools become three-teacher schools or three-teacher schools become two-teacher schools.  I do not propose to deal with this aspect other than to say that despite the operation of amalgamation policies for a considerable number of years it is truly remarkable how many smaller schools have managed to survive unscathed.  That is a good thing because the educational value of the smaller schools should not be underestimated. Many issues have obscured the kernel of this debate but we should not allow ourselves to be confused.  The issue is whether the proposal is right for the children from the education point of view.  Many of us in this House and many of the people in the gallery are or have been practising teachers.  I suggest it is utterly unrealistic to maintain that the change as proposed will cause any damage educationally to the children so long as we underline and underscore our concern and our positive action in the area of pre-schooling.</P>
    <P>The structure of training and institutions required for educational development cannot be regarded as in any way similar to that provided in some other countries.  I do not know of any country that sees its schools as centres whose main function is one of custodial care. On occasions like this and in after-dinner speeches, we are wont to say that the primary educator is the parent.  Are we suggesting, as responsible legislators, that a number of extra months in the company of one's parent at this delicate, often traumatic, stage of development could be harmful to the young children?</P>

      <P>What is fundamental &mdash; and I note this was not mentioned by Deputy Wilson &mdash; is whether the raising of the national school entry age will be good for the children generally or detrimental to them.  No amount of pleading <Col N="1100" /> regarding disadvantage, handicap, special groups or any other circumstances alters this question.  Special groups require special measures and the record of all governments in recent times is that they have rarely been tardy in supplying such measures of positive discrimination where the need was clearly established. I give credit to our predecessors on this point.  These measures have been adopted when the special group in question has been clearly identified and when the proposed measures have been seen to be beneficial.  The programme of the Government continues this tradition and is committed to positive discrimination in favour of the disadvantaged and the deprived.  I suggest that if there was one central and simple factor that brought about the change of Government it was the public perception of this Government as being willing and desirous of bringing about such change in favour of people who have less.</P>
      <P>What we are concerned about is the generality of children, the vast majority of children coming from ordinary homes, having concerned and interested parents, growing through the stages of physical, emotional, social and intellectual development of childhood and requiring at each stage the structures that support development appropriate to that stage. Implicit in the motion before us is the suggestion that the home environment or the pre-school environment is so anathema to the well-being of the young child that it is the last place one should leave a child for the extra five or six months. The only measure by which this question should be judged is whether the change in the enrolment regulations is to the benefit of the children.</P>

    <P>I have noted the worth-while research carried out by the INTO and I see their concern expressed in their document. The Minister will deal with that matter in full tomorrow evening.  I ask the teacher organisations, the INTO, the ASTI, the TUI, and others interested to do perhaps more in future, to balance with their professional concern the welfare of the children.  Sometimes that may mean less rhetoric and less emphasis on jobs and promotional prospects &mdash; I admit they <Col N="1101" /> are not ideal in some circumstances &mdash; and more emphasis on the welfare of children.</P>
    <P>The following are seen as the advantages arising from the change and they should be spelled out.  The two fixed entry dates will allow for the better organisation of classes.  Such a change was envisaged in the Fianna Fáil White Paper on Education published in December 1980. Deputy Wilson has endeavoured to throw cold water on that and to back track from it.  Perhaps Deputy Wilson would ask one of his colleagues to say whether I am right in assuming that a White Paper is not some kind of nebulous, vague document for discussion but is a firm set of proposals.  The White Paper published by Deputy Wilson when in Government stated only two enrolment dates, as in the present case, would be allowed in the future.  The exact quotation is:</P>
    <P>In future first enrolment of pupils under the age of five will be permitted only on two dates each year, namely the first day of the school year and the first school day in January after they have reached their fourth birthday.</P>
    <P>Maybe the Deputy is concerned about this, but I honestly think it is a combination of hypocrisy and political chicanery to come in here and try to disown this pledge which was on the table in his name a few months ago and try to belabour this Government and this Minister as if it were our intention&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In working out the details there is room for people of good sense and maturity to be able to make progress. The second advantage is seen to be the following &mdash; numbers cannot be inflated artificially by accepting pupils in the final quarter of the year, and that has happened. Thus all schools will be treated equally from now on as regards teacher supply, and who can deny that that is an advantage?  Thirdly, pupils will have the opportunity of at least seven-and-a-half years in the national school.  Previously there were complaints that children were moving forward in the national school without completing an adequate infants' programme.  Fourthly, pupils will be over 12 years of age on entering post-primary schools.  This is considered preferable to transferring too young.  The INTO themselves, in one of their many worth-while submissions, previously sought an older age of transfer.  Fifthly, anomalies whereby pupils could complete the sixth standard in national schools yet not be of age to go on to post-primary school will be eliminated.  Sixthly, students should be more mature in age when ready to transfer to higher education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Entry to structured schooling at the age of four is most unusual in educational circles.  In the Community countries, for example Germany, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, France and Luxembourg, all have a starting age of six.  Denmark starts at seven and in the UK there is provision for those over five.  Most of the authorities of these countries &mdash;and the former Minister is familiar with his European colleagues' views &mdash; express surprise at <Col N="1103" /> the age at which children enter structured schooling in this country.</P>
    <P>For these and other sound reasons there is a great deal that is positive about the proposal and it is utterly lamentable, and probably irresponsible, for any former Minister for Education, who must have a specialised expertise in this area, to come here and pretend that a proposal by the Minister for Education is all black. That is irresponsible but it is precisely the tone of opposition which has been set by Fianna Fáil since the change of Government &mdash; not one scintilla of constructive criticism but black, negative, reactionary, destructive criticism.</P>

      <P>The primary school is a structured community with explicit intellectual goals and presents a challenging environment to the young child.  Despite the belief in and advocacy of child-centred methodology, the very ethos of a school presents difficulties for the young child.  Faced with separation from parents and the familiar things of home, the sudden precipitation into an unfamiliar institutional setting surrounded by unfamiliar faces, gaining only a small fraction of the adult attention to which he was hitherto accustomed, the child can, and sometimes does, experience bewilderment and anxiety on an unimaginable scale.  The teachers at national level would be the first to admit that that is a fact.  The parent too can suffer from the pangs of too early separation and a troubled consciousness of what the child is experiencing.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that a note of derision arises when one refers to <Col N="1104" /> the needs of parents in this area.  There is little doubt that the daily routine of a child changes abruptly when he enters school, and even though the school has a lot to offer him, it can only do so within certain constraints.  Not the least of these constraints is the pressure parents exert on school practice by their expectation that the child make quick progress in areas such as reading and mathematics. The celebrated Plowden Report devoted considerable attention to this particular question and I quote:</P>
      <P>If more flexible part or full-time entry was permitted during a child's first year at school, he or she would be ready to accept compulsory education at six.</P>
      <P>In the same report a country inspector is quoted as follows &mdash; and he mirrors the experience of many of our own inspectors:</P>
      <P>The present arrangement of full-time education at five is too abrupt a transition from home.</P>
      <P>while a headmaster says:</P>
      <P>Many children who begin their school life at five find the full school day too long and show signs of fatigue. Some others show marked signs of strain.</P>
      <P>Can any teacher deny the truth of that?</P>
      <P>Of course the Plowden Report was discussing children in our neighbouring island &mdash; you will note the concentration on five not on four-and-a-half and four &mdash; and can we seriously contend that our society is so much more sophisticated that it would lead to a much earlier development of childhood maturity.  The Plowden Report clearly accepted the validity and overriding importance of the arguments concerned with the well-being of the child and recommended an adjustment in the age of entry to the September term following their fifth birthday for all children.</P>
      <P>The Gittin's Report &mdash; Primary Education in Wales &mdash; which puts us more firmly in a Celtic setting, which will please Deputy Wilson, reinforces the Plowden argument with the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> A child starting school has to adapt to many new demands.  Transition from home to school should be gradual and suited to the child's individual needs.  Many children of five become fatigued and irritable if they attend for the whole day and not all children can accept separation from their mothers for a whole day at first.  They may be unsettled and even very anxious.</P>
    <P>Gittin's refers to research which indicates that many young pupils are still very unsettled after three months in school. So much for the practice and experience in our neighbouring island, which, apart from our own, is the only European country where formal school starts at five.</P>
    <P>On the European scene children are generally older still before they are admitted to the formal structured approach of primary schools proper.  The entry age is usually six, although it is seven in the Scandanavian countries.  In Luxembourg the formal teaching of children under six is prohibited by law.  W.S. Wall in his book &ldquo;Constructive Education for Children&rdquo; published by UNESCO Press follows the same line of thinking and treats of the anxiety and insecurity experienced by children in their early schooling.  He tells us this anxiety and insecurity manifest themselves in such ways as the breakdown of well established habits, difficulties in sleeping and eating, a reversion to bed-wetting and temper tantrums, while other children seem to become particularly vulnerable to minor ailments, such as coughs and colds.  Many find the effort of adjustment to school so great that when they return home they &ldquo;let go&rdquo; in a bewildering bout of bad behaviour which may provoke repressive action by parents. That, sadly, is too often a feature of the social care experienced in our own society.</P>
    <P>A factor that is sometimes overlooked in any discussion of this question is that while entry to primary schools was hitherto permitted at age four, compulsory schooling as such, in this country, did not commence until the age of six.  The practice of sending very young children to school became popular for a variety of <Col N="1106" /> reasons &mdash; some of which might not be the most lauded &mdash; many of them reflecting a concern by parents that their children might be missing out on something. It is not that no efforts were made to convince them that children were going to school too young, although it must be acknowledged that the message was not often couched in the explicit terms that the children could well make more significant strides to emotional and social maturity in the home or in a less formally structured play setting.  We should underline the value of such informality at that age.  A number of our educationists have pronounced from time to time on this point and I quote from the record of the INTO Congress Report of 1977:</P>
    <P>It appeared to be generally agreed that eleven plus is too low for transfer (to post-primary school), that children generally are too immature at that age. Pursuing that to its logical conclusion one reached the controlling fact that children are being accepted into school at too young an age.  In fact a number of speakers suggested that five years should be the minimum age for acceptance, that children under that age were not ready for school and still needed the protection and security of the home.</P>
    <P>More recently a sub-committee of the Dublin South City Branch of the INTO reporting its findings in the Spring 1981 issue of <i>An Múinteoir Náisiúnta</i> on the question of &ldquo;From Primary to Second Level &mdash;when should transfer occur&rdquo;? stated <i>inter alia:</i></P>
    <P>It is the general contention of the sub-committee that pupils in the Republic of Ireland begin formal Primary Schooling much too early.</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>Given the inability of many children in Primary Schools to cope with the curriculum it seems that they are in the main too young at all class levels.</P>
    <P>They are not my words but the words of people experienced in primary education.</P>
    <P>I could go on and refer to the position <Col N="1107" /> taken by the INTO working party set up by the previous Minister for Education and the observations of that working party, which were substantially that many pupils were too young on being promoted from infant standards to first class and that a significant number of pupils made this transition after spending an inadequate period of time in the infant standards due to enrolment late in the year in junior infants once they reached four years of age.  I could also refer to the recommendations of that working party which, if implemented, would have had the effect that a pupil born in October could be six years and 11 months on promotion from infant standard, an effect which is deplored by the INTO when it is achieved by adjustment of the school entry age.  I could mention, too, a return to wisdom in this connection whereby many parents voted with their children's feet and delayed sending them to school as soon as they reached four, as evidenced by a continued drop in the enrolment of four year olds over the last three years for which statistics are available, despite stability in the birth rate for the corresponding earlier periods.  The evidence is not quite as damning as some would make it look.</P>
    <P>It is not for me at this stage to rationalise the paradoxes of our society which put children through exercises in rationality in schools before we accept that they have reached the use of reason, or to comment on the double think regarding the maturity of children and their suitability for schooling when particular adult and organisational interests feel they may be discommoded or that their interests are threatened.  I am convinced that sensitive, compassionate consideration and subsequent implementation and acceptance of these regulations governing the admission of pupils will ensure better class organisation and provide educational benefits for the child.  The evidence is to that effect.  Henceforth all children will spend a minimum of one year and two terms in the infant classes while many will spend the full two years in these classes.  Their extra maturity will ensure that they are better prepared for the more <Col N="1108" /> formal type of education from standard one onwards.  In particular, mathematics and reading should benefit and the basic concepts in these areas should be much better established.  Everyone will agree that there is a clear need in this area.  As a consequence fewer pupils will have need for remedial instruction at a later stage in their school careers.  This view is supported by the research work of Brunif and others who found that a later entry age meant fewer retarded and more advanced children.  That is the experience of those who have no other concern but the well-being of children.</P>
    <P>Current practice in school enrolment makes for two extremes.  In some schools the intake for the whole year arrives on a particular date, usually in September; in other schools two or three pupils are admitted at irregular intervals through out the year.  Neither practice is satisfactory. In the first case so many new pupils arrive that the teacher has not the opportunity to give any child the individual attention he or she may require at this most critical point.  When new pupils constantly arrive throughout the year they may often be at a disadvantage in so far as the teacher in her enthusiasm may feel forced to proceed with the normal class work to the detriment of these individual children.  The new procedures will ensure more manageable admission groups and allow better opportunities for their assessment and for the teacher to assist individual children and groups in overcoming the difficulties of adjusting to school life.  That, I know, is the primary concern of the INTO.  These new arrangements will also facilitate fuller and more meaningful contact with the parent.  The new procedures will also lead to a more uniform system of promotion from the infant classes.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to everybody not to be diverted from the main issue by any of the subsidiary questions and not to pretend that this is some shallow, barren, empty economic, fiscal or financial issue. That is not the question.  The essence of this new enrolment procedure is that it is good for the children or, at the very least, it is a lot better than what existed heretofore. I have heard the appeal to the <Col N="1109" /> Minister to withdraw this new regulation, in the name of God.  I suggest instead in the name of God that these children, who are not organised, who do not have a lobby here and who do not barricade the gates, should be given their childhood so that they might enjoy it in the freedom and security of their homes or in a properly structured pre-school environment and accordingly be more ready to face the challenges of school life when they enrol and be mature enough to face the challenges of adult life when they complete their schooling.</P>

      <P>I rise to speak in favour of the motion tabled by Deputy Wilson.  I speak as a teacher with many years experience in all types of national schools and as a parent whose family have passed through the national school system, thankfully without any of the traumatic effects experienced by Deputy Browne. When one looks at the amendment and the amendment to the amendment one can readily understand where the term &ldquo;browned off&rdquo; originated.  I speak as a representative of a constituency which is a fair cross-section of urban and rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>The overriding purpose of the motion is the good of our four year olds.  We feel that the decision as to when a child should be sent to school should rest with the mother rather than the Minister.  We ask the Minister to withdraw this circular. Everyone knows he made a mistake in allowing his Department to issue it.  He must by now realise this but the attitude of the Minister of State indicates clearly that Fine Gael are not prepared to withdraw or repent.  The wording of their amendment had the audacity to claim credit for the appointment of 300 extra teachers who were actually sanctioned by the previous Fianna Fáil Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>That form of piracy is easily recognised and has been denounced already by the teachers themselves.  The Minister who told us he was so keen to have this debate judged on what was <Col N="1110" /> good for the children very quickly got around to jobs for teachers in the Government amendment.</P>
      <P>This decision was taken in the light of the economic facts of which the Minister for Agriculture speaks.  It was decided simply to save money.  The origin was in a document called <i>Where the Money Goes</i> in 1977 and this Government lost no time in taking action.  One must be aware of the penny-pinching people in the Department of Finance who are always looking for areas where cuts can be made.  The Minister of State said we should show compassion and sympathy for children but those listening to him found very little evidence of sympathy or compassion in his contribution.  This bright idea will have the effect of keeping 20,000 children out of our schools each year and will relieve the Government of the task of providing places for them and the new classrooms and teachers which would be required.</P>
      <P>The late Donogh O'Malley showed Fianna Fáil's commitment that money should not determine the extent of any pupil's education and that the opportunities available to our children should not be based merely on financial means.  It is quite obvious that monetary considerations were the only ones used by the Minister in this awful move.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State spoke of dealing with the matter with good sense and maturity.  Where was the good sense or maturity in the taking of this hasty decision in mid-term when everyone was on holidays?  There was no discussion with parents or teachers.  It must be viewed in the context of discussions held by the previous Government with the INTO in April and May 1981.  At that time there were specific proposals with the Department of Education concerning dates of enrolment but there was no indication whatsoever that the existing age of enrolment would be raised.  It was never considered by the previous Government. The Minister of State should look at section 4, paragraph 23, of the White Paper from which he quoted.  It indicates that no basic change was called for.  This is a very basic change and shows that the &ldquo;Just Society&rdquo; was just an empty slogan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> Should children go to school at an early age?  I have discussed this with eminent educationalists and with specialists in child psychology and they are certain that the Minister has done the wrong thing. The proposal does not bring us into line with European standards, as some socialist <Col N="1112" /> but not nationalist Members would lead us to believe.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 393 and 394 together.</P>
      <P>Two modifications were recently introduced into the western drainage scheme. The first is that the maximum area eligible for grant aid will be 40 hectares.  This limitation was necessary to ensure &mdash; in view of the large number of applicants and the overall ceiling of 150,000 hectares &mdash; that as many farmers as possible benefit under the Scheme.</P>
      <P>The second modification is that grant aid will be limited to a cost of £800 per hectare.  This was introduced to ensure that limited public resources are used to the most economic advantage.  These limits are generous and I am satisfied that they are in the best interest of western drainage.  They accord fully with the EEC directive.</P>

It is a condition of the scheme that applications cannot be entertained for work contracted before 20 October 1980.  In these circumstances, this request was rejected and the applicant was notified on 17 February 1981.  A further letter was received from this person on 19 October 1981 to the effect that he had not had any response to the earlier application. A further letter informing him again of the decision to refuse the application was issued to him on 29 October, 1981.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. E. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that what the Deputy has in mind is the minimum amount of employment which a person would require to engage in each week in order to warrant payment of a social insurance contribution at a class which would be reckonable for unemployment benefit purposes.  This is governed by the Social Welfare (Subsidiary Employments) Regulations, 1979 and the Social Welfare (Employment of Inconsiderable Extent) Regulations, 1979 which came into operation on 6 April 1979 with the introduction of the pay-related social insurance (PRSI) contribution system.</P>
      <P>Briefly the position since that date is that persons whose employment is of a subsidiary nature, that is employment which is not ordinarily the principal means of livelihood, and which is specified as such by the Social Welfare (Subsidiary Employments) Regulations, are insurable at the Class J rate of contribution. A Class J rate of contribution provides coverage for occupational injury and health purposes only.</P>
      <P>Similarily persons engaged in employment of inconsiderable extent are also insurable at the Class J rate of contribution. Employment of inconsiderable extent means employment where (a) the total hours worked by an employee, whether for one employer or between two or more employers is less than 18 in a week and (b) the employee is not mainly dependent on the earnings received for the total hours worked or (c) an employee has only one job for which he/she is paid at a rate less than £6 a week or £26 a month.</P>

      <P>Sketch-plans have been approved and a grant has been sanctioned for the proposed Dalkey school project national school.  However, a problem has arisen in regard to the implications of a condition of the planning permission.  Full planning permission and by-law approval would be a prerequisite to the invitation of tenders.  The Department were informed by the chairman on 1 July 1981 <Col N="1007" /> that full planning permission had been granted subject to the following conditions:</P>
      <P>On substantial completion of the development, the area shown as public open space on Drawing No. 61 (Scale 1:500) shall be cleared of surplus soil, rocks, debris and shall be levelled, seeded and planted with approved shrubs and/or trees and such area shall then be dedicated formally for the use of the public.</P>
      <P>This condition raised several questions such as: (1) to what extent would extra cost arise from this condition?  (2) whose responsibility would it be to comply with this condition and to provide for the maintenance of the public open space? (3) in whom and by what process would this space be vested and could such space legitimately form part of the school site to be vested in trustees under an official lease to which the Minister for Education would be a party?  The Commissioners of Public Works were asked for advice on 18 September 1981 and their formal reply is expected very shortly.</P>
      <P>I wish that the minimum delays should occur in proceeding with the school and I am asking that the project be expedited.</P>

In their report dated 5 October 1981, with which they furnished sketch plans and a revised estimate, the Commissioners of Public Works proposed that the new school should be erected on a site of 1.3 acres at the rear of the existing school, that is the site already approved to which satisfactory title has already been furnished.  This site, they say, together with the existing school site, gives a total area of two acres, <Col N="1008" /> approximately, which complies with the planning requirements for a four classroom school.  The site of the existing school would, in effect, be the site extension. This proposal is presently under urgent consideration in my Department.</P>

Senior cycle pupils from Dromahair are eligible for free transport out of the Coola catchment area.  Junior cycle pupils from Dromahair are eligible for free transport to another centre only in accordance with the ordinary rules of school transport which stipulate, <i>inter alia</i>, that they may have free transport only from the nearest pick-up point within the catchment area of the centre attended.</P>

      <P>The standard of service, from the point of view of travelling and waiting time for the Dromahair pupils who are eligible for free school transport and who have opted to attend Ballisodare post-primary centre is in accordance with the general standards laid down for the post-primary school transport scheme.

      <P>The future of the District Court office in Kenmare is under review at present following the occurrence of a vacancy there consequent on the retirement of the clerk-in-charge.  The review arises under the terms of a productivity agreement which was concluded with the provincial District Court staff in 1973 as the basis for an improvement in their pay and grading structure.  An essential element of the agreement is that the overall number of District Court offices be gradually reduced from 59 to about 40 as opportunities occur.  The question that arises at the moment is whether the Kenmare office might be amalgamated with neighbouring offices such as Killarney.  The review is not yet fully completed and accordingly I have not taken any decision in the matter. The Deputy may be assured that before taking a decision I will give very careful consideration to all aspects of the matter including the convenience of the public in the area.</P>
