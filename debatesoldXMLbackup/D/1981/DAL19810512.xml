      <P>Under Council Regulation 355/77 individual applications for FEOGA grants for marketing and processing of agricultural products are now considered only where they are in accordance with a programme for the <Col N="2563" /> sector concerned which has been approved by the EEC Commission.  As has already been done for the main agricultural products, a programme for potatoes which was prepared in consultation with the industry was submitted recently to the Commission for consideration. When this is approved by the Commission applications for grants will be considered against the background of the programme.</P>
      <P>The programme covers investment projects which would increase efficiency in the industry, expand processing facilities, improve distribution and marketing and create opportunities for increased employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware of the grave concern among farmers in County Donegal concerning the importation of potatoes in view of the large quantities of potatoes still on their hands; and if he will make a statement on the action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is at present a strong demand of potatoes and this had resulted in a considerable reduction in the supplies available in County Donegal.  Indications are that by the end of the present season few, if any, growers there will be left with good quality potatoes on hands. Small quantities of particular varieties suitable for processing, which are generally unavailable in the county, are being imported from Northern Ireland.  I am satisfied that the steps I have recently taken to regulate imports of potatoes from outside the EEC have had the effect of ensuring that Irish growers will be able to clear their supplies this season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister giving a guarantee that all good ware potatoes will be bought up in County Donegal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the way in which supplies are clearing at present and the information we have with regard to existing supplies in Donegal, that appears to be the position.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Cyprus potatoes have now reached London and there is always a danger of them coming in here?  We understand that there is a licensing system in operation. Can the Minister guarantee that Cyprus potatoes will not reach this country before all the ware potatoes are bought up?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The order which the Minister for Agriculture introduced restricting imports from Cyprus is intended to do what the Deputy suggests.  There is no application for a licence before the Minister and there is no intention of granting one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware of the objections of residents in the vicinity of city abattoirs to the operation of these plants which are in or adjacent to residential areas; if he has under consideration any revision of the existing law in the matter; if he is aware of the practice in other EEC countries of locating modernised plants on the outskirts of urban areas; and whether any consideration has been given to submitting an application to the EEC for funds for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations on behalf of residents who are concerned about the position in Dublin. Slaughterhouses catering for the domestic market are the responsibility of the local authorities in the areas in which <Col N="2565" /> they are located.  The question of a review of the by-laws in operation for these premises in Dublin is therefore a matter for consideration by Dublin Corporation in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I understand that the corporation have a review of the by-laws in train at present. I am aware of the general trend in favour of placing modern premises of this kind in non-urban locations and also of the availability of EEC funds in this connection. Details of the FEOGA funds and the conditions under which they may be availed of have been made known to interested parties in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not specific information on that.  I am aware that there are a number of such houses located in different parts of the country.  As I have indicated, in the first instance, they are a matter in respect of which the local authority in the area must take appropriate action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that they are a matter for the Minister's Department.  Specific information was brought to the notice of Minister of State, Deputy Allen, at a meeting in Wexford when specific instances and names were given.  Has any action been taken by the Department because these people are evading taxes, levies and all types of duty due to the Department?  That meeting was held about two months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is an undesirable development but I must indicate that prime responsibility rests with the corporation.  I understand that here in Dublin the corporation are considering a draft of new regulations, that these are at present being studied, and I will not be in a position to indicate what action will be taken by the Department until such time as these draft regulations are submitted to my Department from the corporation.</P>

    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>(i)  Expenditure on food marketing in the dairying sector over the years in question has been largely concentrated in the area of consumer subsidies on butter and liquid milk on the home market. Funds have also been dispensed from the proceeds of the EEC milk co-responsibility levy on product development, the promotion of consumption on the home market and market development abroad.</P>
    <P>(ii)  No EEC expenditure specifically on marketing has occurred in this sector.  National expenditure on the promotion of domestic and export markets has been incurred through a grant-in-aid to Córas Beostoic agus Feola.  1980 was the first year of operation of a restructured CBF &mdash; a statutory body financed both by grant-in-aid and producer levy.</P>
    <P>(iii)  No EEC or State expenditure was incurred specifically for marketing in this sector but an amount of £200,000 is to be paid from the Exchequer to the Pigs and Bacon Commission in 1981 for the promotion of pigmeat markets.</P>
    <P>(iv)  The above figures do not include any expenditure from the grant of £75,000 provided from the Exchequer in 1980 to finance export promotional measures for Irish food products generally by the Agricultural Exports Co-ordinating Group, which is representative of the Department of Agriculture, Córas Tráchtála and the main agricultural exporting agencies.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above expenditure funds are allocated each year from both the Industrial Development Authority and the EEC towards the cost of investment <Col N="2568" /> projects on marketing and processing of agricultural products.  It is not possible to isolate allocations for marketing only.  Details are as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department participate in the implementation of a whole range of control measures in relation to the export of live cattle.  In the years mentioned, they have included animal health and disease status measures, animal welfare measures and procedures and arrangements of various kinds connected with the operation of the common agricultural policy.  The latter have related in particular to the payment of refunds on exports to non-Community countries and, for a time, the collection or payment of monetary compensatory amounts.</P>

Are the Department satisfied that an equal subsidy is available for the exports of processed meat in that area?  I know some improvement has been effected but I <Col N="2572" /> want the Minister to state: is the export of processed meat done on an equal basis with that of live cattle?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is a very complex system.  My Department would be concerned at all times to ensure that export refunds operate on an equitable basis between carcase beef, live cattle and boneless beef.  There are some indications that frozen boneless beef may not be doing as well out of that system as we would like it to do and we have submitted proposals to the Commission with a view to improving the situation.  But we act as an agent for the Community in this and it is not within the ambit of Government control to make certain all the time that the regulations operate one hundred per cent satisfactorily. However, it is our intention to do all we can in that regard.</P>

I want to make it clear that I am not objecting to live exports, but what are we doing to ensure that the export of processed meat will be entitled to the same refund for exports outside of the EEC, an advantage which we have enjoyed over the last few years?

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 to 19, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Council Directive 75/268/EEC, which governs the operation of the disadvantaged areas schemes, is aimed at assisting broad regions which, by meeting the criteria laid down in the directive, are shown to be suffering from permanent natural handicaps affecting farming.  The boundaries of the areas designated as disadvantaged must be precisely determined and conform to recognised and well-established geographical units.  The suitability of the district electoral division as the basic unit was very carefully considered by the departmental team which reviewed the boundries of the disadvantaged areas in 1978 and it was concluded that the existing practice of delineation by reference to the boundaries of district electoral divisions should be adhered to, given the requirements of the directive. The only exception to this is that of mountain sheep grazing land for the purpose of headage payments on mountain sheep, but the special conditions attaching to classification in this case are not applicable in the case of the cattle headage schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mountain sheep grazing lands in the Knockmealdown and Comeragh areas of County Waterford have been designated as disadvantaged in the Eastern Region <Col N="2578" /> of Ireland since the directive came into operation.  A full list of the district electoral divisions concerned is to be found in the annex to Council Directive 75/272/EEC, a copy of which has been placed in the Library of the House.  Following the 1978 boundary review by my Department, it was found possible to arrange with the Community authorities for the four additional district electoral divisions of Fews, Mountkennedy, Clonea (Power) and Clonea (Dungarvan) to be added to the disadvantaged areas in County Waterford.  It was decided to provide special drainage aid from national funds to the area so enlarged.  As the County Waterford disadvantaged areas are entirely within the Eastern Region for the purposes of the EEC Directive the distinction between more severely handicapped areas and those less so does not arise.  I would, however, refer the Deputies to my reply to a question in this connection on 9 April.  The position in regard to the disadvantaged areas generally continues to be kept under surveillance in my Department in case future developments at Brussels may make it possible for further boundary changes to be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister refers to the fact that the description &ldquo;severely disadvantaged areas&rdquo; can only be applied to broad regions.  Is the Minister aware that the areas referred to in the question, in other words, the Knockmealdown and Comeragh mountain ranges together with their foothills, constitute an extremely broad region?  Is the Minister further aware that the valuations in that region can very from as little as half a penny per acre in the mountains to in excess of £1 per acre in the valleys? Would the Minister agree that there is a great disparity?  It is entirely unfair to base the administration of this scheme on such district electoral divisions.  The Minister cannot justify such a classification because of the disparity in the quality of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that whatever statistical unit is used, boundaries to them present certain difficulties.  In relation to <Col N="2579" /> the DED, when this directive came into effect in 1975 the then Government, in consultation with the EEC Commission decided that the DED was the only practicable statistical unit which one could use for the purpose of this directive.  That position has been maintained since.  The question of having further areas included as severely handicapped will be kept under review but at present it would be necessary to get the Commission to agree to an additional percentage of utilised agricultural land for the purposes of this directive before it would be possible to have any major extensions carried out throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate the absurdity and illogicality of his answer?  I am quoting on the basis that what I think he said is correct.  He said that the boundries of areas must be well defined administrative boundaries and implied that this made it impossible to use units smaller than DEDs, although in fact DEDs are composed of townlands which have defined boundries set out on every large scale map.  That part of the answer was absurd and incorrect.  The Minister then went on to say that, in fact, the principle which he had deduced as being one which made it impossible to depart from DEDs had been departed from in the case of sheep, thereby making his answer illogical.  Would he explain, in view of the wide variation in the quality of land within the district electoral divisions, which can be quite large in size and can cover areas quite disparate in character, why the inter-departmental decision should have been accepted by the Government and why the Government do not take into their own hands matters of policy of this kind and take decisions, instead of leaving civil servants to decide such matters at a level of detail and in a manner which is absurd and illogical?</P>

      <P>It would appear from the Deputy's question that he misunderstood my earlier reply.  I indicated that when this directive came into effect in 1975 &mdash; and as the Deputy may recall, he was at the time a member of the Government <Col N="2580" />&mdash; the dicision was, in consultation with the Commission, to adhere to the district electoral division as the statistical unit which would be the guiding principle for the boundaries of disadvantaged areas. He will also appreciate that this severely disadvantaged areas scheme cannot be compared with the scheme which operates in parts of our mountain regions in relation to sheep subsidies.  They are not comparable by any stretch of the imagination. The Deputy's colleagues on the benches beside him would be able to indicate to him the reason for that.  The question of whether future changes in these matters can be made will be guided entirely by what is possible in the Commission and whether or not it will be possible to get an increasing percentage of utilised agricultural area for the purposes of further disignations depends on whether that is possible or not.</P>

      <P>While in the first instance the DEDs may have appeared to be a good unit to start with for an approximation of the areas concerned, it is quite clear from experience that they do not represent adequate units for this purpose.  If different units could be used for the sheep scheme, why cannot the DEDs be broken up into parts which are poor land and parts which are good land for the purposes of the other scheme, except perversity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The operation of this scheme from 1975 up to 1978 was perhaps a fair experience for our predecessors to decide whether the DED was a satisfactory unit or not.  I recognise immediately that it does present certain difficulties for townlands which happen to be in a DED where perhaps the bulk of the land is very good.  I do not at all argue with the Deputy or with my colleagues from any side of the House in relation to the difficulties that that presents.  I would like to be able at some future time to assist in some way with the practical difficulties which exist in relation to getting the area for the whole country increased as distinct from a few townlands in one particular county. The Deputy will appreciate that representations of this kind would come from <Col N="2581" /> various areas and consideration would have to be given to the subject on a national basis rather than on an individual county basis.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that I sought in my question to have included areas which also applied to be categorised?  The Minister did not visit these areas and he was remiss in not doing so.  Is he aware that there are areas in County Waterford, such as the Nire, Ballymacarbery and Mellary which have applied, and indeed, have put a case to the Department, and have been refused full recognition under this scheme, even though they may be classified for the purposes of sheep subsidies?  Would the Minister explain to the House why those areas which are acknowledged to be very poor areas, in terms of income, have not been fully recognised for all schemes?</P>

      <P>The only Government to succeed last year in getting any extension in this directive was the Irish Government. That is indicative of the general effort made to try to extend the advantages of this scheme to as many areas as possible.  The first strategy was to try to get an increase in the percentage of utilised agricultural land for that purpose. Last July the Minister for Agriculture succeeded in getting an addition of 1 per cent, which is not sufficient to meet all the requirements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It happens frequently that people come to the Department of Health to find out the position or what the position might be.  The fact that my permission is not necessary has been outlined to the people concerned.  The Department would inform such people of any of the considerations that might arise.

      <P>Health boards and the authorities of certain voluntary hospitals are now taking the steps necessary to offer the new form of contract to consultants holding appointments with them.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there was within the Irish Medical Association a difference of opinion.  There was a marginal rejection of the contract whereas within the Irish Medical Union there was an overwhelming acceptance of the contract.  Further discussions have <Col N="2592" /> been taking place with the Irish Medical Association with a view to providing whatever clarifications are deemed necessary. It is understood that following the recent meetings the association will circulate the contract with the clarification so that members may take what has been termed a free vote on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the information I have the factory produces lead sheeting and ingots for the building industry.  The process is known as the DM method which is a low heat process. There is a sophisticated pollution control system in operation which reduces pollution from the plant to one-2,000th of the permitted limit set by the planning authority of the county council for the area.  It is a matter which was discussed in great detail at the time when planning permission was being given to that factory. There was evidence from the health inspectorate and a study was carried out by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards at the request of the IDA. The matter appears to have been thoroughly researched and the standards set are well within the permitted limits.  It is noted that local residents mentioned periodic emissions of black smoke from the chimney on the site but it is understood that this has no connection with the lead manufacturing process but results from the burning of rubbish at the site.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that counties Cavan and Monaghan have a higher number on the waiting list for hip replacement operations than most other counties. Steps have been taken to improve the orthopaedic services available in the North-Eastern Health Board area.  A second orthopaedic theatre was opened in June 1980 at Navan Orthopaedic Unit and work on renovating the older theatre has now been completed.  This theatre will be brought into use within the next few weeks.  This will allow for more operations to be done and will help to alleviate the situation in these counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Does the Minister agree that, leaving out Dublin and Cork, the waiting list for hip replacement operations in Monaghan and Cavan is about double the National average?  Does that not suggest a complete neglect of the facilities in <Col N="2594" /> those two counties?  What is the longest waiting time for such operations in those counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that as far as the Government are concerned attention has been given to the provision of facilities and the further extension of those facilities.  This raises an interesting point.  In that health board area for some reason the counties Cavan and Monaghan have the highest incidence of arthritic hips.  Apparently that has always been the case.  I do not have any idea what the reason is for that.  It is a matter which has been commented on. In comparison with Louth and Meath, counties with a greater population, the incidence of arthritic hips is much greater in Cavan and Monaghan.</P>

Is it not a fact that one of the consultants offered to perform the operations in Coole hospital provided the Minister gave him the necesary facilities and back-up staff which the Minister refused to do?  The Minister is aware that this type of complaint or ailment is a problem in Monaghan and Cavan and that is all the more reason why he should give it better attention to get the backlog cleared up quickly.  Does the Minister realise that the patients involved are elderly and that a three or four year wait is a serious matter for them?</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2629" /> As Deputies are aware from the explanatory memorandum already circulated, the purpose of this Bill is to increase the authorised share capital of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta by £50 million, that is from £27.5 million to £77.5 million, and the limit on the company's facility to borrow under ministerial guarantee by £50 million, that is from £100 million to £150 million.  The actual text of the Bill is of a standard format and I would not expect that it should give rise to any major difficulty.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary for me to give Deputies much in the way of background information on NET as the company have been the subject of the widest attention and publicity in recent times.  Deputies who are members of the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies, whose report on NET was published on 4 May, will be particularly aware of the company's activities and present difficulties.</P>
    <P>NET were set up in 1961 as a State-sponsored company to produce nitrogenous fertilisers at Arklow.  The company started in a relatively modest way but have expanded over the years to a point where they are now a major industrial and chemical undertaking, providing employment at their plants in Arklow and Marino Point for over 1,150 people. Total assets are more than £170 million and net sales revenue in 1980 was over £60 million.  The Marino Point factory produces ammonia, a raw material for the manufacture of nitrogenous fertilisers, from natural gas supplied from the Kinsale Head field.  The ammonia is used mainly to produce urea at Marino Point and calcium ammonium nitrate at Arklow &mdash; both straight nitrogen fertilisers. NET have been successful in supplying up to 85 per cent of the domestic market for straight nitrogen and the company's operations ensure national security of supply in respect of this strategic commodity for Irish agriculture, as well as making a valuable contribution to the country's balance of payments.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, NET embarked on a major expansion programme in 1974 when the company <Col N="2630" /> received Government approval to proceed with the Marino Point project.  As everyone is aware at this stage, major problems were encountered in relation to this project which resulted in its being delayed by over 15 months.  The final cost of the Marino Point plant is now put at £137.3 million, an increase of 116 per cent compared to what NET regard as the first detailed estimate of £63.5 million. I do not propose to debate the complicated and controversial history of the project as I feel that it is already well-documented, particularly since publication of the report of the Joint Committee, last week.</P>
    <P>As the construction of this project advanced it became clear to me that there was reason to be very seriously concerned about the cost escalations and delays involved.  I have met members of the NET Board and management on countless occasions during the past three years and impressed on them my deep concern about the way the project had developed. In mid-1978 I set up a system whereby NET were required to submit quarterly reports in relation to the project.  By the end of 1978 I felt that the history of the project was such as to warrant a confidential independent consultancy review to discover how the capital costs had increased to such an extent and what lessons could usefully be learned from NET's experience.  However, I am afraid the hard facts are that, once a project of this nature is put in train, it quickly reaches a point where it is extremely difficult to abandon it and no amount of monitoring or supervision will alter its basic economics.</P>
    <P>The increased expenditure associated with the Marino Point project has had a profound effect on NET's finances.  This has been exacerbated by the separate problems affecting the Arklow plant, which has been trading at an increasing net loss in recent years.  Losses directly applicable to Arklow have grown from £0.8 million in 1975 to nearly £8 million in 1980.  The principal reasons for the losses at Arklow have been changes in production technology in the fertiliser industry which made the company's <Col N="2631" /> involvement in the manufacture of phosphoric acid and compound fertilisers unprofitable, increased competition from bulk-blenders of cheap intermediate fertiliser products, general overmanning in NET, depressed price levels for fertilisers which have failed to keep pace with input costs and unfavourable industrial relations and labour practices.  These problems have forced NET to engage in a very substantial level of borrowings with associated crippling financing charges.  NET's accumulated losses at the end of 1979 amounted to £24 million and the loss for 1980 is expected to be £56 million.  The total amount of NET's medium and short-term borrowings at the end of 1980 was over £200 million, with associated annual financing charges of £30 million. The company are now in serious financial trouble as their capital base is completely eroded and they are unable to service their borrowing commitments.  NET have proposed a capital restructuring of the company, and has requested additional paid-up equity of £90 million, which it says will enable the company to return to a commercially acceptable debt/equity ratio and reduce the very large burden of bank interest which prevents it returning to a viable position in the long-term.</P>
    <P>NET are facing an immediate financial crisis as they are obliged to repay a short-term, non-renewable bridging loan of $80 million &mdash; equivalent to £50 million approximately &mdash; by 29 May 1981.  Unfortunately this aspect of the company's finances was not highlighted in the Joint Committee's report.  Furthermore, NET have, at present, up to £50 million in existing medium-term loans which are not the subject of ministerial guarantees under the NET Acts and it is desirable, in the context of any new legislation, that provision should be made for formal guarantees in these cases.  These guarantees will also enable a marginal reduction to be secured in respect of the interest rate for the medium-term loans in question.</P>
    <P>The Government have concluded that the immediate financial difficulties facing NET must be tackled now and the specific purpose of the present Bill is to <Col N="2632" /> enable the $80 million bridging loan to be repaid by 29 May 1981 and to provide formal guarantees for the existing unguaranteed medium-term loans of £50 million.  Failure to tackle these problems at this juncture would, in my opinion, inevitably precipitate the immediate closure of the company.</P>
    <P>I must stress at this point that the present Bill does not mean that the Government have brought their examination of NET's prospects to a conclusion.  In this regard, the Government share the view of the Joint Committee that further study and specialist advice is necessary under a number of headings, before any final decisions can be realistically taken about NET's future.  Some analysis has already been undertaken of the possible options open to the Government but it is clear that further work needs to be done as a matter of urgency.  With this in mind, the Government have now decided to establish an inter-departmental committee of senior officials to consider in detail all the options for the future of NET with a view to reporting to me as soon as practicable so that proposals can be presented to the Government at an early date.  It is my intention that the committee will use independent specialist consultants to advise on specific aspects of this matter where they consider it necessary. Obviously one of the matters which will have to be considered is the dramatic change which has taken place in the energy field since the original decisions relating to Kinsale gas were taken.  There may be better uses to which this gas can now be put and the full implications for this in relation to employment, balance of payments, energy efficiency and returns to the Exchequer will have to be examined.</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the future deliberations of the proposed inter-departmental committee, I must say that I have been impressed by the resolute action taken by NET, and in particular the company's new managing director, during the past year in attempting to restore order to the company's operations and finances.  I was also glad to see that this action was endorsed by the Joint Committee. As a result, I must admit that I <Col N="2633" /> am now more optimistic than I was some months ago about the company's future prospects.  The action to which I refer comprises the closure of the unprofitable Arklow Gypsum subsidiary, the retirement from phosphoric acid and compound fertiliser operations at Arklow, a reorganisation of the company's management structure and a general slimming down of excess manpower with a view to increasing productivity.  It is, of course, deeply regrettable that action of this nature, involving the loss of a very significant number of jobs, has to be taken. However, it must be recognised that these measures are absolutely necessary if the company are to have any prospect of future viability.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill will commend itself to the Dáil and I recommend the Bill for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The company referred to in this Bill have attracted a great deal of media comment in the not too distant past which has been added to by the publication by the Joint Committee of their findings on the operation of NET. Some of the reasons for this company attracting such media comment are, possibly, the sheer size of the amount of money involved in their losses and their debts and what we know to have been their performance for the past two or three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are being asked to do here today is nothing less than maintain the integrity of the State in honouring a guarantee given, already signed and sealed, but not yet delivered, a guarantee to underwrite or to give £50 million to NET by 29 May.  That is a large sum of money and when one looks at the report of the Joint Committee on their whole operation one cannot but be prompted to ask why this might be so.  I do not think that this is the time for a witch hunt in relation to NET.  But it is a time to initiate deep scrutiny of this whole operation.  We are dealing with the expenditure of public money and therefore the question of public accountability is involved.  This House has a duty and a solemn obligation to the <Col N="2634" /> taxpayers to, in so far as it can, scrutinise this project, come to a decision on what it might do, and justify its actions in doing so.</P>
    <P>This company have had problems from the very beginning and one cannot but look back at the question of their building, their construction, the contracts handed out at the time, the information on which the board at that time worked, which was given to them by their advisers, and the relationship between that board and the Department of Industry and Commerce, as it then was.  Also, problems arose in relation to the actual construction; industrial action was taken and there were long delays, all very costly.  We ended up starting production in NET at Marino Point long after the date when work might reasonably be expected to have been completed.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee report bears out that the management of NET at this time left a lot to be desired.  In the recent past the workers of NET were literally vilified publicly for the performance of this company. I do not think that it is fair, or indeed proper, to take the easy way out and to point the finger at a group of people who themselves need not have been responsible for the poor record of performance which this company had. We are now in a position where, with a new chief executive who would seem to have the capacity to take hard decisions in the interests of the taxpayers and in the interests of the company, things have taken a turn for the better.</P>
    <P>It has not been easy as the Minister stated.  Jobs have had to be put to one side in the case of Arklow.  This was unavoidable in the light of the future of NET.  The restructuring of management at Marino Point has been undertaken. The new chief executive is owed a debt of gratitude for his handling of the massive problems which confronted him on assuming office.  On the surface options are open to the House in relation to NET but when one gets down to examining the whole project one finds the options are quickly narrowed down to a self-evident option &mdash; that of not providing the necessary funding at this time &mdash; but by adopting that option one reneges on the <Col N="2635" /> guarantee given and one ends up with writing off 800 jobs.  That must be costed and we must see what it costs the taxpayer. There is also the social cost of throwing 800 men out of work overnight. This, to save what now seems a large sum of money, may or may not be a wise thing to do.  I believe one must come down on the side of being prepared to invest further in this company.</P>
    <P>This is a first rate chemical plant.  I believe it has a strategic value because it gives us independence in so far as niotrogenous fertilisers are concerned, because we are no longer dependent on Middle East sources for raw material.  We can produce our own ammonia and we can produce urea.  We are totally independent of outside factors, even though this is at a cost.  It seems to me, from scrutinising the published accounts of the company and examining the report of the Joint Committee, that this company, given the right circumstances and the right economic atmosphere in which to operate are a viable industry.  They have shown they can operate profitability.  Their major drawback is the massive debt which is now dragging them down.  If we decide to withdraw from the operation now we are saying that NET will no longer be contributing to the servicing of their own debt.  The question of withdrawing from this project now is really a two-edged sword, the loss of jobs and the fact that the company would not be able to contribute to the servicing of their own debt.</P>
    <P>On the plus side, this is a first class chemical plant.  We are told it is one of the finest in Europe.  It has been suggested that it could very well be the basis for a major petro-chemical industry in the future.  We should not lose sight of that asset.  We hope when we find commercial oil that this will happen.  The plant uses gas from the Kinsale gas field. Some people say this is a wasteful use of gas.  The company are getting gas at a cheap rate.  Some people say that this is a hidden subsidy but when one looks elsewhere one sees that similar industries in other countries get gas at much the same price.  It is a question of the whole <Col N="2636" /> gas industry being underpriced in relation to this type of heavy industry.  Bord Gáis, who sell gas to NET, are at a net loss of approximately £30 million per annum.  If they sold this to the ESB, for example, they would possibly pay twice as much for this gas as NET do.</P>
    <P>These are all points which can be made in relation to the poor performance of NET.  If this industry has a future we have a duty to back the industry, not indefinitely or not at any price.  If we feel that the demands made are reasonable, we have a duty to the taxpayer to follow through the amount of money spent and hope that in the near future this company will become profit making.  Mr. Conlon is on record as saying that, having taken on international consultants to investigate the operations of the company and having heard their recommendations and hopefully implemented them, the company will be able to show a profit by 1984 or 1985.  This may be over optimistic, but Mr. Conlon should know what the position is.  I feel that this particular project is worth a further chance.</P>
    <P>While the finger can be pointed initially at the board of NET for the inadequacies which were exposed, particularly in the report of the Joint Committee, there has been no mention made of the fact that those people were reacting to financial advisers.  I do not believe anybody has pointed the finger at those people.  They were supposed to advise the board on the viability of such an undertaking, and find out what the world trade was in this particular commodity.  Those are the kind of things which would normally be expected of them.  Whatever advice was given to this board &mdash; and I assume they acted on bona fide advice &mdash; it was wrong.  A great deal of the blame must be laid at the door of the financial advisers on whom the board depended and, in turn, on whom the Department of the day depended.</P>
    <P>Taking all these factors into consideration, in my opinion we do not have any real option at present but to do our best to retrieve this situation, which is not healthy by any means but which is receiving the kind of attention necessary to make it healthier and more viable.  If this <Col N="2637" /> injection helps in that direction &mdash; I am sure it will &mdash; and if it lessens the burden on the company and helps them put their house in order, then it is money well spent.</P>
    <P>The cynics may say that this £50 million could be spent more profitably and beneficially in thousand of other places.  That may be so.  But if we allow a major project of this type to shut down, we will be leaving ourselves open to pressures over which we have no control, that is international pressures in the fertiliser industry.</P>
    <P>At present we are independent, but we must pay a price for that independence and there is no reason why the taxpayer should always be asked to pay the price. I hope this will be the final injection and that the investigation initiated by the company and a further committee now being set up by the Minister will lead to the pruning of deadweight and the eventual viability of this company.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are behind this allocation. As I said, I hope the Minister will not have to come here again seeking further money and that the company will look to the future with confidence and will become viable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some difficulty in getting to grips with the Minister's speech.  I suggest that the case which has been presented to this House in a rather scanty form is very serious.  In five-and-a-half pages the Minister, with excessive blandness, has asked us to make available £50 million to NET and to give further formal guarantees of borrowings by the State.  I do not think the Minister has analysed the case because since he is privy to a great deal of information about this company and received the very comprehensive report of the Joint Committee on State Sponsored Bodies, his response should have been much more detailed.  I do not know the reason for his attenuated response.  Admittedly the publicity given to the debacle of NET in the 1971-1974 period has done this country enormous damage.  That damage was not caused by critical comment; it was caused by the worst case study in the history of Europe in terms of industrial development in <Col N="2638" /> technology of this kind.  I am a member of the Economic Affairs and Development Committee of the Council of Europe and I have been searching for similar cases.  No matter how bad British Steel or British Leyland were, in comparative terms there is no company in Europe which produced a debacle of such magnitude as NET.</P>
      <P>I want to make a controversial point. The Minister should have come here today and announced the resignation or the firing of those members who were also members of the board in the 1974-76 period, irrespective of whoever they are. Due to pressure of work I did not have time to check the names of the board membership, and there may be some trade union members on it for all I know. But, whoever they are, they deserve to be fired.  There is no excuse for what happened to NET.  I will go further: there is no excuse in the Department of Industry Commerce and Tourism, leaving aside the supervisory role of the Department of Finance, for this debacle.  The former managing director has retired, but if he had not, he should have been fired when the report of the Joint Committee was published.  What happened in Marino Point and Arklow Gypsum, in terms of gross, absolute, total, utter, abysmal and culpable incompetence, is inexcusable. The amount involved, so far as Arklow Gypsum are concerned, is £9 million. I take a very serious view of that because 138 workers were thrown out of work, and that was inexcusable.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the situation is far more serious than the Minister said this afternoon, because one has to view NET's projects and current economic and social contribution to this State not just in terms of the Government decision to provide additional capital money but in the context of the feedstock of natural gas used by the company.  This is the most serious aspect of the matter.</P>

    <P>It has been estimated that NET will lose about £31 million this year.  We are in the fifth month and this figure has not been denied.  Last year they lost £50 million. If NET had been paying the normal commercial rate for their feedstock last year &mdash; I am quoting evidence from outside <Col N="2639" /> commentaries &mdash; the loss would have been £80 million, and my estimate of the loss in the present year in such circumstances is £56 million.  Natural gas is a State resource and could we allow a situation in which fertilisers produced in Cork and Arklow would be exported to Europe, or indeed China or India, and subsidised nationally here for the farmers of Europe to spread on their fields and to compete with farmers all over the Republic through CAP?</P>
    <P>The policy ramifications of what is happening at the moment are enormous.  I have the greatest respect for the Minister's personal competence in terms of setting economic criteria, and I say to him, at the end of this Dáil term, not to let anybody be under any illusions.  Do not let the workers in Cork or Arklow think, even with Mr. Conlon as the excellent managing director, that this injection of taxpayer's money will resolve the issues because the issues are too great and require an enormous amount of consideration in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>All this is doing is in effect saying to the receiver: &ldquo;There is £50 million, and for God's sake stay away from the door for six months, a year or two years&rdquo;. What will be done in the meantime will be of great consequence to the country as a whole.  Of course there will be cheering in Cork and in Arklow: &ldquo;We are getting £50 million.  Fianna Fáil are looking after us.  We are guaranteed another £40 million. Everything will be all right&rdquo;.  Even with the considerable skill of the rescue attempt by the managing director I do not share the optimism expressed in the Minister's speech, though I am more optimistic now than I was a few months ago.  The Minister must indicate that he and Deputy Colley are horrified &mdash; I know both Departments are horrified &mdash; by the real economic assessment of the energy feedstock being used by this company and the extent to which it contributes to our balance of payments situation, and by the extent to which the natural gas feedstock could be used alternatively in other areas, such as petro-chemicals. That situation cannot be dodged for much longer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2640" /> That is why I allude to these matters at the outset of my contribution.  The Minister made an extraordinary statement at the beginning of his speech.  Referring to the Joint Committee, of which I was a member, and which spent so many wearying hours trying to find out what the situation was, the Minister said that unfortunately the committee did not allude&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will give one excerpt from the evidence to the Joint Committee meeting on 2 July 1980.  Mr. Conlon said: &ldquo;By 1986 we will turn the corner, that is having charged full depreciation.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;You said you would still owe £97 million.&rdquo; Mr. Conlon said: &ldquo;Yes, we would owe £97 million then&rdquo;. My comment was: &ldquo;That is still a lot of money&rdquo;.  Mr. Conlon's reply was: &ldquo;Yes, of course.  At present we owe £168 million, so that would be a reduction.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At page 33 of the same report, Mr. Crumlish stated: &ldquo;As of now, in terms of our total debt, more than 60 per cent of it is in currencies other than the Irish pound.  Of the 60 per cent that we are talking of about 20 per cent would be in sterling which is both expensive and carries the greatest risk from the point of view of Irish business.  We have considerable borrowing in dollars as of now and we have also borrowed in EEC currencies&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will throw a simple question at the Minister.  In making these moneys available have we any insurance, or what action has been taken to stop the further erosion and the haemorrhage to NET?  I do not know what kind of Government memoranda are floating around in terms of producing £50 million for NET.  I approve of the decision of the Minister to give them the money because it was either that or close the whole place down and fire the 800 workers.  From now on we must have a closer look at the future economic viability of this company before we pour good money after bad.  I am glad we are taking this decision today. It is an all-party decision: we have agreed to give the money, it is taxpayers' money, <Col N="2641" /> but we must express our reservations.  As far as I am concerned the true situation will not be hidden from the Irish people.</P>
    <P>This is the first opportunity the House has had to discuss what has happened in NET.  I should like to see the company's current corporate plan.  I say this directly to the Minister &mdash; I do not regard a three-page press release issued by Profile Public Relations Consultants as a response to the Joint Committee's recommendations. It is a very interesting press release.  It is interesting to note also that the board have engaged the service of two firms of highly reputable international consultants.  The Minister set up an inter-departmental committee.  He is engaging a further clutch of consultants to advise him on the future.  Meanwhile, the company operates.  Listen to the conclusions of the Joint Committee in relation to the corporate plan of this body, and this report is only a few weeks old:</P>
    <P>The Committee concluded that while individual strategic planning exercises are carried out on an ongoing basis by individual departmental heads, overall long term corporate policy and expectations in relation to the Company, its field of business activity, financial and growth objectives have not been clearly defined in a policy document such as a corporate plan approved by the Board of Directors in the past.  In addition there appears to have been some serious lack of dimension in the overall planning expertise within the Company which has given rise to continuing and substantial differences in projected costs and profitability over short time intervals.  Projections appear to be based on the most optimistic view without proper allowance for contingencies which might arise.</P>
    <P>The board is still there.  Is the Minister as sanguine and optimistic about the competence of that board which for 1974 to 1981 could not produce a corporate plan? Now because they have a new managing director and have cleaned up some of the operation they say they have a corporate plan.  Perhaps.  I wish them well.  I am an advocate of State-sponsored bodies.  I <Col N="2642" /> have literally been ashamed of my life at having to indulge in virtually a cross-examination as to where almost £100 million of taxpayer's money went.  That has been no great joy for one who professes a desire to see a strong, viable, profitable and effective State sector.</P>
    <P>It has given me less joy to have to say to the trade unions concerned that that is the situation within the company.  I do not want to belabour the House unduly but I want to put on record some of the conclusions reached by the Joint Committee in relation particularly to Marino Point.  I quote from page 37:</P>
    <P>Central to the problem has been the substantial escalation in the cost of the Marino Point project which was originally budgeted to cost £63.51 million but eventually cost £137.3 million and which was financed mainly by borrowing.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister in his meeting with the board, both in Arklow and elsewhere, frothed at the mouth, and rightly so, when he spoke to the board about the way they carried on their operations.  The Minister was horrified and shocked.  I share his concern.  The Minister should put on public record that the board and its former managing director, Mr. Jack Hynes, were responsible for that debacle. In so far as there appears to have been officials &mdash; I have been very careful in my 12 years in this House in having a go at any Government Department &mdash; who failed in terms of monitoring, surveillance and carefully supervising major public capital programmes moneys which were sanctioned by the Government, known &mdash; admittedly in part only &mdash; to the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, that Department must share a degree of responsibility.</P>
    <P>We have said in our Joint Committee report that the Committee considers that the submissions and project feasibilities studies undertaken and presented by NET to the Government Departments concerned did not contain a sufficient justification for the project.  This seems to the Committee to be the main reason for the delay in obtaining Government approval.  That is their comment.  One <Col N="2643" /> cannot lay all the blame for this debacle at the door of any official.  But I have a feeling it was let slide and drift.  In so far as at that time Fine Gael and Labour were in Government, there does not appear to have been set up at Cabinet level and between the Cabinet and the Department of Finance and the Department of Industry and Commerce some kind of monitoring mechanism whereby the Minister for Finance of the day would say to the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day &ldquo;What in the name of God is happening in NET?&rdquo;  These questions were not asked.  Even today it is necessary to have that kind of normal public capital programme monitoring, seeking of formal sanctions and demanding from the heads of some of these bodies, particularly from the managing directors of this company in the 1974 to 1981 period where the memoranda are.  I have seen all the documentation relating to the background.  It is confused, mishmash documentation.  It would drive any civil servant out of his mind trying to divine what the company were up to.  In so far as the public accountability of Departments, from Industry and Commerce to Finance, broke down because they were not able to keep total tabs on what was happening in NET, the system of control was not set up, and that also must be a shared responsibility.</P>
    <P>I have always been extremely cautious about attacking public servants who are not in a position to defend themselves in public, but I quote another conclusion of the Committee, page 84:</P>
    <P>The Committee has established to its satisfaction that there was a serious misunderstanding between NET on the one hand and the Government and Government Departments on the other hand as to the amount of the estimated capital cost of the project during the critical period covering Government approval and NET's authorising of Kellogg to proceed.</P>
    <P>I hold the view that, after 50 or 60 years of State investment in State-sponsored bodies, we need to have some kind of controlled mechanism whereby that kind <Col N="2644" /> of misunderstanding cannot and should not be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>There are two other conclusions which are of considerable importance.  I quote conclusion No. (iii) in relation to the Marino Point Project:</P>
    <P>The Committee considers that the time taken by NET management to transmit vital capital cost information to the Government Departments concerned, and on occasions to the NET Board, was too long.</P>
    <P>We then came to the conclusion:</P>
    <P>From the Committee's examination of the evidence given, it would appear that NET management were premature in proceeding with the execution of the project by issuing the Letter of Intent to Kellogg on 12.12.1974.</P>
    <P>The indictment contained in our Committee's report, all of which we can substantiate in documentation data, is positively embarrassing.  It is embarrassing for somebody from the Labour Party to have to say this in terms of conclusions. It should go on the record of the House in terms of people's responsibility here.</P>
    <P>As regards the contract with Kellogg, the Minister is in a tragic situation.  If Fianna Fáil win the election, he will not be Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  If Fianna Fáil lose the election he will not be Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism either.  If Fianna Fáil win the Taoiseach will probably put the Minister into the Department of Defence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is hardly relevant to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister would be quite happy if Fianna Fáil lost the election because he might then be leader of the party.  However, I will not dwell on that matter.  Whatever else the Minister does he should ensure that his Department examine contracts for civil engineering work.  Where the IDA grant money or where public capital programme money is involved, the Department should ensure that the contracts are <Col N="2645" /> scrutinised.  I should like to quote from paragraph 263 of the committee's report:</P>
      <P>It is the Committee's conclusion, having considered the mass of submissions and arguments advanced, that the contract favoured the contractor to a considerable extent.  The Committee is supported in this conclusion by its consultants who are of the opinion that the type of contract conditions between NET and Kellogg appeared to be heavily weighted in favour of the contractor.</P>
      <P>This was a project where the cost was originally estimated at £63 million and finished up at £137 million.  The Department should have demanded to see the contract and they would not be regarded by anyone as excessively bureaucratic or inhibiting the normal progression of State contracts.  We know that every month costs escalate through the mechanism of price variation clauses.  In all Government Departments there should be constant monitoring of major contracts before sanction to proceed is issued.</P>
      <P>As I am a spokesman for the Labour Party, a member of a trade union and a former union official, it might be assumed I am in favour of giving a certain immunity to any development project.  However, the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies is an all-party committee and our report on NET is unanimous. I should like to quote from paragraph 300 of that report:</P>
      <P>The site construction workforce, through unofficial industrial action and excessive absenteeism, contributed to delays amounting to £16.5 million.  It can be argued that some of the responsibility for this cost can be attributed to Kellogg who were responsible for the management of industrial relations. However, NET have argued strongly that they do not subscribe to this view on the grounds that every single incidence of industrial action was unofficial. Kellogg could hardly be held responsible for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be said loud and clear that £16 million was attributed to industrial action.  As there was no incentive to the <Col N="2646" /> main contractor to ensure that they had management on the site to prevent wildcat and unofficial strikes, that should be put on record as a contributing factor in the increased costs.</P>
    <P>In the case of Arklow Gypsum, here we have not just a matter of escalation of costs but also a decision to proceed which reflects the whole problem of NET.  I should like to quote from paragraph 317 of the report:</P>
    <P>The Arklow Gypsum Limited (AGL) project was approved by the NET board in 1973.  The project subsequently went ahead with mechanical completion planned for the end of 1974.  However, due to various delays commissioning did not commence until more than 4 years later.  By early 1980 not only could a breakeven situation no longer be projected but even cash flow projections were negative.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that the board, without doing any feasibility study, should decide to go ahead.  Between 1973 and 1981 they literally poured down the drain £9 million of taxpayers' money.  Some 132 jobs were directly involved in Arklow, north Wicklow and north Wexford.  It is incredible that such irresponsibility was allowed to continue.  In paragraph 318 the committee reported as follows:</P>
    <P>The Committee has not had the opportunity to examine either the original feasibility study, the succeeding ones or the final one on which the decision to close the plant down was made.  However, bearing in mind that NET projections have almost always been proved to be over-optimistic and also the fact that on this occasion their final prognosis was made on the basis of &ldquo;nothing going wrong&rdquo;, the Committee is of the opinion that NET's only course was to close and, if possible, to sell the plant.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of the committee with regard to the Arklow project were restrained.  The closure of the project was inevitable having regard to the decisions made.</P>
    <P>One striking point about NET &mdash; and this was evident also in some other <Col N="2647" /> State-sponsored companies &mdash; was their failure to take account of inflation. Accounts were presented by them with monotonous regularity in current financial terms.  In paragraph 322 the committee stated:</P>
    <P>Another factor that had an important bearing on subsequent events was the omission of inflation from the original feasibility study.  Thus, in the original feasibility study it was assumed that the cost of raw materials, services and personnel would increase at the same rate as the selling price.  This assumption was made despite the fact that a sensitivity analysis showed that the project was particularly sensitive to project price.  Subsequent events showed that this was a serious misjudgment when in the period 1973 to 1979 raw material costs had increased by a factor of 4.3 whereas selling prices obtainable had increased by a factor of only 2.5</P>
    <P>This was a recipe for absolute disaster. What was involved was taxpayers' money.  It is imperative that the Minister or his successor insist that the most modern up-to-date accounting methods which take account of inflation are employed by State-sponsored bodies.  Firms in the private sector are taken to the cleaners every week by the receiver for failure to adopt this course.  The committee have examined 17 State-sponsored bodies and in fairness I must state that most of them do not fall into that category.  However, what happened in the case of NET was so expensive that it deserves comment in this House.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on the future studies to be undertaken by this inter-departmental committee aided by the consultants. The biggest single policy decision which will have to be taken relative to NET is the one I alluded to at the beginning, namely, should they be using the gas feed stock resource which they are permitted to use at present.  That is a policy decision of the first magnitude.  In his attenuated comments today the Minister alluded to this in a most veiled fashion. <Col N="2648" /> It was also referred to by the Minister for Energy.  Today the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Obviously one of the matters which will have to be considered is the dramatic change which has taken place in the energy field since the original decisions relating to Kinsale gas were taken.  There may be better uses to which this gas can now be put and the full implications for this in relation to employment, balance of payments, energy efficiency and returns to the Exchequer will have to be examined.</P>
    <P>There are questions which will have to be put directly to the Minister's committee and which will have to be answered in a very definite way.  I will put them in a media sense and the Minister will know what I am alluding to.  Let me take one of the many public comments made in this regard.  On December 3 1980 in <i>The Irish Times</i> Paul Tansey claimed that NET were paying almost 10p per therm for gas from the BGE.  He went on to say that fuel oil equivalent price, based on the average import price from January to September 1980, of £84 a ton, and assuming 391 therms per ton, comes to 22p per therm, implying conservatively a &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; of 12p a therm.  With the annual consumption of NET amounting to 192 million therms, this implies an annual feedstock &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; of £21.84 million, if the estimate of price paid is correct.</P>
    <P>In their 1979-80 annual report at page 43 the ESB gave a fuel cost per unit sent out of 1.092p for their Marina gas consuming power plant.  The cheapest fuel cost per unit sent out from an oil-fired plant is found at the Poolbeg Station with a cost of 1.697p per unit sent out, which exceeds the gas fuel cost by 55 per cent. Therefore, if we apply the difference, namely, 0.605p to the number of units sent out in the year from Marina, which is roughly 1.066.6 million units, we get a &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; to electricity consumers of £6 million, on a very crude basis.</P>
    <P>One of the major questions facing the inter-departmental committee is the altternative use to giving a feedstock to NET, the alternative economic usage at X price to future users of that gas which is being given currently to that economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2649" /> I have not got the competence to do an economic evaluation of that situation. The Minister's inter-departmental committee and the consultants employed should have the economic ability to arrive at a conclusion on that matter.  On the basis of information publicly available &mdash; and there have been many allusions to the price for gas paid by NET &mdash; and so that nobody will feel I am being exclusive, I want to quote some of the comments made during the course of the evidence given.  The information is of some considerable importance.  In the minutes of evidence taken before the committee in July 1980 Mr. McSweeney said:</P>
    <P>We are not permitted to disclose the price of gas and would not do so, but we have studied what is paid by people in our business for gas for major heavy chemical business.  Gas is available in some cases at unbelievably cheap prices under old contracts and there are modern prices which are related to today's conditions.  The price we pay is within the general range.</P>
    <P>On the same day Mr. O'Brien said:</P>
    <P>Our information is that our biggest competitor and much bigger than ourselves in England is paying a little less, or if it is more, it is only infinitesimally so, than we are paying.  So, I cannot see how we are subsidised in that respect.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery. &mdash; What is the duration of the contract for the natural gas?</P>
    <P>Mr. McSweeney. &mdash; Twenty years.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery.&mdash;But it is escalating.</P>
    <P>Professor O'Donnell.&mdash; There is an escalation clause.  I think I said 12 years earlier.  The escalation clause is based on the average of the bulk price for 12 months and not 12 years.</P>
    <P>As reported on page 32 Senator Cooney said:</P>
    <P>Yours is a 20 years contract.  What are the provisions in it for renewal?</P>
    <P>Mr. Crumlish.&mdash;It is related to the life of the field and at the time of signing <Col N="2650" /> or drawing up the contract the life of the field was determined as 20 years from the start of production.  Our contract runs for 20 years from commencement of production, from 1979.</P>
    <P>In that context the data are clearly available to the inter-Departmental committee and the consultants to be employed by the Minister.  A major policy decision arises in that regard.  On the assumption that the long-drawn out declaration of a general election will finally be made, the incoming Government will have to face the major policy decisions to be taken.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party considered this Bill carefully.  We received a number of representations in the Cork and Arklow areas and other areas about the Bill and about NET.  At times we were accused maliciously of knocking NET for the sake of knocking NET.  This is grossly incorrect. When we are about to rescue this company on its death bed we are absolutely entitled, in the national and public interest and to ensure that this kind of situation will not recur in the history of Irish enterprise, to apportion a degree of blame and lay it on the doorstep of the people responsible for what happened, be they former or current Ministers, former or current public servants, or the board of this company from 1974 onwards, those responsible for the taking of these policy decisions.</P>
    <P>It is arguable that had the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies been set up when it should have been set up &mdash; I remember so advocating when we were in office in 1974 to 1977 &mdash; had we got to grips with the situation early on, because in the last couple of years we have examined no less than 17 separate State-sponsored bodies, we might have detected and at least alerted the Houses of the Oireachtas to the development at that time.  The Joint Committee should have been set up way back in 1970, when they would have been in a position to tease out in public some of the ambivalence, some of the total over-optimism and, indeed lack of confidence which we found and which the Minister quite clearly found at a later date.  That would have obviated the necessity for coming <Col N="2651" /> into this House today seeking funds of this magnitude.  Above all it would have lessened the appalling air of uncertainty, of depression and the lack of optimism for the future which has permeated the complex both in Arklow and Cork.  The least we owe the workers in those plants is that we be totally honest with them in terms of what happened and in terms of their future.</P>
    <P>In so far as these moneys and guarantees of borrowing will keep the situation afloat we give our approval here today. We do so without any reservation of the immediate, short-term prospect, subject to examining in the most careful way the future viability of this whole, sorry enterprise as it has developed between 1974 and 1981, as obviously it has a future with the most careful State control and scrutiny.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said in recent months about the financial affairs of NET and how they got into their present state.  There is no need for me to go into that situation as, following the report of the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies, the various meetings and deputations and media coverage, every rational person is now aware of the sad financial state of the company.</P>
      <P>I regret that the company's financial state is such as to necessitate the introduction of this Bill but, having said that, I welcome its provisions.  I note that it is designed to increase the authorised share capital of the company and the limit on its borrowings which will now be covered by Ministerial order.  Indeed the contents of the Bill indicate the Government's confidence in the ability of the company to overcome their current difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the circulation of the Bill there has been an upsurge of optimism amongst workers in the town of Arklow, amongest everybody involved in the economic life of that area.  Clearly it is the wish of all concerned that the economic viability of the company be re-established.  Hopefully the renewed efforts of management, workers, the Minister and his Department &mdash; whom I compliment on this £50 million injection &mdash; will ensure that this <Col N="2652" /> viability is soon restored.  It is essential that this native industry, using in the main indigenous resources, will prove to be successful.  Indeed it has had much success to date.  After all it supplies up to 85 per cent of the domestic market in straight nitrogen, a basic commodity requirement of agriculture, our main economic component.</P>
    <P>When the Marino Point development was introduced in 1974 there were assurances given that that development would compliment the NET development, the parent company in Arklow, that it would cement the viability of that company. Sadly that has not proved to be the case, witness to this fact are the huge number of redundancies that have taken place in the Arklow arm of the company.  These redundancies have brought about tremendous personal and financial strains on workers and their families, something which has had an enormous adverse impact on the socio-economic life of Arklow and the South Wicklow-North Wexford region.  This £50 million injection has brought about renewed optimism in the area and is essential to the maintenance of the company's functions.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note also from the Minister's speech that he has established an inter-departmental committee to consider the options for the future of NET. This is vital as the company, through its new managing director, confers with his consultants and has his feasibility studies carried out.  It is vital also that the Oireachtas be kept informed and involved through this inter-departmental committee.  I know that the company's venture into an off-shoot in Arklow Gypsum did not prove successful; in fact it was a disaster and this has been admitted. Nevertheless I sincerely hope a viable, alternative ancillary can be found for NET.  The last was fraught with difficulties, saw the loss of many jobs and a lot of taxpayer's money.  With a study group examining the options, as the situation continues to evolve, hopefully various ancillary and other projects can be entered into adding to the company's viability.</P>
    <P>Therefore I welcome the provisions of this Bill and join the Minister in the <Col N="2653" /> optimism I know abounds once again within the community.  Certainly I hope that NET will recover very strongly and quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As if we did not know we have now discovered what is wrong with the NET plant company.  Sufficient has been said about the faults of this company by everybody in the country over the last three years.  It is time we began to ascertain what we can do about it in the future, whether or not it can be rendered a viable fertiliser and ammonia-producing plant and, if not, what we intend doing with the £1,500,000 worth of plant existing at Marino Point, what we intend to do with the 50 per cent of the gas field in the Celtic Sea, the Marathon field and what we intend doing with the 800 workers employed in the plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admire the job done by the Joint Committee in relation to all the companies they have dealt with. Of course they have the benefit of hindsight. Another lesson to be learned is how careful we must be of the qualifications of people who are given top jobs in important companies here.  I am a strong believer in the necessity for movement out of the civil service to industry and from industry to the civil service but until that has been going on at all levels for a number of years we must be careful about the appointments we make from the public sector to the semi-private sector as in this case.  The incompetence of the management, the workers and the board of NET have got them into a financial bind over the last seven or eight years but I would suspend judgment on them having read the report of the Joint Committee some of which is horrifying reading.  The inter-departmental committee which the Minister has just now set up is very much too late when the evidence that necessitated this Bill has been with the Minister for 18 months.  In their report of 1979 presented to the Minister the chairman of NET signalled a restructuring of the finances of the company and indicated that they would lose £50 million during <Col N="2654" /> 1980.  At this stage on 12 May we are debating a provision relating to the repayment of the loan before 29 May. That means that this House only got 17 days notice yet the Minister had this indication from the NET report of 1979. It is unreasonable for the Minister to attack the board and the management of NET here for not doing their job properly when this House is being asked to correct the financial structure of this company so that money due for repayment and known to be due for repayment on 29 May for four of five years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of course they could. About 99.9 per cent of decisions are made in advance of the reports of the committee.  The fact that this was twelve month money makes it even worse and it is a further indictment of the people involved.  If the Minister knew this was twelve month money and waited until a fortnight before repayment was due to come in here and ask this House to pass £50 million there is as much criticism due to the Minister as there is in other respects due to the board of NET.  I will put amendments down on Committee Stage of this Bill to ensure that at least in relation to this company this will not happen again.  I am sure that the Minister will use his 82 Deputies to ensure that my amendments will not pass but I still do my best.  The chairman in his 1979 report <Col N="2655" /> signalled that the company would lose £50 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister gives me the 1979 report of the accounts of NET I will quote from it.  In those reports the chairman signalled that the company would lose £50 million during 1980.  It is quite obvious that a company with a capital base of £17½ million making a loss of £50 million will need extra capital.  I cannot understand how the Minister can come in here with only a fortnight to go and expect to get this money passed with only a limited amount of discussion.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister decided to set up an inter-departmental committee to look into the future of NET.  I criticise the Minister for saying that the £50 million is not enough and that we will be having this discussion again at the end of this year when more money will be needed.  The Minister was tardy in waiting until now to set up this committee when it was obvious to everybody long before the Joint Committee sat that a serious decision would have to be taken about NET.  The Minister says:</P>
      <P>With this in mind, the Government have now decided to establish an inter-departmental committee of senior officials to consider in detail all the options for the future of NET with a view to reporting to me as soon as practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This should have been done years ago because this company take 46 to 50 per cent of the gas produced in the Marathon field.  To say that there may be better uses for this gas is true but if a decision is taken by the Minister to shut down the NET plant what effect would that have on the contract that An Bord Gáis have with Marathon that requires them to take <Col N="2656" /> the entire field at a certain flow over a given period?  What effect will that have on the price being paid for the gas by An Bord Gáis which is a State company? That is something which must be considered.</P>
    <P>Now, the known best use for this gas would be a domestic use on Inch Strand where it comes ashore.  Every mile that it is moved away from there and every other use made of it makes it a less valuable asset.  The advantage of the urea plant at Marino Point is that it is within a relatively short distance from the point of coming ashore so the loss in transmission is quite small.  Another advantage of that plant is that it helps to make this country totally independent of the importation of nitrogenous fertilisers.  This is something of strategic value and possibly could be quantified or guessed at in terms of money.  It is said that there is a subsidy for using this gas, because the price which NET are paying to An Bord Gáis is relatively low.  If this is so, and Deputy Desmond quoted to this effect from the evidence given before his committee &mdash; which I had always understood to be the case &mdash; many or most, and probably all, of the companies who make similar use of natural gas for the production of fertilisers sell it at below market price, below the going rate.  Therefore, the companies with which NET are in competition are receiving the benefit of this &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the stock of fertilisers being produced by NET were taken off the world market, would supply and demand become more interbalanced, even if only fractionally, and so interfere with the price of, or increase the price at which we would have to import fertilisers?  What effect would this have on our balance of payments?  On the other side of the equation, what is the advantage to our balance of payments of producing these goods ourselves?  Even if all these sums were to come out correctly, if it was decided that one could make something else with the natural gas close to Cork, or even transporting it to Dublin, if there was more beneficial use, how could one quantify the added value by spreading the fertiliser on land, getting it through our cattle <Col N="2657" /> and onto the export markets again?  Even if that came out wrongly and all these considerations had been taken into account, and we decide to turn off the tap and give no more natural gas to the NET factory at Marino Point, what do you do with one of the most modern and one of the biggest chemical plants in Europe?  This plant has a value of probably £150 million and perhaps more, sitting on a prime deepwater frontage in one of the most sought-after industrial parts of this country and you are still stuck with the problem of paying off the debts, because they are Government guaranteed.  That is why this legislation is before the House today.  The Government have guaranteed the borrowings of NET and this must now be repaid.</P>
    <P>Even if NET go out of existence on 29 May &mdash; and I agree with the Minister that if this debt is not repaid they probably will go out &mdash; I presume, but do not known &mdash; the Minister might enlighten me in his reply &mdash; that there is no legal obligation on the Government to pay, but there certainly is an obligation on this country to pay money which was borrowed by semi-State bodies under Government control and is guaranteed by them.  I do not know what the legal position would be if the company went into liquidation on 29 May, but that is a scenario which we should not even consider. I presume this country would pay their debts.  So, we are stuck with the debts of Nítrigin Éireann.  If they are guaranteed by the Government, the Government must pick up the tab for all that money. You must pay the money which Nítrigin Éireann borrowed under Government guarantee; you have, I think, £136 million &mdash; although £150 million is probably a truer value &mdash; of the plant sitting on prime industrial land: you have 800 people on the dole queue, and you must set about immediately redrafting your contract with the Marathon Petroleum Company, because you are not now fulfilling your side of the contract and taking off 50 per cent of the natural gas, as you had undertaken to do seven or eight years ago.</P>
    <P>These are the problems which the Government must face and these are the considerations <Col N="2658" /> which must be taken into account by the inter-departmental committee. I would hope that some little bit of realism would now come into all our undertakings.  I am trying to find the figure I have quoted.  Can the Minister find it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>He says in the report dated 23 May that the results would be much worse.  He does not quantify them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I cannot find the figure which I saw, of £150 million. He does say here that the finance changes for 1980 will be of the order of £25 million. Perhaps the figure I mentioned was in the accounts of Deputy Desmond's committee.  I understood that a £50 million loss in 1980 had been forecast.</P>
      <P>It is time that a little realism was brought into the discussion about natural gas and about the Nítrigin Éireann plant in Cork.  The £50 million which we will pass next week, or whenever it goes though this House and becomes law, takes care of only part of the problem.  I think I saw a quotation where the debts of the company are now £200 million.  Is anybody going to suggest that the Government are going to pay off all the debts of this company, going to put 800 people out of work and be stuck with the plant sitting in Cork harbour with very little marketable value but with an actual value of £150 million?  Is it not time that we came clean and said that this plant is to stay in operation and that the workforce will continue to be employed?  Their training has been in progress there since the plant opened two or three years ago and they are now competent and capable of producing at prices that are as competitive as those relating to goods produced by workers in other factories in other parts of the world with whom our workers are competing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This plant is one of the most modern in the world for the production of ammonia and urea but we should ensure that it is managed better and more tightly than was the case in the past.  We must do everything possible to guarantee that, even after 20 years have elapsed, we will have the source of producing 100 per cent <Col N="2659" /> of the needs of our farmers in terms of nitrogenous fertilisers at competitive prices.  This would ensure that our farmers could compete competitively in terms of production and it is the sort of positive approach that is needed if we are to think in terms of the maximum benefit for the national economy.</P>
    <P>What happened in the past so far as this plant is concerned is both regrettable and appalling.  The report of the Joint Committee was alarming.  It was an indictment of many people.  But that is all in the past and there is no point now in trying to recoup losses.  The money has been lost.  We must now adopt a positive approach and agree that we have no option at this point but to fulfil our contract for natural gas.  The price is good. Although NET may be buying at what some people might regard as a subsidised price &mdash; and I would not so agree &mdash; when we realise that 100 per cent of the product will be absorbed inside the country, we realise the importance of this plant to agriculture, which is our most important industry.  All of this will be reflected in higher profits for all sectors of the agricultural community.  We would be penalising ourselves by failing to fulfil the contract and we must remember that there are 800 jobs at stake.</P>
    <P>The £50 million being talked about here is not the all important factor because this is a plant that must not be closed.  However, it must be managed more efficiently than has been the case in the past.  We cannot afford to put another 800 people on the dole queue in addition to the 126,000 who are unemployed now. Most of the criticisms made by Deputy Desmond and by the Joint Committee are valid.  Is mór an trua é sin.  But let us not any more make the company, their new management &mdash; and I underline the word &ldquo;new&rdquo;&mdash; and their staff, the whipping boy for every politician and journalist in the country.  Let us start today and restructure properly the finances of the company.  We are not doing that so far as this Bill is concerned.  Today we are catering only for one small part of the problem.  A major benefit was the fact of being able to make the deal with Marathan <Col N="2660" /> for the gas at a very reasonable price.  That was because we were in a position to create immediately a huge &ldquo;take-off&rdquo; of the gas.  The benefit for this country of being independent of the important of urea and ammonia is collosal in terms of the assurance of supply to the farming community at reasonable prices and of the overall benefit to the economy.  Therefore, it is time that we stopped knocking NET and pointed to all these advantages.  We must set about obtaining the highest possible value from this plant, not only for the economy but for the workforce and for the agricultural community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak to the Bill from a totally objective point of view.  I expect that all of those here who have read the report of the Joint Committee relating to NET have found it frightening and realise that the question of the future of the company raises many important issues.  Primarily, we must ask how best we can utilise our resources, whether these resources be natural resources in the form of gas or straightforward hard cash resources.</P>
      <P>Could the money we are being asked to agree to here today be spent better in the building of hospitals or in the provision of employment or by way of grant-aids for industry and for farmers?  We must ask ourselves whether this money might be put to more productive use.  We must ask also whether the gas might be used in a more productive manner.  It is not good enough to say that because the industry is there it must continue as it has continued during the past couple of years.</P>
      <P>The information that we garnered during the course of the Joint Committee's investigations would make one's hair stand on end.  This was a case of gross mismanagement of State funds.  Let us not take the easy way out and be nice about it.  Neither let us be unnecessarily ugly.  We must be fair and straight in this matter.  I am reasonably happy that there has been a big improvement in the whole structure of the NET company and especially in the management there particularly during the past year and a half.  I would be hopeful &mdash; but no more than hopeful &mdash; that the change in management and the general outlook will make things more palatable in the future and that the results will not be as dreadful as they have been in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the sittings of that Joint Committee we learned time and again that the projections put forward by the company were far too ambitious and did not at all keep in line with reality.  It is because of that fact that I am not too confident that the future is as rosy as has <Col N="2662" /> been predicted this evening by some speakers.  We must take a hard, long and objective look at the whole case.  It is obvious that mistakes were made and this is the place where it should be stated that mistakes were made.  The finger should be pointed in the direction of the perpetrators of those mistakes and the reasons for them spelled out.  We must ask ourselves if the people who originally thought up the idea of manufacturing urea fertiliser really knew what they were doing; if they had sufficient expertise to know what was involved or if they were just playing around with an elaborate toy which, as it turned out, was a very costly toy?</P>
    <P>As a member of the Joint Committee it seems that the people involved originally did not know the extent of the financial involvement.  They did not know the cost to the country and were not sufficiently qualified to decide whether this venture should be undertaken.  Initially it seemed a very attractive proposition that we should be independent as regards the provision of nitrogen fertiliser.  It seemed a very praiseworthy objective, but I hate to think of what would have happened if we had to rely on naphtha or fuel oil as a source for the production of that nitrogen fertiliser.  In the event NET were blessed that there was a discovery of gas off Kinsale in 1973 because that put at their disposal a very cheap source of raw material.  With the explosion in oil prices in subsequent years it is obvious that if they had to use naphtha or fuel oil as the raw material the cost we are now experiencing would be multiplied.  If there has been any saving grace in this economic catastrophe it has been that NET were able to avail of an extremely cheap source of energy.  The cost of that energy has been a closely guarded secret. We were told that because of industrial competition NET did not want to permit their competitors to find out the real price, but obviously it is less than the going rate in Europe for similar sources of energy.  NET have had this advantage all along and it cloaks the real losses, which are obviously considerably more than those which have come to the public notice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2663" /> If the gas was being sold at the going rate which industry is paying for oil or which the Dublin Gas Company is at present paying for naptha, then the losses incurred by NET would not be of the order of £200 million to date but probably a multiple of that sum.  We can be thankful for small blessings in that regard.  The other great element of worry in regard to this was the manner in which the contract with the main contractors was set up.  The Kellogg company of America, the main contractors on the site, got an open-ended agreement, the type of contract that everybody in the construction business or any form of business would love to have.  There were virtually no penalty clauses.  The extent of the penalty clauses came to £650,000 whereas they were being paid a fee to the extent of £6 million and probably greater due to additional costs.  They were handling materials which cost in the region of £100 million. How anybody could have agreed to such an open-ended contract is beyond my comprehension.  Surely the whole idea of a contract is that if the contractor does not live up to expectations he should have to bear the cost of his failure.  In this case that did not happen.  The contractor was immune in regard to the normal penalty clauses associated with such a contract. The word &ldquo;contract&rdquo; in this case is a misnomer.  The word &ldquo;fee&rdquo; is nearer the truth.  I fail to see how the company could have agreed to such a loose-ended contract or fee arrangement.  There was no initiative needed from Kellogg to see that the job finished on time.  If it did not finish on time they would not be penalised and surely the whole basis of such a contract is to see that people live up to their obligations.</P>
    <P>When the building of the Marino Point project went behind time the only person who suffered was the Irish taxpayer.  The loss was estimated at £2 million per month.  From our questioning of the management of NET on that Joint Committee it appears that the delays for one reason or another during the course of the construction of the Marino Point project amounted to something like 15 months. Straight away that creates a loss of £13 <Col N="2664" /> million, an astronomical figure for one project.  That was a major mistake, and the consultants who advised the Joint-Committee in their investigation of the affairs of NET made that point sharply. The consultants felt that the open-ended form of the contract was not conductive to the work on the project being finished on time.  The delays listed were mainly due to industrial disputes.  Another reason was the delay in Kellogg providing the final design plans.  We were also told there were delays due to bad weather in the winter of 1977-78.  I do not know if that is correct but it is what we were told by the management of NET.  It seems a little far-fetched that the weather could have caused delays to the extent mentioned, virtually six months.</P>
    <P>The causes of delays are listed in the report of the Joint Committee and the cost of those delays are put down as follows: the delay in design and procurement of the plans cost £5 million; delays due to industrial action cost £10½ million; delays due to bad weather cost £8.7 million and delays due to excessive absenteeism amounted to £6 million &mdash; overall a total loss of £30 million.  If a contractor were tied to a finishing time the delays would not have happened to an extent anywhere near that mentioned in the report as I have just listed.</P>
    <P>We deduced during the hearing that in the course of construction of the Marino Point project there were 79 industrial disputes and every single one of them was unofficial.  Again a large amount of blame must lie with the Kellogg Company who were in charge of the construction of the plant itself because they were responsible for industrial relations on the site and seemingly they did not have the proper personnel to manage things properly, and that is borne out by the fact that during the course of the construction &mdash; unfortunately much too late to have any real effect &mdash; Kellogg's chief men on the site, their project manager and his assistant, were both replaced, which would indicate that NET were right when they objected to the manner in which the work was being prolonged.  I have seen the comment by one of the consultants we <Col N="2665" /> employed to give his views on the project and it was, to say the least of it, uncomplimentary.</P>
    <P>When that is the standard of management provided on the site by the Kellogg Company initially the blame must lie with the NET management and board for allowing such a state of affairs to arise. They were the people who called the tune, who were dishing out the Government's and the taxpayers' money in the long run, and if they allowed themselves to be conned in the drawing up of the contract they must take the blame.  I believe that when the contract was being drawn up many of the conditions were not acceptable to the Kellogg Company and they changed something like 60 different points in the contract presented to them by the NET company.  In other words, a lot of the trouble arose from the fact that Kelloggs got their way when it came to drawing up the contract, if you can use such a word.  Eventually that type of open-handed arrangement led to industrial chaos, lengthy delays and a colossal loss of money.  It teaches us a lesson and I hope it has taught us that semi-State bodies must be supervised much more strictly, and I am glad to see from the Minister's statement that he is doing just that.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes reference to the fact that he was at numerous meetings with the board and management of NET and he has told them that he expects a better performance and that he is keeping a financial check on them once every three months, because obviously the proper types of restrictions and checks were not kept by the relevant Government Departments during the construction of the project in question.  It brings up the whole question of accountability by State-sponsored bodies to the Department of Finance or to the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism or whatever Department they responded to or to whatever Department is in charge. In this case we saw a form of looseness which should not be tolerated and I hope that the tightening up which the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, has brought about is not restricted to NET and that it goes right across the whole field of State-sponsored <Col N="2666" /> bodies in this country.  There is too much money involved and, as I have said, perhaps the money being lost in these companies could be used to better advantage elsewhere and we in this Parliament are here to see that that is done.  Up to now it has not been done.  I go along with the Minister if he can see that the money is spent properly and prudently.</P>
    <P>Those are some aspects of the deficiencies in the set-up of the semi-State body involved, Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta.  Of course, it is questionable whether the project would ever have got off the ground if there had been proper consultation between the company and the Departments directly involved, the Departments of Finance and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It would appear from the evidence that we listened to at that hearing that there is doubt as to whether the Departments were deliberately denied information about escalating costs.  I remember asking the former managing director, &ldquo;Did you not inform the Departments of the escalation in costs in good time because you were afraid that if you did they would not allow the project to go ahead?&rdquo; and he almost jumped down my throat.  He said, &ldquo;No, that is not so&rdquo;.  However, I have doubts.  I think that, due to proper tabs not being kept on the progress at the tendering stage, the project was allowed to go ahead when it might not have been. Initially the cost was estimated to be something like £30 million, when the idea was first mooted back in 1972, using naphtha and fuel oil.  By 1974 it had increased to £42.5 million and the Government of the day, in November 1974, were told that the project would cost £42 million.  On 2 December 1974 the board of NET decided to go ahead with the project on an estimate of £63.5 million and that decision was reinforced by the management of NET the following day, who again decided to proceed with the project at a cost of £63.5 million.  Therein lies a story because, despite the fact that the decision was made on 2 and 3 December 1974, we are told that the first the Department of Industry and Commerce knew about the increased and amended cost was in early April 1975, some five <Col N="2667" /> months later, and the Department of Finance maintain that they did not know about the escalation in cost until the end of April 1975.</P>
    <P>Therefore there was a major breakdown in consultation and, although meetings were held and we are told that officials from both the Department of Finance and the Department of Industry and Commerce were present on 3 December 1974, there is no documentation to the effect that they were told on that date of the escalation in prices from £42 million to £63.5 million.  There was a colossal breakdown in communications, and whether the breakdown meant that the project went ahead when it might not have gone ahead is a question which we were not able to answer.  The key question in this whole episode is: would the project have gone ahead if the Government of the day had been made aware that the cost was going to be £63.5 million, which of course in turn escalated to £137 million?  It is a classical example of lack of control from central Government over State-sponsored bodies and should not be allowed to recur.</P>
    <P>The Arklow Gypsum plant was another catasthrophe within the NET framework.  It cost something like £9 million. From beginning to end it was destined to failure.  Again, we must question the grounds on which that company was set up and we must question the qualifications of the people who allowed it to be set up, because it would appear from reading the reports and from taking evidence from witnesses, including the workforce at Arklow Gypsum, that the company did not really have much hope of success for the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  The projections were way off course.  There just did not seem to be a market for what they were producing.  That again raises the question as to the capabilities and qualifications of the management.</P>
    <P>Let me raise the question of the board of NET.  Are these boards really necessary? Are they competent to make decisions of the magnitude required?  The boards of State-sponsored companies generally meet about once a month.  The people involved are involved on a part-time <Col N="2668" /> basis.  One must question whether they are aware of the complications involved in major companies.  I have come to the conclusion that boards should not be made up of people who have just a passing interest in the venture involved.  They should be people who are highly professional and highly qualified in that specific project and not people with a broadly based interest.  Perhaps one or two members of the board could have a broadly based interest.  A board which is going to make decisions on a project involving hundreds of millions of pounds should not consist of people who meet once a month for a couple of hours &mdash; perhaps some of those members would not be present at the relevant meeting. Boards should be established on a fulltime basis and should have senior officials from the relevant Departments involved in the project.  The day of part-time boards is gone.  The day of the old family firms which had relatives, uncles and aunts, brothers and sisters on the board is gone.  That was all very fine when dealing with an annual turnover of a couple of thousand pounds.  But when one is dealing with projects running into hundreds of millions of pounds we should see that a more professional approach is adopted.</P>
    <P>If nothing else the investigation of the Joint Committee highlights the difficulties we have in the present State-sponsored structures.  That is a glaring difficulty. I do not wish to go outside the scope of this Bill, but let us take other State companies where the chairman of the board is part-time and works at it only a couple of days a week.  These are companies spending hundreds of millions of pounds and the boards only meet once a month.  These are large undertakings and it should not be left to people to do this work on a part-time basis.</P>
    <P>There should be much more control at Government level.  If there was we probably would avoid a lot of the heavy losses which are presently being endured, and certainly the NET losses would never have escalated if that type of control had been there.  I do not wish to make this a political matter.  The Minister may come back and say that it was the previous <Col N="2669" /> Government who were involved at the time.  But the structure was there from time immemorial, from the time the State-sponsored bodies were set up.  It just happened to happen during that period.  The Minister himself would have to agree that he would have had difficulty in spotting the escalations involved if they had not been pointed out to him by senior members of his Department.  This apparently was not the case with regard to NET.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that I agree with the need for the passing of this Bill but I have reservations as to the viability of the company in the long run.  That is what we are here for.  We are here to question the advisability of spending large sums of money on projects whose feasibility is in doubt.  The Minister may have read the report of the Joint Committee. I would like to draw his attention to one of the conclusions arrived at by the Committee.  In relation to the Kinsale gas field and its use as a raw material for NET, we asked if it was the best way of using limited resources of natural gas and could the gas be used by the Dublin Gas Company, the Cork Gas Company and other town gas companies throughout the country, or by industry, to better advantage. We also asked if there was a need nationally to secure the fertiliser requirements of the agricultural sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case to be made for retaining NET because it makes us independent of imports.  But there is a degree beyond which one cannot go.  We have not an unlimited amount of finance.  We cannot sustain unlimited losses by NET. There must be a balance and the cardinal question is where the line should be drawn with regard to the future financing of NET.  That line must be drawn.  It is not enough to say that we should be independent of fertilisers from abroad. As it is, there is an over supply of nitrogen fertilizers on the world market.  That is all the more reason why we should, as the Committee recommended, see that a study is undertaken to determine our strategy in this regard in the short-term, in the long-term and in the medium-term. A study is needed.  We are lay people. <Col N="2670" /> We are not professionals and it is not for us to adjudicate on these matters.  But a study is definitely needed.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has made the point that he has already set up an inter-departmental committee to look into the matter and they are to report to him as soon as practicable on the proposals so that the Government can make a decision as to NET's future role.  But we found that the Government Departments must not have been sufficiently qualified to adjudicate on matters such as this.  We obviously need international experts and we need our own experts in chemical engineering to tell us what are the long-term prospects of this company.  It is a matter of great national concern.  Those of us who spent a lot of time on that Committee were appalled at the sequence of events right from 1970 to 1973.  We were appalled to see money, which we all know was so badly needed for other purposes, literally going down the drain due to a lack of proper management, lack of proper qualifications and proper control.  It made us all feel a bit sick because we all needed it for housing or hospitals and so on in our own parts of the country.  I have no compunction in saying that this matter must be studied very closely.  It is just not good enough to hand people a blank cheque and say &ldquo;spend, spend, spend&rdquo;.  It cannot be done.  We must be more prudent and more responsible in our overall attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been remarkable, in particular for the speech of Deputy Desmond.  I would like to acknowledge its uniqueness.  It bears study.  It was not easy for him to say some of the things he did.  One must recognise that fact.  I have a different sort of inhibition. As Minister I cannot have the sort of swinging freedom which might be open to other Members of the House.  I can only reiterate the type of concern I have expressed on many occasions over a long period in relation to this company, in relation to their past activities and the concern I have in regard to the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one statement Deputy Desmond made which I would like to draw <Col N="2671" /> the attention of the House to, because I fully concur with it.  He said that, bad and all as the situation is in relations to NET generally, the worst aspect of this whole sorry affair was the Arklow Gypsum affair.  He is right.  It is the worst aspect because they &ldquo;only&rdquo; lost a little over £9 million, which seems to be relatively small here but in fact is the more serious aspect of it.  I was not aware of anything even approaching the true situation in Arklow Gypsum Limited until March or April 1980.  After I was alerted to what might be the position I had urgent inquiries made and, believe it or not, it took some months for me to get the full information.  That is a very disturbing aspect of the whole series of difficulties in relation to this company.  Deputy Desmond was right to draw attention to that particular aspect.</P>
    <P>A great many points were made and in the present circumstances it might be better if I did not follow them all.  I will, however, deal with some of them.  When Deputy Desmond spoke about the question of resignations or firings from the board he made the point that anyone who was on the board for the 1974-75 period should be fired or asked to resign.  There are only two members currently on the board who were on it in 1974.  I want to emphasise that point.  I have not anything else to say in relation to the board at the moment.</P>
    <P>The question of exports was raised by Deputy Desmond and other Deputies.  I would like to point out to the House that to seek to prevent the company exporting would only add to their difficulties.  I do not believe any additional loss is caused by their exports.  Their exports of CAN are very small.  I have not got the exact figure, but as a percentage of their total output of CAN from Arklow it is a very negligible percentage and it is mainly to Northern Ireland.  On the other hand, their exports of urea from Cork are fairly substantial.  I believe they amount to more than 50 per cent of the production of urea.  As the House will appreciate, urea is an inevitable by-product of the ammonia plant and one cannot cut down <Col N="2672" /> the output of urea unless one cuts down the output of ammonia.  It would not be economic in the circumstances for the company to reduce their output of urea at the present time.  The company have calculated &mdash; I hope this is one of their correct calculations &mdash; that within five years the Irish agricultural market will take up the total output of urea.  Irish farmers have not been traditionally big users of urea and NET and An Foras Talúntais in recent years have tried to educate them in that direction.  If the rate of increase in the use of urea is as projected, there will be no exportation of it in four years' time.  That would be a satisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the company, who are inevitably producing a surplus of urea, are quite right to export it.  I do not believe it could be stock-piled.  It would be far too costly to stock-pile it and it would be impossible for a company in as weak a situation as this company are to carry such stocks for a period of some years.  There seems to me to be an implication in Deputy Murphy's contribution that the present problems in Arklow were attributable to Marino Point exclusively. I said before, and I want to make it clear again in case there is any misunderstanding on it, that, notwithstanding the appalling escalation of costs at Marino Point, Arklow quite independently are in serious difficulties.  They are making very substantial losses.</P>
    <P>There is a point which has been made to me on numerous occasions about extraordinary work practices which operate in Arklow.  Unfortunately I have to confess to the House that they are pretty hair-raising but the existence of those work practices today and over the last few years is a direct result of bad management and nothing else.  A competent management would never have allowed those practices in the first place.  The fact that they are there today is not the fault of the present managing director.  He can not snap his fingers and eliminate things which have grown up over the years and have been regarded almost as a constitutional right in some respects.  The fact that there are practices of that kind in this or any company can in the last resort <Col N="2673" /> be attributed to weak and inefficient management.  That certainly was the position in the Arklow fertiliser factory for quite a number of years.  It is wrong that such practices are there.  The workers concerned would not be human if they did not take advantage of the weak management which existed there for so long.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies quite rightly raised, as I did in my opening speech, the question of possible alternative uses of gas and of what is the optimum use in present circumstances.  Present circumstances are quite different from what they were some years ago in terms of energy availability and energy prices.  There may be some misapprehensions in regard to it.</P>
    <P>The natural gas in the Kinsale Head field is very pure methane and is rather different to the bulk of the gas in the North Sea.  As a feedstock there are basically only two uses for methane natural gas: first, the manufacture of ammonia and, second, the manufacture of methanol. We are very heavily into the manufacture of ammonia &mdash; we are all lamenting how heavily we are in &mdash; and we are using roughly half the output of the field in the manufacture of ammonia.  The only other alternative where we could use methane natural gas as a feedstock &mdash; I am not talking about power generation, heating and so on &mdash; is methanol.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years I looked long and hard at the possibilities of methanol and it has definite uses.  It is an additive to petroleum; we could add up to 15 per cent in volume of our petroleum.  It is itself a feedstock for a number of plastics and synthetic glues and things of that kind for which there is a level of demand in this country and abroad.  If we were to divert into methanol I was faced with the choice of having to expend in 1980 pounds over £100 million to build a methanol plant which would provide employment for 55 people.  Given the history of building plants to process this gas, I am sure the House will appreciate that I did not rush with any enthusiasm into building a methanol plant in 1980 in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Methanol is becoming more valuable in some respects and recently I had discussions <Col N="2674" /> about it.  In the longer term it appears, and I am advised, that it is likely from, say, the early nineties onwards methanol, or a substance very close to it, can be derived from coal and that the possibilities of building plants <i>in situ</i> over large shallow coalfields in countries like the Soviet Union and Australia show obvious possibilities.</P>
    <P>In terms of non-feedstock use of this gas, there are two ways of using it: first, to generate electricity and, second, to use it directly for heating and cooking. Unfortunately the demand for domestic gas in Ireland is minute.  The Cork demand is tiny and the Dublin demand is the biggest in the country, but still very small by comparison with other European countries, and it is dropping in all cases because of the tremendous cost of gases based on naphtha.  What municipal gas companies could take up would be only a very small fraction of what would be available if this gas were not used for the production of ammonia.</P>
    <P>When the pipeline to Dublin is built we will open up other possibilities because while the direct use in Dublin may be quite small, in the early years particularly, it would be possible, for example, to pipe it to the ESB in Dublin and let them convert some of their oil-fired stations to burn natural gas.  Purists, and people who are less than purists, are not enthusiastic about that.  It is a complicated equation, in which the various figures are changing all the time, to try to work out the balance of advantage.  The criteria we should look at are things like the value which is added in this country, the amount of imports we avoid, the amount of employment of good quality given and various other factors of that kind.</P>
    <P>That is why we set up this interdepartmental committee.  I was accused of not doing this earlier but I do not think any company had more committees, more consultants or more experts looking into their affairs in the last three or four years than NET.  As far back as 1978 I set up a committee to inquire into why things went wrong.  I was resisted very strenuously at the time but I had to press ahead with it and I am glad I did.  There <Col N="2675" /> were, and are, various firms of consultants looking at these questions.  It is worth saying that the correct answers three years ago would not be the correct answers today and it is possible that the correct answer today will not be the correct answer in three years' time, depending on how energy crises move in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The ESB are not in a position at the moment, and would not be before early 1984, to take up any significant further quantities of gas.  For that reason it is, on balance, in the national interest to do what we are doing, that is, keeping this company in existence producing ammonia. It has been easy for some years past, and it is easy today, to buy nitrogenous fertilisers based on ammonia on the world market; but there were times in the past when it was not easy, and there may be such times in the future.  The importance of agriculture to this country and the importance of fertilisers, particularly nitrogenous fertilisers, to agriculture is such that when we have the opportunity to be independent in this regard, provided the cost is not too high, we should try to avail of that opportunity within reason.  I emphasise the words &ldquo;within reason&rdquo; and &ldquo;provided the cost was not too high&rdquo; because it would be tragic for Irish agriculture in, say, five years' time if, as a result of world developments we did not have access to nitrogenous fertilisers at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>Much play is made, not so much in this House as sometimes by commentators outside, about the allegedly cheap price at which NET are getting the gas.  They are getting gas cheaply in the sense that it is much below the oil related price but NET are right when they say the price they are paying is not out of line with that paid by their competitors.  Obviously you cannot expect a major user taking 55 million cubic feet a day to pay the same as a domestic user taking perhaps half-a-cubic foot a day, or a small industrial user who is taking perhaps 500,000 cubic feet a day.</P>
    <P>In terms of other users, as long ago as three years ago I asked the IDA and BGE to look for industrial users.  I have <Col N="2676" /> been somewhat surprised at the fact that they have not come forward as rapidly as one would have expected.  In terms of feedstock for industry, where gas is more than just a different form of power, heat or lighting, the glass industry would be an obvious one, but there is not any prospect of setting up a major glass industry here.  At present there are only two soda glass manufacturers in Britain and it is questionable whether the British and Irish markets between them, of nearly 60 million people, can support two such manufacturers.  In these circumstances it would be a foolish man who would get into glass manufacture here on such a scale.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies strongly made the point that there should be greater control by the Departments of Industry Commerce and Tourism and Finance of the semi-State bodies.  I would ask the House to reflect on a report of the NESC published about six or seven months ago in which the NESC, representative of a very wide range of interests, came out very strongly against what they regarded as the excessive level of central control of these bodies.  There is a fair amount of public and political acceptance of that recommendation.</P>
    <P>Everything we have heard here today is directly contrary to that point of view. It is difficult to know where to go.  Perhaps there should have been greater control, and with hindsight we might all say there should have been greater control exercised here, because it was needed. On the other hand there are other companies where perhaps even less control is needed.  A lot depends on the calibre of the management and on their sense of accountability to the Department concerned. They vary greatly.  Criticism of that kind of Departments can lead the Departments to the situation when instinctively they will say no to everything. If the Department of Finance said no all the time they would be right at least one third of the time.  However, that is not of much use to the national effort at investment and wealth creation.  It is difficult at times to assess some of these projects, and the Departments concerned need the fullest continuing co-operation. <Col N="2677" /> I do not think that on all occasions the Departments get the fullest continuing co-operation.</P>

      <P>The question of accountancy or accounting was raised.  I am in sympathy with the views expressed in this respect.  It is noteworthy that the accounts of NET were audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  For a number of years the Comptroller and Auditor General qualified the accounts of this company.  In 1979 he qualified them on the basis that he was auditing the accounts as those of a going concern and assuming that the company would remain solvent by the injection of State funds, but he had other qualifications in that year and in several other years.  He drew the attention of the Oireachtas and the public to what he regarded as a serious misdemeanour.  The company were paying their then managing director £2,500 a year more than Devlin allowed. That qualification was put into the audit every year as long as I have been dealing with the matter and perhaps it was there before my time.  It probably was.</P>
      <P>It reflects the type of accountancy that was involved when an overpayment of £2,500 a year was made to an official, a major misdemeanour in so far as State accounting in this country is concerned. At the time when all that fuss was being made about £2,500 a year, tens of millions of pounds were going down the drain.  I am not blaming the Comptroller and Auditor General or his staff who are there to audit in accordance with guidelines laid down about public accountability for money, and only that.  Their concern is that Dáil Éireann vote the money and that it is spend in accordance with the general purposes laid down in the Act and with the authorisation of the proper officers in the company.  After that, how it is spent is immaterial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind it is very disturbing that we had our attention called constantly to the overpayment of £2,500 but that our attention was never called to the way things were going, particularly to the situation <Col N="2678" /> which existed in Arklow Gypsum Limited.  Deputy Desmond was right to highlight that as the most serious of all, even though it only&mdash;I emphasise &ldquo;only&rdquo;&mdash; amounted to £9.2 million. There was a company with a complete workforce recruited for four years before they ever went into production.  That is the type of situation that would keep one awake at night when one thought of how that could have happened and how it was concealed effectively from the Oireachtas and the Department concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. Barry was highly critical of those who went back into the past because, he said, we should look only to the future.  I find it necessary to go into the past when asking the Oireachtas to vote a substantial amount of money.  I did not go back very much, I did not analyse the matter fully for the reasons I have set out.  This has been one of the most analysed problems of all and I waited deliberately with this Bill until the Joint Committee's report had been published because it would have been wrong of me to bring a Bill of this nature before the House in the absence of that report.  Deputy P. Barry criticised me violently for waiting and said I should have gone ahead.  It would have been discourteous to the Committee and not very useful to the House if I had done it.</P>
    <P>In the time available I cannot cover every point.  I think I have covered most of the points.  I have not gone as far in relation to many of them as I might wish to do in certain circumstances.  I have given my views to those who cared to listen to them.  This House, the Government and I are faced with the problem that NET are a State company and if we do not pick up the tab for this company we will put every State company who are losing money in jeopardy.  That is a very sad situation, but it is a reality.  Since the Government and the taxpayers have to pick up the tab for this we might as well pick it up and have our company rather than pick it up and not have it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Because this Bill and the Industrial Development (No. 2) Bill, 1981, both deal with changes in industrial development legislation, I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, for the sake of convenience to cover both Bills in my speech.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the first Bill are explained in the memorandum circulated to Deputies on 1 May 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for the revision of the statutory limit on the aggregate amount of grants and payments of a capital nature which can be made by and to the Industrial Development Authority and also of the limits, which may not be <Col N="2681" /> exceeded without prior Government approval, under various grants which the Authority may make to an individual undertaking.</P>
    <P>The limit on the aggregate amount of grants and payments of a capital nature which may be made by the Authority and the aggregate amount of grants which may be paid to the Authority for this purpose out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas was increased to £750 million in the Industrial Development Act, 1978. The total amount of capital issued to the IDA at end April 1981 was almost £724 million and the Authority's capital allocation for 1981 is £196 million.  I am now proposing, in section 2, subsection (1) of the Bill, a new limit of £1,500 million. This higher limit will permit the IDA to carry out their functions after the end of this month for a further three to four years.  I am also proposing in section 2, subsections (2) and (3) an increase from £100 million to £125 million in the aggregate amount of loan guarantees which may be given by the IDA.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Act, 1978, raised to £1.25 million the limit, which may not be exceeded without the approval of the Government, on the total amount of grants which the IDA may make to a particular undertaking towards the cost of fixed assets, purchased or leased, and towards the cost of factory rents.  Because of the increasing cost of fixed assets it has been necessary to submit an increasing number of projects to Government for approval, particularly in recent months.  This prolongs the period of negotiation with investors for projects which could not be considered as major or significant ones.  Accordingly, I propose to raise to £2.5 million the limit on the amount of grant moneys which the IDA may make without reference to the Government.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, there was no legislative limit prior to 1977 on the amount of training grants which the IDA could make.  The Industrial Development Act, 1977, provided for a limit of £850,000 on the amount of such grants which the Authority might make without prior Government approval to an individual <Col N="2682" /> undertaking.  This limit was subsequently raised to £1.25 million in the Industrial Development Act, 1978. Training grants are and will continue to be an important component in the Authority's overall range of incentives. The major element in training costs is wage related and, therefore, I consider that the statutory limit on training grants should be increased to take account of increases in industrial wages since the previous limit was fixed in 1978.  I am proposing, therefore, to increase to £2 million the limit on training grants which the Authority may make without prior Government approval.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development (No.2) Act, 1975, prescribed a limit of £500,000 on the amount of a loan guarantee of principal to a particular company without prior Government approval.  Similarly, the Industrial Development Act, 1977, set a limit of £500,000 on loan guarantees for Industrial restructuring.  I am now proposing to increase both these limits to £750,000 to take account of the change in money values since 1977.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the loan guarantees and interest subsidies for working capital under the IDA's Enterprise Development Programme.  This programme aids those persons wishing to establish an industrial undertaking who had not previously been the owner of such an undertaking. The limit on the guarantee facilities which the IDA could approve without prior Government approval was fixed at £150,000 under the provisions of the Industrial Development Act, 1977. Until then the volume of new projects promoted by first-time industrialists had been relatively few.  The major barrier to enterprise had been the inability of the potential entrepreneur to raise the necessary finance to carry through the start-up situation.</P>
    <P>During 1978-79 it was necessary for the IDA to guarantee approximately 50 per cent of bank borrowings with the banks taking the remaining risk on the basis of a charge on the assets.  Because of the credit squeeze in 1979-80 and the current recession, the IDA had to guarantee a greater proportion of bank borrowings &mdash; in some instances up to 70 per cent <Col N="2683" />&mdash; to enable promoters to successfully negotiate bank finance.  Accordingly, the present legislative limit of £150,000 is unrealistic in terms of present day money values and, accordingly, it is proposed in this Bill to increase it to £300,000.</P>
    <P>In this context I might mention here my continuing disappointment with the role of the banking system in industrial development, particularly its reluctance to finance new projects without cast iron guarantees.  I wish our bankers would follow the example of bankers in countries such as Japan and the US and play a more prominent part in financing industrial development.</P>
    <P>Investment in research and development to improve or develop products or processes is essential if Irish industry is to remain competitive.  Overdependence on one product or a limited range of products can make individual firms vulnerable to market or technological changes.  New production methods can reduce manufacturing cost significantly.  Because of the pace of technological change the IDA has found that the present limit of £50,000 on grants for an individual R and D project is inadequate and I therefore propose in this Bill to increase it to £250,000.  Grants in excess of this figure will continue to require Government approval and the statutory maximum of 50 per cent of the total approved costs will continue to apply.  I believe the new limit should greatly help to advance technological development in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The IDA have in the past taken equity shares in a number of industrial projects. Prior to the Industrial Development Act, 1977, there was no legislative limit on the amount of such equity interest.  The 1977 Act provided a limit of £1 million on the amount the IDA could commit without Government approval.  I am proposing in this Bill to increase the limit to £1.5 million to take account of the movement in money values since the limit was first established.</P>
    <P>I will now deal briefly with industrial development in general.  Irish industrial policy has remained largely unchanged since the early sixties.  During that time we have seen a dramatic switch in emphasis <Col N="2684" /> from agriculture to industry.  If we are to provide employment for our growing population we must continue to ensure growth in the industrial sector.  Despite the fact that the IDA had their most successful year in 1980 with 35,600 job approvals, we are still faced with a daunting employment challenge.  Because of the amount of State money involved, the time has now come for us to ask ourselves if we are getting the best possible return on our investments in industrial development and whether policies that have served us well in the past are the most appropriate for the 1980s and beyond. For this reason the Government asked the National Economic and Social Council to carry out a review of our industrial policies.  This review is nearing completion and I look forward to the conclusions of the council.</P>
    <P>Of the record number of job approvals in 1980 about one-third of these came from the small industry sector, which continues to be actively promoted throughout the country.  Small industry projects are quick to realise their employment potential and virtually all are Irish-owned and controlled.  Investment in manufacturing industry in 1980 exceeded £600 million and this contributed significantly to the construction and related industries which were otherwise facing reduced demand.</P>
    <P>I have impressed on the IDA actively to encourage the involvement of private sector investors in supporting the capital needs of new domestic ventures.  I am pleased to see the new developments in the Irish Stock Exchange which make for easier access to public capital markets.  I would hope that, to an increasing degree, this will be used for raising capital by manufacturing companies.  I endorse the recent remarks of my colleague, the Tánaiste, in regard to the kind of activities for which money has been raised in recent months on the Irish Stock Exchange which, for the most part, are highly speculative. One would like to see that kind of money and that sort of interest directed towards manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>Private developer finance is also being successfully organised to provide industrial <Col N="2685" /> buildings not alone in the major centres but also in provincial towns. These developments can do much to supplement the already extensive IDA building programme and contribute to accelerated job creation.  I look forward to an extension to these private sector activities.</P>
    <P>The IDA have adopted an increased target of 36,000 job approvals for the present year.  This target is being attempted against the background of little, if any, increase in output or investment in the developed countries, although some improvement is expected in the latter half of 1981.  This Bill will provide resources to back the exceptional effort required to achieve this target.</P>
    <P>Depressed business conditions in overseas markets, which were the worst since 1975, resulted in a high number of job losses in 1980.  The manufacturing sector of our economy has, however, done well by international standards and increased its share of our total exports.  The rescue programme of the IDA has, to its credit, prevented the closure of a number of firms which would otherwise have fallen victim to the savage world trade environment.</P>
    <P>Of course viability can only be assured by having the production processes and the product right.  This requires what is termed the &ldquo;total business concept&rdquo; and involves encouraging firms to engage in or expand their research and development and marketing effort from their Irish base.  This programme will utilise the Authority's incentives and will involve the facilities available from some other State bodies, educational and scientific institutions and the private sector. I anticipate worthwhile results as this concept is put into practice.</P>
    <P>An immense job creation effort is required to provide a sufficient number of jobs for an expanding population.  The IDA's Industrial Plan for the period 1978-82 sets a target for the creation of 75,000 new first-time jobs in grant-aided manufacturing industry.  The achievement of this target involves the approval of industrial projects with a job potential of 145,000 or an average of about 30,000 <Col N="2686" /> for each of the five years.  In the first three years of the plan the annual targets have been surpassed, with total approvals of more than 100,000 jobs.  Some of these jobs have already come on stream and many of the remainder will be coming on stream over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Some of the more important features of the job creation effort in recent years have been the dramatic rise in the number of native people establishing manufacturing industries for the first time, and the growth in Ireland's importance in the electronics and pharmaceutical/ health-care sectors.  The IDA are seeking to fulfil more than half of their job targets from domestic industry sources including small industries.  Many of these small industries have been established as a direct spin-off resulting from the establishment of large-sized overseas projects here.  The opportunities in this field are manifold for efficient and go-ahead Irish firms.</P>
    <P>I would now like to speak about the second of the Industrial Development Bills.  Our greatest natural resource is our young population.  One of the Government's primary objectives has been and continues to be the provision of stimulating and worthwhile employment for these intelligent and well-educated people. The visionary approach to the task of establishing a healthy industrial base in Ireland which was adopted in the 1950s continues to be relevant today.  However, such an approach is not simply a question of grant today and job tomorrow, but rather one of utilising our natural advantages and gearing our incentives to the direction in which future industrial and commercial development will go. Through our efforts down the years we have eliminated what was the greatest scourge and indeed very often the only prospect for young people of previous generations &mdash; the emigrant ship.</P>
    <P>However, we must continually look to the future.  The increasing sophistication of international trade and the rapid advancement of technological innovation have created a considerable demand for technical services worldwide.  In 1973, the IDA introduced a pilot programme for the promotion of service industries.  This <Col N="2687" /> programme has been moderately successful. Between 1975 and 1980, 6,300 service industry jobs have been approved for grant assistance by the IDA of which 2,000 have been created by mid-1980. But this sector has a much greater potential for generating high quality employment and substantial foreign earnings than has been our experience until now.</P>
    <P>Critical to the development of technical services is good infrastructure, particularly in communications.  We are, with great speed, putting this infrastructure in place.  Equally, if not more important, of course, is the availability of people with the highest skills.  Thanks to our second and third level educational institutions, we now have the best equipped young people in our history.  The technical services sector depends, after all, on the intellectual skills of its people rather than the productive capacity of its machines. Located in Ireland are some of the world leaders in computer manufacture but we must now build up an equally strong software capability.  Lest it might appear that the promotion of the services sector is the &ldquo;icing&rdquo; on the manufacturing cake, I should stress that unless we also develop a strong capability in technical services we will have failed to grasp many of the spin-off benefits arising from the advancement and diversification of our industrial base.  In the computer area, for example, the provision of data processing and software services has now become much more expensive and, in fact, more important than the manufacture of computer hardware.</P>
    <P>In order that we may share in the rapid growth of technical services, the Government have decided to give the IDA power to grant-aid service undertakings which contribute to regional and national development. Under existing legislation, the Authority can provide grant assistance towards fixed asset costs of manufacturing industry but, because of the relatively low fixed asset base normally associated with service industries, capital grant assistance is not the most appropriate or effective incentive.</P>
    <P>Export sales relief, which the House will be aware has ceased to be offered <Col N="2688" /> from 1 January 1981, was also a powerful weapon in the promotion of design and planning services, which is one of the major sources of new grant-aided service industry jobs.  It was, therefore, necessary to devise a completely new package of grant aid tailored specifically to meet the needs of the services sector.  The new scheme, which is the basis of this Bill, will provide for the payment of employment grants to service undertakings which comply with certain criteria.  The main difference between an employment grant and the normal IDA capital grant will be that an employment grant is related solely to the creation of employment and not to the acquisition of physical fixed assets.  This new incentive will assist promoters of service projects to meet part of the substantial pay-related costs in the initial but critical phase of the project.</P>
    <P>As will be seen from section 2 of the Bill, the amount of an employment grant will be subject to a limit which I will fix from time to time with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  For the initial year of the scheme this limit has been fixed at an average of £5,000 per job created.  Half of the employment grant approved will be paid to the service undertaking once the jobs have been created, with the balance of the grant being payable one year later on certification that the jobs continue to exist.  As training is a vital aspect in the development of service companies, training grants will continue to be used by the IDA as a major part of the incentive package for this sector.  The use of training grants has the advantage that 55 per cent of these grants are normally recoverable from the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>Before employing grants can be paid by the Industrial Development Authority it will be necessary for me to specify, by order, the service industries to which such grants may be paid.  Furthermore, the service undertakings to be grant aided will have to contribute significantly, in the opinion of the IDA, to regional and national development.  Eligible projects will have to be commercially viable, will have to have sound market growth potential and would have not been developed <Col N="2689" /> in the absence of an employment grant. As it is the aim of the new scheme to create high quality employment, the service industries which will be specified by order will have a high technical or professional content.  Between them, the engineering architecture and computer service industries have accounted for 85 per cent of all the jobs already approved under the IDA's existing service programme. These sectors will continue to be promoted with vigour.</P>
    <P>Other target sectors which will be specified by order include headquarters operations, commercial testing laboratories, medical care and contract research and development services.</P>
    <P>This will not, of course, preclude worthwhile projects in other areas being assisted should it appear worthwhile to extend, by order, the list of specified service industries.  When this new incentive scheme gathers momentum, the IDA expect annual service industry job approvals to rise to 5,000 by 1985.  This would represent a three-fold increase on the present achievement.</P>
    <P>EEC Commission approval for this scheme is required before it can become operative and such approval has been sought.  When we get the &ldquo;green light&rdquo; from the Commission, I will make the necessary orders.</P>
    <P>Through the promotional efforts of the IDA and Shannon Development, Ireland is now a major centre for electronic companies. These companies are mainly the result of the enormous strides that have taken place in the last decade in the development of micro-technology.  The potential of these technologies is only now being realised.  What is certain is that they will be a central force in generating a worldwide demand for technical services and informatics.</P>
    <P>This new Bill will enable the IDA to take the fullest advantage of the opportunities in this and other rapidly growing service industries.  What is required in this sector is brain power and skills.  Our people have these in abundance, but we must now ensure that the outlets for their use are made a reality.  This Bill is an <Col N="2690" /> important step in this direction and I believe that it marks an exciting beginning to a new chapter in our industrial development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome both Bills.  In dealing with the Industrial Development Bill, 1981, the Minister gave details of increases in the maximum expenditure under different headings allowed by the IDA without Government approval. They are all very important.  There is nobody in this House who would not welcome assistance for the efforts of the IDA.  The value of money is changing in the wrong direction, unfortunately, so quickly that it is imperative that we update these limits from time to time to take account of exchange rates and values of money.  This Bill provides that facility.</P>
      <P>At this time it is of the utmost importance that we should try to increase the capacity of the IDA to provide and create new jobs.  The Minister said, and rightly so, that the 1980 target set by the IDA was reached.  The creation of something in the region of 36,000 jobs was achieved. However, one must be mindful of the fact that the net result by the end of the year was barely a plus inasmuch as as many jobs were lost as were created.  This is the unfortunate record of the Government. While the IDA are making every effort to make progress, even their efforts cannot stem the job losses which are taking place.  We admit that without them we would be in a much worse position. Their efforts are appreciated.  The new limits of expenditure under the different headings are welcomed on this side of the House.  They are necessary if the IDA are to continue to achieve the job creation targets they set themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister expressed his disappointment with the banks who, he said, could take a lead from banks in places like Japan and the US.  That is so.  Our banks are very slow to provide the venture capital necessary without cast iron guarantees in situations in which these guarantees cannot be given and at a time when the prospective borrower cannot possibly provide the kind of guarantees sought by the banks.  If the banks are to reap the benefit of an expanding economy, they <Col N="2691" /> must be seen to play their part in providing the necessary venture capital to further the efforts of new industries and encourage individuals with entrepreneurial skills.  The banks should look with favour on proposals of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the new developments in the Irish Stock Exchange which make for easier access to public capital markets. He then endorsed what the Tanaiste said about this development and pointed out that much of the speculative money on the stock market could be directed towards the development of industry.  I am not surprised the Minister made that statement.  Much of the speculation on the stock market in relation to oil is due to the expectations raised by the Taoiseach in the minds of the public about the possibility of commercial oil finds.  With that kind of statement coming from such a high source as the Taoiseach, there are bound to be speculative money dealings on the stock market.  The Tánaiste and the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism were correct in what they said, but they must be reminded that their Taoiseach is causing much of the speculation on the stock market in relation to oil and oil finds.  The Minister made the point also that one-third of the record number of jobs created or approved in 1980 were in the small industry sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, concerned about many inequities in the present situation offending against the best interests of both tenants and landlords, demands the setting up of independent tribunals to consider questions relating to rent and conditions, to which both landlord and tenant may have recourse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2692" /> In my remarks I intend to show, firstly, that the whole area of landlord and tenant legislation is in need of urgent attention, secondly, the unparallelled shallowness and inertia of the Government's attitude so far to this housing echelon and, thirdly, precisely what this party intend doing about it, given the opportunity. There is no doubt at all about the fact that this area of the housing accommodation sector may genuinely be called the Cinderella of housing policy.  There are almost 400,000 people living in private rented accommodation in this country whose needs have not been dealt with by this Government.  On the contrary, it has been policy to invest resources, scarce resources at that, in every other element of the housing spectrum except this one.</P>
    <P>We would say it is time that the private rented sector, the problems of tenants and indeed of landlords were recognised as being genuine and in need of attention and support.  Accordingly I intend to put forward a six point programme which I believe would deal with that.  Underlining our concern in this area is the fact that Fianna Fáil, this time four years ago, gave very specific commitments to the people concerned in this area, the tenants.  Those commitments were explicit and comprehensive. Not one of them has been implemented. I challenge the Minister for the Environment, who is here this evening, to spell out why the promises given at that time have been ignored and have not been implemented despite repeated attempts by the Opposition parties to bring to the attention of this House and the country not just the prevarication but the complete disinterest by the Government in this area.</P>
    <P>On 7 June 1977 the then secretary of the National Flatdwellers' Association, a body which has done exemplary work in representing the interest of tenants, received from the then National Director of Elections, Senator Eoin Ryan &mdash; and one could say in parentheses that it is perhaps ironic that the Minister here this evening apparently will be National Director of Elections in the coming election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble with the Minister's party at present is that they cannot make up their minds about anything. Therefore, I am not surprised if they change it from day to day.  We will fight that one in due course.  But I would like the Minister to answer the question we pose here this evening, if he can.</P>
      <P>That letter was quite explicit &mdash; I trust I am getting this right and the Minister is welcome to a copy in case he has mislaid it &mdash; written on Fianna Fáil, The Republican Party, notepaper, addressed to A. Cassidy, Esquire, Secretary, National Flat Dwellers' Association, 9 Anglesea Street, Dublin 2.  It reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Dear Mr. Cassidy,</P>
      <P>I acknowledge receipt of your letter of 31st May.</P>
      <P>Our Party stand on Landlord and Tenant law relating to flat dwellings has been very fully set out by our Deputy Leader, Mr. Joseph Brennan, in an address to the Solicitors Apprentice Debating Society and reported on the front page of <i>The Irish Times.</i></P>
      <P>It is our view that legislation should be enacted to provide protection for tenants of flats or houses, but at the same time to ensure that landlords do get a fair return on their investment, and that they have protection against bad tenants.</P>
      <P>We fully appreciate that the private sector provides a large part of the rented accommodation in the city of Dublin.  We would not favour a situation where these people were restricted to such an extent that they were discouraged from investing in this type of project.  We would like to see a fair balance, and would like to see the private sector being encouraged to provide good accommodation, with certain minimum standards, and at a rent that is fair to the tenant and fair to the landlord.</P>
      <P>We would be in favour of setting up tribunals, to which the Landlord and the Tenant could have recourse for the purpose of fixing fair rents, and deciding disputes between the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2694" /> We would stress, however, that the rents should be fair, and we would not like to see a return to the old situation, where rents were restricted on such an extent, that landlords simply allowed their property to deteriorate to such an extent that in cases the properties became totally uninhabitable.</P>
    <P>It is in the interest of those seeking accommodation that the people providing that accommodation are encouraged to provide it to a high standard.</P>
    <P>Regarding the illegal eviction and harrassment of tenants, we are totally opposed to this but are aware, however, that it does happen.  However, the Courts at the moment have power to re-instate tenants, and in fact have done so, and if a tenant is interfered with physically by a landlord, a criminal offence is committed.  We feel that in this respect a better knowledge of his rights on behalf of the tenant is the answer, and not the creation of any further criminal offence.</P>
    <P>We are also totally opposed to discrimination against tenants on the grounds of marital status, colour, religion or sex.</P>
    <P>We are accordingly basically in favour of your suggestion for the charter of rights and we are prepared to introduce appropriate legislation in this field.</P>
    <P>We trust that this answers your letter satisfactorily and I would be glad to answer any queries which you have regarding our Party's attitude to this problem.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan,</P>
    <P>National Director of Elections.</P>
    <P>Apart from the general tone of being against sin contained in the letter, there are three specific undertakings given.  I want to know this evening why, in four years, we have seen neither sight nor sound of even the first steps in doing anything about the specific and unequivical commitments entered into, I am now going to suggest, for nothing else but the most shallow of political expediency, as no doubt we will see repeated over the <Col N="2695" /> next few weeks.  Indeed, we have had already evidence of that, when measures are proposed to be introduced without even an indication of what they cost.</P>
    <P>Where is the undertaking that legislation should be enacted to provide protection for tenants of flats or houses?  Where is that?  Where are the tribunals they were in favour of setting up?  Where is the undertaking that they were prepared to introduce appropriate legislation in this field, that is in relation to the charter of rights for tenants?  Where are they?  They are not with us this evening.  Instead, what do we get?  We get the most mealy-mouthed evasive and downright dishonest amendment I suppose I have seen in the last four years in this House, when an attempt to introduce some progress in this area is met by a Government amendment which says:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and to substitute:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;takes note that important aspects of the relationship between landlords and tenants of private rented accommodation are at present before the Supreme Court and is satisfied that the Government will take whatever action it deems necessary in the light of the terms of the Court's judgment&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are two points I want to make about that amendment.  First of all, it is indicative of the attitude of this Government to give an undertaking that they will take whatever action they deem necessary in the light of the Supreme Court's judgment without having the slightest idea of what its implications might be &mdash; another attempt to sell people a pig in a poke.  More importantly, it evades every one of the issues in our motion.  The House will note in the motion that we do not refer to the issue at present being dealt with by the Supreme Court because, we suggest, it would be wrong to do so &mdash; that is, of course, the question of the constitutionality of the Rent Restrictions Act.  We specifically exclude that.  What we are talking about in the motion is the setting up of independent tribunals to consider questions in relation <Col N="2696" /> to rent and conditions to which both landlords and tenants would have recourse, and which was promised four years ago but about which nothing was done.  You tried to fool this side of the House and the country into thinking, by some vague generalisation in the direction of the Supreme Court, that you could duck responsibility.  This will not happen.  You gave promises and have not delivered on them.  Why have you failed to set up the tribunals which prior to the last election you said you would set up?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Why have the Minister or the Government not set up the tribunal which they undertook to set up?  The Minister and everybody else knows that this area requires immediate attention. Surveys carried out by the National Flat Dwellers Association indicate, and any Deputy who has the pleasure of working in city constituencies realises that the problems of people in private rented accommodation are very serious and that the present situation is unjust for both the tenant and the landlord.  This area has been neglected for years and the reality is that many people living in private rented accommodation are living in conditions unfit for human habitation.  The premises are in some cases owned by landlords who have not the resources and have not been encouraged to put in the resources to improve the premises.  In other cases because the return on the houses is woefully inadequate there is no input and in some cases it is because the people involved are landlords by mischance. I know of cases where people are living in conditions which are not just unfit for human habitation but into which the average farmer would not put his stock because he would worry about the effects of weather and exposure to the elements.  We are putting up with a situation in which people are living in these conditions.  It is no consolation to such people to have a very small rent or to be told as they were told on a previous occasion by Deputy Barrett that they have recourse to the courts.  Anyone with any knowledge in this area knows that to refer <Col N="2697" /> the average tenant, perhaps a young married mother with two or three children, to the support of the courts which are in session now and again and who may not be in session when her need is greatest is nonsense and is completely unrealistic and naive.</P>
      <P>We need a number of measures urgently.  I am conscious of the fact that in the early seventies the Department of the Environment had in their posession a comprehensive report in which they at least began to come to an understanding of the problems implicit in this area.  The real vacuum exists in the four years since 1977 when people, presumably having investigated this situation before they made commitments, made specific promises to do something about the problem and since then have done nothing except evade their responsibility.</P>
      <P>I ask for a completely new deal for tenants and landlords which will recognise any area which houses between 300,000 and 400,000 people as being a legitimate and central part of the housing spectrum, which endeavours to do justice to both landlord and tenant and which sees that investment in that area, be it of direct advantage either to the landlord or tenant or to both, is good investment. The alternative is for people either to be in the private housing sector where they find that every move by the Government does nothing more than add to the price of the new houses or else to add further to the local authority housing lists where the going rate in Dublin city, for example, to build one of these houses is £35,000 or £40,000, due again to the inaction and oblivious attitude of the Government to the problem of the cost of housing.  I am for investing in the private rented sector for people who believe that their housing need is best met in that respect by recourse to private rented accommodation. The options should be encouraged. If people wish to buy their own homes they should be encouraged, if they believe that a period on the local authority housing list is appropriate they should be able to avail of it and so on.  I cannot understand the blind spot we have in relation to tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should draw up a comprehensive <Col N="2698" /> programme of landlord and tenant legislation which would give tenants and their landlords a new deal, which would embody a number of central elements one of which would be to allow those tenants to have offset against their income tax some portion of their rent if not all of it.  Such a step does no more than introduce the same standards of equity as presently obtain in other areas of the housing sector, notably the interest concessions in relation to mortgage repayments in the area of private house building or the sensitive and good principle of the differential rent system which takes a person's ability to pay into account.  The concessions and the sensitivity in both those areas are not at present matched in the private rented sector and I do not see why they are not.  There should be a substantial grants package of not less than £35 million available to owners of private rented accommodation conditional on their maintaining their property in accordance with proper standards and existing by-laws and depending on that property being registered.</P>
    <P>At the moment certain properties are supposed to be registered but understandably there is a massive evasion of registration.  It was completely predictable, so much so that in Dublin city where the main problem exists the question of evasion is considered by the local authority only as a matter of statistical interest. The sooner we get around to a situation where the by-laws cán be implemented the better.  If they were implemented either landlords would have to close down tomorrow because of deficiencies in respect of their implementation or else there would be such a massive need for investment of resources that it just would not happen.  Obviously there would be a mass exodus from the private rented sector and the local authority housing lists would become even longer than they are. In the context of making available to this sector substantial grants packages we should take full cognisance of the fact that the alternative costs which would be necessary to accommodate the number of people at present in private rented <Col N="2699" /> accommodation by the local authority would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>It would seem on paper at least that we are at one with the Government in this except that they have been in a position during the last four years to do something about this and have not.  An independent tribunal or tribunals should be set up, and will be if there is a change of Government, to oversee fair standards of rent, conditions and interpretation of general standards in this area.  Both tenant and landlord should have recourse to these tribunals and they should not merely be about rent.</P>
    <P>The registration of all private rented accommodation should be obligatory and should be enforced.  The excuse at present is that any such crackdown, as it were, would simply precipitate large numbers of people out of that sector because the standards which are expected and are implicit in registration are not obtaining in general.  There are, as there always are in these situations, very many superlative landlords who give a very fair deal for reasonable rents.  I like to think, because of a positive view of human nature, that they are in the majority but I do not know whether they are or not because nobody is counting.  Certainly registration of such rented accommodation would be feasible under the propositions which I am outlining and would be capable of being implemented by the local authorities without fear or favour, because they would know that there would be no fall-back on their own housing lists in the event of someone unable to match up with the standards and evading registration being brought to heel.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, this comprehensive Landlord and Tenant Bill should outlaw discrimination on the grounds of colour, class, creed or other basis.  Another discrimination which the Bill should consider as a matter of urgency in that context is what I think is reasonably called the unChristian attitude which I believe exists in many cases to people with young families.  It is almost impossible for a husband, wife and young baby to get private accommodation, presumably because children are expected to create <Col N="2700" /> problems in terms of noise or detrimental effect to the walls of the flat, or whatever, which the absentee tenant, out all day at work and out all evening at play &mdash; does not create.  I recognise the difficulty and it must be recognised.  It should not, however, be met by slamming the door on the faces of these people but by meeting the problem as it exists and giving to the landlord a fair return and, if necessary, the right to compensation in some circumstances where there is such impact for the worse on their property.</P>
    <P>The corollary of this, of course, is that the local authorities are totally submerged in worrying about and contending with the burden of social housing, as it is called, and many of the problems associated with that.  It is not just a question of landlord and tenant legislation: it is good for our society to have the mix. It is good for our economy and the economy of the housing sector to encourage this diversity, rather than perhaps appear to be fostering the mentality of the ghetto by dividing local authority estates from privately rented accommodation.  In fairness, much progress has been made in that respect and I am of the view that local authority housing at present is, in terms of construction and design, superior in most cases to the private dwellings built by the private builders, simply because there are more tiers of surveying and examination analyses to be gone through and because of cost, although that is not necessarily an indication of quality.  In Dublin city, for example, there is reason to believe that the numbers of people competing for such tenders is unusually limited.  Perhaps it is worth looking into.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into it in detail because it would be improper to do so, but I have no doubt that the Rent Restriction Act should, and I expect will, go.  It was seen for a long time that the prevailing attitude in this area was somehow a protection for tenants.  There are tenants who are scared to death of what would happen if and when that occurred.  The idea was that tenants would have the defence of some mechanical formula for ensuring that the maximum rent which they would pay would be supervised, as <Col N="2701" /> it were, by law.  What has, in effect, happened is that such accommodation has been allowed to deteriorate in many cases.  There are houses in our city where the rent would be in the order of £ a week and in some cases less.  Every member of this House has had people in to see him or her about those conditions.  Our response would be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but I am afraid the Deputy is getting into the area of the Supreme Court appeal.  I would ask the Deputy to keep away from that subject.  That is the understanding that we have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to refer to the difficulty being experienced by many tenants who are presently apparently entitled, as their only defence, to seek the protection of the law in cases where the property is not maintained.  It is completely unrealistic to expect perhaps an elderly person living alone, with a very small income, pitted against perhaps a fairly substantial property owner, or a company which is waiting for vacant possession of the property, to be able to take effective action against such people.  It does not work.  Accordingly, we have people living in conditions which few of us would tolerate for very long if they were our own.  The traditional perception of this Act as the mechanism of protecting tenants has not operated.  At the same time, it is important that, whatever new situation might come about, the reasonable fears of tenants presently in accommodation, perhaps in controlled rental situations, be allayed by the Government at this stage &mdash; and I trust they have been doing something about it, although I am not particularly heartened by their ignoring of the other problem &mdash; and that the Government would be able to act immediately if that arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum total of those six central steps alone &mdash; although other reforms are also necessary &mdash; would bring about a major wind of change in the area of landlord and tenant legislation.  I give an undertaking that our party in Government will introduce this kind of change, based on the principles to which I have referred.  I <Col N="2702" /> would not feel so annoyed about all this if, firstly, I did not have the experience every week of meeting people presently living in intolerable and unbearable conditions about which we all know and, secondly, if this Government had not so cynically and so sickeningly given those undertakings.  In those circumstances, they could perhaps plead for time to investigate, or perhaps argue that they had not made the commitments and that they were not bound.  They are bound and there is no need for further study.</P>
    <P>The performance of the former Coalition Government in this respect, with their attention to an honest and complete analysis and investigation of the privately owned rented dwelling accommodation sector was thorough and laid the ground for action by the Minister, but nothing happened.  It is very likely that, despite evidence to the contrary during the mid-seventies the popularity of the private rented sector will remain as a fairly essential ingredient in housing policy.  It has, particularly among young people, a high degree of popularity.  It is therefore reasonable that we should not pretend that somehow the problem will go away.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the scale we have many families living, born and reared in and likely to live on, in such privately owned accommodation.  One of the most worrying aspects of all this is that this part of our housing stock has been deteriorating. Unfortunately, the enlightened grants policy which obtained and which at least allowed people, for example, who might be willing to extend or modernise or improve their dwellings to do so, modest as it was, was done away with and although we got a vague promise in the context of the sweltering euphoria of the recent Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis that there would be a package of reform embodying some new deal in some circumstances &mdash; presumably indicating a reversal of previous policy when these grants were done away with &mdash; the reality is that nobody knows, except perhaps the Minister, what precisely is going to be introduced, if anything at all.  It is only as late as yesterday that the local authorities got their first glance of a scheme which they are going to be asked to introduce.  Not <Col N="2703" /> one Member of this House has failed to receive numerous phone calls in recent weeks asking what the Government are going to do about this famous grant&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that not show the interest of the people and how attractive the scheme is, that the Deputy is getting so many inquiries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Government rush into a pre-election package of promises and have the neck, on the same day or within 24 hours, to say, &ldquo;We do not know what it will cost because we do not know what the demand will be.&rdquo; affects their credibility.  Clearly they have not done their homework because, even on inquiry from managers, they are not able to give local authorities the most meagre information.  Neither are they able to answer questions in this House as to when the legislation will be introduced. That is another sad and sickening indication that the cynicism embodied in their letter to the National Flatdwellers Association of 7 June 1977 is to be repeated all over again.  Apparently this Government believe that one can buy one's way all the time.  If that is their belief as to how this country operates, I am confident that the people will tell them very soon that they are not as shallow or as gullible as the Government think they are.  The voters will not be fooled a second time.</P>
      <P>If the Minister were to take a walk through flatside &mdash; Rathmines, Rathgar and so on &mdash; and to ask any of those who, prior to the last general election, received from Fianna Fáil a very explicit and colourful pre-election leaflet setting out what that party would do for the private rental sector, he would be made aware of how those people regard the promises made then.  The letter written by the Government is a damning indictment of the cynical, unprincipled and cheap approach of this Government towards buying and bartering their way as they have been doing in the past four years throughout the whole economic and social spectrum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All thinking people will reject in the <Col N="2704" /> coming weeks the approach of the Government. Even in the area of uncontrolled, furnished as well as unfurnished dwellings there are once again specific problems, all of which are known to those who have the responsibility for doing something about them.  There is no reason for further delay and inaction in this respect.</P>
    <P>Two small surveys were carried out in 1975 by the then Department of Local Government for the purpose of eliciting information about the rents paid for furnished accommodation.  The findings were interesting because they showed a very erratic situation.  For instance, in some cases rents were disgracefully exorbitant. People might pay, based on updated figures, £20 for a small room, or even more, while at the other end of the scale somebody might be paying one guinea a week for a whole house.  In such cases houses might be expected to be falling down around the occupants because nobody could be expected to roof a house, for example, while in receipt of such a rent.  To do such a job would probably cost the equivalent of 400 weeks rent.</P>
    <P>There is a need also to consider the degree to which such rents should represent a certain proportion of a person's income.  This is a matter to which the tribunal that will be set up if there is a change of Government will have regard. It is reasonable to suggest that people should not be expected to pay more than a certain percentage of total income by way of rent, whether by way of mortgage repayments or in terms of any housing cost.  If people are being put to the pin of their collar, particularly in the private rented sector, to pay for accommodation we are going into the situation in which there is exploitation of young people particularly and of young, newly married couples but, what is worse, we are depriving those of the chance to raise the increasingly substantial deposit necessary to provide themselves with homes of their own, if that be their wish.  The concept of paying a percentage of one's earnings in outgoings on housing costs has been for months the policy of our party and it is a concept which will be favoured sympathetically <Col N="2705" /> in the context of rent overhaul in this area.  It is something that will be welcomed by those who will recognise an honest attempt to deal justly with the real problems they are experiencing as opposed to the gimmickry to which they were subjected four years ago.</P>
    <P>Another problem which is serious is that of student accommodation which, though seasonal in nature to some extent, is a cause for concern.  An imaginative and, in the literal sense, resourceful approach by the Government in this area would be to facilitate the local authorities in providing student accommodation in blocks of flats, in some cases in flats that are obviously unsuitable for the families who are expected to live in them, sometimes as high up as the eighth floor.  If students were accommodated in such places in return for economic rents, local authorities would be facilitated to some degree in involvement in areas outside merely the area of social housing.  In that way they could begin a process of a total housing policy.  This would involve their being facilitated in using resources in a way which up to now has never been their right, funded as they are from year to year without any real idea of what is coming next year except, perhaps, the firm belief that what they get will mean less in real terms than it meant in the previous year, if the experience of the last three years is anything to go by.</P>
    <P>The deterioration in the housing stock, particularly in the Dublin area, is to be deplored.  I appeal to the Minister to restore and to improve on the facilities which owners of accommodation have in terms of improving that housing.  I ask the Minister to consider urgently this matter and to apply the resources in that area.  Investment in people's homes, whether in the private rented sector or otherwise, is investment in the future of all our people and will help especially children who are obliged to live sometimes in conditions which their parents are not able to do much about because of the aids not being available to them either to accumulate the necessary resources to improve their lot or to acquire their own property.  The problem is serious and it will not go away.  Even the most conservative <Col N="2706" /> estimates regarding the projected need for private rented accommodation, such as those outlined in the input papers for the draft development plans for the city of Dublin, show clearly an increasing gap between the supply and the demand for rented accommodation during the coming years unless steps are taken to increase the supply.</P>
    <P>There are many measures we could take to bring about improvements whether they be the anticipated provision of control of rents, measures to bring about a certain sense of justice and equity into the area as I have outlined, measures which would ensure that there would be an increase in the overall supply of rented accommodation by positive investment of resources into an area of the housing policy which up to now has been a Cinderella, with a view to ensuring that there is in the housing area a permutation of possible homes for people of varying needs.</P>
    <P>The evasion of responsibility in respect of private rented accommodation over the last four years has been as startling as has been the increasing evidence of the disgraceful conditions in which many people in that category have to live.  It is not too late for the Minister to redeem himself, and the Government, and stand over the undertakings given so easily in the fervour of an election campaign four years ago.  The Minister should do as he said he would do, enact legislation to provide for &ldquo;protection for tenants of flats or houses&rdquo;.  The Minister should provide legislation in favour of &ldquo;setting up tribunals&rdquo; and to give evidence of his undertaking in relation to his preparedness to &ldquo;introduce appropriate legislation in this field&rdquo;.  The answer in the last four years has been one of inertia and silence in this respect.  I can only conclude that the document I have referred to was one of the cheapest and most cynical attempts to buy the votes of a vulnerable section of our people that we have ever seen.  It is a shame on the Minister.</P>

    <P>Deputy Keating in his bleeding heart contribution referred to a letter sent by the then Director of Elections of the Fianna Fáil Party to the National Flatdwellers' Association.  I am aware of the letter to which he has referred.  That letter ranged over many aspects of the relationship between landlord and tenant <Col N="2708" /> and was not solely related to tribunals to fix rents and other disputes between landlords. In the intervening period major pieces of landlord and tenant legislation have been put through this House by the Minister for Justice.  The letter addresses itself to many of the factors &mdash; an adequate return to landlords, security of tenure by tenants and so on &mdash; which are at the core of the proceedings in the courts to which I have referred.

It was first introduced in 1915 as a temporary wartime measure designed to protect tenants in a time of acute housing shortage.  With certain modifications from time to time, rent control has continued ever since.  In the years between the two wars controls were ended on certain types of housing previously controlled.  In 1944, however, control was reimposed on these dwellings and extended to other unfurnished accommodation built before 1941.  The series of temporary Acts was ultimately consolidated in the Rents Restrictions Act, 1960, which, with a 1967 amending Act, forms the present statutory basis for rent control.</P>

      <P>The two Acts, as I have just mentioned, removed further categories of houses from control.  As a broad statement, a substantial proportion of unfurnished rented accommodation is subject to control.  Rents of &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; dwellings are set at the levels that prevailed in June 1966.  It should be remembered that in many cases the 1966 levels were themselves controlled rents.  Certain additions to the original rents have been allowed by the Rents Restriction Act, but these increases bear little relationship to increases in living costs.  Side by side with the control of the rents, the Acts give security of tenure to the tenant and his dependants.  A tenancy, of course, can be passed on from one generation of a family to the next indefinitely.</P>

    <P>From this short outline of how rent controls on living accommodation have operated in this country I, with certain trepidation, move to the constitutional challenge to the provisions of the Rents Restriction Acts.  In April 1980. in a judgment in the High Court, Mr. Justice McWilliam found Part II and Part IV of the 1960 Act repugnant to the Constitution. Part II deals with the control of rent of controlled dwellings and Part IV with the security of tenure tenants enjoy.  The grounds for the findings were that a group of citizens &mdash; the landlords of controlled dwellings &mdash; arbitrarily selected, had been deprived of property for the benefit of another group &mdash; the tenants of controlled dwellings &mdash; without compensation, with no limit on the period of deprivation and with no indication of any <Col N="2712" /> occasion which necessitates their selection for this purpose from amongst the general body of citizens.  The decision of the High Court has been appealed by the Attorney General to the Supreme Court whose judgment on the matter is awaited.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Environment I am very much alive to the importance of a private rented sector of residential accommodation.  It is an essential element in the overall housing stock.  It provides the only realistic method of housing certain categories of persons, both individuals and families.  These include single persons, students in higher level educational establishments, those whose employment in particular locations is short-term and all those for whom owner-occupation or local authority housing is for one reason or another unsuitable or unattainable.  I acknowledge that the question before the Supreme Court relates to part only of private rented sector accommodation. The findings of the High Court are fundamental to the type of action advocated in the motion before the House.  It would, accordingly, be quite injudicious for the Government to formulate a policy in regard to the regulation of the rents and tenure of rented accommodation without first having available the detailed findings of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I have outlined I think it prudent for the Government to await the judgment of the Supreme Court.  Indeed, it would be unethical on my part to speculate on what options may be open to the Government.</P>

      <P>I have no intention of getting into the full field.  However, it would be right to say that the judgement of the Supreme Court and the reasoning behind it, will be an essential prerequisite to consideration by the Government of any initiatives in this area.  I can assure the House that in line with their imaginative and progressive policy on housing the Government will not be found wanting if action by them is deemed necessary.</P>
      <P>In this context, Deputies will be aware of the Government's positive response to the need to increase the supply of rented accommodation, probably the one area in his contribution &mdash; I am going to be generous and call it a contribution &mdash; where I agreed with Deputy Keating.  The budget introduced a scheme of special incentives to the provision of private accommodation for renting.  The construction of moderate cost rented residential accommodation and certain conversions of existing properties into two or more units is being encouraged by making available a special tax allowance whereby 100 per cent of the expenditure incurred can be offset against rental income.  Statutory effect to this measure will be given by the Finance Bill at present before the House, a Finance Bill to which the Fine Gael Party did not see fit to put down one amendment and to which the Labour Party put down the same amendments as they had last year.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I am a little bit puzzled about certain aspects of this motion before the House.  First of all, the motion has been accepted for debate.  Until I came in here and until you mentioned it, Sir, I was not aware that certain restrictions had been laid down on the terms of the debate.  Apparently some arrangement has been made which allowed that certain restrictions should be imposed and that matters which are before the Supreme Court should not be mentioned. That was not conveyed to me by the Party Whip and I am rather surprised at the suggestion that this restriction has been imposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>General debate or not, the position is that an important debate has been tabled for this evening and I do not like restrictions on a debate.  While the Supreme Court decision &mdash; or what is likely to be the Supreme Court decision &mdash; has been mentioned again and again, the Minister did sail pretty close to the wind when he went on to describe what exactly was before the Supreme Court and what the effect would be.  That to my mind was dealing with the matter before the Supreme Court.  However, I do not want to follow that line.  I want to know from the Minister &mdash; and I am sure somebody else from Fianna Fáil will be coming in &mdash; before we conclude what happened to the suggestions made for a revision of the Landlord and Tenant Act as affecting these people, which was being discussed in the Department when I left it?  There is a long history attached to this.  Originally, for some reason which I could never find out, the Department of Justice were the Department dealing with this matter and the Department of Justice rightly did not give two damns about it. It had nothing to do with them, it was not their bailiwick and why should they bother?  As a result of an application made by me to the Cabinet it was referred to the Department of Local Government, now the Department of the Environment. A committee were set up and certain work was carried out.  If before the last general election we were as unprincipled as the present Government are, we would have blazoned abroad what was suggested and what we proposed to do.  But we believed that the first thing to do was to try to ensure that the people affected here were looked after, that it was in their interests that the whole investigation was being carried out and that it was in their interests that the legislation was being introduced.  What do we find? We find that Fianna Fáil, as they usually do, sneaked in the back door and approached the people they thought most affected.  There was no question of, as the Minister said a few minutes ago, worrying about whether it was the right thing to do before an election or of worrying about the morality of it.  It was a question of them saying, &ldquo;Here are a group of <Col N="2716" /> geese; let us pluck them now while we can&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That is exactly what Fianna Fáil did at the last election.  They went to people they knew were badly affected by legislation which had been on the Statute Book for some time.  Although there were two amendments, they did not get to the kernel of the trouble.  Lest there be any doubt, a gentleman who signed himself Senator Eoin Ryan, National Director of Elections for Fianna Fáil, the Republican Party, said that they were basically in favour of the suggestions for the charter of rights and were prepared to introduce appropriate legislation in this field.  Would the Minister point out to me where this appropriate legislation is?  I did not notice it going through the House and I am not aware that it is on the Statute Book.  I am very anxious to know where the legislation is now.</P>
      <P>The whole question of rented accommodation is a morass.  I suppose Fianna Fáil felt that they were not going to be responsible for walking into it lest they disappear in that morass.  Having given the promise and having got the votes they then sat back and said, &ldquo;well, let them; it will do until the next election&rdquo;.  I am not impressed by the Minister's suggestion that the reason he is not now able to do anything about it is because there is a Supreme Court judgement awaited. Indeed, there was not a Supreme Court judgment awaited in the last few years. Why did he not do it then?  Why did he not do something before this whole matter got into the situation in which it is now in the Supreme Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three or four different categories of people who are affected by this. First of all, there is the tenant who is living in accommodation and is paying not too much but very much too much. There are cases I know of where people are being asked to pay outrageous sums for accommodation which may be all right as accommodation goes and may be reasonably good accommodation but the price being charged is outrageous.  Then there are those who are living in appalling accommodation and, no matter what they are paying for it, they are paying too <Col N="2717" /> much.  In many of those cases these people are paying much more than they should and those mostly affected by it are the unfortunate people who are trying to rear a young family or who have got married and are about to start a family. The accommodation is given as if there was something special being done for them; often it is accommodation into which one would not put an animal, and very excessive sums are being charged for it.</P>
    <P>There are the young people coming up from the country who are going to work in the city.  This is a problem that relates to the whole country but the worst of it is in this city, in Cork and Galway and other cities, and in the towns.  People are coming to work and they desperately need accommodation and pay £8 or £10 a week for a single room with a gas cooker on the landing.  After a couple of weeks the landlord comes in and says that he undercharged the tenant and puts £5 on to the rent.  In another month after that he comes in and says the same thing and eventually the rent is £20.  Then the unfortunate sister or brother of the tenant, or a cousin or somebody they know, may be coming up from the country and they go into the same accommodation. The landlord says that he will oblige the tenant by allowing the extra person in and he doubles the rent.  He charges the same for the additional person.  In some cases I know of three people are in a room that could possibly accommodate one, and they are paying three times the amount of rent which was originally agreed upon.  This is the sort of thing which should have been dealt with and I would have dealt with it if I had been in the Department of Local Government for another six months.  But the present Minister and his predecessor just had not the time and could not care less.</P>
    <P>There is yet another section.  Early in the century there were people who owned a nice house in this city and elsewhere and who, because they had alternative accommodation, let their house for what could then be termed a reasonable rent, 15s, £1 or 25s. a week.  The people who were living in the house at the time were paying what they considered <Col N="2718" /> to be a reasonable rent.  But as the years went by the people who were living in the house possibly may have died, their descendants taken over, and the same thing may have happened in the case of the landlady or landlord.  Thirty or 40 years later the descendants of the landlord or the landlady may find themselves living in a hovel somewhere, maybe on an old age pension, and the original tenant's descendants living in the house are still paying 15s. or a £1 or 25s. a week although their family income would, by then, have risen to £200 or £300 a week. That aspect has to be dealt with just as the other aspects have to be dealt with. It could and would have been dealt with but for the fact that this sort of a confidence trick was played on the unfortunate tenants when they were persuaded that the people who would deal with the matter were Fianna Fáil when they got in.  But they did not deal with it.  They just sat back and I am sure they had a good belly laugh at the people who were foolish enough to accept their word.</P>
    <P>The ordinary tenants of local authority houses got the same treatment.  How many more people got the same treatment? They were promised by Fianna Fáil, &ldquo;We will look after you; anything they can do, we will do better&rdquo;.  When they took over they simply dumped the whole lot and let everyone stew in his own juice.</P>
    <P>This whole situation is outrageous.  A Minister who comes in here with the lame duck excuse which we have listened to from the Minister for the Environment, is in the same position as the Minister in relation to whom I said the other evening that the Taoiseach could do with somebody else to do the job.  I do not know what a Minister who just does not bother with important matters in his Department is doing there at all.  It is not a question of this Minister not having the ability.  I believe he has plenty of ability and if he had turned his mind to it he could possibly have succeeded in doing a good job in relation to this matter.  But the reason that he and his predecessor did not do anything is that they do not like to be unpopular and because people might be asking for money by way of <Col N="2719" /> compensation and the State might have to pay a subsidy to tenants who, if they had to pay a reasonable rent, might be unable to pay that rent to the private landlord; the State might have to pay the difference in cash out of some fund.  In order to avoid that they just forgot about it; they pushed it to one side and left it there.</P>
    <P>I am glad the motion is before the House tonight.  The Taoiseach may decide to have a general election in three weeks time or he may hang on for another 13 weeks as he can and, between you, me and the wall, he would be a wise man if he did.  But if he decides to let the country decide, this is one of the things that will be hanging around the neck of Fianna Fáil when they come to meet the electors.</P>
    <P>Without a doubt, something has to be done about rented accommodation. Somebody will have to have the courage to do it.  I believe there is nobody in Fianna Fáil at the moment with that courage. They must as a party and as a Government have decided they would not do anything about it, that they would leave things as they are.  The Minister spoke about the encouragement he is giving to people who will provide additional rented accommodation.  He spoke about the budget and what was included in the budget a few months ago.  He was talking about a speculators' charter.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about alternative accommodation for private renting and about modest rents.  When the Minister for Finance was asked about the rent he did not say it was a modest rent.  He said the Government would have no control over the rent which would be charged for this new type of accommodation.  He said, in fact, if the right people build it, if they have no conscience and they charge enough for it the Government will not interfere.  Fianna Fáil never interfered with the speculators.  They always did well out of them and they looked after them.  They are doing it again now. It is an insult to the intelligence not just of the people in this House but people looking for rented accommodation for the Minister for the Environment tonight, and for the Minister for Finance, <Col N="2720" /> to suggest that it is anything else but a speculators' charter.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Finance Bill and said that the Labour Party tabled the same amendments this year as they did last year.  I am sure the Minister is aware that there are certain financial matters which cannot be amended in the budget and it confines the Finance Bill very much.  The reason we put in the same amendments this year as last year is that things are as bad this year as they were last year.  The Finance Bill needed the same amendments, which were not accepted.  It reminds Fianna Fáil that those things have not been forgotten and that what they did last year and are doing again this year will be judged by the public.</P>
    <P>A suggestion was made about giving an allowance for income tax in relation to rent.  It might not be an easy thing to do but it is more logical than giving an allowance in income tax to people who are purchasing their houses and are paying the money back by way of annuity. There would have to be very tight regulations to ensure that a landlord &mdash; there are some very good landlords and there are some terrible landlords &mdash; who was unscrupulous enough to overcharge was restricted and would not attempt to get back off the tenant whatever the tenant got back by way of income tax remission. That will have to be looked at.  I want to assure the House and the public generally, who are affected by those things, that if we have a part in government after the next general election we will proceed with the matters which were started when I was Minister for Local Government and we will try to arrange that there will be the necessary legislation to cover the points I have made here tonight.</P>
    <P>There is no use in anybody talking about giving £4,000 to encourage people to build their own houses.  My sympathy is with the officials of the Department of the Environment who are dealing with housing matters.  I do not know what would happen if they were down the country and were recognised.  It is amazing the number of people who have said to me in regard to the Minister: &ldquo;What is <Col N="2721" /> he talking about £4,000 for?  We are waiting over 12 months for the £1,000 grant and we cannot get it&rdquo;.  People will not be codded any more.  They were codded in a big way before the last general election. People now look at matters in a very different way.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied there is no way in which Fianna Fáil can get out of the difficulty they are in tonight where a solemn promise made four years ago has been reneged on and the Minister who is responsible for seeing that it is carried out comes into the House and says that there will be a Supreme Court judgment and he would not like to do anything which would upset it or cause any trouble. He has had over three-and-a-half years before the matter of a judgement came up.  What did he do?  What did his predecessor do?  They did nothing.  There is no use saying that it is all right, we should give them time and they will be better the next time.  Everybody now realises that the racket which Fianna Fáil operated the last time is now coming back on their heads.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with this city in relation to rented accommodation because it affects other areas where the Minister for Finance suggested the building of flats like rabbit warrens.  Flats are being built, one on top of the other, with a common entrance at the bottom.  I do not know how people would get out of them if a fire occurred.  Those are to be found throughout the country and excessive rents are being charged for them.  If people want accommodation the State must take a hand in this.  If they do not want to do it themselves they should through some arrangement with the local authority or a private individual, arrange to have the necessary accommodation provided.</P>
    <P>During my time as Minister I was considering doing something about a place like Ballymun.  The top of some of the high rise accommodation in Ballymun may be no use at all as accommodation for unfortunate people with young children. There is no future in places like that for people who have to climb many flights of stairs when the lifts are out of order, or have to go up in lifts with young <Col N="2722" /> children.  If they let them out to play and they look out of their windows and see them on the ground with somebody bullying them there is nothing they can do. Shantalla in Galway is the same; no lifts are provided and unfortunate people have to drag prams, children and goods up and down four flights of stairs.</P>
    <P>It might not be a bad idea if those places were converted to accommodation for single people and if, with the income from that, decent housing was provided for those who need it.  I am quite sure that everybody in the House and most people outside it are aware that there is a desperate shortage of local authority accommodation.  There are more people living with in-laws now than there were after the last war.  This is only four years after we reached the stage where people on the Government benches now, said that we were building too many local authority houses, that 75 per cent of those looking for accommodation from local authorities consisted of two or less in a family.  Now we are in the position where over the last few years the number of people on the waiting list in Dublin Corporation has risen by 2,500 and people cannot get any type of accommodation.</P>
    <P>Let nobody tell me about the treatment which young married couples get when the first child is born.  I have had personal experience of this.  They live in flats and when the child is born and the wife is in hospital the landlady pushes a note to quit under the door or, worse still, she has a key, opens the door and goes in, as often happens when landladies go in to see if the tenants have something they did not know about.  It is shocking for a couple, when they are starting a family and arranging their future, to come across something they have not bargained for &mdash; no housing, no place to go. Bethlehem is re-enacted very often in this city and in other cities for many people who have their first child.</P>
    <P>I met numerous people who tramped around Dublin city looking for accommodation. If they are single and have money everything is all right, but if they are married they will have to give certain information before they are considered for that accommodation.  If they have <Col N="2723" /> one, two or three children there is no way they will be considered.  We are told this is a great Catholic country.  It is a pity we do not have more Christians in it.</P>
    <P>The kernel of this problem is that more people are looking for accommodation than there is accommodation available. I and most other Deputies would like to see anybody who wanted rented accommodation and was prepared to pay for it get such accommodation.  There are many cases of young people living in, say, a two-roomed wooden structure.  These people can be found in our villages and towns as well as in Dublin city.  These wooden structures have electricity and power supplied by an illegally connected meter from the landlord's house.  This structure is illegally built in the back garden and a man, wife and their children live in that accommodation.  I know of a family who had to move from the so-called bedroom into the so-called kitchen/sittingroom because there were three rats in the bedroom and they were afraid their baby of a few weeks old would be eaten or that they would be bitten.  This is the situation in 1981.  That man has been in that area for only a few years.  He is in the Army and because he is not a native of the area he finds it very difficult to get on the housing list.  This means he has to wait until something happens and he gets accommodation which will provide him with a room for himself and his wife and another for the children.</P>
    <P>This housing shortage is the result of the failure of this Government and previous Government to face up to a problem which was difficult to solve.  At least we attempted to do something.  We started the ball rolling.  We made the change from the Department of Justice &mdash; who could not be blamed for not caring; it was not in their bailiwick &mdash; to the Department of Local Government, now the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Local Government I would not have been happy to see such a problem left to one side for a further four years if I had been in office.  It had been my intention to deal with the matter within a period of 12 months.  It might <Col N="2724" /> not have been the ideal way to deal with this problem but suggestions could have been made in this House to improve the legislation.  This problem will never be solved if the Minister for the Environment sits back, shrugs his shoulders and says that because of something or other there is nothing he can do about it.  I want to assure him that if we have something to do with government we will do something about it.</P>

      <P>I said &ldquo;in so far as it relates to any Member of this House&rdquo;.  A letter from Senator Eoin Ryan, director of elections for Fianna Fáil, making a solemn commitment in this area has been read in this House.  Time has shown that that commitment is not worth the paper on which it was written and I do not think there are many people who would not make the same deduction about the standing of Fianna Fáil in this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully highlighted the situation very well from both the tenants' and landlords' points of view.  He pointed out the anomalies where tenants are being overcharged for their accommodation.  He highlighted cases where the heirs and successors of previous tenants are being undercharged and, perhaps, enjoying very good accommodation for very little money, while the heirs and successors of the original owners are often living in less comfortable accommodation.  These are two extremes but there are many other anomalies.  There is no reason why the independent tribunal referred to in the motion could not be set up speedily.  Four years ago Fianna Fáil gave a written commitment to set up such a tribunal.  It is still not too late to try to resolve the whole mess involving landlords and tenants.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Hi-Jacking of CIE Bus.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair <Col N="2726" /> for allowing me to raise a very serious matter.  As you will know, Sir, Drimnagh is in the constituency for which I have been elected and there last night a CIE bus was hijacked by a number of youths whose faces were covered.  It was taken some distance where more youths were waiting and set on fire.  Fortunately the bus was not totally destroyed and it was subsequently driven to the garage.</P>
      <P>Whoever is guilty of this foul deed has gone a step too far in intimidation.  Whatever we feel individually or collectively about the H-Block crisis in the North, whatever we feel should be done about it, I have no doubt there is near unanimity in society in the Republic that actions of this kind first of all should not be allowed to happen and should not be tolerated. In tonight's <i>Evening Herald</i> a report appears under the headline &ldquo;City Busmen to Seek Danger Money Increase&rdquo;. The report states that bus crews are now being subjected to all sorts of attacks, stonings and robberies.  It describes last night's incident as &ldquo;a new turn&rdquo;, in the words of an NBU spokesman.  This highlights the total failure of the present Government to maintain reasonable law and peace in this city and in the country.  We do not know whether this incident was encouraged by the National H-Block committee but we know that efforts were made last Thursday to prevent busmen reporting for work, an effort that failed conspicuously.  However, it did not fail in other areas where people were more timid.  People in my constituency had to close their businesses against their will and we read yesterday that a Fianna Fáil city councillor is understood to have been intimidated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whoever were the perpetrators of last night's incident if they are allowed to get away with it will cause widespread concern among bus crews, particularly if there is to be another day of mourning and continuing tension in relation to the H-Block situation.  This debate is taking place in a very regrettable situation. Since you allowed me to raise this matter other events have taken place which we cannot be pleased with, but whatever occurs tonight, tomorrow or in the future there is a grave responsibility on the Government <Col N="2727" /> to see to it that ordinary people can go about their ordinary business in a peaceful way.</P>
    <P>So far, the Government have failed in this respect.  It was extraordinary that the Leader of Fine Gael last week had to raise here the question of intimidation and that the Minister apparently was unaware of any intimidation at that time.  I want the Minister to tell the House now of the steps that have been taken to bring the perpetrators of last night's deed to justice, if there have been arrests, if not why not, and the steps that are being taken to prevent a repetition.</P>
    <P>This is very important because too frequently the bus service in this city is interrupted, whether by strikes official or unofficial, by buses breaking down, whether they are new or otherwise.  It is the ordinary people of the city who have to put up with the inconvenience and annoyance caused by the absence of a bus service.  I hope the busmen and buswomen of this city will not be put off by last night's incident, will not feel that their jobs are dangerous.  I hope they will continue to do their work come hell or high water and provide the service which the citizens of Dublin need.  I hope they will ignore the disgraceful intimidation by the few.  They are human beings and there is a danger that they will feel the need for protection.  If and when there is another day of mourning the danger is that attempts to stop the bus service will be more successful than they were last Thursday.</P>
    <P>I do not want to comment on the central issue to which, apparently, this incident is connected.  If people want to mourn or show their sympathy, so be it. They should not force other people, by <Col N="2728" /> intimidation or otherwise, into mourning or sympathising against their will.</P>
    <P>There is a body of opinion which says this is not the direct responsibility of anybody connected with the H-Block Committee.  I am prepared to accept that that may be so.  In tonight's <i>Evening Herald</i> there is a report which says the Garda do not believe the attack was linked to the H-Block campaign.  The newspaper cites the case in Waterford where an eight year old boy was injured at the weekend playing with a petrol bomb, having seen on television petrol bombs being thrown in Belfast.  Can anything highlight more the need for an equitable and just solution to that terrible problem?</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the seizure and burning of the CIE bus at Drimnagh last night is being investigated. In accordance with long established practice I do not propose &mdash; and it would not be practicable for me &mdash; to make a statement in relation to the investigation of a particular criminal offence.</P>
      <P>On the general question of alleged intimidation of CIE workers, I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have not received any complaints of such intimidation.  Any complaints of this nature that may be made to the Garda Síochána will be fully and properly investigated and appropriate action taken.</P>
      <P>It should hardly be necessary for me to repeat once again that the manner in which the Garda investigate crime and questions such as the taking of such precautionary measures as may be possible are matters entirely for the judgment of the relevant officers of the force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The production by computer of disability benefit payments has been in operation in my Department since late 1973 but I assume the Deputy is referring to the system of computerised records of pay-related social insurance contributions which are relied on for the purposes of deciding entitlement to disability benefit from January of this year.</P>
      <P>The method of collection of social insurance contributions was changed with effect from April 1979 from the stamped card system to the pay-related system of collection operated by the Revenue Commisioners in conjunction with the collection of PAYE income tax.  Up to December 1980 entitlement to disability benefit was decided on the basis of the records of contributions paid by way of stamped cards but since January 1981 such entitlement is, in the main, decided on the basis of the computerised records of the pay-related contributions.</P>
      <P>Preparatory planning for the computerised record-keeping system commenced in 1978 and involved the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Data Processing Services of the Department of the Public Service as well as my Department.  Details of the PRSI contributions are registered on computers in the officer of the Revenue Commissioners from employers' annual returns, which cover both income tax and PRSI contributions, and are transferred <i>via</i> computer tapes to the computers in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These then are the basic PRSI contributions records which are relied on for the purposes of the payment of disability benefit since January 1981 and the only further involvement of my Department is in making additions and amendments which are received regularly <i>via</i> computer tapes from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners arising out of the normal course of their continuing operations of collecting outstanding contributions, receiving late returns, correcting defective returns, and so on.  The basic contribution records and any amendments received from the employers <i>via</i> the office of the Revenue Commissioners are supplemented in the Department of <Col N="2597" /> Social Welfare by the addition thereto of records of credited contributions arising from disability, unemployment benefit, and so on, thereby making up the full contribution picture for the contribution or tax year in question.  In addition my Department collect the contributions and end of year returns themselves in a small number of cases, approximately 7,500. These are in respect of some special non-PAYE categories of employees, such as employees of diplomatic missions, persons employed in Ireland by employers who are resident abroad, AnCO trainees, home helps employed by various social service organisations, and certain actors and actresses.</P>
    <P>The data available from the Revenue Commissioners in respect of PRSI contributions for the 1979-80 tax year is deficient in certain respects, mainly due to an excessive number of employees who had to be taxed on an emergency tax system for several months at the beginning of that tax year.  This situation occurred because of restrictions imposed on the issue of tax free allowance certificates and on the allocation of RSI numbers during the postal dispute.  The situation was compounded by the fact that come employers did not complete end-of-year returns correctly, largely due to their lack of familiarity with the amended form which was introduced for the first time in respect of 1979-80.  Apart from difficulties in cases where PRSI records were not available or were incomplete, the principal transitional difficulty in relation to PRSI arose out of the failure of many claimants to quote the RSI number and previous insurance number on all documents, but in particular on all medical certificates, submitted to the Department in connection with their claims for disability benefit, and the consequential difficulty in identifying the relevant records either from the computer or from the old clerical record system.</P>
    <P>In the month prior to the change in the payment system in January there was a sustained press and television advertising campaign urging insured persons to quote both the RSI number and old social insurance number on all claim forms and <Col N="2598" /> medical certificates being sent to the Department.  In addition all existing disability benefit claimants were requested individually in writing to quote both numbers from January 1981.  In a further effort to get claimants to quote both numbers staff of the Department's public offices in Dublin and throughout the country have been requested to inspect all medical certificates and other documents handed in, so as to ensure that they contain both numbers.</P>
    <P>Despite these measures many claimants initially did not, and some still do not, quote both numbers.  Where claimants fail to quote both numbers, there is unavoidable delay in making payment in any case in which it is not possible to trace the relevant insurance record. However, pending the identification of the relevant record, as a special transitional arrangement this year, payment of disability benefit may be based on the contributions in the 1978-79 contribution year, where an insured person is not eligible on the available 1979-80 record.</P>
    <P>My Department are fully committed to the task of bringing payment of benefit up to date in the shortest possible time. Additional experienced staff from within the Department and from other Departments have been assigned to the branch responsible for the payment of disability benefit.  Instructions have been issued to all staff concerned to take whatever action is necessary to speed up the issue of payments and they are working overtime during the week and at weekends to achieve this.  A renewed advertising campaign has been undertaken in the press and on radio and television to make the public generally and claimants in particular more aware of the importance of quoting both their RSI and old insurance numbers on all claim forms, medical certificates and letters sent to the Department.</P>
    <P>The existing computer system in use for the payment of disability benefit if working satisfactorily but is due to be replaced, in the normal course, by a more modern and elaborate computer system during the months of August and September this year.  This computer system will again have immediate access, <i>via vis-</i><Col N="2599" /> ual display unit terminals, to the records of current claims but one of its special advantages will be that these terminals will be capable of being located outside of the building in which the computer is housed, for example, in the public office of the Department at Oisín House and linked back to the computer by telephone lines.  This will result in a major improvement in the information service of the Department as the staff in the public office will have automatic immediate access to the precise latest position of the case, which they can then discuss with the claimant across the counter.  This facility will be available initially in Dublin but I propose to have it extended also to appropriate local offices of the Department throughout the country as soon as the experience of operating in the Dublin area warrants it.  The availability of these telecommunications facilities will also afford advantages in relation to regionalisation.</P>
    <P>The number of persons insured for disability benefit is approximately 820,000. The weekly number of persons in receipt of disability benefit averages about 69,000.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice why the regulations were changed recently to allow members who have no detective experience to become detective sergeants; the average overtime worked by members engaged on duties other than crime investigations in the detective branch in Union Quay; the average overtime worked by members on crime investigation there and by detectives in other city stations over the past five years; how a member of the Garda <Col N="2603" /> comes to be employed on these inquiries; who makes the selection; if he is aware that out of ten members selected for the detective branch only three were appointed at recent interviews and that seven were placed on a list to fill any vacancies that may arise; and, if so, why the names on this list will not be made known.</P>

      <P>The promotion of members of the force up to and including the rank of inspector is, by law, a matter for the Commissioner. I am informed by the Commissioner that, subject to compliance with the provisions of the Garda Síochána promotions regulations in relation to educational and professional qualifications, the administrative requirements governing eligibility for appointment or promotion to detective sergeant have been changed from time to time with a view to the selection for detective duties of the most suitable personnel with crime investigation experience, irrespective of whether their previous service has been in the uniform branch or the detective branch.</P>
      <P>The information sought in the question in relation to the average overtime incurred on particular duties by members of the force assigned to stations in Cork city would have to be specially complied. Compilation of the information would involve the diversion of members of the force from more important work and I am not satisfied that this would be justified having regard to the value of the information.  The allocation of individual members of the force to particular duties is, of course, a matter for the Garda authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the recent interviews referred to in the question, I am informed by the Commissioner that interviews were held in the Cork city division recently with a view to selecting gardaí from the uniform branch for appointment as detective gardaí.  Following these interviews, ten gardaí were placed on a list which was compiled for the purpose of enabling the local Garda officers to make recommendations to the Commissioner <Col N="2604" /> for the filling of vacancies in the detective branch.  Entry on the list does not give a member any entitlement to appointment to the detective branch and it is not normal practice to disclose to those concerned what names are on the list.</P>

      <P>My Department's policy for the protection of the population from the effects of radioactive fallout, which is considered to be the most likely hazard for this country in the event of a nuclear war, is based on the idea of domestic refuge rooms, refuge rooms would be prepared by the householders themselves, at the time, to cater for that hazard.  Advice to the public in this regard is contained in the Department's booklet, &ldquo;Bás/Beatha&rdquo;, which is available to the public free of charge.</P>
      <P>There are no plans for the erection of purpose-built public fallout shelters. However, investigations have been made of large buildings which might afford reasonable protection from the effects of radio-active fallout to persons caught out away from home in a fallout situation and to persons, such as caravan dwellers, whose homes would have little or no protection potential against radioactivity.</P>
      <P>The only accommodation built or modified purposely with a view to protection against radioactive fallout is that in which control centres are located.  These control centres would be staffed mainly by personnel whose function would be the receipt and processing of information on fallout conditions and the issue of warning and advice for the protection of the public.</P>

Greyhound feeding stuff is not distinguishable from other dog food and is liable to VAT at the same rate, that is 25 per cent.  It would not be possible to remove VAT from greyhound feeding stuff while maintaining the 25 per cent rate on other dog food.

This results in the need for careful deployment of the available staff in an effort to provide a service to cope as far as possible with the many and varied demands arising.</P>
    <P>The position is being kept under constant review with a view to improving services still further in the event of additional personnel resources becoming available.

      <P>One of the objectives of the current accelerated telephone development programme is to get into a position by the end of 1984, if possible, where all applications for telephone service can be met promptly.  In the case of the north Dublin city area, as in the country generally, this will involve extensive cabling works in all areas which it will take some years to carry out.</P>
      <P>Major cabling schemes planned for the north Dublin city area involve factors such as trenching, laying ducts, pulling in cables, jointing, and distribution. Because of the number of different types of work involved it is not practicable to programme work in such fashion as would enable the information required to be given on an area by area or street by street basis.  It is expected, however, that about 90 per cent of the existing waiting applicants in the area will have been offered service by the end of next year and the balance of 10 per cent will be given service over the following year or so according as the remaining cabling, exchange etc., schemes required to meet them are completed.</P>

      <P>In January 1980 the housing authorities were requested by my Department to assess accumulated needs at 31 March 1980 and prospective needs in their areas for the period ending 31 March 1985.  For this purpose the authorities were also asked to carry out sample surveys of houses relating to the age, structural condition and standard of facilities in the housing stock.  These surveys were the most comprehensive housing surveys ever undertaken in the state, involving the inspection of some 25,000 houses.</P>
      <P>Most authorities have now submitted completed assessments to the Department and these assessments are being analysed in detail, in consultation with the authorities in appropriate cases, to ensure accuracy and consistency in the methodology employed.  Pending the submission of the remaining assessments and the completion of the analytical work, it would be inappropriate for me to release detailed particulars of the assessments received.  I intend, however, to publish a report in due course setting out a detailed analysis of national housing needs and the Government's programme to meet those needs.</P>

      <P>Disabled persons are being recruited to the public service in accordance with the Government decision that a 3 per cent quota of disabled persons should be employed in the service as soon as possible. In pursuit of that decision special arrangements have been made to facilitate the recruitment of disabled persons to the civil service, including the holding of a number of special competitions by the Civil Service Commission.  This should lead to the taking on of at least 200 disabled persons during 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as local authorities, health boards, and other State bodies are concerned, the employment of disabled persons is a matter for the individual bodies, but all of them have been urged by the <Col N="2625" /> responsible Ministers to take the necessary steps so that the 3 per cent quota target will be achieved as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>It is too early yet to put a figure on the total number of disabled persons likely to be recruited to the whole public service this year, as this will depend on the number of suitable vacancies which can be made available and other factors.  However, I am confident that substantial progress will be made towards the Government's 3 per cent quota target.</P>
